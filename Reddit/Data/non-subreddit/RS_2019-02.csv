The amount of dating questions relating to German dudes and foreign girls on this sub is comical ... but i had to post my story! Thoughts please. 

I‚Äôm studying Spanish here in Spain for a month and on my first day of class I met a nice German guy. We got along well - we have a similar demeanor and energy. He sat next to me in class and also would wait for me if I took longer to pack up. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. One day at lunch I decided to sit with this big group to try and meet new people, he sat next to me, but to my luck they were all Germans ahaha and they were speaking mostly German üòÖ so I quietly left and went to the second floor where there is a bookshelf so I could chill/recharge before the next class started. When I walked out of the nook with the bookshelf I was surprised to see the German dude looking around for me. ((Surprised because I saw him chuckling with the other German students and thought he would stick with them for a while)). We spent the rest of the break alone, talking. 

The next day in class, one of our exercises was to write about our ideal partner. I wrote down I would like a guy who is intelligent, nice, funny, and it would be nice if he is taller than me. 
During lunch break that day he asked me if I would like to rent a car with him this weekend to check out other cities in Spain. I said sure but wasn‚Äôt sure if this is normal for Europeans to be this friendly or if he was interested in me romantically. I just assumed it was friendly. That same day at lunch he asked me if he could follow my Instagram and Spotify and of course I said yes! I love seeing what music other people listen to. I noticed he followed very little people on both ((30 &amp; 11)) so I felt special that he asked me haha. Anyway, that night we went out to dinner with some other students from class and after when we were saying goodbye, he hung behind till we were alone and he was acting a bit goofy ... like he was trying hard to make me laugh. I think it had to do with our class assignment hahah. I just nervously chuckled LOL because I wasn‚Äôt really sure what he was doing... but it was kinda cute nonetheless. 

Sooooo the next day he picks me up with the rental car and we spend the day driving to various cities in Spain, we do a little hike, talk talk talk, and we ended the day at the beach, watched the sunset and then spent a good two hours just watching the waves and looking at stars and stuff. Mind you, this whole time we keep a solid 12 inches ((~30cm)) between us because I had a hard time figuring out if he had feelings or not, so to be safe I just assumed he didn‚Äôt. He never tried to get physically close to me. 

The next week he started an internship so we didn‚Äôt have class together anymore, but he still lived in the same city. He messaged me and asked me if I had any plans, I told him I didn‚Äôt but I was at the river eating noodles &amp; reading. I told him he could join me. We sat and talked for about 3 hours and during this time we started talking about prom in the usa and if it was really like the movies ... anyway he asked me if I thought it was important that two people who date are more similar or different. I said I tend to like people who are more similar to me and he agreed. He asked if I had a boyfriend and i said no ...I thought this was a hint that he liked me. BUT THEN, I asked if he had a girlfriend and he said YES. My mind was blown ‚ò†Ô∏è in that moment I concluded that dating culture must be really different here and that he never had feelings, he was just European. But then when I asked how they met and what she was like, his answers were uncharacteristically short. I didn‚Äôt want to push it so I just moved the convo on and then said I should head home. 

He kept inviting me out to eat and hangout but since finding out he had a girlfriend I‚Äôve starting inviting my other friend I met at school to tag along with us. But still we had dinner alone sometimes. Last Friday we went out together along with my other friend from Switzerland and they were comparing dialects, and he mentioned his town has its own dialect that is different from regular German. I asked him to say something in both to see if I could tell the difference. He did and I asked what he said, and he said ‚ÄúI like you so much I could kiss you‚Äù ???????!!!!!! Whaaat?? Do Germans just drop romantic lines like they are nothing?? Ahaha anyway I just said Ohhh cool and changed the subject because he has a girlfriend. Also that same night my friend was saying that some of her friends dumped their boyfriend before their travels so they could have a fling with other people and the German guy shook his head and said ‚Äúah so the relationships were not strong‚Äù. This made me think that he must have a strong relationship with his girlfriend and i felt silly for developing a small crush on him. 

One day he just stopped messaging me to hangout and I feel very confused ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I initiated the last two hangouts and it was chill but now he doesn‚Äôt initiate hangouts at all. I don‚Äôt know what happened. It suddenly turned from his messaging me everyday to nothing. I guess he suddenly does not even want to be friends anymore and I don‚Äôt really understand why because when we hung out we didn‚Äôt really ever flirt... it was pretty platonic.

alwdbs,4,2019-01-31,"""No Longer Under Consideration"" on both applications I've submitted this month",[deleted],boeing,https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/alwdbs/no_longer_under_consideration_on_both/,"I've submitted two applications this month (both in Long Beach, CA for Level 3 software engineer positions) and for both I received an automated rejection e-mail shortly after the posting close date and my status changed to ""No Longer Under Consideration."" It's absolutely disheartening and I have no idea how to improve since there's no feedback. I even tailored each application with keywords from the qualifications and responsibilities, and I think I have a great resume and great work experience under my belt currently working for a Fortune 100 company.  
A few reasons I can think why I got rejected:  
\- I live in Illinois and maybe they wanted to go with local candidates?  
\- I have 3.5 years experience (4.25 if including internships) instead of the minimum of 5 years stated  
\- I selected ""No Experience"" when they asked if I had any experience in the skill \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Will they automatically filter out applicants who don't have experience in a skill they listed?  
I know 2 applications isn't a lot at all but is there anything else I should know or improve before applying to more? "
alwjjp,23,2019-01-31,My insurance apparently thinks I'm pregnant.,sarahhopefully,TryingForABaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/alwjjp/my_insurance_apparently_thinks_im_pregnant/,"Been feeling extra sensitive about not being pregnant ever since New Year's and now I've had 2 awkward/upsetting incidents at the pharmacy.

Earlier this month I was supposed to do a Clomid cycle but I came down with the flu and decided to  skip it. The RE's office had already called in prescriptions for me but said I could either tell the pharmacy I wasn't going to use them or let them sit and go back into inventory. 

The couple of times I went by (picking up more fluids and meds for the flu) the counter was being staffed by the Awkward Male Pharmacy Intern (TM) so I decided not to stop and deal with him. (AMPI is the guy who I had the most uncomfortable 5 minute conversation with about the estrogen supplements I was supposed to insert vaginally, because he had never heard of such a thing and was also afraid to say the word ""vagina."") I was sick and had no energy to deal with his fumbling.

Cue last week when I need to pick up a regular prescription. AMPI is working the register, of course. I guess the RE's prescriptions were still in their system so I had to spell out that I did not need them so please return them to inventory. He then blurts out, ""It (the computer) wants me to ask if you're pregnant."" Nope. Not pregnant. Thanks dude. 

Then yesterday I go to pick up something else and thankfully it was a different pharmacist. He was staring at the computer for a looooong time in that way that says something is wrong, before he finally says, ""So... your INSURANCE has flagged that you might be pregnant? Which is really weird because that's not really something insurance usually does? Plus this prescription you're picking up is pretty common for pregnant and non-pregnant people to take..."" I then had to explain that I'm NOT PREGNANT but have been doing fertility treatments so maybe some of the meds have given them the false impression I'm knocked up. 

Of course he then goes on to still explain that some medications can be shared between mom and baby so whenever I DO get pregnant I should let them know so they can mark their system yadda yadda... and the whole time I'm just like, ""Yep, uh huh, I know, STILL NOT PREGNANT....""

Uuugh. I know they're just doing their due diligence but still. Rub salt in the wound. And also  I'm now worried that the insurance company thinking I'm pregnant is going to cause issues in the future? I don't know.

I'm so tired y'all. "

alx8g3,2,2019-01-31,Is it bad that I'm frustrated that my girlfriend won't tell me about her past?,DrJohnHix,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/alx8g3/is_it_bad_that_im_frustrated_that_my_girlfriend/,"Hello everybody,

my girlfriend and I have been together for almost two and a half years now. We've had some ups and downs during the last year but I love her very much and she makes me happy. However there is something that has bothered me from the start and I can't get it off my mind. 

I'll try to keep this short. 
When we met I was 18 and she was 23, yes that's quite an age gap, I know. However, we were both at similar points in life as we were both studying at university in the same semester. The thing is, I don't know why though. I know she finished the high school equivalent of my home country when she was 18 and then she started to study with 22. But I have no idea what she did in between. 
Even before the start of our relationship she didn't like to tell me much about herself and her past but gradually we grew very close and she told me more and now I'd say I know almost any intimate detail of her life at the moment. But I still don't know anything about this period of her life. 
At first I thought that I can't pressure anyone to tell me something they don't want to talk about and I still think this way but I really can't look past this at the moment. Weeks go by where I don't think about it but then there are some nights like this where I lay awake wondering why she won't tell me just in one sentence, just briefly maybe, what on earth she was doing during this time. 

At the beginning of our relationship she was very dismissive about this and I was kind of hurt by it but we talked about this, she apologised and said she can understand why I am so confused and insecure about this. She hinted something along the lines of ""maybe I was pretty successful during this time but I don't want you to see me in a different light I want you to see me as I am now"" so maybe she worked during this time?? I don't know. She even promised me she'd eventually tell me about it and that's good but I somehow feel she just said that to make me happy because she never said when and I don't really want to wait 60 years. 

Am I exaggerating? I mean, I'm fairly young and for me four years is a very long time. It's just the fact that she refuses to tell me anything about it without any apparent reason that makes it so weird, you know? Also, I did ask her if this part of her life was somehow traumatic for her and she isn't capable of reliving it by talking about it but she just laughed and said that everything was alright. I don't think she'd lie to me about something like that. Apart from that I guessed pretty crazy stuff like her being in prison or something but she always laughed and said no.
You see, I don't care about past lovers or anything, this is not about that. I just don't understand, no matter what she tells me, why she won't just say in one sentence what she did. 

Some weeks ago she told me in the beginning she refused to do so because she wanted to keep her boundaries and then it somehow artificially became so untouchable that now it's hard for her to open up. But to be honest, I mean I guess I'll sound like an asshole, but I'm so frustrated. Why won't she tell me? She tells me anything about how she feels, what she does, etc. at this moment but nothing about this time period. 

In my opinion, your past does shape you and makes you into the human being you are today. And I feel like I don't know her completely without knowing anything about this time. For example, if I somehow lost a part of my memory and didn't remember four years of my life, I wouldn't understand myself in some situations, why I would do certain things in certain situations. And even if I'll see her in a different light, well I guess then it should have always been this way because this is what she is. Sooner or later she would have told me, right. And then maybe I'd see her with different eyes. But I'd see her completely. It feels kind of unfair that she knows almost everything about my past and my feelings but I know literally nothing about four years. Four years! That's longer than it took for me to get my bachelor's degree. Speaking of which, this is another point. I'm currently in my master's. I will do an exchange semester in some months and then maybe an internship, so my master will take a bit longer but not that long since then I'd run out of money. But she's 26 now and she's still in her bachelor. Normally, people around her age start working on their PhD or just start working normally, at least in my home country. But talking about the future doesn't lead to anything with her. I would like to get my PhD but in this case it's not guaranteed that I'll get a position somewhere close. For me planning a future together means knowing what your partner wants to do later in life and what they can do. And for that I need to know her qualifications. Four years is enough to get some sort of education. So maybe she's already got some qualifications? She's currently working part time, that's why it's taking her so long to get her degree and apparently she's got her own office and has quite a lot of responsibility which is quite rare for student workers here. So I guess she's already worked her way up? I don't know. Because she won't tell me. And right now I'm making decisions that will influence where I will go in the future and what I will do so knowing whether my partner could theoretically start working in some field because she has the qualifications would be crucial to know. She was pretty pissed when I didn't inform her enough about my ongoing application process for an exchange semester (I did tell  her about  it, she  was annoyed because I  did not  discuss  all  the details with  here.) and we plan things together but I don't understand how we can plan together if this huge part of information is missing about her. 

So my question is, what would you do? Should I just be patient and wait and hope she'll tell me about it soon. Should I talk to her again? I don't know what to do. I love her but this is bugging me so much! I don't even understand why myself. I just don't get why it's so important for her NOT to tell me.

Sorry for the long text.

alxnyt,7,2019-01-31,Im ready to throw it against a wall,KayCae,Nexus6P,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/alxnyt/im_ready_to_throw_it_against_a_wall/,"Hello, to all you 6P users.

I sometimes come back to this subreddit to see what others are doing with their 6Ps and I thought I'd put in my two cents: I. Hate. My. Phone.

I didn't run into the battery problem until three years after release (around Q3 of 2018). Now, I have to keep a battery bank connected to the phone for it to stay on. Although, lately it's been shutting down even when doing this. 

Unfortunately, I only just turned 18, and surprisingly do not have a job. I work as an unpaid intern. I suggested replacing the battery to my mother, but she's reluctant to dish out cash on a temporary fix. I couldn't agree more. Except, I also don't want her wasting $100 on the extremely cheap budget phones just for them to be shitty too ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm in a really tough situation guys.

There's nothing like having to drive out somewhere late at night only to find your phone decided to cut off again and you have no way to contact anyone at all.

Just needed to let out my frustrations to some people who may understand.

Hopefully this isn't a problem.

alxshw,3,2019-01-31,The simple task of going to work everyday is something I dread immensely. How will I get through adulthood without feeling daily on the verge of a nervous breakdown?,throwitawayar,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/alxshw/the_simple_task_of_going_to_work_everyday_is/,"This is kind of a depression/anxiety/ptsd post, but I figured here would be a better forum to share.

I‚Äôm 26 and I never had a proper full job, only internships, freelance, part time, temp jobs, things like that. Partly because I‚Äôve always had a hard time committing to a career, partly because some of this jobs paid enough to help me go through times of unemployment with ease.

Well, I‚Äôve got to a point in which I need to work on becoming financially independent. I started a technical course and got a chance to do an internship on the area (tech) with the future possibility of it becoming a full time job.

The combination of money anxiety, ptsd trauma, years of depression, etc, have transformed the simple task of keeping up with an internship an absurdly tiring one. When I‚Äôm there I check the clock almost every 3min (literally) and calculate how much time until I can leave. When I leave I already dread the next day. Friday comes and all I think is the weekend will eventually end. I feel like everyday I‚Äôll just crack, like fall on the middle of the street or something, but it never happens because my anxiety is actually very rationalized, all those things go through my mind while I appear to be just fine.

I feel weak and pathetic, but everyday I consider quitting just so I can go back and stay home in my room. The job kinda sucks but it isn‚Äôt terrible, so I know it‚Äôs more to do with me than with the job itself. I also know that quitting would let down my parents and I understand them completely, it‚Äôs time I make a living and leave their house, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll ever have the strength to keep up with independent adulthood.

I‚Äôm on medication for depression for more than a year. It helped a bit with my anxiety but it no longer does. My psychiatrist is reluctant to give me any tranquilizers. I‚Äôm kinda lost.

Any advice will be welcome. This community helped me a lot on previous times on previous accounts, so thanks in advance."
alxvwa,1,2019-01-31,"Recent graduate, trouble finding a job, looking for career advice and direction, in an Australian context.",boardsfan94,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/alxvwa/recent_graduate_trouble_finding_a_job_looking_for/,"Hi folks, let me apologize in advance for this post, as I'm sure you've probably read something similar hundreds of times. Also, yes I've read the FAQ. 

My situation - I finished my degree in 2018, having studied a B.E (Chemical) and B.Sc (Chemistry) from a reputable Australian university. My graduation ceremony is in May. I have a pretty horrendous GPA (we don't actually have GPAs at my uni, but my average mark is around 65/100). Also, I feel this is somewhat of note, but I took 2 extra years to finish my degree (due to travelling and part-time study). 

The recruitment cycle in Australia for structured grad programs begins in May/June and ends in October/November and whilst I did apply for many 'fresh' grad positions, I didn't get through to any. This means I've missed out on the typical grad positions unless I reapply this year, but I will be competing with people graduating in 2019, and this also means I will have to start in 2020. I cannot wait this long. 

To be frank, so far, since completing my degree I've only applied for maybe 30-40 jobs. Of these 30, I've gotten to the interview stage for maybe, 3 or 4. I recently applied for a job in food processing and was pretty sure I was going to get the job, but in the end, I didn't and was pretty disappointed. 

I've had a few internships, but the majority were in India (as it was easier for me to find work there). On my resume I have them listed. Some of the work I've done was in the pharmaceuticals industry and also bulk chemicals. I've also worked for one of the 'Big 4' in the Assurance/Advisory division, but didn't particularly enjoy the work. 

I'm looking for work in any field really, but I wish to do core engineering work, not so much consulting or 'soft engineering'.

Right now, my main channels of finding jobs are just through the typical 'job sites' like Seek, Indeed, Jora, etc... but at the moment there are barely any advertised positions for recent grads. What am I doing wrong ? 

I am considering going overseas to either India (since I have family there) or the US (less of a chance since there is a question of working rights). But I don't know what to do. I don't mind if I was to move to India and work with any multinational, as long as I get to learn as much as possible. I've heard from friends and family that there are many jobs in India for chemical engineers.  

Should I keep looking here, in Australia? Keep in mind, I only finished my degree very recently. I'm nearly 25, and I haven't even yet begun my career which to me is really worrying. 

Can you lovely people offer any advice/direction/guidance ?

Thank you kindly for reading this wall of text."

In my opinion, finding and getting a job in a Cybersecurity field is relatively more difficult than in another area such as SWE.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a couple of friends who were doing just okay in college (3.0 GPA, none/ one internship experience, etc.), but now they are working at Apple, Google, Amazon as Software Engineers. I, on the other hand, barely got a job in Cybersecurity field. Currently, I'm working at a start-up as a Support Engineer (not 100% dealing with security stuff).

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are:

1) Why it is much easier for someone to get a job as an SWE at big companies?

2) What should I do from now on to be able to reach the level where my friends currently are (i.e., working at big companies as a REAL Security Engineer).

&amp;#x200B;

This post is not about self-pity but more about me trying to improve myself before it is too late. Thank you."

Basically, It's just a huge facility in a mall with lots of computers, 3D printers, etc. I had arrived at about 11:30 AM on this Saturday morning and had been busy moving things such as old monitors and PC parts to the storage room in the back, almost all day. At around 3:30, the owner of the place, who I'll just call by his first name, Larry, left early because he was feeling ill. This left only me and the receptionist here to assist people, which should have been fine, since it was already past lunch and the numbers of people at the mall had went down by a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was and still is as of 1-31-19 on a business trip in Australia, and my mom was coaching my younger brother's soccer team at a game pretty far away. It was clear that I likely wouldn't get picked up until at least 6:00 PM, but I was fine with it, since I had my laptop with me, which could run CS:GO at about 60 fps on max graphics settings. The receptionist had her dog with her, so she took her out for a walk, leaving literally only me in the entire place. However, it's not a huge deal, because there are security cameras everywhere. She and her St. Bernard walked out of the building as I started up a competitive game of CS:GO. 

 

My game is going pretty well, I'm on CT side playing on Cobblestone, and its 3-1 when, EP (Entitled Parent) shows up with EB (Entitled Brat, female, who looks about 9 years old but is really short) enter the building. I'm sitting behind the receptionist's desk, and that was probably a mistake that I made, making myself look responsible. I take off my earbuds and EP is smiling at me, with EB clutching to her side. Begrudgingly, I leave behind my teammates to defend B site while I   start talking to EP. She says, ""Hi!"" very loudly as EB is looking around the room, mostly towards the virtual reality area. (It's very visibly marked, literally labelled, ""Try Out Virtual Reality for Free!"") ""Hi, how can I help you? I ask."" ""Oh, I just wanted to check this place out, obviously this place is new here or I would've seen it."" she responds. I give a puzzled look to her because this place has been here for 3 years now. I begin by saying, ""This place is a non-profit community learning center for all ages, where anyone can learn about technology, such as how to use Photoshop, Blender, how to code in C++, etc."" She clearly doesn't know what I'm talking about, because she responds with, ""Oh, that's cool. Can my daughter use the Virtual Reality thing?"" ""Yes,"" I respond, The HTC Vive is sitting out in front, and I motion for EB to come over. She follows me and I boot up steam. I put on Job Simulator, because most of the kids like it. I teach her how to play it and EP watches as her daughter works as a store clerk. She is having lots of fun, laughing as she plays for about 20 minutes when I remember that my laptop is still running. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I get back to the desk with the laptop, I read the score. My team is still winning, 10-7. Now I'm on T side, and my teammates are typing angrily in chat. ""Don't kick me, I'll be back soon,"" I typed, and dropped an AWP for one of my teammates. I get interrupted by EP again, who says, ""Well I think we'll take that machine that my daughter is playing."" I blink and respond to her, saying, ""What?"" She says again, ""We'll take that computer-reality thing that she's playing on right now."" I look at her with a confused look, saying, ""I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand, this isn't a store."" She is getting a little bit frustrated now, responding, ""No, I don't think you understand, this store says that it's non-profit, so everything is free. Honey, Daliah, unplug that computer-machine, we're taking that one."" HER WORDS, NOT MINE. EB takes off the VR headset and begins unplugging random cables on the computer running it. I'm really upset, especially because it's the 2nd most expensive and powerful computer we have, with an Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti graphics card. ""No, we aren't giving out free hardware, put that down right now!"" EB looks up at me, but keeps unplugging random cables to the computer, which is going to take a good twenty minutes to rearrange all the tangled wires. ""Did you just yell at my daughter that way?"" She yells at me. ""Get out before I call the police!"" I say, phone in hand. ""My daughter deserves that machine! Did you know she is an only child!"" ""At this point I start swearing, because these people are so unbelievably unreasonable. ""Get the fuck out before I call the police!"" I show her my phone and start dialing, calling the receptionist, who was walking her dog, instead of the police. Her daughter is crying, probably because I had said a bad word. The PC falls over onto its side, and I run over to it to make sure its not damaged. While I'm doing this, EP reaches over the desk to try to take my laptop. ""The fuck are you doing?"" I scream at her. ""I'll just take this one,"" She says angrily. ""I'm on the phone with the cops right now!"" Receptionist finally picks up on the 5th ring or so and I explain the situation to her, pretending she is the police. EP looks at me with a scared expression, backing up and taking her crying EB with her as they leave the store. I show her the bird and with a defeated look on her face, she leaves the building. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I return to my laptop, telling the receptionist to get over here as fast as possible. I resume playing CS:GO, and the score is 15-14. I put on an Iron Maiden song and put my earbuds back in. My entire team is dead, leaving just me in a 3v1 situation. I picked up a Negev which my teammate had dropped earlier in the round, (I'm guessing) and run towards B site, knife out. I hear footsteps as I approach A Site, and I prefire around the corner, killing two CTs almost instantly. i get shot in the leg my an enemy AWP, but I use my superior rate of fire against him. A laser beam of 5.62mm bullets hit him and he retreats behind the fountain. 150 bullets later, he's on the floor, and I hear the noise, ""Terrorists Win."" I sit back from my laptop and sigh in relief, suddenly very tired. I explain everything to the receptionist, and she goes over the security camera footage. I decided to walk home that day, going to bed when I got home, forgetting to call my mom to tell her I wasn't at the tech center anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To be brutally honest, there are some moments in my life that I want to Thanos snap the population of the world, and this was one of those moments.

alzkir,320,2019-02-01,Why i transitioned from LSD to shrooms. And why I'll never go back to acid.,-_Akira-_,shrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/alzkir/why_i_transitioned_from_lsd_to_shrooms_and_why/," Alot of you should know that some of your ""Post"" experiences on 1 or 2 tabs are footnotes to an endless doorway of what you do not yet know. And some of you have had to find out the hardway. 

 When i 1st experienced psychedelics it was 4 tabs of some powerful Micros. I was 16 years old. At this time my mother recently died of leukemia, my brother and sister took her death differently. I just couldn't cope. Weed wasn't enough. 

So i went looking for answers and my mind was all over the place.  

I was placed in group homes, seperated from my family. I would smoke weed and write songs, i found interest in the point of existing, god, self, denial. I felt like i was following a ritual that was placed in this reality that all of us were programmed to follow. There was no closure for me in anything i did. I was just passing time and eventually time seemed endless and pointless. 

I thought of killing myself and ofcourse i held these thoughts to myself. I wasn't looking for attention, i told myself if i kill myself there's no point to verbalize it if i would do it so i just kept it absent to everyone. 

I was given a therapist, 3 to be exact. All of them were bullshit. It was common to see through it because 2 of the 3 were interns and they were fresh out of university. These connections were false. None of our sessions meant anything to either parties so i just fed back bullshit to the bullshit i was being fed. I analyzed everything and eventually i realized that the system i was placed in was just another sub system that traps/ and will trap more of us into these parallels and most of us will be put in fresh, drained dry and sent out at 18 and forgotten then recycled the next group of kids. This was the foster care system and this is life.

Alot happened here, alot of times i had to create a fake personality to interact with other's. 

Our schedule was Wake up, go to school, go straight back, do chores, go to group, do homework and then go to bed. 
The weekends were volunteer organizations that sent groups of people to host activities like 
Bowling,pizza parties, arts and crafts. Bullshit. 
I didn't want to attend but if you didnt you would be dropped to level 0 which meant you couldn't do shit. So i dropped to level 0 and stayed in my room. 

I dated a few girls, never told them i was in Foster care, never told them about my dead mom. Just pretended to be someone. But that shit wasn't enough. I felt this deepness within that i couldn't explain, all i wanted was to understand why i exist what is purpose. Why are we connected just to be erased.  Being around my friend's, i couldn't pretend anymore. I didn't want to get drunk and be high all the time. Go to shows and party and waste time. 

I found an old friend from middle school, he introduced me to LSD. I was so excited because i was in love with The Doors, Pink Floyd, Led zeppelin, The Beatles, The rolling stones etc. 

I wanted to try it to this music instead of getting high to the same songs.
I skipped school, went to his house and he gave me 4 tabs of micros. These tabs were blank with black lines between each tab. Small as hell so i assumed that taking 1 or 2 was a waste of time. So i put the strip under my tounge then on top and for 30 minutes and swallowed the paper.

He was surprised when he saw me take all 4 because he was telling me about his own experiences. It was essentially words in and out of my ears i didn't care. 

This experience broke me in more ways than i can explain.  And it was the beginning of my psychedelic traumas and journeys. 

Gravity was not the same. I felt heavier, i felt unhuman and i felt as if i was inside of a simulation. But i could feel everything.
I was dropped off to the beach and i called a girl i didn't like i just needed someone to be there for me. The skies turned purple and pink, the clouds spiraled and i digged my hands deep into the sand as i layed my head on her lap crying and losing my mind. Time was irrelevant, 6 hours had passed and the skies were darkening and i sat there for hours and it felt like lifetimes had passed. In these moments i was connected to unknowns, fears filled my mind and saddness. I was afraid and i was being destroyed by the idea of being death. 
During this i never thought of anything in particular to questions i had wanted to answer. It was just full of emotional episodes being pushed in and out all at once. I didn't have words but i felt it all. 
Time skip - 

Few weeks later i hit up my friend again and he ran out of LSD. But he had Shrooms. 
I took an eighth

Long story short i felt as if i was laughing uncontrollably and i was just happier and tripping my ass off. Great fun experience. The visuals were very nice. 

Few weeks later i asked for more shrooms. And my friend relocated to another state because he was starting college. 


I was fucked. Now i entered into a doorway that i felt was being taken from me and the key was being thrown into a river. I had to find the key to reopen my mind. But i couldn't get any more psychedelics. 

So....?

I grew my own 

This is where everything changed. 


I grew about 500gs of shrooms dried. Albino As and B+

I took many 3gs-4gs very often. Atleast once a week. However all of these experiences were expectations of what i read online, my 1st and 2nd experiences and Rock star's interviews about psychedelics like Jim morrison and john lennon.

I had created this identity for the psychedelic experience and this is why i suffered.

I read and read and filled my mind with all of these truths from other people's trip reports i had looked for similaries from my trips etc. But eventually i had found a Tier system for doses.

Level 1 through level 5

The break through.

The doors of perception

Break on through to the other side.

I desperately had to know and i had to see it for my self.


So i grinded up 7gs of Albino As soaked in lemon for 20 minutes and smoked 2 blunts on the come up. And then boom. I was there. 

I've been ""there"". You just realized that you never truly knew your self. Your entire life is just an imitation of other's imitating each other to fit in with the era. The music,films,styles,people you find interest in are just added to your character like a patch, that builds and defines your identity over time. You then believe as though this person you've become is who you created when really you were modified to be this individual by those surrounding you and i. This is why the world is destroying itself. We hold onto attachments of physical over spiritual. 

We're like portaits. Everything in this reality trys to paint a peice of them onto our portait and we become a reflection of what society wants us to be. This social status defines your class. Rich poor, good, bad, beautiful, ugly. This is the illusion. 

That one experience put me in a state of fear,saddness, eternity felt infinite as if i would never leave that forever. I was afraid. I thought i was insane. But then the peek transitioned into a euphoria where i felt peace and time was non existent. I laid on the sand and i felt free from time. 

 My soul left my body like 8 times in an endless line. I was tranformed into many creatures like rock golems and stars etc. I was surrounded by pyramids and symbols, green infinity and then was being ripped in and out of reality and into others. I was tossing and turning i was in the dark. The frequencies were killing my head as if i could hear all the buzzing and vibrations from the cell phone towers near my neighborhood and the power lines. I could hear cicadas all night as if the noise was trapped in my ear hole for eternity. I saw entities that were like aliens that were controlling our planet. 

I was broken. I cried and i was tortured spiritually and mentally because of what? 

My ego. The ego that drove my curiosity. Made me believe i was in control and that shrooms was a drug that I took and that I could choose what i wanted to experience. After growing and realizing that I AM just a vessel and that i am the student, the shrooms were the teacher, my mentor, my guide. It spoke too me and took the wheel for me and guided me. I remember reading that terrence mkenna would speak to the shrooms and ask poliety to calm the body sensations and too apologize and accept them instead of trying to combat the experience with fear and hesitation. Once i released myself from these ideals i was free to realm under their teachings. 

If i ever have a sensation of ""Fear"" i say this mentally and aloud "" Thank you for this experience. I apologize for trying to take control please forgive me and guide me"" and the shrooms actually listen and do what you have asked. Instantly. It really works.  And in this experience it humbled me. I was at the mercy of my teachers and i accepted my fate instead of trying to pave my own. 

I was suicidal and wanted to kill myself because time seemed gone. I thought i was stuck in a reality forever and the only escape was to end it then and there but the shrooms guided me. They spoke. 

I was an infant. We all are, none of us are in control of our lives or this life. We're just riding the waves of it. Time is our god and we're living by time instead of just living. Once you allow yourself to let go of all things you will be free and you will forever be whole again. Only take shrooms out of necessity not out of selfishness. Whenever you choose to do shrooms forcefully it will fucking destroy you. 

Shrooms will contact your subconscious and alert you when its your next time to do it. You can go months to years without it but then all of a sudden the shroom will call you back because its trying to teach you something new or rekindle a lesson you've forgotten. Its sacred to take shrooms then go months to a year break so that you can grow from them. Then when you start to fall back into an old mindset shrooms will call to you to reawaken your true self.

 That will help you. But like i said let them guide. Do not go in with a single expectations. Especially fear. When you expect to be in control you are already going to lose. They take over because your entire life you've been in control and its lead you to this moment. Now its time for them to guide you into what you need to understand. Clear ur mind. Just absorb the energies and accept your fate. This is how you're healed. Never try to fight the shroom. If you start fearing and getting anxious and start begging for mercy within your self You will make it worse. All you have to do is ask for acceptance and talk to the shroom. Ask to be guided and that you know you're not in control and that you appreciate them. And this is how i grew. 

Its been years since I've done LSD. Ive done it 4 times. But I've done shrooms more than 100 times since i was 16. I am now 21. 

I do not find interest in LSD anymore,or any forms or synthetic psychedelics. On my journey i have taken shrooms for personal curiosity and insight.
Now i do them to keep growing. 

Thanks for reading. 


Edit: 

I stopped using lsd because i gained no mindset from them. All it did for me was take me for 12 hours and let me feel better for a period of time. 

My 1st experience with 4 tabs wasn't bad, it was openeing up alot of emotions i had stored within my self. Those emotions had erupted all at once. And that is why i was taken control of.

I have taken shrooms and i have found alot of great changes in myself. I have found love of so many conclusions i would never have on anything else. It is my preferred psychedelic. 

I never said lsd shouldn't be considered based on my own preferences. Just because i have come to this conclusion doesn't mean it's right for You. It's right for me. And i shared my story because it was the past. 

It's very easy to hate what you do not understand. It's easy to hate things and very easy to hate on other's. Our experiences are individual. Its why i am me and you belong to you. The mind on psychedelics is rare. What we can learn is beautiful. But if you have this anger within your heart from words you read online than i feel you have more to overcome. I do not want to be treated like my word's are posion. It is how i have accepted my own journey. Not everyone agrees on the same philosophies but we have the right to have our own for a reason. Try to accept other's for who we are. We're flawed beings. As i said, its easy to judge and to hate but it's also very equally as simple to show kindness. Thank you. "
alztdh,34,2019-02-01,JAPAN vs QATAR AFC Asian Cup Final,twoplus9,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/alztdh/japan_vs_qatar_afc_asian_cup_final/,"**Today is the final of AFC Asian Cup, and Japan and Qatar are the Finalists out of 24 teams.**

Nobody Expected Qatar to be in final except obviously Xavi who Predicted Japan vs Qatar Final.

Xavi Knew it all or maybe was also little biased towards Qatar's Manager who was also Barcelona youth coach while Xavi progressed and we all know Xavi loves Barca DNA. Xavi has predicted Qatar will win the final.

**What changed for Qatar?**

It‚Äôs not something that happened overnight or the team always had potential and only realized it this time. This team has been built from the ground up for over a decade. All started with the opening of Aspire Academy in 2004 which scouts players from a different region and develop them. Aspire not only focuses on producing proper athletes but also provides them the theoretical knowledge about various football philosophies and what they demand from the position they want to excel. Aspire then sends them to various European leagues for internship giving them an opportunity to make it on a bigger league.

**F√©lix S√°nchez Bas**

This man has been pivotal for all this success; the Qatari team is enjoying. He was appointed as Aspire Academy Manager and moved slowly up to U19, U20, U23 and finally Qatar National team.

He has already found success with U19 winning AFC U19 Youth Championship: 2014

**Current team**

Qatar is the most flexible team in case of formations. Players know the formation and what it demands from them. They have experimented with various formations in the friendlies just before the Asian Cup. They tried 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 4-3-2-1, 3-4-3. They have also used various formations in the tournament as per the opposition. I think their preferred formation is 4-2-3-1, but they are fluid and respond to the in-game tactical changes of opposition, they are best at this. They used 3-5-2 (5-3-2) formation against South Korea to negate the threat from their wings. Formation aside their midfield and defense is so tight that they haven't let a single goal till now.

They have scored 16 goals in 6 games.

**Sanchez use of Youth**

It seems Qatar wanted a coach who was ready to work from the ground level and work it till the top and use his knowledge to build a system that would sustain itself. Sanchez has been using two players who have been with him since U19 and won the AFC U19 Youth Championship: 2014

1. Almoez Ali
2. Akram Afif

Ali is the top scorer of the tournament with 8 goals, and Afif is the man with most assists 8. They have an excellent understanding. Sanchez has also brought other youth players who impressed him

* Abdelrahman Moustafa
* Mohammed Al Bakari
* Assim Madibo
* Bassam Alrawi

Qatar has a great chance to win this tournament and reap the rewards of their hard work over a decade.

**JAPAN**

Japan has never lost any finals in the AFC Asian Cup, (4 finals 4 won) so the obvious favorite is Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

""There are many men of principle in both parties in America, but there is no party of principle.""

‚Äï **Alexis de Tocqueville, some White French geezer who visited the United States in the 1800's**

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Alexis de Tocqueville? Does it matter? Whichever way you answer, it would be inconsequential unless you truly care about how the United States is perceived. Why do you care about the way in which the United States is perceived? 

&amp;#x200B;

Because it might be insightful to see how foreigners perceive us. Much like a newly made friend gives you refreshing insight on your life that you didn't see otherwise due to persistent tunnel vision.  

&amp;#x200B;

Or you could be bothered to care because in broad strokes, the country is a convenient indicator to judge and observe the behavior and culture of people, communities and therefore you. A way to understand us. Who we are and why are we exceptional, unique or wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

As we are all ant peasants part of the ant kingdom unless of course you have two internships, owned the job fair and your future is so bright that your future earnings will subsidize our low income tax breaks. This was covered in 1.3. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Kiss the ring,'' grunted the Zicklin Finance Intern in the $1,099 suit said to the kneeling Weissman student.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sigh... okay..I'll do this... just one more time. My knees hurt, "" said the part time Barista.

&amp;#x200B;

As an self proclaimed expert on inclusiveness, respect and Zicklin-Weissman relations and holding a degree in inter-departmental faculty conflict and relations, I have observed that the U.S and New York, relative to other places in the world has been a beacon of hope, and progressive ideals and I argue a great place to see a closing in the gap of inequality. This becomes more apparent when we meet people from other places in the world. This is where your incoming foreign exchange students come in. Believe it or not, these mostly rich European kids have more use than to just fill up a Baruch classroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their voices are actually useful to help us understand our greatness, (Few and far between) our flaws, (Too many to count) a moral compass and constructive criticism (You guys don't know how to dress... You all are obese because of fast food)  Their voices are a great contribution to the exchange of ideas.... 

&amp;#x200B;

\~ with the exception of the French because I don't know what the fuck they're trying to say even when sober.

   

Foreign exchange as a program and the students that come to the States and American students that go abroad is not only worthwhile but a great way to go into more debt and circumvent strict drinking laws under the auspices of studying. Many of these exchange students who were 21 and above that I personally knew may have had fond memories of their time in New York but have trouble remembering what exactly they had done due to drinking American beer which is inferior to European beer. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're a sophisticated craft beer snob and want a unsophisticated explanation to the disparity in quality between European and American beer and social drinking culture, Europeans like their beer are mild mannered, have an elegant taste and rarely don't drink without pacing themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, Americans chug beer like psychos with the sole objective of waking up the next day naked and afraid. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ones who chug Long Island Ice Teas, you know who you are! You all disgust me. But it does look like you're having the most fun in the bar. Shout out to you. Still Fucking disgusting.    

&amp;#x200B;

What leads this polarized behavior even though our culture is descended from that of the European? We are similar in many ways but culturally and especially socially, I argue we are quite insular and occasionally mean spirited whether intentional or conditioned. I guess unlike any other people on earth, we prioritize money over all else. We wouldn't riot over a small increase in annual costs and taxes on our gas or wine like the French,  yet we all go ape shit when the MTA incremental increases or when Subway discontinues their $5 sandwich of the day. Yeah fuck you Subway!   

&amp;#x200B;

I mean which other country, community have you been in where strict laws policing behavior is the sole deterrent to bad behavior and thus acting in bad faith. Only in America where paying it forward and doing good isn't a priority and Baruch is the perfect microcosm/reflection of this man for a man mentality. I believe that the majority of people only act with good intent because of the fear of consequence unless of course there is an incentive or pre-established relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Traveling to a country where the intangibles are actually valued is great. And more power to you if you already know this. Eating 2 hours lunches. Family. Friendship. Relaxing. Socializing as opposed to tapping on smart phones. Basically activities that are conducive to poverty yet feeling okay about life as opposed to aspiring to be a corporate slave in combination of using people lower than you on the socio-economic scale as excuses to feel better and utilizing tools such as social media to re-enforce this notion. American materialism and superficiality was a common theme as criticism from my European drinking counterparts. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah... I agree with zeet,"" said the French guy wearing $700 Balenciaga t-shirt. 

""Yeah, Yeah whatever just get the tab, I'll get you back later.... said nobody ever..."" -Me while crossing my fingers

&amp;#x200B;

Traveling, meeting foreigners, befriending them, getting drunk with them is great to see who we're truly about, what and who we really are...  ultimately understanding our social and cultural identities, and of course laughing at their accents and sharing ideas was and has generated the better part of my last and only year at Baruch or ""Ba-rouuch"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah no....  Yeah the H is silent and Lexington isn't 4th avenue. Just because our street numbers are numerical and in Spain the streets are all named after saints and white people doesn't mean you can invent numbers as you go. Nice try. 

And I don't know where the fuck you're at when you tell me on the phone to meet you by the fast food place. Okay? 

.......... Dumbass. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you don't overstay your student visa because I don't want to deal with you anymore. Just kidding I love you. 

This was a excerpt of a typical interaction I had with my foreigner exchange friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to Toqueville and thus the message for today, his observations on the U.S were considered to be ground breaking and still stands the testament of time. I interpret his quote to be very relevant today, because there is indeed good in all of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well.. there is good in most of us except for the board of directors at Subway and Ted Bundy.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as Americans due to our selfishness and need to survive, one up each other, flaunt how cool we are, when we herd as groups, we are susceptible to being shitty people. I argue that this has trickled down and is evident at Baruch because much of New York is like this as money and greed driven. And I am too. But I would argue that I am partially because I am forced to make my own sandwiches now.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you Jarod Fogle. I know you're in jail but this is still on you!

&amp;#x200B;

Afterword- 

Shout out to my friends from Spain and France! Thanks for the laughs. Cheers to you! Thanks to the Foreign Exchange Program at Baruch. I hope everyone stays warm and hold hands with a cold brew.

am0kxd,1,2019-02-01,M4A (A playing F) The multiple prompt list. Hopefully something for everyone! (Fairly long) (open/multiple prompts) (light or dark) (chat or rp) (sub or dom),Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/am0kxd/m4a_a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** **(Major bonus points for this one)** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

**Others:** Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff, raceplay. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary and BONUS points if you let me choose your character)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes.."
am1zmq,5,2019-02-01,"To Rene, My Last Words",poor_icarus,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/am1zmq/to_rene_my_last_words/,"Ever since I returned from Europe, my heart has been torn on deciding whether to keep in touch with you or say goodbye forever. 

Do you remember, in that train in Amsterdam... I know you, you don't like to make promises, but you promised you will see me again. Maybe you felt pity for me. Maybe you genuinely would like to see me. To me, the distinction is as good as nothing, as there are things we have lost to the wind now. 

Today, my parents surprised me with a new internet plan for my phone, and with it, a new number. To cut cost, they say. Coincidentally, I had also wiped my chat history the previous night, so I had no way to tell you of my new number, and now that I think of it, I am not sure if I plan to give it to you anyway in the future, even if there was a way to contact you. 

It's Yuanfen. Our fate is without destiny, and our time has run out. 

Before, no matter how hard my heart said to let you go, I fought all those feelings anyway and constantly wrote to you, and when that night I was stranded at the airport, I did everything in my power and went against the government and my family to see you for a second time. But now life has made the decision for me, and I respect that. 

It took every atom in the universe to align and hand me a new SIM card at the right time to allow me to let you go. 

I'd want to say I'm sorry, but I know you wouldn't miss me too much, and you will be alright. And if there's a way to say it to you, I want you to know that I will be alright too. I know I'm the type to cry a lot, but I have faith in myself that I would see me reach the finishing line. Even if I don't, I know I would at least perish while kissing the sun, like Icarus soaring high in the blue sky, beautiful as a bird of paradise, and full of passion and freedom. 

After all those good times  I had with you... I remember, talking to you while walking in the busy busy Bangkok, whenever you laid those powder blue eyes on me, the world fell silent, and it was just you and me.

I remember, in that Spanish restaurant, you helped me peel the shells of the prawns because I didn't want to get my hands greasy.

I remember, in Belgium, I asked for pennies to buy a candle in the dark and empty church, and I lighted it and I closed my eyes, said a little prayer -- you. You don't know, but you were always my prayer, in all the churches, from Bangkok to Maastricht, and all the way to Amsterdam. 

I remember, in Scheveningen, we walked along the shorelines, as real couples do, and when it was cold I put my hand in yours and they fit perfectly like zippers, and then we looked for a nice restaurant. I always hated fish, but when I had it with you it was special. 

I remember, in Rotterdam, after that boat tour, we stopped by at the house you used to live in, it was by the rippling lake next to the bridge, and the windows weren't lighted. I was struck by how much life you had experienced before me, and how much of it will continue on without me. I am a fraction of a dot on your personal timeline. 

I remember, in your apartment, you put on music and we sat next to each other quietly for a long time until I fell asleep and when I woke up I was in your arms, for me, there was no happier feeling. 

Do you remember me? Do you remember me when having apple juice? Do you remember me when sitting on the window seat when taking the train? Do you remember me in my blue coat and red scarf? Do you remember me when somebody mentions Malaysia passingly in a conversation? 

Maybe. Maybe not. I never know how much I mean to you. You were always hard to read. You never let yourself be vulnerable, not even around me when it was just us. You never seem to have problems, and you never seem to need anyone or anything. Which is why I always felt frustrated. I could never figure out how I can make your days a little brighter. 

I was surprised at myself at how much I could love you, because admittedly when I first got to know you, I thought you are far too old for me. But our first dinner together, you asked me some good questions about my future, and it was then I realized you are human, just like any other person I have met. 

I have loved someone before you, he was from Baghdad, he never photographs well, but he was stunning in person. He was kind too, but he was haunted by too many demons in his head. I can't help but feel that the lesson I learned from being with him is connected to the lesson I learn from being with you also. The lesson of gratitude, patience, letting go, and forgiveness. 

He is not you, but he was borrowed to me and taken back too soon, just the same. He wasn't perfect, but neither am I nor you. We're all just trying to make it as far as we can in this world, and we don't have enough time or resource to be loving the wrong person who, in the end, will only drag us down. I realize that. 

Before I always fantasized about what it would be like to be together. A real couple, you know? I thought I would make you breakfast and we could go out for walks together and on your birthday I would throw you a surprise party and who knows, maybe you could even meet my friends and family who've been dear to me, and when you get really old I'll take care of you, but that is all too... unrealistic. 

You wouldn't want that, and now I'm not sure if I would want that. We're not very compatible on every level, are we? 

I still remember what Geome, or whoever his name actually was, told me when we were in that cafe after seeing the choir on Christmas day. He told me that out of millions of people, at that time and place, I, from across the world, was sitting next to you. How crazy was that? 

I am appreciative of the fact that against all odds, we met, we kissed, and before we lost each other, I got to say everything I always wanted to say, how I loved you, how much I wanted you, and how sad I was we didn't get to be together. Because too many people on this earth walk around with unspoken words as thick as novels in their hearts. 

I love you, wherever I am, in Europe, in Asia, on a plane in the middle of nowhere. I love you and your beautiful eyes and charming smile and your warm touch. But I really think I am ready to move on with my life. 

Lately, we may have had small arguments and I may have held some resentment and bitter feelings towards you, but now that I lost you I can honestly say that I forgive you and I forgive myself and that it's okay, everything is going to be okay and I really thank you for being there. Thinking of seeing you again in Europe got me through one hell of an internship and when I was finally there I experienced twelve days of bliss. 

Remember, in Maastricht, I cried to sleep in your arms because I was so happy we were finally together again? Well, right now I'm crying the same way. I know I usually cry because you left me or whatever, but tonight I cry because I'm happy I got to know you, I'm happy you were kind to me, and I'm grateful for everything we had, and I'm glad it's over now. 

I know it may be a little confusing for you to see my number suddenly missing from the chat system but I trust in you to not take it personally and trust me when I said to you that one time that I'll always be grateful for knowing you, even no matter how many years will pass. 

This is goodbye, you probably won't but try not to find me. I truly believe this is for the best. I've tried my best at being honest with you, I shared with you what little I have in my life, I tried watching all the movies you mentioned and read the books you recommend, but now I see, that we are just not meant to be. I can't wait for you because I'm only young once and I feel you wouldn't wait for me either. I can't continue being friends with you because I like you too much to reserve my feelings. So this is the best. 

I mean, at least we had something other than nothing, and that's okay. That's enough. 

And this world is pretty crazy, who knows, maybe we will meet again, by coincidence. If we do, if you notice me, if you recognize me, you could always say hello and I would smile for you just the same, old friend. 

Until that time comes, I'll keep on going forward with my life."
am2hsz,1,2019-02-01,21 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/am2hsz/21_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

‚≠ê‚≠ê Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

5. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

6. When you message me, please write more than ""hi"" or ""saw your post"". Tell me which post you are coming from and any ideas you have. You do not need to write me a book, just give me more than two words. Poor introductions will be ignored.

7. I am looking for my character to be tfed, NOT tfing other characters. If that is a deal breaker, you have been warned.

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+. 

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or:

Kik: N1njastar28

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon!"
am37wm,1,2019-02-01,AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop complaining about money?,ihatemyselfloll,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/am37wm/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_stop_complaining/,"So, my boyfriend (23) and I (20) are both students and have been together for three years. He is in his final year as a informatic engineer and I just started university in toxicology. He currently is doing his last traineeship (or intership? I do not not what it would be called in English) 2 hours from where I live so we only see each other on weekends and during the week we talk on the phone. 
Tbh I‚Äôm always down to ear him complain about almost anything because I like talking to him and all but there is this one thing I can‚Äôt ear anymore: his salary. 
So when he will be done from school he will make around 70k+ a year which is a lot in my opinion. BUT currently he is making way less, which is normal since he is an intern and only work 4 month a year and the other months he is in school. Way less is still 2x more what I made at my student job when I used to do around the same amount of hours.

A bit a background here: last year I worked almost full time (between 30-35hrs a week has my job would give me) to collect my money so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it at school and I still work today with school (less than 15hrs a week). During that year, I agree, I complained A LOT. Like A LOT. At mid point in the year he told me how annoying that was. I got pretty angry and frustrated at first but then I realized, and I worked on it and tried not to complain as much after that. 

Now, back with the story: this morning he called me like usual and we talked a bit before he started complaining about having no money. His pay is next week and we just bought a vacation in the south with two friends and he can‚Äôt pay his credit right now because the vacation was more than what currently has in bank BUT his next pay will cover way more than that. So we agreed that I would give him money so he could pay for the credit and he would pay me back next week (okay for me). But he kept saying that he is way underpay and that he should be given more (from the company not me haha). 
I was already kinda annoyed from all the previous time so I didn‚Äôt say anything. So he told me &lt;&lt;are you tired about me talking about money&gt;&gt; so I told him yes and then it started.
I told him that I felt he was a bit entitled and that he should stand back a bit. That the condition of his internship were good and that he shouldn‚Äôt be that demanding. Then he lashed back and told me about all the time I complained about my job. Then I told him that he‚Äôs still very lucky and that not making 95k a year is still really really good for a student‚Ä¶
Then he told me that he had to go and the conversation ended there.
And now I‚Äôm conflicted because I hate (like hate with a fury) people that have the mentality of you can‚Äôt complain because some people have it worse. And I kinda feel like that right now.
But I also feel like I was right for that specific thing.  

(TLDR: I told my boyfriend that he shouldn‚Äôt complain about the money he make as an intern because it is still making way more than minimum wage and now I feel like an asshole)"

Woke up that morning with a text from one current FWB who simply wrote ""I really need your dick"". She goes to school closeby and interns at the school itself so she was heading towards my side of town already. Now who am I to not fulfill that kind of request, so I told her to come by. I met her in the lobby of my building and we made out all the way upstairs in the elevator. She was rubbing me over my sweatpants and it did not take long for me to get hard. By the time we made it in the door, my sweatpants were half off and I pulled her tits out of her top and was flicking her piercings. There's a couch right at the entrance so I bent her over the armrest and fucked her from behind. I told her I was close and her eyes rolled in the back of her head (her words) and I pulled out right before I came and shot over her back and ass.  1 ‚úÖ

She watched TV for a bit and I got ready for the day and told her I needed to take a shower. She stripped down and got in with me and we enjoyed soaping each other up and paying attention to only the naughty areas. I got hard again quickly and she dropped to her knees and kept deepthroating my cock, gagging every time it hit the back of her throat. She knows that's my weakness and it wasn't long before I came on her tits.  2 ‚úÖ

I drove to my buddie's place to watch the early game and since I don't drink much, just hung out with him and some mutual friends when I get a text from a teacher FWB of mine. She has a tradition where she buys me some kind of Patriots thing before their playoff run and she had found some cups, plates, and napkins and wanted to give them to me. The Saints were up 13-0 and the game was looking like a blowout so I pulled an Irish goodbye. 20 minutes later, I knocked on her door and she answered in an open robe. That's all it took and I was hard and ready. She walked over to her bed where she had set the lube and her dildo and told me she needed my dick in her. I chugged some water and came back to her fingering herself. She's one of those born again Christians who think anal is fine since she can't get pregnant that way. I absolutely love that loophole so I dripped lube on her ass and my cock and slowly pushed into her ass. (LPT here, too much lube is just enough.) It's always an exercise in patience not wanting to cum immediately because she's so tight but it was a little easier since it was #3. It took some time but she started to get sore so she reached through her legs and started rubbing my balls, which is a trigger for me. I came hard and deep in her ass.  3 ‚úÖ

I headed to Theory, which is a hardcore Patriots bar (they give shots after every Patriots Touchdown and the owner has season tickets on the 50 yard line). It's fairly full already with Pats fans so I found some standing room and talked with an older couple nearby. I see this girl in a Gronkowski jersey 7th wheeling this group so I go over and introduce myself to the group. Her name's Nicole and she moved to Chicago recently from Northern California. As the Patriots game starts, I stick with her and am shooting the shit. Apparently, she is loving this since she had resigned herself to being the awkward extra with her group. Around halftime, the bar is absolutely packed and I tell her I live closeby and will probably watch the rest of the game from there. She thinks that's a fantastic idea and says bye to her friends and we walk back to my place (few blocks). We head upstairs and she's a little tentative but gets comfortable watching the game in front of the gas fireplace (which is one of the best investments I ever made). The game stays close the whole way and heads to OT with both of us cheering and jeering the whole way. The game ends with a Pats win and I turn to her and in my corniest line ever say ""Well that ending totally deserves a kiss"".

She agrees wholeheartedly and we start making out and clothes start coming off quickly. I kiss her neck and down her body and get between her legs. I alternate flicking my tongue across her clit and curling two fingers inside her pussy as I kiss her. She starts grabbing and twisting her nipples and the moans get louder till she covers her mouth and screams. Her legs start shaking and her whole body has these cute quivers during which I can't help but hold her and kiss her. I take her to the bedroom and we continue making out and she looks at me and tell me I need to grab a condom. I grab one from my nightstand and she slips it on my cock and pushes me down on the bed and gets on top. She rides me and bounces up and down (Ladies who do this, thank you). Eventually, I feel her slow down a little so I flip her over in missionary without taking my dick out of her and continue fucking her. She starts moaning my name and I switch up my strokes, some long and deep and some fast and shallow. She reaches down and rubs her clit and says she's going to cum again, I slow down a little and posture up so I can watch her do it and she cums hard. I feel myself getting close as well so I tell her and she tells me she wants it in her mouth. She drops to her knees and peels off the condom and starts sucking hard. I can't take it and cum in her mouth. It wasn't much, but I was wiped. I tell her she's welcome to the stay the night and we both pass out.  4 ‚úÖ"

am56lf,2,2019-02-01,My [20F] boyfriend [22M] of almost three years gets overwhelming when I'm feeling down. Am I overreacting or is he being insensitive?,sooverwhelmedtbh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/am56lf/my_20f_boyfriend_22m_of_almost_three_years_gets/,"Using a throwaway since he knows my real account. I'm sorry for how long this post might be, if you make it through to the end, I really appreciate you!

Basically, my boyfriend, who we will call John, is incredibly attached to me. At times it's endearing and at others it's exhausting, especially since I am the opposite. I need my alone time and can't deal with being bombarded, even if it's with love. He texts me and snapchats me throughout the day, every day. Sometimes I have to tell him to give me space even when I'm not feelings down, just because I can't get work done due to his messages. He thinks calling me three times a day is the bare minimum, and I think once a day is sufficient, especially when we text all day. It is what it is, we just have differing personalities.

My main issue that has been ongoing since the start of our relationship is how he reacts to me feeling down. We all have days where we feel off, and John is no stranger to those. I am not either, but it doesn't help that the company he works at, Big Bank, passed on me for an internship yesterday that I think I was well-qualified for. I am not going to ever bring this up to him, but it hurts me that he got a job there through connections despite not being even remotely qualified for his job. This is the reason why I am feeling upset today. I told him that I got rejected by Big Bank last night, and he said it's because I'm lacking experience. This is true! But I am 20 years old and since it's an internship and not a job, they never specified that they require experience in the field. It bothered me a little that John, who had 0 in-field experience when getting hired, thought this was the appropriate response, but I let it slide.

Today, I woke up feeling grumpy, which means I need some alone time to process my feelings and get over things on my own. I told John that I would prefer if we talked later on tonight or tomorrow when I feel better, and he said it was fine. But it was not fine. He continued to text me while I was at work about anything and everything, and I did my best to respond normally, although I admit I sent more one-word responses than usual. I was getting very overwhelmed, and it all got too much when he insisted I send him a photo of my face so he feels better. I honestly lost it at that moment and told him something along the lines of: ""I feel it is selfish to make me do things I don't want to do when I'm upset just so you feel better. I asked you to give me space and allow me to breathe not just so many times today, but every time we're in this situation. I'm turning my phone off and we'll talk later."" I did so I can get some actual work done. I also tried to link the texts he sent me while my phone was off, but my other post got removed for doing so. 

I know John and I know that he wanted me to spill all my feelings right then and there, but that makes me so uncomfortable and he knows this. This is exactly what happens every time I feel sad, and it honestly ruins my day, if not week. I believe he thinks because this method works for when he is feeling sad, it will also work for me, despite me insisting it will not multiple times. I think I've told him that leaving me alone for a while in this situation is best at least 10 times over the course of our relationship. I'm so bothered by this and his reaction that I'm honestly thinking of breaking things off with John. I feel so smothered on a daily basis, and it just gets too much when I need to be alone the most and he doubles down. Am I overreacting? Is he really being overbearing like I think he is? Please give me all the suggestions, experiences, and opinions you have. I am so, so frustrated.

**TL;DR - Every single time I feel down, my boyfriend bombards me with texts and snapchats until I'm forced to spill all my feelings to him. This doesn't make me feel better and he refuses to understand that. Is my method of taking time for myself to process things alone too cold or is he being overbearing? If it's the latter, how do I handle this?**"
am5fxu,114,2019-02-01,"If my Son doesn't want to do his Homework, he doesn't has to!",nicki419,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/am5fxu/if_my_son_doesnt_want_to_do_his_homework_he/,"First Things First: I'm German, excuse my Grammar (I got a Browser Plugin to help me with this but I'm sure I'll mess Things up anyways).

So, here's the Backstory: During October 2018 I did a two Week Internship that I needed to do for School. Since the Company, where I did my first Internship in Grade 9 (I'm in Grade 10 now) was in the IT-Business I decided to try out something Social so I applied for an Elementary School. I got accepted almost immediately. I just called, didn't even had to write an Application. Great, I thought. *Thought.* I got assigned to a pretty problematic Class (My whole Internship was still fun though). But there was one Kid (EK) who topped everything and soon I'd know where he learned that Behavior. Short Facts about this Kid: Refuses to do tasks and comes up with some bad Stories on why he won't do them, refuses to do Homework. Got assigned to a 2nd Graders btw.

Don't get me wrong here, I don't blame the Child for this, I remember me being quite problematic either. But here's the Difference: If my Parents found out, what they almost always did I got punished hard for it. But this Mom basically demands her Kid to stand above the Law. It happened on a Wednesday, Subjects on this Day: Maths, PE, German. You can skip the Lessons and just skip to the EP Part, but the Lessons add some Context, might be funny if you're bored.

Maths Lesson:

Awesome Teacher (AT): EK, have you done your Homework? (She asks Kids known for not doing Homework individually)

EK: \*looking ashamed\* No...

AT: Why's that? It's only one Page! (Around 8 simple Equations)

EK: I didn't understand...

AT: Didn't you ask your Mom for Help?

EK: No...

AT: And why?

EK: I don't know.

Teacher carries on, since Lessons are short. EK would interrupt that Lesson loudly a few Times.

&amp;#x200B;

PE Lesson:

EK comes up to me, telling me his leg hurt and that he can't take this Lesson. I told the PE Teacher (PT), she told EK to sit next to me until the Lesson's over. This is where it got suspicious: At the Beginning of each PE Lesson Kids have 15 Minutes to play free in the entire Sports Hall. EK wanted to play with his Friends.

Me: Stay here. You said your leg hurt, you shouldn't be playing around.

EK: It doesn't hurt anymore.

Me: I don't believe you.

EK: Why????? (Almost starts crying)

Me (not wanting to be responsible for letting a Kid cry): Okay, look. We'll go to M(r)s PT and let her Decide.

EK agrees. PT wouldn't let him play because his Leg hurt as he said and he started crying. It was so loud. PT gave up and let him play. EK was running around in the hall like Sonic the Hedgehog would do. When the Playtime was over, somehow EK's Leg hurt again. PT knows his Mom and told me to just let him sit on the Side with me. I couldn't understand her Decision. *Not now.*

&amp;#x200B;

German Lesson:

Aside from EK not doing the Homework (Literally copying two Sentences with 6-7 Words) and almost crying about being confronted with it, nothing extraordinary happened in this Lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it starts. The School offered Afternoon Care where EK was signed in to. After regular Lessons, I was assigned to Afternoon Care for an Hour too. EK was quietly eating his Food, nothing happened. But after 40 Minutes, the Moment you've all been waiting for: Entitled Mom (EM) shows up.

EM: Hey, EK! How was your day?

EK: Awesome!

EM: Nice. Go grab your Bag, let's head home, shall we?

At this point, she seemed like such a nice Lady to me. She had a constant Smile on her Face and happily watched her Son packing his Bag. Then she spoke to me, still nice and polite.

EM: You're a bit too old for Elementary School, aren't you? (It was a joke from her, I happily responded)

Me: Yes, indeed. I'm doing a two-Week Internship.

EM: Nice, how do you like it here?

Me: It's pretty awesome.

Then I was a bit surprised. AT and PT went in through the Door, heading directly towards EM and Me. (Later I found out that EM's Schedule is quite predictable and that AT and PT were waiting for her.)

AT: Good Afternoon, Mrs. EP.

EP: Good Afternoon.

AT: Do you have a Minute to talk about your Son?

EP: Of course... did something happen?

AT: Indeed, let's head over there.

They went on the other Side of the Room where I could still hear them.

AT and PT started confronting EM about Not doing Homework and the Thing with the Leg in the PE Lesson. EM totally changed Emotions.

EM: You're telling me MY SON did not do his Homework?! Well, maybe it's because it's TOO HARD FOR HIM!

AT: I asked your Son, he didn't even mind to ask you for Help. I don't think it's too hard, I just think he doesn't wanna do it.

EM: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I DID NOT RAISE MY SON LIKE THAT IF HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE HOMEWORK HE'LL ASK ME FOR HELP.

AT: Apparently, he didn't.

EM: IT'S FINE. IF HE DOESN'T WANNA DO HIS HOMEWORK, HE DOESN'T HAS TO. He's smarter than the whole Class anyway.

AT: He is one of the only Students to hang behind on most Subjects and he understands Things quite late. I think you should consider talking to him about School more and maybe help him if he-

EM: DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY SON!

AT: As a Mother, it is your Responsibility to take Care of your Son and help him. Also, we haven't talked about the PE Lessons yet.

EM: No, it is not. YOU are HIS Teacher, it is your Responsibility that he understands everything that is being taught. If he needs Help on some Homework, okay but it is not my Job to explain him Things he didn't understand. YOU GET PAID FOR THIS! And since you were talking about the PE Lesson. If EK says his Leg hurts, it hurts. Maybe Pain stops for a few Minutes but it can start again. My Son is not a Lair.

PT: Next Time I just won't let your Kid do the whole Lesson if something hurts, including the 15-Minute Playtime. I've had enough of this.

AT: Also, I get paid for teaching other Kids too. I can't wait for a single Child who doesn't learn Things because he refuses to do his Tasks, everyone would be bored and no one would learn anything in these Lessons.

EM: I'm saying this again: It's your Job. Do it right, else I'll get you both fired I SWEAR TO GOD!

She quit with her Son. During their Conversation, I had EK sitting next to me. He literally told me how his Mom would often behave like this if it comes to him and how his ""Mommy is the Best!""

After they left PT and AT would come to me and tell me that this wasn't the first Time something like this happened. I just responded ""Wow"" and they left. The last 10 Minutes of my ""Shift"" were free of any Stress at least, and I headed back Home.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still speechless about this Incident.

am5toe,150,2019-02-01,Returning a document to ourselves,Deprox,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/am5toe/returning_a_document_to_ourselves/,"I'm a clerk at a civil court in Brazil. My job includes dealing with lawyers and parties who walk up to our counter, as well as dealing with all the stages of a lawsuit. Firstly, I want to apologize for the recent lack of stories on my part. We had a few crazies around, but some wouldn't translate very well and some I'm still in the process of writing. Today, however, something short and funny happened involving my supervisor and I.

I need to clarify two things before we start. First is that in Brazil, we use letter rogatories if we need anything outside our jurisdiction, even if it's the next city over. So if a writ of attachment of a house is issued by City A but the house is in City B, City A has to issue a letter rogatory for City B to perform the attachment. Second is that nearly all judges delegate day-to-day decisions (like decisions, orders or decrees) to supervisors/directors to make in their name, and only bother with sentences and very complicated matters. Mine, of course, is no exception.

So, today, I got my hands on a very odd lawsuit. It's a letter rogatory for a writ of attachment issued by... My court. I triple-checked, and the issuing authority was, indeed, the First Civil Court. The address was somewhere in the capital of my state, nowhere near our area of jurisdiction. I was about to talk to my supervisor, but I realized he had already issued a decision:

*Given that the address is not within this Court's jurisdiction, return the letter rogatory to the issuing authority.*

I had no doubts about what to do: I printed the letter rogatory and took it to my supervisor. ""What's this about, Deprox?"", he asks, seeming confused. I happily reply, ""So, apparently, our court wants me to return our letter rogatory to ourselves. There it is."" He is now more confused, turning the pages until he gets to the decision he issued. ""If you wanted it in print, you could have just told me so instead of issuing a decision"", I add.

He takes off his glasses, which he usually does when he is about to get serious or personal. He stares at me and I start to think that maybe I'm in trouble for this practical joke. ""I... Didn't realize that we were the issuing authority"", he says before he starts to laugh. ""Welp, an order is an order"", and he stows the letter rogatory in his ""to scan"" folder.

Later in the day, I take another look at the letter rogatory's digital file and there is a new document by my supervisor: ""I certify that this letter rogatory was returned to and received by this Court."" We're actually obligated to certify in the files whenever we send a document to another court and/or when we receive a document from another court, so because of the decision he issued, he had to do both, stupid as it sounds.

***

EDIT: Bonus story that just happened!

A few minutes after this, a bald gentleman arrived at our counter.

**Gentleman**: Where is the third Family Court?  
**Intern**: There are only two Family Courts here, sir.  
**Gentleman**: Oh, but it's not the third court of this city. It's the one in [City 1.300 miles away in another state].  
**Inner Me**: *I don't like [where this is going](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/91kwoc/the_captain_who_wanted_a_remarriage/)...*

**Gentleman**: Fuck. 'K, thank you, bye.

I came to Sweden from an EU country with my car in April last year. I did a 6 months internship (end of studies) followed by 3 months of job seeking.

Basically, during the internship I was more or less in a temporary visit so I didn't even think about registering my car in Sweden. Then I could stay at least 3 months as a job seeker, given that I'm from an EU country. Again, I wasn't certain I was going to stay here.

Now, I finally signed a work contract earlier this month and started to ""move to Sweden for real"" and so checked about car registration rules... turns out this had to be done 7 days after I moved to Sweden!!

So 2.5 questions:

1. Did I ""officially"" move to Sweden since I signed my work contract? (so I have delayed the car registration by almost a month)

1,5. Am I actually delaying it since April 2018??

2,5. Do I risk a fine and how big would it be?

Thanks for your answers and I am infinitely sorry for my ignorance of the swedish law...

am62v1,5,2019-02-01,T.B.C. Staff Reform Act - learn what each staff's duties are!,Zoocanadanda,Freebuild,https://www.reddit.com/r/Freebuild/comments/am62v1/tbc_staff_reform_act_learn_what_each_staffs/,"We've revamped and reformed the staff's duties! Now the power is **distributed** in a more balanced way.

**Helpers** will be essentially interns who will get involved in staff duties in a more smaller role and learn through those to eventually become moderators. They will help out by telling people to move to appropriate channels, weighing in their opinion in staff discussions, etc.

**Mods** will tend to focus on the Discord-side of things, along with being able to weigh in their opinion and contributing to major decisions as well. Creating a new channel, kicking/banning some users out of the discord, talking in staff discussions, etc.

**Admins** will tend to focus on major decisions and server functionalities. RDP, multicraft, worlds, plugins, whatnot, they will be able to turn on the server, restart it, add plugins, etc.

**Owners** will oversee the entire staff team and help implement big and major changes, along with helping staff itself carry out its duties and continue to preserve and protect the server. Owners is pretty much self-explanatory.

---

Note 1: with this new staff reform act, **there's a bigger difference between each rank**, and thus allows for people with certain skills be granted permissions and be allowed to rank up to the best fitting role.

Note 2: **responsibilities are hereditary** - example, an admin should have mods' responsibilities/duties but have a bigger focus on the new ones, such as, major decision making, helping Owners decide on server plans, helping execute certain server plans, add or remove certain plugins, help all the staff members and oversee the staff team.

---

**Shared responsibilities:** kicking, muting, staff discussions, griefs, server threats, server plans, all those things and more, are shared responsibilities - all staff weigh in, all staff have a say in the decision making process.

am673l,7,2019-02-01,Office (Korean movie),SlippyLombardi,horror,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/am673l/office_korean_movie/,"What are your thoughts on this movie? I recently watched it on Netflix and found it very interesting and wanted to share some ideas to see what others have come up with because some of it is left up to your own imagination and/or speculation.

I tend to prefer movies that don‚Äôt hold your hand and spoon feed you the plot that most Hollywood movies will do.  

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people are confused by a number of parts of the movie. I found that watching the movie a second time helped greatly confirm a number of scenes which I was initially unsure about. There are a lot of hints throughout the movie that make much more sense when you put them all together, which I found much easier to do on second viewing having already being aware of what happens later.

Movies left open to interpretation offer better discussions and what I‚Äôm about to say about the plot are by no means canon, they are simply my interpretation having put all the pieces of the puzzle together that I found.

So why did Mr. Kim decide to murder his entire family? Including his sick son who his co workers say he cared for deeply.

Why did Lee Mi-rye the intern decide to murder her co-workers?

When you look at what they both have in common. Is it stress from the strict and competitive workplace? The working environment in East Asia especially South Korea and Japan are considered a highly stressful environment involving long working hours and minimal days off. No, I don‚Äôt believe this is what pushed them over the edge. 

The second thing they have in common is the mysterious KNIFE of course. Mr. Kim says to Lee Mi-rye that he was sent the Knife by a client he was working with, who committed suicide. Mr. Kim states that when he is holding the Knife, he feels calm and at peace, as if he‚Äôs holding a rosary. He then tries to forcefully pass the Knife on to Lee Mi-rye who declines to even touch it.

After he has indirectly given the Knife to Lee Mi-rye (he puts it in her office draw) he then leaves work, murders his entire family, then returns to work (maybe it‚Äôs here he puts the Knife in her draw), opens up the elevator maintenance door and proceeds to take a lethal dosage of cyanide whilst holding his diary. The diary simple compares his co-workers to wolves.

They have a number of similarities, which a co-worker informs her of in the toilets. There is a scene at the start of the movie of Mr. Kim having a coffee in a Caf√®. Lee Mi-rye is having the same coffee in the same Caf√® later on. A customer knocks in to her and she drops the Knife on the floor which she quickly puts back in her bag and runs out. This confirms she keeps the Knife on her even when she leaves the office only to bring it back with her the next morning to put back in her draw.

When Detective Jong-Hoon breaks in to her flat to investigate his suspicions, her neighbour informs him that she is incredibly weary of her and that she is a ticking time bomb. She tells him that she accidentally went to her flat one night instead of her own because she was drunk, and saw her standing still like a statue, holding and staring at the Knife with such commitment that she didn‚Äôt even notice that she had entered her flat. Whilst talking to the Detective she says that Lee Mi-rye looked ‚Äòpossessed‚Äô.

In conclusion, I believe the Knife is pure evil. It is in control and takes over its current owner. The company client originally had the Knife, who then sent the Knife to Mr. Kim before committing suicide. Mr. Kim then proceeded to murder his entire family, passed the Knife to Lee Mi-rye and then committed suicide himself. Lee Mi-rye then murdered her co-workers and seems to get away with it. 

How does she appear to get away with the murders? Well at first glance at the end from Detective Jong-Hoons view, it clearly looks like Won-Suk is the killer, and swiftly shoots him in the head. However upon closer inspection, he still has his suspicions of her as he asks her directly about the Knife that was found at the scene during her hospital visit and if she‚Äôs ever seen it before (he knows that she has because of her neighbour) in which she replies with the exactly same sentence as Mr. Kim did regarding the Knife; calm and at peace, as if holding a rosary. Now we already know that the Detective is under a great deal of pressure regarding this case, and literally just before entering her hospital room he‚Äôs on the phone with his superior about closing the case no matter what and his promotion is mentioned. I believe the way the Detective sees it, is if he takes it further with this case and attempts to investigate Lee Mi-rye for the murders, it‚Äôll piss his superior off and will greatly effect his chances of promotion so he simply closes the case and takes the easy way out.

Hallucinations are a reoccurring theme in the movie also. Several co-workers all have hallucinations of Mr. Kim. The company Director has a hallucination of him in the parking lot that he said felt so real. Jae-Il saw him whilst he was working an overtime shift. The Assistant Manager said she saw Mr. Kim under her desk and even Lee Mi-rye herself is having a conversation with him over instant messenger on her computer.

All of these are hallucinations. It was the driver picking up the Director in the parking lot, the Assistant Manager says when she saw Mr. Kim under her desk, he completely vanished out of no-where, and when Lee Mi-rye was talking to him on Messnger, she is startled by a senior employee, as she goes back to the chat on her PC, it isn‚Äôt there. It was never there in the first place. 

Also during the office murder spree, the employees often see Lee Mi-rye as Mr. Kim, including the assistant manager as she is stabbed to death in the toilet and the final scrap with Won-Suk, who keeps rambling saying things like this isn‚Äôt Lee Mi-rye. 

I take this as the Knife is helping to at least partially, conceal the wielders identity, or that the Knife actually contains Mr. Kims soul and can use his appearance as it sees fit. 

Pretty much the only part I‚Äôm not certain of is the fate of Jae-Il. He‚Äôs working a late shift to get a report finished, sees ‚ÄòMr. Kim‚Äô and is later found hung in the conference room. How did this happen? Was it suicide or was Lee Mi-rye responsible. I really can‚Äôt imagine her lifting a grown man up there to hang him, and he was clearly very stressed and having an argument with his partner shortly before. On his report he scribbled down in pen saying that he wants to kill himself. This could merely be a spur of the moment rambling out of pure frustration or it could be literal. We know that Lee Mi-rye was at the office with him because she is still there the following morning, so she is the ‚ÄòMr. Kim‚Äô he was seeing. The Knife was making him see her as Mr. Kim and perhaps ultimately drove him to kill himself. 

Another reoccurring point of interest in the movie is 2015 Sales Report that is shown a number of times. This is the report that Mr. Kim was originally working on, and that Jae-Il was tasked to finish. After this, the Assistant Manager is seen working on it, and does a copy and paste from Mr. Kim‚Äôs PC to hers. And finally later on it shows Lee Mi-rye herself working on it, which kicks off the final confrontation. She is asked why she is working on it, in which she replies saying something like ‚ÄòCan I not?‚Äô. The impression I get of this, is the Knife is in control of both Mr. Kim and Lee Mi-ryes souls, and is somewhat combined together. Lee Mi-rye is working on the report as Mr. Kim. 

As you can tell I really enjoyed the movie as I‚Äôve put so much thought and analysis in to it. Again, I‚Äôm not saying everything I‚Äôve wrote down it true, it‚Äôs just my opinions. However I believe most of it makes absolute sense and in the end, only a little is open to speculation. What do you guys thing? I may have missed some parts out."
am6rsh,4,2019-02-01,Story of the cheating bitch,stanevica,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/am6rsh/story_of_the_cheating_bitch/,"I need to get this off my chest.

We were together from 15 to 22. In the beginning it was great and exciting. After a few years things became stable and kinda boring. But we were happy together. 

Then he dropped the bomb that he wanted to do an internship on the other side of the world. I didnt like it because he would be gone for 6 months, but I was supportive. We talked about moving in together when he returned. I had a terrible feeling about his internship, something was gonna go real bad. Turns out it was me. 

We went on a big holiday with family. It was amazing but the whole time I felt like I should be happy. Why wasnt I happy when I had everything I needed? I started to analyze the relationship and his behaviour. He never, worked hard for anything. Was too lazy to have a job so there was not much money to do fun stuff or travel together. And suddenly he was working his ass off for the internship.  He never really complimented me, didnt make me feel attractive. I know its not his fault my self esteem was fucked up, but he was not the ‚Äòkind of guy‚Äô I needed to be with for the rest of my life. I would idealy like someone that surprises me sometimes or just told me I looked beautiful when I put effort in my looks for a datenight. Though I didnt fully understand this at the time, I can say in hindsight this was not the relationship I wanted to be in for the rest of my life. 

As soon as he left I started spiraling down. I missed him so much, and had never been alone before. I got nightmares all the time. I looked at my single friends and noticed how much more developed they were. Our sexlife was bad. I hated my body and he only lasted for 2 minutes. In 7 years time he made me orgasm once. So sex for me was a manditory task that I just got over with. I was curious about this social life were people actually think you are funny and attractive and wanted to get to know you. And I wanted to explore that side. I stopped developing myself when the relationship became comfertable. 

I had the talk with him, that I felt like I was changing and that I didnt know what I wanted and what it would be like if he returned. I suggested we took or time to get used to eachother again in stead of immediatly moving in together.

One night I was invited to a party. I dont remember much from that night. I threw up at one point and was brought home by a mutal ‚Äòfriend‚Äô. This guy took adventage of me. I still had vomit on my shirt and hair and he kissed me. I had no idea what was happening but he left, we didnt have sex. He apologised the next day and we havent had contact since.

I confessed the next day. All of the sudden I had done this thing I never thought I would or could do, and seeing my boyfriend hurt made me feel terribly guilty. Started spiraling more and failing my classes. Deep down I knew this relationship was over. I didnt want to marry someone I been with since 14 and never have experienced a good sexlife with orgasms and passion. I wanted to feel attractive, not slutty, just be wanted by someone. Someone to put effort in me.

I was exhausted and depressed. I was having nightmares all the time. I couldnt break up with him, I tried. He literally begged me to wait it out. He told me he got a lot of attention and could have cheated if he wanted to. I wanted him to explore his options and develop himself so that he didnt choose to settle down with me just because we had been together for so long. He took that the wrong way and said I wanted to sleep around and only told him to do so, so I wouldnt feel guilty myself. I just didnt want to drag him down with me.

So we ‚Äòdecided‚Äô to wait til he got back, in a month or two. He told me he would eventually forgive me for cheating. But the feeling was gone. I was honost and did not take adventage of him or the situation. I didnt go out after that. Just focused on the gym and school.

Seeing him after 6 months was so awkward. He felt like a brother to me. I got a twisted stomache thinking about having sex with him. But I still had some hope that things could turn to normal. We had this day planned to get to know eachother again. But he broke up with me.  I am very thankful that he was strong enough to make that decision when I wasnt. I took full responsibilty for my behaviour. I apologised and gave him his space. I accepted his anger and hate towards me.  I didnt start dating, just isolated myself and tried to get better through therapy. It still hurts that I couldnt make my mind up and get a clean break up where he wasnt betrayed by me.

Now, 4 years later, he is engaged to a girl he started dating two months after the break up. I dont miss him, I really hope he is happy with his fiance and does put effort in her.

And I am still trying to figure myself out. I have grown so much as a person. I finally graduated, am perfectly happy with being on my own and feel confident in my body. There were a couple of flings with great sex and an abusive relationship. So I had my share of shit.

I believe that I am not a bad person, I tried to do the right thing by telling him how I felt and confessing right away. But I shouldve been stronger. I have not cheated again. I never got closure and that is hard for me. I still have nightmares and am in therapy, I feel like I deserve that. I hope I can forgive myself and continue to grow.

I know its easy for the one who is hurt to be angry. But everybody hurts in a break up, even the cheating bitch."
am766a,43,2019-02-01,I found the cure to growing older,poloniumpoisoning,PPoisoningTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/comments/am766a/i_found_the_cure_to_growing_older/,"What would you do if you held the secret every human being and every enterprise would do anything to put their hands on?

I was 22 and a novice at a huge biomedicine company. Everyone treated me pretty much like an intern; I was young and unimportant, a mere apprentice cleaning the big shot researchers‚Äô Erlenmeyers and beakers.

But I loved my job; I stayed way past my shift every day. Working for free. Observing. Learning. Testing.

That‚Äôs how I came up with it. I noticed one of my colleagues was pretty close to achieving it, but had made a fundamental mistake. Everyone knew it was her obsession; she was 46 and working relentlessly in the cure to growing older for at least 15 years.

Her name was Valentina Esposito, and she was extremely respected in the field. She developed anti-age products for a lot of major beauty companies in the world. I don‚Äôt mean to brag or say I‚Äôm better than her. I thought her brilliant brain needed a little help and I could provide it, that‚Äôs all. So I had been secretly working for weeks on helping her.

Next day was Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day; Valentina wasn‚Äôt particularly nice to me, but I wanted to make her look good in front of her daughter anyway.

I stayed later than ever, working in one of the 3 samples she had been testing that day. I was so tired I was afraid to drive my car, and asked my father to come pick me up. 

‚ÄúSometimes I don‚Äôt know if I should spend my youth doing that‚Äù, I confided to him.

‚ÄúYou love it, Emily, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked, and I nodded as enthusiastically as my worn-out body could. ‚ÄúHave a little more faith in yourself, girl‚Äù.

That night, I slept peacefully, knowing I was doing something big.

I bought huge coffees for everyone, knowing there would be running around and excited screaming from the kids. All my peers were middle-aged and had daughters and sons from 7 to older than me; I was the only one that didn‚Äôt bring my children because my only son was a dog.

‚ÄúHey, Valentina, why don‚Äôt we test the stuff you‚Äôve been working on?‚Äù I suggested, at some point. I could barely restrain myself from smiling proudly. ‚ÄúYou said it was ready for human tests‚Äù.

‚ÄúSure‚Äù, she said, in a dispirited tone. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it will be 100% though‚Äù.

‚ÄúOf course it will, I‚Äôm sure!‚Äù I encouraged her. ‚ÄúYour work is brilliant and your daughter should see it‚Äù.

It seemed to cheer her up.

In the lab, we all knew her formula required a very special ingredient: DNA from a younger person. It was super simple to do it, we just needed a skin or hair sample, then it would be centrifuged to separate the DNA per se from the other parts, and added to the flask. The DNA needed to be fresh when you drink it so, at first, Valentina‚Äôs goal was to sell this product just to beauty clinics that could afford proper machinery to complete the formula.

Pretty much everything in your body has DNA, but in our lab we always opted for hair or skin when we could.

‚ÄúDo you want to use a bit of my hair?‚Äù I offered.

‚ÄúYour skin is so perfect, Emily‚Äù Valentina said in a dreamy tone, brushing her fingers on my cheek. ‚ÄúYou look so good. But nothing compares to the freshness of a child‚Äôs youth, so I‚Äôm taking Danielle‚Äôs DNA‚Äù.

Danielle was Valentina‚Äôs daughter. She had indeed perfect skin, being a 10-years-old; still a couple of blessed years free from the adolescence‚Äôs oiliness.

I put on my gloves and grabbed a small pair of sterilized scissors. Getting on my knees to be her size, I talked to Danielle in a soft voice. ‚ÄúYour hair is beautiful, you know?‚Äù she happily giggled. ‚ÄúBe a dear and let me cut just a tiny bit for your mom? You‚Äôll help her get prettier‚Äù.

She extended me the ends of her long hair in obedience. What a good kid, I thought. And her hair was indeed beautiful; she had auburn locks, just like her mother.

Cutting it and properly processing the DNA was simple enough, and soon Valentina was drinking the elixir. 

I couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes off of her; her skin slowly acquired more glow and the wrinkles soon started to soften. Valentina was still beautiful, but her age definitely showed. You could see in her face all the sleepless nights she spent developing her pride and joy cure to growing older. Most women in her field did everything they could to always look good, but Valentina refused to undergo plastic surgery, botox etc. She would get younger with her product and her product only, no matter how long it took to be finished.

It seemed to be working wonderfully, and her quick skin regeneration attracted attention from everyone in our small lab team. I was feeling proud and relaxed, watching her look like a woman in her mid-30s ‚Äì 10 years younger at least.

‚ÄúMommy, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Danielle asked, and I averted my gaze from Valentina‚Äôs rejuvenated face. ‚ÄúI feel weird‚Äù.

When my eyes met Danielle‚Äôs, I screamed. Her face was all wrinkled; way more than Valentina‚Äôs used to be.

It was horrifying; Danielle got 80 years older but still had a kid‚Äôs body. Her face was aged, with sunken and dry skin, but her features were still those of a child. She looked like a midget witch, and her anguished face made it all the creepier. To paint you a word picture, she looked like Snow White‚Äôs Queen when she turns into an old hag.

*Fuck*, I thought to myself, *the DNA‚Äôs donor will get old in the user‚Äôs place. But at a way bigger rate. This is fucking bad.*

‚ÄúValentina, look at Danielle‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt sell this. We need to work on this again‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe?‚Äù she replied, with ferocity. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, newbie? You have no place telling me what to do. Go clean some flask or whatever‚Äù.

A few of my peers laughed, and I felt my face burn with shame. Valentina couldn‚Äôt stop starring at the mirror. She didn‚Äôt even look at Danielle‚Äôs crying, desperate face. Nothing in the world would get between this woman and her vanity; no, between her and the job of her lifetime.

‚ÄúThe girl has a point, you know, Dr. Esposito?‚Äù Dave, the only other researcher that was on the same level as Valentina, spoke. ‚ÄúYour daughter‚Äôs face is a mess. She got like 8 years older for every year you got younger‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù Valentina replied with eyes gleaming from fury. ‚ÄúShe only needs to drink someone else‚Äôs DNA. Why don‚Äôt you give me one of your snotty boys so I can fix her?‚Äù

Just then, I noticed there was a putrid smell coming from Danielle. She smelled like really old people when they are about to die, but it was way stronger. Using that formula was inhumane, I thought. No one‚Äôs beauty is worth it.

‚ÄúI want to get younger and bang hot girls too‚Äù Dr. Cesare, the older in our team, screamed, instantly starting to chase Valentina.

It was pure chaos; in the blink of an eye, people armed themselves with shards of glass and other dangerous stuff from the lab, attacking others. Some wanted to get the elixir, some wanted to get a kid they could dump their oldness on.

Everyone went berserk, chasing kids and young people, that ran away screaming bloody murder. Some of the kids were too young to understand what was happening, why their parent‚Äôs friends wanted to hurt them. There was a lot of crying and pleading. I only survived because I had a limber body, and was able to react very quickly. I locked myself in one of the offices and sat very quietly under a large desk for hours.

In our no-disclosure agreement, we were forbidden to call for external help, such as the police, ambulances, etc. When bad stuff happened at the lab, we were to wait for their special team. And I didn‚Äôt have their contact. I was completely helpless.

Every minute I spent there was excruciating. I thought about how hard I had studied my whole life to be there; working for this company was my childhood dream. While other kids were dreaming of being ballerinas, doctors and astronauts, I had a serious career plan, including the university I would attend. The one I ended up attending.

I sacrificed personal relationships, sleep and my mental health to be there. I was happy and deserved to have such important people as my peers. The only ones I was still to keep in my life were my father and my dog, both always loyal despite my distantness and constant complains of being tired.

I deserved to be there.

‚ÄúHello, Emily‚Ä¶‚Äù I heard Valentina through the door, talking in a very paused and deliberated tone. It made my hair stand on end. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre there, because I already found everyone else and this is the only closed door‚Äù she sung all the words like a creepy melody.

I didn‚Äôt move or say a word, doing my best to keep my teeth from chattering.

Valentina kept pounding on the door. She sounded out of her mind. ‚ÄúLet me take your youth, Emily‚Ä¶ give it to me‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre so beautiful‚Äù her voice was raspy and scary, on the verge of unreturnable madness.

I waited and waited and waited for long minutes, but Valentina wouldn‚Äôt go away.

She was about to bring the door down. I looked around the office, but there was nothing that could be used as a weapon. Stupid bureaucrats. So I had an idea that could be my last. I explained to her that her original formula had a mistake that I fixed.

Laughing maniacally, she asked if I actually said she made a mistake and a child with no experience fixed it.

‚ÄúI swear. Try the other samples you were working yesterday. They are inert even if you add the right amount of DNA on them‚Äù.

I honestly don‚Äôt know why she believed me. Even I doubted myself for a moment. Maybe I just thought I had fixed it, but it was right all along. Maybe I‚Äôm the one who ruined it to the point where it takes away the DNA‚Äôs donor youth, instead of just copying it.

*Have a little more faith in you, girl*. Remembering my father‚Äôs words made me cry, thinking I would never see him again.

But Valentina grew quiet, and I knew she was trying the other samples. God bless the scientific mind. No matter if I was right or wrong, I had bought some time.

Not *some*. I had bought *enough* time.

As the special team arrived, Valentina decided to keep me alive and well because I was right.

The lab had a lot of trouble with the cover-up, but the story didn‚Äôt leak. Five children and two adults died that day, not to mention the youngsters that started rotting away alive like Danielle. They had to buy the silence of a lot of people and move them to another country in a hurry.

But Valentina was too important for them to lose her, and the cure to growing older was too amazing; I mean, despite the incident, it had potential. The company big wigs wanted the two of us to keep working together to improve it; they were eager to start selling it, but they knew it would wreak havoc and maybe even end the world.

For 25 years, I worked tirelessly on it. I made a lot of money, became as prestigious as my peer and had a lot of immensely qualified people working under me.

But we were never able to make the formula any better. The only way to cure oldness is sacrificing the young, and admitting this made me harden my heart.

This all happened in the early 90‚Äôs. I abandoned biomedicine and now direct an orphanage. We have a low adoption rate, but always have space available. The kids just complain about the smell. My skin is pretty as ever and still talk to Valentina often; she says I haven‚Äôt got a day older since we first met."

am7aqs,1,2019-02-01,I (22M) Must make decision between girl (20F) I have loved for years and dream opportunity,Kazah_7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/am7aqs/i_22m_must_make_decision_between_girl_20f_i_have/,"I'm someone who has always put logical decisions first, leaving my emotional well being to the way-side in my belief that it will be better for my long term happiness and success, and my relationship with this girl has been no exception. While my success may have profited, my happiness certainly has not. I find myself in a position I know all too well where I must make a decision between my future and this girl who I cannot let go of.

So let's lay the context. This may get a bit (very) long, so I apologise in advance, but those who read through, I greatly appreciate it. TL;DR at the end.

I met this girl (we'll call her Olivia) the summer she turned 16 and me 18. We hit it off, dating throughout the summer until I had to go to university in the neighboring city, 1h train ride away. She would keep going to high school in the small town we were from, and as a result I didn't think much of having a serious relationship, especially since I had never had one before.  This was something I told her for the sake of transparency; we'd be going our seperate ways and I'd likely see other girls once I started university.  
Despite this, she did come to see me in the city a couple of times once school started. I had my own apartment, and thanks to the new found privacy, I slowly intiated her into a sexual relationship. She had no such experience prior to me, so I made sure to take the time to go step by step, starting with hands, and oral.  
However, dumb and young as I was, I did end up having another girl come over to my place at some point who gave me oral sex for no good reason other than she was attracted to me and I was a horny teenager. This will be important later.  
Realising relatively quickly how stupid this was compared to how Olivia made me genuinely feel fulfilled when I saw her, I decided to start taking our relationship more seriously: she would come up to the city during the weekends to see me regularly from this point on. We had sex for the first time a bit before Christmas that year, her first time ever. And I truly knew I was in love with her come New Year's Eve.

For the rest of the school year, we went on to have the happiest, most fulfilling, innocent, naive and committed relationship young love could offer. Until I got an internship opportunity in the US for my 2nd year studies. My 2nd year of studies starts with an internship taking up the whole first semester: 5 months in this case.  
Having the 'logical' belief that we were young and should not be tied down by a long distance relationship at our age, I made the decision to cut things off and see how we'd feel when I 'd get back, much against Olivia's will and love for me, and as I'd soon realise, my love for her. And oooooh boy do things get messy from here on.

Within the first month, each of us at a our own seperate parties, each of us thinking ""oh, we're young and should have fun"", both get into bed with someone else. Still in contact, and still maintaining transparency, we tell eachother this over the phone. I wasn't bothered so much at first: this is the decision I made. I'd signed up for this, I knew things would happen eventually. She, however, was gutted. Both at what I had done as at what she herself had done, especially having only known sex as an emotional experience up until that point. Seeing the pain this caused, I cut contact entirely, believing our feelings would sort themselves out and we'd get over it. You guessed it: we didn't.  
I reopened contact with her in tears, promised her we wouldn't make the same mistakes again and agreed to attempt a long distance relationship. And so we did. And it was not easy. It was long and strenuous for us; 2 people who normally had a very tactile and physical relationship reduced to sexting and calls and messages with a 9 hour time difference separating us. I also realised that no longer being the only person to have slept with her bothered me. A lot. And upon asking, she would learn I had had a girl over to my place back when I first started university; remember? When I was being a horny teenager? As you can probably tell by now, I remain very honest in my relationships, but this is one case where I believe the better thing to do would have been to shut up, because ironically, it ruined her trust in me.  
There was a silver lining: At some point in the middle of the time I was away, I made plans and paid for her to visit me for a week. We had the time of our lives and she got to meet my best friend and his family as I was staying with them. She ended up bonding greatly with my best friend's mother. This had a big consequence later on.

Upon returning home to France, I had a few days to move into a new apartment and start a month of intense work at university. I was stressed and had little time for Olivia, who, on top of having her trust and heart broken over the past few months, had to deal with me being a generally unpleasant asshole because of how I couldn't handle people around me when under pressure. She broke up with me during that month. Aroggant little SOB I was, I was merely peeved at having 'wasted' my time and money on her while abroad thinking I could have used it better on myself. But things weren't so smooth.  
After dating a few other girls, feeling no real spark, and reopening contact with Olivia, I realised that I was very much in the wrong with a lot of the decisions I'd made, in the wrong with how I'd been treating her, that I still loved her and that I wanted to see her when I could to fix things. But while she still had strong feelings for me, she kept me at arms length. All it took was 1 more fight over text messages and it was properly over. We cut contact and a month later, my sister tells me Olivia was 'In a Relationship' on Facebook with someone else.

It was summer now and I was out and about with a vengeance. She had someone else? Fine. I was single and alone in an apartment in the middle of summer vacation. And boy did I fuck around. A lot. I thought it made me happy. I mean look at me! I was a 'stud': sleeping with several girls, going to the gym, eating properly, hanging out with friends when I could. But slowly the feeling crept in that I don't care about any of the girls I was seeing. That very few cared about me. That I wasn't getting the kind of attention or validation that I really yearned for, especially since I've always been very bad at giving myself that validation and seeing the bright side in things; always critical, never good enough, always expecting better of myself.  
When school picked up again and I had given up spending time with women I wasn't interested in, all it took was a little bad news from a friend that I had to be at school on a Saturday again for me to snap. I burst into a full on breakdown, sobbing my heart out. My sister (we'll call her Anna) who I was living with in the apartment at that point couldn't understand what the hell was going on. 'I'm so tired of being sad Ann' is all I could say.

Later that semester, at a bar, Anna ran into Olivia. Apparently, Olivia came straight up to my sister. She wanted to know how I was. In order to protect me from ginving her any real information, Anna said I was 'Fine'. I sat up on the couch in the living room late that evening. Given that information, I couldn't sleep. Around 2 am, my best friend in the States who I had stayed with during my internship messaged me to complain about Thanksgiving lunch.  
'Yeah I hate this crap, especially with my Mom talking bad about men on the phone to make Olivia feel better'  
'What? She's talking to Olivia?'  
'Yeah. She's bawling about you right now'  
Shit.  
'I miss her so much man. I haven't met anyone else who even come close to her'  
'Then call her'  
I waited for her to hang up with my friend's mother, and I did exactly what he said. We kept the conversation short; I told her I knew she'd just been crying on the phone. I told her I was not happy myself. We decided to meet up a couple days later. Through a lot of tears and embracing, we were back together after 7 months apart. But we had a lot to work through.

The break up struck our egoes hard. Olivia had been in a new relationship for a few months that went terribly and as a result she ended up sleeping around a bit as well after breaking it off. While the first week or so were fine, the following months were riddled with arguments over our hurt feelings and how all this could've been avoided. How I shouldn't still be friends with girls I'd slept with, how she didn't try hard enough to make things work and blah and blah and blah... we'd spend hours at a time sat up on the bed expressing our hurt to eachother until we could come to some form of understanding or compromise.  I know now that we grew more as people during that time than ever before. We learned to express our feelings and to listen to each other. That's something I'd never want to take back. And I knew that if we got through all that crap and we'd be together at the end, we could get through anything. Atleast, that's what I thought. I had to leave again.

I was coming up on my 4th year of studies. The international exchange year. During that time, I would have to take an exchange program from a school somewhere else in the world and since I had never been to Asia, I knew that's where I wanted to go from the start. By the time Olivia and I had been able to work through things, I already knew I was headed to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I would be gone 13 months. That coupled with an internship in South Africa for 4 months prior to that, no matter how we put it, there was no way after our previous long distance experience that we were going to bring ourselves to be able to live through that again. There was no way without a proper visa and without money that Olivia was going to be able to follow me without ruining her life. Despite all her best will to do anything to stay with me, I insisted she needed to work her own life as much as I was going to work on mine, and that meant not following me.  
After all we'd been through, there we were again. Breaking our hearts as I left for another country. We took turns crying in eachother's arms under the shower. I thought I was going to die my chest hurt so much.

A year and a half later, and I'm back in France. I'd found someone while travelling Asia but I wasn't grasped and I broke it off upon returning home, even though we could've easily kept things going since she was French. She wasn't the girl for me.  
Single, coming to the end of my 5 year degree and I've been struggling inside. Just like the summer where Olivia and I were broken up; I've been working on myself, investing in new acitivites, reading a lot, meditating, meeting new people, but nothing seems to click. I've been feeling empty. Lonely. And I'm truly beginning to fear I'll never be as happy as I was with Olivia because only she could make me feel the way she did.  
My degree must finish with a 6 month internship which can, naturally, be followed up by full time employment, and I have an opportunity I could've only dreamed of a few years ago: a well paid, multinational, growth oriented consulting job in Singapore. But you can probably guess where this is going. A week or two ago at a music event, I saw her.

She saw me first. I merely had to raise my glance for us to lock eyes. There she was, in the flesh, for the first time in a year and a half. She looked‚Ä¶ different. But it was still very much her. She held my stare, and as she did I felt a surge of adrenaline and suddenly the world began to slow and everything around her became a blur, as if she were under a spot light, my face decomposing with the surroundings; a deer in the headlights. Once I came back to my senses, all I could do was smile and wave. I broke down cryng that night when I came home. So I messaged her. And she messaged back. And then we saw each other.

Cut to yesterday. Initially we were meant to meet in public. Somewhere quiet to talk about our experiences over the time we hadn't been in contact. But because she wanted to meet earlier than I was able to, I could only suggest that she come to my place if she wanted to see me earlier. She accepted.  
She came in and we prepared lunch together during which she spoke to me in the usual whimsical upbeat way she always did about all the amazing things she was getting up to. She hadn't changed a bit. And my heart swelled. She told me she had a boyfriend and that she thinks she loves him. Thinks.  
All I wanted upon leaving her was for her to be happy and to find her own path, so I was genuinely happy for her. But I still missed her. As I shed a tear, she came over and held me tight, and I held her back. We held each other for a long time.  
Then she kissed me. And again. And before I knew it she was on top of me on the couch, saying we should take it to the bedroom.  
'I don't want you to have any regrets about your boyfriend'  
'I won't have any because I want you'  
So we made passionate love. She dug up her feelings for me and wants to break up with her boyfriend for me but as you can tell by now, we're in a dilema again.

TL;DR  
If everything goes well, I have the choice to leave (again) to Singapore for a dream opportunity. But with Olivia having her own life now with her own professional projects, again, she would not be able to follow me and again, we would have to seperate. Possibly definitively if I stay on after the internship. And I have no doubt in my mind that this is the girl I want to be with, none other. No other girl comes close and I've been with plenty and I've tried everything to get over my feelings for her. To no avail. With everything we've been through, I know it's her. But now I need to know if I'd be making the right decision to stay with her or to leave. You'd think by now after having gone through this twice that I'd know. But my heart and my brain are torn between 2 different possible futures that I both desperately want. I need help."

I applied to a pretty big firm (not Big 4) for an internship back in March 2017. I made it past the first round but didn't get the internship. Second time, I applied in October 2018 for a full-time position, and the interviewer was the same guy from the first round. He remembered me and mentioned that it was the first time he's ever interviewed someone a second time.

Now, on my school's career site, the positions for full-time and internship are up again. Since I'm graduating, I would definitely pick the full-time position. However, I'm pretty sure the interviewer will be the same guy again, and it will be my third time interviewing with him. On one hand, he could see it as determination. On the other hand, he could think to himself ""Doesn't she get it by now? How many times am I gonna continue seeing her?"""

We've  been dating for 6 months and get along better than anyone I'd  ever been with. We commonly  expressed  how we're  each others counterpart, and would like to have a future together. Since the beginning of the relationship  she transferred to a college about an hour and a half from me, we managed  to see each other every weekend. At first it wasn't  a big deal but she's  a junior and I'm still a freshman so where the trouble is is she's  thinking about her career  path and worries that she won't  have time for a serious relationship between  grad school and internships.

It's  worth to note out of all our time together we never argued at all and always  had great time together.

Come last night I could tell something was odd, when we went for a drive. She told me how much she loved me and wanted a future together , but felt she needed to focus on her career and would regret if a relationship prevented her from good opportunities. We talked for a while and before I  left we affectionately kissed and she told me she loved me. She appeared really sad and so was I.

I don't  want to hold her back from her aspirations, but I obviously  still want her in my life. She mentioned  she still  wants to be a part of it too, but I don't  think I could manage being friends with the feelings I have for her and that I believe she has for me. 

I don't  know  what to do at this point because none of this feels right, everything was so good. I'm  planning on giving it some time to reach out to her or wait to see if she comes back."

*The reports aligned with the emergence of the sun over the horizon. First the eastern seaboard of the United States. Asia. Africa. Europe. In the initial confusion, people thought everyone was changing. But it wasn't everyone.*

*Within a few months time, it was determined the final number was 90%. Nine in ten men awoke to a vagina between their legs. The organ they had been so accustomed to were gone. No one knew the cause. Some people claimed it was the Earth was now in the hands of an angry god. Some women claimed it was karma finally catching up for all of the bad behavior the penis has led men to perform. But by the end of a single day, 19 out of every 20 people on Earth had a fully functioning vagina but otherwise remained themselves.*

*The Mass Vanishing‚Äîas it soon came to be called‚Äîappeared to be random. There was no rhyme or reason as to which men were affected and which weren't. But it* ***was*** *entirely predictable how the men reacted. There was a spike in suicides at first, but that leveled out. Some openly embraced it, but the majority seemed to descend into great denial, assuming things would reverse and pretended like nothing has changed in an effort to keep people thinking that* ***they*** *weren't among the men who were changed.*

*The reality of the situation set in quicker than the cultural institutions could change. Suddenly, women found themselves in competition with men for the attention of the 10% who still retained a penis. Those men found themselves on the receiving end of a phallocentric cultural phenomenon. Despite the fact that the Great Vanishing was random and they had nothing to* ***earn*** *the power that now befell them, they became highly valued in society. It didn't take long for the penis to become the defining characteristic that separated humanity. The world reorganized not along a masculine/feminine divide but rather a phallic/yonic divide. The cock had cultural cache like never before.*

---

If you've read this far, welcome to a strange and twisted alternate reality I recently concocted. 

I'd like to build a story set in this world. For the most part, I'm rather flexible on the characters. I'd prefer two men‚Äîone with a cock and one without‚Äîbe at the center of the story, but what that looks like is up for negotiation. A few ideas I had so far would include:

* A masculine, power-hungry corporate executive (or even a government official) is one of the men who has lost his cock. He doesn't want the world to know this, so he's pretending he still has it. However, a problem arrives in the form of a haughty and assertive intern who *didn't* lose his cock. Emerging on the other side of the Vanishing with his cock has only inflated his already exaggerated sense of self. The intern knows the secret of the exec. The exec benefits from the intern staying silent, and the exec realizes what he needs to do to keep the intern silent (which perhaps he even comes to enjoy). The intern benefits from the favoritism and perks bestowed on him. The exec realizes the benefit of having someone with a real cock (a rare commodity!) at his disposal.

* A suburban family of three is turned upside down by the Vanishing. The father loses his cock, and it takes a toll on his relationship with his wife. Their college-aged daughter, who's living at home while attending classes, is dating a bratty guy her age. The relationship between the father and the daughter's boyfriend has always been contentious, but in the aftermath of the Vanishing, the boyfriend becomes a more audacious showboat. The extent of the boyfriend's assertion of power in the house eventually takes the form of him luring the father into a sexual relationship and threatening to expose it if the father should try to stop the sex.

* A gorgeous transwoman who transitioned at 18 is one of the random (chromosomally male) individuals who *retains* a cock. Her masculine boyfriend is one of the men who *loses* his. Their relationship is radically changed with the introduction of a vagina into their life‚Äîfirst her unbridled envy and resentment paired with his anger and impuissance. But it becomes a change that, eventually, both come to see as a net positive.

But I'm also open to your ideas. Kinks include power dynamics, world-building, and the intersections between sex and gender in a sociological sense. I'm willing to enter some stronger kinks than my usual vanilla fare, but all characters must be 18+, violence isn't welcomed, and bodily fluids and filth are excluded. "
am9nrt,4,2019-02-01,Are IG like/comment bot services actually being cracked down on?,smokehella,socialmedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/am9nrt/are_ig_likecomment_bot_services_actually_being/,"About a year ago I used Robolike to automatically like posts under certain hashtags and saw that, coupled with an aggressive REAL engagement effort, I saw a ton of growth. Now, I have since moved on to a different account and haven‚Äôt looked back at the auto-like services in a while. Recently, I was tracking the news that IG planned to crack down on accounts that use automation services like that. However, I get likes and comments all the time that are clearly automated and for many of the accounts it seems to be working in a positive way, where their engagement rates are still quite high and they are seeing a lot of growth.

The theory here of course is that you auto-like posts in certain hashtags, these users often click your page out of curiosity, and if you have good content some of them convert to followers.

 Like I said, I‚Äôve avoided revisiting this because of the IG news but are people still using these with success? Or am I just trippin‚Äô and maybe they‚Äôre just doing it manually with a team of interns."
am9xnj,1,2019-02-01,Physics Kinematics Question,recommendasystem,HomeworkHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/am9xnj/physics_kinematics_question/,"Can someone help me out? This is from Pearson's textbook, and I my question relates to why one method works and the other fails. 

Here is the situation:

&gt;During your summer internship for an aerospace company, you are asked to design a small research rocket. The rocket is to be launched from rest from the earth's surface and is to reach a maximum height of 920 m above the earth's surface. The rocket's engines give the rocket an upward acceleration so it moves with acceleration of 16.0 m/s2 during the time T that they fire. After the engines shut off, the rocket is in free fall. Ignore air resistance.

The method I used to solve this was as follows:

Separate the distance into two parts, d1 + d2 = 920m. d1 is the initial burn at 16m/s^2, and d2 is when gravity takes over. Then:

d1 = 0 + 0 + 16(t^2)/2 = 8t^2. This is because the initial position is 0, the initial velocity is ""at rest,"" thus also 0, and so the kinematic equation X + V + 1/2(at^2) is 8t^2 when a = 16. 

We now find the velocity at the end of the initial burn, using V^2 = Vi^2 + 2a(X - Xi). Here Vi = 0, our initial velocity, and X - Xi = d1, since X is our position at the end of the initial burn, and Xi was our initial position on the ground; a remains 16 m/s^2. Thus V = sqrt(32*d1). 

Now we can find d2 in terms of V. We use V^2 = Vi^2 + 2a(X - Xi). In this case, X = 920, and Xi = d1, so X - Xi = d2. Then V^2 = 0 because, at the top of our burn, V = 0, thus V^2 must also equal 0. So we solve -Vi^2 = -2(9.81)d2, so d2 = Vi^2/19.6 = d2

Then d1 + d2 is 8t^2 + Vi^2/19.6 = 920, sub in sqrt(32d1) for Vi, and 8t^2 for d1 and we get:

    8t^2 + 256t^2/19.62 = 920 &lt;==&gt; 412.96t^2 = 18050.4 
    and so:
    t = 6.611 seconds or so. 

Now, we can try to solve this using just the position equation X + Vi*t + 1/2(at^2), and we can find this equation:

    d1 + d2 = 8t^2 + 8t^2 + 16t -(9.81/2)*at^2 = 920 

where we treat Vi as, alternatively, sqrt(32*d1) = sqrt(256t^2) = 16t, or we simply intuit 16t because that would be the velocity at the end of the burn, and there are a handful of other reasons to use 16t. The question then is why doesn't this second method yield a correct answer? In fact, I could not determine any way (even treating Vi as 0) which resulted in a correct answer. The best I got was within a second or so of the correct answer. "
ama1ty,0,2019-02-01,[M4F] Looking for curvier/bigger girls :P,eatyourveggiez,r4rtoronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4rtoronto/comments/ama1ty/m4f_looking_for_curvierbigger_girls_p/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 24 year old male who is currently doing his internship in Toronto. A little bit about me: I have an average-fit build, am tall and kinda lanky. I enjoy doing mostly physical activities during my spare time. I also enjoy travelling, eating good food, and (surprisingly) learning new things . Some say I'm cute, some say I'm a little too juvenile so don't say I didn't warn you üòÇ.

To describe what I'm looking for; I'm looking to meet a curvier/bigger girl to do fun things with. As strange as it may sound, I never actually had a chance to date a curvier/bigger girl - I guess it never worked out üòïI've been single for a few months now and recently I noticed myself being attracted to curvier/bigger girls more and more. Hit me up if you (or if you have any hot curvier/bigger girl-friend you can introduce me to üòÉ) are also looking to chill and do fun things."

Hi all! Hope everyone is doing well.

This past month, Twice [released 1 Japanese M/V](https://www.vlive.tv/video/107254), attended 3 awards shows **\[add links?\]**, and had a [well-deserved](https://twitter.com/SubjectKpop/status/1091877740825866240) [vacation](https://twitter.com/misayeon/status/1091718252609355776). As January 2019 has drawn to a close, let us look back at what Twice has done and accomplished this month.

This calendar does not consist of everything TWICE did in the month of January; you can find the full calendar post here **\[add link\]**. **(should I include a full calendar post?)**

amap5d,2,2019-02-01,Putting It Into Words [Long Post],do11ars,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/amap5d/putting_it_into_words_long_post/,"tl;dr: OP was homeschooled until college, spent the last 3 months getting over a 5 year long exclusively online relationship (my only relationship) that ended abruptly when my pwBPD chose to move in with someone whom she had just met.

I found out about this subreddit this week, and I've debated whether or not I should post my experience going through a breakup partly 1) Because it doesn't feel like the breakup is even ""over"" and I haven't still quite accepted it, but mostly 2) Because my situation is unconventional and feels so complicated I barely even know where to begin. In reality, every situation is different and complicated for different reasons, and reading the posts on here make me feel like I'm not alone. I'm writing this post primarily for my own therapeutic purposes, but maybe it can have the added benefit of reassuring anyone who is going through something even remotely similar that you aren't alone. I'm not using a throwaway because even the tl;dr of my situation is ... unique, I suppose, so on the offchance someone recognizes me by the specificity it wouldn't matter if I had a throwaway. More importantly at this point, I don't really care. I just want to let it all out.  

I saw her on Tumblr five years ago, late 2013. I remember following her because I thought she was cute and I liked her blog, and she followed me back. We reblogged/commented on each others' posts, sent each other asks, eventually started talking on the phone/Facetime... it was a really difficult time in both of our lives, I think. For me, I was homeschooled until freshman year of college due to medical reasons, and at this time I was recovering from surgery. The surgery would end up being the reason I could be healthy enough to attend college; physically the recovery was extremely tough, and mentally it would have destroyed me if she had not been around. Because I was homeschooled I had a great deal of free time, so we would either talk for hours, effortlessly and about everything, or watch tv shows/anime/random Vines or Youtube videos. We were both just teenagers, with her being two years older than me. Although we never met in-person, I consider her to be my first - and to this day only - relationship.

In the beginning, she was taking the year off from school to live in France. She was struggling financially, and made it obvious to me. I wanted to help, partly because I thought she deserved to be enjoying her time there, and partly because I wanted her to like me. It was a **massive** mistake on my part to establish a pattern of sending her money/buying her presents in order to receive affection. I enjoyed granting her wishes, from the infinitesimal to the grandiose to the downright impossible. Among other gifts, I literally paid for her plane ticket back to the U.S. - I have no clue how she planned to get back, other than finding someone else to use.  I knew early on that she had BPD and an eating disorder because she blogged openly about it, which was fine in the sense that ignorance was bliss - I really didn't know anything about what those things really meant beyond something like a DSM definition/Wikipedia article.

As the years went on, we increasingly vented to each other exclusively about our mental problems. I can't speak for her, but I got worn down. I felt bad that I wasn't doing more to help her. She told me her only relationship experience was with her physically and emotionally abusive ex. She told me she couldn't afford therapy, and even though I would send her money specifically for that it would, without fail, end up being spent on something else. I never told her the money or the gifts were contingent upon her acting a certain way towards me because I truly didn't think of them that way; in fact, I told her the opposite. I told her that she shouldn't worry about it when I sent her an irresponsible amount of money, or that she should, if anything, use the money to see a therapist for both of our sakes. She never demanded money, but she would bluntly talk about it a lot - how she needed it, how she wanted someone to shower her in it. She would show me lipstick or lingerie and say something like ""this is what a good boyfriend would buy for me."" I fell for it every. single. time.

My first lesson: Although looking back I feel like I didn't understand the situation I had gotten myself into, the fact remains that what followed was so predictable in hindsight: Money and sex became linked. Sex became linked with intimacy. Money became a way for me to buy intimacy for her. This is *extremely* toxic. It can't be overstated. I can only say that I feel, in a way, fortunate that I didn't fall so deep into this hole that I couldn't climb myself out. The fact that I enabled this aspect of our relationship is my greatest regret.

In 2015, she came back to the U.S., enrolled back in school, and I went off to college. We agreed it just wasn't realistic for us to meet soon, we would both likely end up meeting somebody in college since we would be around so many new people, and that we should just remain friends. While we both did make plenty of new friends for which I'm extremely grateful, neither of us expressed strong romantic interest in someone else; at least, not strong enough to not come back to each other. We continued talking to each other every single day, and eventually the conversations became intimate and sexual again. During this time period, I can think equally of instances in which I initiated those conversations, and instances in which she initiated them. I was still in love with her and the idea of meeting her. 

Second lesson: We idealized each other. It's natural when you never meet someone to brush off negative behavior and have a higher tolerance for being ""around"" them, because you're not actually ""around"" them. We subconsciously projected onto each other positive qualities the other may or may not even have. I always understood that it wasn't like we would, as some given matter of natural course, get along seamlessly were we to meet in real life. Maybe not meeting her saved me from getting further tangled up in something I don't want anything to do with. Honestly, I don't know how to feel about the fact that we never met. I feel pretty bitter about it right now, but I understand that feeling could change one day. 

We made so many plans to meet in real life, but they would just get shattered. During the first week of December 2017, she told me out of absolutely nowhere that she wanted to spend that winter break together. Of course, I wanted to as well, but I just couldn't do it because of things going on at home - I needed more warning. Looking back, many crises or arguments that arose in our relationship did so without warning on my end, and I was expected to drop everything to respond to her demands or accusations. She responded to me telling her we couldn't meet by literally begging in a way I had never seen her do. She told me she would do anything to make it happen. She would take a 12 hour bus. She would work 14 hour shifts to pay for her own ticket. She would, verbatim, ""do anything for you. Move anywhere. I'll follow you anywhere.""  This should have sent alarm bells ringing in my head, but unfortunately it only kind of did. Instead I was more invested in how disappointed she was, and how guilty I felt that I couldn't make her happy. She started to talk very negatively about her life in general, and how this was just one example of how nothing went right for her. At this point, I actually started to question myself and my role in her life, as in perhaps I was the one weighing her down after all these years. I told her I still loved her, but she should feel free to see other people if she wanted. She said she didn't want that, that she wanted me, but she told me I should feel free to do the same as well. 

We didn't make any plans to meet because things felt so fragile between us. In spring 2018, a girl in my apartment building asked me out for coffee. I had been asked out by girls before and declined either because I didn't like the girl in that way or because I felt loyal to my pwBPD, but this time I wanted to say yes to this girl and I did say yes. I told my pwBPD about it and she reacted in a way I had never seen. We spoke on the phone literally all night. One moment she said she didn't want to stop me from going on this date, the next she cried saying ""We shouldn't see other people until we meet in real life."" I went on the date and it was nice enough, but those words and the pain with which she said them echoed in my soul. There was 0 chance I could invest myself in that date or any other girl at the time.

Summer starts approaching. She tells me she has two options: 1) intern in the department at my university relevant to her major, or 2) go back to France on a study abroad trip. I knew she wanted to go back to France, so I told her the choice was entirely up to her - she was of course welcome to live with me if that's what she wanted, but it was her choice. She said she would choose France, but she wanted for us to work towards meeting over winter break. I spent 8 hours in class 5 days a week last summer, but we still talked every fucking day. We fought frequently over increasingly minor things, but somehow it felt like we were closer than ever before. Every conversation would end with her feeling sleepy (5 hours time difference) and we would have makeup phone/Facetime sex. 

Third lesson: We were codependent, to a very dangerous extent. Her birthday is in August. I happened to be very busy that day and did not send her anything but a good morning/happy birthday text. By the evening, she called me over 30 times, and her messages read like they were written by someone on the verge of serious self-harm. In my mind, that sort of behavior had crept its way into being acceptable or normal; but that was only because she had gotten me to accept it as normal in our relationship. I also began to rely on her for sex and general motivation - because I wanted to work towards making us work in real life, I had the drive to do well in class, compile a great resume, and be able to work anywhere for her. I wasn't doing those things for me, nor was I even doing those things for her - I was doing them for *us*. Now, I can't think about sex without thinking of her, leading to feelings of heavy depression. When I think about doing work, I think about how doing well on a paper or a homework assignment won't get me any closer to what I want, which is meeting and being with her. I want that less and less each day now, but it's still there. 

Things get kind of complicated here, if they weren't already. I moved to D.C. late August for a semester-long internship program. I had never been to D.C. but she would just trash it, saying just... oddly negative things about it unprovoked. She was probably upset that me moving there would mean my attention wouldn't be 99% devoted to her, only 95%. She told me every day leading up to my moving that she was worried I would find someone in D.C. and leave her for them. I tried everything I could to assure her that wouldn't happen, but I couldn't prove that it wouldn't happen until it actually didn't happen. She wanted me to promise that us meeting for winter break would happen. I told her that it would. I genuinely thought it would. On the very first day of my internship, she *blew up* at me over an offhanded joke I made - it was so casual to me, but she reacted with more anger than I had seen her display towards me before. She said she couldn't accept my behavior any longer, that I never consider her feelings before I say things, and that winter break was cancelled and so was our relationship. A week later, she acted like what she said had never happened (what I said still happened, of course. She held her anger over my joke over my head every day). We kept having sexually intimate conversations into the night through October. 

One day, she tells me she started using Tinder. I was honestly fine with it, thought it could do her some good to meet new people, and even said she could have sex with someone if it felt right and I wouldn't mind. I thought it could be what she needed. I said I wouldn't mind because I thought she was still invested in me like I was in her - I still wanted winter break to happen, and I thought she did, too, because she kept talking to me and we kept having phone sex after she said we were over. She let me know she met someone she had known but only as an acquaintance, and she started spending nights at this person's place. It was honestly unclear to me if they were having sex at the time or not, but I didn't want to ask - just because I wouldn't have minded her having sex doesn't mean I would have wanted to hear the details. Regardless of what I wanted, we had our final argument over something small the last week of October. This time, unlike any argument we had in the past, she blocked me on everything. 

Maybe because I had just become so dependent on her and so deluded by her, but I just... thought she needed time. I contacted her a month later, the day after Thanksgiving (she had unblocked my number by then for whatever reason). She told me she's spending every night at the same guy's place, they're ""luvers,"" having amazing sex, that she planned to spend winter break at his cabin, and that she is truly happy for the first time. I can't really express how I reacted... my mind is still a little frozen in the moment I read those texts. I basically had a total nervous breakdown in the moment, but still managed to go to work every day. I ended up excusing myself from social events, using my lunch time at work to try to talk to her instead of eating, and couldn't think about anything else. I told her that I know I said I was okay with her seeing someone, but I thought she was still in love with me. I thought this because she was treating me the same way as before she had already cancelled everything in her mind. 

I asked if she remembered saying she didn't want us to see other people until we met in real life and she just said ""things happened."" She said I was trying to guilt her for being happy. When, out of confused, depraved and pathetic desperation I told her I didn't want to be with anyone other than her, she told me that I should wait for her by moving on with my life. I spent all of winter break trying to understand, barely leaving my bed. I kept thinking about her and this random person being together, how after less than a month he got to be with her in ways that I never did after 5 years. We didn't talk for another month. 

Once I finally told my family and close friends about what happened, I started to think maybe it wasn't entirely my fault. When it became clear to me that I wouldn't be able to just return to school like nothing had happened, I tried reaching out to her, partly because I wanted to confront her with what I thought she did wrong to me and partly because I still wanted to get back together with her. I was still blocked, and beginning to inch towards accepting what happened as what it seemed to be - I had pushed her away, and she was chasing her happiness. Simple enough. I was so fueled by the hope that we would one day meet and all these feelings that built up over years could be actualized, not ""just"" through sex but by spending actual time in each other's physical presence - it's hard to put into words, but there are so many times even now I go to a museum or even just grocery shopping and I'm not able to enjoy it because I wasn't with her. Now it's even worse, because I can't do the things I actually did enjoy (video games, watching tv/movies, listen to most of my favorite music) by myself without thinking about her. 

She eventually reinitiated contact with me. I was trying to move on, and before she did that I was doing better than I am now. I should have blocked her on everything. She sent me a Christmas Eve text, and two weeks ago called me while she was still in this guy's bed and he was at work. She never asked me how I was doing or even how my last month in D.C. was or how my winter break was. She said she didn't ask me because I accused her of being selfish, and ""why would I ask someone accusing me of that how they're doing lol,"" while we're on the phone because *she* called *me*! I told her it felt like she cheated on me, but that I didn't want to think that she did - at the very least, she threw away our future together, and that my feelings towards the memories we built over five years turned from happy to resentful. In my mind, she has turned from my best friend in the world to someone... I just don't recognize. It's like that person I loved is dead. 

Some highlights from our final conversation: she never did anything ""purely to manipulate"" me. It was easy to move in with someone so fast because ""a better opportunity presented itself"" to her. She ""doesn't love me,"" but said later she was only still talking to me because she ""still loves me in a fucked up way.""  Her boyfriend is telling her she doesn't deserve me or anyone being ""mean"" to her, and that she feels like a ""princess with a perfect beautiful life."" She feels ""somewhat guilty because it was unavoidable"" for her to hurt me, but she said ""I do not feel selfish for being happy. I did a good thing for me. I actually did what was right."" Finally, she told me I'm a selfish individual with a ""virginity complex"" (which is true, and which is why it hurts).

Because our relationship was entirely digital, I have the ""benefit"" of having access to logs of basically every conversation we ever had, or if it was a phone conversation then there's a log of who called whom when etc. I went through some of these logs just to confirm my suspicions that she had been abusive to me without me understanding it as abuse. When I confronted her with that, she responded by saying she blocked me on all platforms forever this time, called me crazy and obsessive, and informed me that she reported me to my school's Title IX office for stalking her. It's been about two weeks since that, and I haven't received anything about any investigation or whatever - I'm less worried about getting in trouble for something I know I never did than I am hurt that someone I was so deeply in love with treated me in this way. 

I don't know where I'm going to go from here. I am starting to see a therapist. I've only just started to come to terms that this already unconventional relationship may have been abusive, as well. I say ""may"" have been abusive because I still think that I did so many things wrong - ""wrong"" in the sense that I worry I did things that were bad for her mental health, and ""wrong"" in the sense that I want us to be together, even now, and it feels like my fault that we aren't. I'm so thankful for my friends, but I'm genuinely worried that I can never have a healthy intimate relationship with another human being. I've never even held someone's hand, so I feel like I had this very intense emotional experience without any of the physical, which is just a weird feeling. But more than anything, I don't want to perpetuate abusive relationship dynamics that became normal without me even realizing it with another person. I'm scared that I could put someone through something like that this person put me through. 

I'm not sure I have anything else to really say. I'm sorry for the long post. Thank you for reading."
amayrg,9,2019-02-01,I have two days to deliver my first internship challenge and I can't get my Update view to load the proper instance when using Bootstrap modal. Any help appreciated.,two-headed-boy,djangolearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/comments/amayrg/i_have_two_days_to_deliver_my_first_internship/,"Hey guys,

I started learning Django around 7 months ago and earlier this week I got called in for an internship interview for a software development company and I have to go in and present a challenge on Monday.

[I have to build a phone catalog website with a basic CRUD and a few other options.](https://i.imgur.com/h2oqV1S.png)

Basically just implement a table that displays name, email and phone number, with options to add, remove and update contacts.

On my own I decided I wanted to use Bootstrap Modals to handle the add and update templates. 

This is my Model:

    class Contacts(models.Model):

    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, unique=True, null=False)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=False)
    address= models.CharField(max_length=150, null=False)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=14, null=False)
    email = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=False)
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=1, null=False)
    birth = models.CharField(max_length=10, null=False)

And this is my home view:

    def home(request):
    #create form
    form = now_contact_form(request.POST or None)
    contacts = Contact.objects.all()

    #edit form
    edit_form = edit_contact_form(request.POST or None, instance=Contacts)

    #dictionary
    data = {'form': form,
             'contacts': contacts,
             'edit_form': edit_form,
             }

    #save
    if form.is_valid():
        contact = form.save(commit=False)
        contact.save()
        return redirect('index')

    if editar_form.is_valid():
        editar = editar_form.save(commit=False)
        editar.save()
        return redirect('index')

    return render(request, 'index.html', dados)

When I try to run like this, [this is what I get.](https://i.imgur.com/paXSJpx.png) Now, I know the problem is that I'm trying to pass my `Contacts` class as an instance in `edit_form` and that's not the way to do it, however, if I try to do a `get` for the object I can't think of how to pass its ID since my home function doesn't pass any ID parameter:

    edit_instance = get_object_or_404(Contacts, id=?)
    edit_form = edit_contact_form(request.POST or None, instance=edit_instance)

Now if I bypass completely the Bootstrap modal and try to update the data in the Edit view:

    def edit(request, id):
    contact = get_object_or_404(Contact, id=id)
    edit_form = edit_contact_form(request.POST or None, instance=contact)

    data = {'edit_form': edit_form,
             }

    if edit_form.is_valid():
        edit_form.save()
        return redirect('index')

    return render(request, 'edit.html', data)

[It works and I'm able to edit the data, as long as I open the template in a new tab and bypass the Bootstrap Modal.](https://i.imgur.com/2zGZALZ.png) Obviously I'd like to have it work with the Bootstrap Modal, though.

Lastly, this is my Modal button:

    &lt;a href=""{% url 'edit' contact.id %}"" data-toggle=""modal"" data-target=""#editar-modal""&gt;
        &lt;svg-icon class=""glyph-icon si-glyph-edit""&gt;
             &lt;src href={% static 'svg/si-glyph-edit.svg' %}/&gt;
        &lt;/svg-icon&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

And this is my actual Modal:

    &lt;div class=""modal fade"" id=""editar-modal"" tabindex=""-1"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""Modal"" aria-hidden=""true""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered"" role=""document""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""modal-content""&gt;
                &lt;div class=""modal-header""&gt;
                &lt;h5 class=""modal-title segoe-bold""&gt;Editar Cadastro&lt;/h5&gt;
                &lt;button type=""button"" class=""close"" data-dismiss=""modal"" aria-label=""Close""&gt;
                &lt;span aria-hidden=""true""&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=""modal-body""&gt;
                {% include 'editar.html' %}
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

I know that's a lot of stuff I pasted but I believe it's a fairly simple problem. I apologize for my ignorance, this is actually my first ever question.

I'd be eternally grateful if anyone at all could help me or point me towards a solution.

Thank you very much."
amb0zb,6,2019-02-02,My dad is too self centered to be happy for me getting a near full ride to my number one college.,TheLoudestWhisper,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/amb0zb/my_dad_is_too_self_centered_to_be_happy_for_me/,"I'm not trying to brag about anything, but I applied to 5-6 schools for nursing. I got into all but my least favorite, so I wasn't too bothered about that. I accepted I wouldn't go to my top school because it is roughly 35k a year not including room and board, but I considered doing ROTC to pay for it. It's special because it's the perfect school, in a great location, and I would get to start nursing school right away, and not have to wait 2 years and risk not being accepted into the program. I'm at a great high school known for it's intense pre-healthcare academy where I have worked extremely hard for years to make good grades, have an internship, and achieve my dreams of helping others. I got a large merit scholarship to this school (School A) but it was still out of reach for my family. I also really love School B, a school about 15 hours away, also very expensive, and without a direct admit nursing program. The thing about School B is my dad works near it, and he works with a lot of alum and is really infatuated with the town and culture. Don't get me wrong, I love the school too, but once my dad gets involved in anything it becomes all about him. Today I came home to the crisp white envelope labelled: IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INFORMATION ENCLOSED. The numbers were crunched, somehow between scholarships, grants, and a small loan I managed to cover tuition to my favorite college. I was shocked, my mom and I were crying, this is a huge deal and I'm so thankful and grateful. My dad is mad because his cheap laptop is acting up. Usually I'd just leave him alone and let him make himself miserable, but this is a Big Fucking Deal so I go and show him. Without looking up, I get an apathetic ""thats great sweetie. can you go pick up the dog shit in the yard now?"" My dad is relatively supportive when situations benefit him, like getting money. But the emotionless answer really rubbed me the wrong way. I by no means require showers of praise, but some congratulations would have been nice. So I pick up the dog shit and go about my evening. I understand, computer problems are frustrating, but he couldn't even be bothered to look up? it broke my heart. I come back from walking the dog and he's still mad at the computer, but he manages a weird hug and a ""wow, thats great. I'm proud, but I've had a bad day because of my computer"". Dad, put the fucking computer away. I sit down with my parents and tell them I absolutely want to attend this school now that it's within our financial reach and how happy it makes me. My mom is still on cloud 9 but dad is still distant and irritable. I sit him down and ask if there's anything else going on, and if I can help. He responds, ""I'm glad you got into School A, but what about School B? I could swing by, stay in the B&amp;B I like, go to those cool pubs, you could be just like everyone I work with"" his ulterior motives have him so wrapped up in his romanticization of this town he can't even muster up a single genuine emotion. I explain to him that I've worked so hard for this, I transferred schools halfway through high school, I had 12 hour school days and internship getting credits for Patient Care Tech, and I gently reminded him that as much as I love him, this is my life and my education. I would get to start nursing school the minute I got there, instead of risking wasting time and money at another school that I might not get accepted into the nursing program. He still doesn't care too much, but says ""Do what you want, I just might be sad"" I feel guilty because he is paying for my college, but he has never been too invested in the process or what I value so I'm not going to let him micromanage this like he does literally every other thing in my life. If I can, I'm going to School A. I can't be manipulated out of an opportunity I've dreamed of for years, but I still feel guilty. Any advice?"

I've been through the standard round of intro programming courses and have picked up a lot from my internships; bash scripting, regular expression, python, LOTS of c and c++. However, I know next to nothing when it comes to web based coding and UD doesn't seem to offer any courses that are just basic web app or web design. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions for a course that could teach me the basics? Stuff like:

Using or even designing web APIs

Basic use and implementation of HTML

JASON and how to implement it

Even just sending a single packet over the web from a python or even C program

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys have any recommendations it would be a really big help. Thanks for your time!"

After 2 month of working hard trying to impress them, they saw that I was doing so much work done more than the contractor and so they put him on ""hold"" or basically in other words I replaced him I was 3 times cheaper and fulltime doing more work than him.  

Now Im the only one working on this project, handling everything learning on my own. The whole project is the ceo (my boss) idea and no one is excited about it as it will just be extra work on their burden. So I have to push hard to get the information i need from anyone.  

My boss's dad (the owner) keeps on asking me why we didnt launch it yet and I just blame it on his son saying im waiting for him to release it by giving me the updated info. He keeps on saying i need to put a timeline but I cant without my boss as everything depends on how he cooperate with me and he often blow past deadlines and everything is always late.  

I think his dad wants to cancel this whole project as they need to provide me visa and insurance soon and he doesnt like it. I renewed my visa on my family for one more year so I have the flexibility now to leave but i havent told my work yet.  

The ex contractor said he can hire me if I leave, but he has to get permission and blessing from my current boss before he does. And if he says no he wont be giving me anything.  

Im planning on telling my boss that i want to start working from home tmr but I dont know how he will react. I need the extra time in my life as im doing freelance on the side for the ex contractor and others, also my current company is so unorganized and people dont speak to each other (boring).  

TLDR: how do I tell my boss to allow me to work from home or become freelancer without firing me or lowering my salary too much?"

I had just completed my internship with a company and was offered a full time job with a sister company in another state. I was excited about moving to a new city, but because of my reckless spending I did not have much money in the bank to afford a big move like this. It was depressing to know that after just turning twenty-five, I did not have much to show for my hard work. I was scheduled to begin my new job at the beginning of the next month so time was certainly a factor. I racked my brain trying to think of a solution but just was not coming up with anything. 

I decided to call my mother and talk to her and see if she had any ideas. After about an hour of talking and still not coming up with anything, an idea came from out of the blue, my Aunt Jane lives in the town where I was going to work, I thought maybe it would be a possibility to live with her until I got settled? Mom was not too keen on that idea but we eventually decided it was the only option. My Aunt Jane and my mother get along but they are two completely different people. My Aunt Jane has more of an outgoing personality and enjoys going out and having fun whereas my mother enjoys the quiet time at home with my father. 

Mom made the phone call and called me back to say that everything was settled and that Aunt Jane would not mind at all. It was settled then, I packed my belongings and headed out with about one week to move in and reacquaint myself with my Aunt. Driving up to my Aunt's house I wondered if I had made the wrong decision? I walked up to the door and was happily greeted by my Aunt Jane."

I am looking to play the office intern around the 13+ age. I want to get a job in an office with some sexy office workers. Maybe I am the bosses son and that's how I got the job. Maybe you are one of the women I am working under and I am not pulling my weight [So you see what I am good for](https://gfycat.com/WarmNextDegu). 

Or I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

Maybe I am interviewing for the position and you're asing what attributes I have, I can't help but stare and get hard and you want to utilize my biggest attribute.

Or even I walk into your office and catch you masturbating. You chase after me and suck me for my silence.

Maybe you have your own idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Below are my kinks.....

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me.

Being tied up, Love the idea of being tied up and unable to move as you do stuff to me. "

So I experienced a tramuatic event in November. I got too involved in my ex friend's domestic violence situation. I had worked with domestic violence victims in the past for internships and it was something I was very passionate about. I got to involved because of my job background and my own personal experiences so it hit too close to home. I felt like I had to save her? I knew he was going to kill her eventually..... Anyway it culminated to her ex trying to stab me cause I was getting in the way. I was in the apartment with her we didn't want him in and he was threatening to break in and basically kill us. She eventually let him in and him and I argued and he held a knife to my throat. My friend de-escalated it and I left and called the police and left. She told the police it was just a misunderstanding and yeah....I cut our friendship after that because I felt weird that she covered for him and she ended up admitting that if he would have killed me she probably would have said it wasn't him.  Ever since then I feel like I've just been losing my self. I've been hanging with the wrong crowd and yesterday I didn't drink but I got high and my ""friends"" tried to force me to try cocaine. 

Btw I am in therapy. 

I don't wanna go down this path anymore. I don't want to drink or do drugs. I don't want to blackout.i just want to go back to the ambitious, motivated and passionate caring person I was. I'm still in school but I had to stop so Many things cause I'm just not in the right mental state. That incident just shook up my world view and I sorta lost myself


I drink because I just wanna numb the pain I feel. I just wanna be ok again. "

amfolg,2169,2019-02-02,Roommate doesn‚Äôt understand MY money isn‚Äôt OUR money,brandonandtheboyds,ChoosingBeggars,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/amfolg/roommate_doesnt_understand_my_money_isnt_our_money/,"Note: Lengthy story so TL;DR at bottom. Tried to keep it short but it didn‚Äôt end up short. Sorry. Also, on mobile, so grammar may not be right. 

Back a couple years ago, I was starting my sophomore year at college and I had chosen to do random roommates. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen, right? Well in walks our choosing beggar. I‚Äôll call him Bad Roommate or BR for short. It was myself, BR, and a great roommate (GR) in a suite-style dorm room for a full year. The following all takes place within the first few months:

Instance one: About a month into knowing BR, I learned he was very active in his fraternity. Which, they‚Äôre not for me but if you enjoy that sort of stuff then have at it. But it usually led to him not making the best decisions. An early into the fall semester, he and his fraternity brothers were going white water rafting. Cool, fun, exciting activity. On his way out the door, GR and I notice he‚Äôs still wearing his Costas (sunglasses that range in price from $150 to a few hundred dollars on the low end). We asked if he actually planned to wear those while white water rafting and he made sure we knew we were idiots for even asking. ‚ÄúOf COURSE I am! They‚Äôll be fine! It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm some scrub who‚Äôll fall out the raft‚Äù (actual quote with heavy foreshadowing). 
Cut to the end of the day. He walks in the dorm room looking kinda sad and GR and I knew immediately what happened. He lost the sunglasses. Idiot. Well about two weeks later he comes to me and asks me if I could give him a ride downtown to pick up the new Costas he‚Äôd ordered. So sure whatever. I‚Äôll give him a ride. ‚ÄúAlso, could you front me about $150 to cover the rest of the cost?‚Äù I said no and told him the obvious reasons why (poor/college student, don‚Äôt know him THAT well, etc.) and he got very upset that I was being so selfish. He asked GR the same. GR gave the same answer I did. From then on, GR and I knew what kind of guy we were living with. 

Instance(s) 2 (through 4):
BR liked milk. So did GR. I do not. GR would buy milk for himself (cereal, protein shakes, just to drink) but every so often BR would drink some. One time, GR bought milk and BR drank it all within two days and asked GR when he was going to buy more milk. GR had not even gotten to drink any of that particular gallon. BR would do this a couple more times with other foods/beverages during this fall semester. GR started keeping his milk in his mini-fridge in his room and locked the door. Total Lockdown because of milk. 

Final Instance: I wanted a TV for myself. I was 19 and had never owned one but never really needed to. GR had one in his bedroom and was always kind enough to let me enjoy it with him a lot of days. I tried to be respectful of his space and only used it when he was around since it was in his bedroom. BR also had a TV in his bedroom. Sometimes we would play Super Smash Bros. on the N64. Fun times. But we didn‚Äôt have a communal Tv. Just the two in my roommates‚Äô bedrooms. When I started thinking about it around the fourth month into the semester, BR kept trying to convince me to buy a big one, a nice one, an expensive one. He wanted e to shell out the big bucks for one that we could put in the main room. He wanted something he could use with a bunch of friends. I told him I just wanted one for my bedroom for my own personal use. Apparently that was selfish. I reminded him that if he wanted one for the main room, he could use his (which itself was a big, nice, expensive tv). He not-so-politely declined. He persisted that I should put mine out there. I offered that we could both go in for one or even try to get GR in on the cost and we could all split it. Honestly, I would have had no problem with that. But again, no. He wasn‚Äôt going to pay for a TV that wasn‚Äôt going to be completely his. I had to buy it. I decided, nah. I don‚Äôt need a TV right now. GR being a great roommate still let me use his with him. GR is still one of my absolute best friends to this day. 

At the end of the semester, I got an engineering internship for the next semester in a different part of the state. So I moved out, bought a tv for myself, and went along with my life. BR continued to pull the same behavior with GR the rest of the time they live together. The end. 

TL;DR Bad roommate wants me to pay for $150 sunglasses because he lost his rafting after I said it was a bad idea to take them, he ate/drank a lot of my and my roommates groceries without permission and expected us to keep buying groceries for him, and then expected me to buy an expensive tv for him to use in the living room with friends when I had no tv and he already had a tv.

amg2e1,1,2019-02-02,[M4A](Playing Female) Office Sex,mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/amg2e1/m4aplaying_female_office_sex/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

My Kik is Mjd931 

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

\- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.
 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me. 

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........"

I am in university, in my third year, and it's exam period. I didn't go to three of my exams and probably won't go to the next one too. If I'm starting to feel better, will try to go the last one, but that's what I said about all the others. Every morning I try to wake up at 8, but can't get out of bed until 10, and even then, it's only to go to the bathroom, make my bed, change out of my pajamas, and then lay back in bed. Just can't seem to find the motivation to study at all or do anything else. I hate my degree and I don't understand how I went through the past two years. And this semester seemed so good from the start, I did better in all of my courses and everything seemed so promising. 

Now I just want everything to end. Every day I end up thinking about how nice it would be to go to sleep and never wake up, because I find no reason to live anymore. I am feeling tired every day and see no point in my existence. My parents love and support me, I have friends that are worried about me and I guess that should be enough. But it isn‚Äôt. I tend to write in my journal every time I need to organize my thoughts, sort out my goals and see what I need to do to achieve them. Even though most of the times I never fulfill them, it is a nice visualization and helps me understand what I want and gives me something to do for the next day. Today I tried to do that, and I couldn‚Äôt think of any goal. I looked at the empty page and I couldn‚Äôt even think about anything. I can‚Äôt even make myself study or work out. 

Everyone tells me that there is only one and a half year left, but I think I started to hate my degree even more for the past few weeks. And I also am afraid that I won‚Äôt be able to find an internship for this summer, as I am not as good or passionate as everyone in my field, and everyone already had one over the past summers. And then there is the problem of finding a job, which I probably also won‚Äôt find. I also can‚Äôt change my degree, as it is not so easy in my country, it is probably too late. I can‚Äôt seem to find any solutions to improving my life. Why can‚Äôt the end of the world come sooner, I am so tired of living, I just want for all of this to be over.

amibyj,7,2019-02-02,Almost no passion for CS anymore and not productive with CS,webdevlets,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/amibyj/almost_no_passion_for_cs_anymore_and_not/,"I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science, and have landed a few good internships in the past.  Right now, I have almost zero passion for computer science.  I'm not entirely sure why, but I would say it's partially because I started coding when I was 11, and it just seems really tedious and old at this point.  Front end, back end, whatever doesn't matter.  Another part is that I am recovering from mental illness (depression, or something like that, depending on who you ask), but in the real world you can't necessarily just break it down into 1) cure depression 2) continue with real life. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I had a full-time software engineering job last year, but I got fired after a few months because of lack of productivity.  I was literally doing about 5-7 hours of work during a 40 hour work week - not because I was lazy or undisciplined, but that is all I could actually manage.  I could be looking at the code and the requirements, and my brain would just not be functioning (hard to relate to if you haven't experienced it).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, does anyone had any CS career / life advice about this?  The only thing that might strike up my passion again in CS is something research-y, like cutting-edge AI work or designing new models of computation.  But, I only have a Bachelor's degree, and there is a long road to get to that point that I don't feel at all confident I can do right now.  If I had a boring CS job but it were part-time, I might be able to handle that, but I have not been able to land a part-time coding job yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just give up on CS for now?  Any advice?

amios3,6,2019-02-02,I want someone to know,Jade_Elephant_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/amios3/i_want_someone_to_know/,"Hi, so...I'm a 22 year old female and I really need to tell someone about my life.  I don't have any friends and my family life is bad (I'll get to those later), I'm also not currently seeing a therapist so I don't have any place to talk.  I'm in a bad place right now and I feel so horribly alone.  I've never been able to really tell anyone about my problems and I'm filled with sadness and I'm just so tired.  So here goes, everything I've never been able to say:  


My life has been 22 years of misery.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a narcissist who emotionally and mentally abused and manipulated me for 20 years.  She raised me to believe that my father was evil and that they were constantly on the verge of divorce (they are still together) and financial ruin.  I grew up thinking it was my job to protect and take care of her.  She tried to get me to video tape my dad being mean to her and constantly made me come with her to prevent my father from arguing with her.  When I was little they got into huge explosive fights and she would come to me and smack talk my dad.  I 100% believed that he was evil and I was genuinely afraid of him.  She also made me fill his role as emotional support and my feelings were completely dependent on hers.  If she was upset it was my job to make her feel better.  I'd go as far as to say it was emotion incest.  Our relationship can be described as me being her parent, not the other way around.  Growing  up she constantly told me about her horrible childhood and life.  She had a bad mom and bad upbringing.  She plainly said that life was out to get her and that she was probably being punished for something she had done in a past life.  She also bemoaned her poor health and CONSTANTLY told me how sick and weak she felt.  She also discussed suicide with me and noted that she didn't think the human experience was worth anything and stuff like that.  On top of that, she told me that wanting social interaction or needing friends was a weakness and was for stupid people.  She has a war on religion and spits on any group no matter how giving and kind.  Everything is a big deal to her, she yells about almost anything.  Like one time someone didn't put lunch meat turkey away on the wrong shelf in the fridge and she completely lost her shit.  She started yelling and accosting everyone about who took the turkey.  When we'd go out in public she'd watch me from afar and then berate my demeanor.  She'd watch the news and then tell me about all the terrible stories she'd heard about even if I'd tell her to stop.  Because of her, I grew up to be incredibly cynical, self conscious and self critical.  I feel like she poisoned me.  I remember I was once a carefree little girl before she twisted me.  I feel like she tried to steal my childhood to replace the one she claims she never had.  

I was never liked in any of my schooling.  Elementary school was fine but in middle and high school I was treated like an ""other"".  Middle school was tough, one of my friends turned into a huge jackass and constantly attacked and ridiculed me about everything.  I eventually broke of the friendship but we reconciled in high school.  In middle school, for sex ed, the teacher told us a very graphic story about rape, which scared me for years.  I'd go home and cry for hours and get flashbacks of the terrible things he told us.  In high school I was treated like a freak.  Everyone in school acted like I was from another species and regarded me with suspicion.  I was always alone and constantly did projects by myself or had to embrace the humiliation of being picked last in gym (Even after the special ed kids) or asking the teacher to assign me a partner.  My friend group had once again become abusive and I left everyone behind upon junior year.  I honestly don't know what it's like to be welcome in school.  Even today, people look at me with expressions that say: ""Whats that doing here?""  I sometimes wonder what it would have been like to walk into class and not think that everyone hates you.  Once again, several of my classes discussed rape in horrifying detail.  for about a year I'd come home from school and cry in my room until it was bedtime.  The end of my high school career was filled with public crying and scorn. 

Now, I'm 22 and have recently graduate college.  Things are hard.  I haven't made any friends since high school, except for a few former work acquaintances.  I feel like I'm an alien that was left on this planet.  No one likes me.  I've never had a boy/girlfriend and no one has even said that I'm pretty or that they like me.  My complexion is horrible and won't clear up no matter what I try.  I have acne and red dots and acne scars.  My mom is still horrible.  She hasn't had a job in about 10 years and sits on the couch all day watching murder shows.  When I'm in my room I can hear women screaming and begging for mercy.  She constantly talks about how much work she does being a stay at home wife, despite the fact that all she does is the dishes and my dad and brothers laundry.  I'm the youngest of two and my brother has always been her favorite.  After he graduate college she pestered her relatives to give him a job, which one eventually did.  He still lives at home and she wakes him up in the morning, makes his bed and lunch, and cleans up after him.  He is her special boy who can do no wrong.  since moving back home, I've heard her talk to her relatives and my dad about me.  She complains that I haven't had an internship or job or that she ""doesn't know what is going on"" even though I constantly update her.  I'm also really tired because I take care of some farm animals and feral cats.  It's been crazy cold so I've been working overtime to take care of them all.  I think I have compassion fatigue.

&amp;#x200B;

so...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

My mom is a narcissist who has abused me for the last 20 years.  I've been and outcast my entire life and have frequently been publicly humiliated.  My middle and high school friends turned out to be jerks and did a number on my self esteem before I left them.  I've been without friends for about 6 years.  Since graduating college and being diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a bit of ocd, I don't have a therapist anymore, and am feeling really down with no one to turn to.  No matter how hard I try, I feel the darkness is always there.  It never goes away.  I'm always one bad day away from spiraling into a deep depression, and each one could be my last.  I feel the world is a horrible place filled with horrible people and that life and the human race is inherently insufferable and I don't  know if I can keep going.  Don't freakout, I'm not planning or threatening anything, but I often wonder what i would write in my note if I was planning suicide.  I don't think I could tell my family everything, they don't know about mom.  It would destroy everything, but I hate being the only one who has to sit with this.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.  Here's my sob story.  I know it probably comes off whiny, but I had to talk about it.  even if it is just a fraction of everything that's happened.  I'll take any kind words or advice.  Thanks for reading this far.

amiufj,18,2019-02-02,Unexplained migratory inflammatory reaction in a patient with severe sarcoidosis,gmshp,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/amiufj/unexplained_migratory_inflammatory_reaction_in_a/,"This is a patient I am currently following that I've been perplexed by, and my staff doesn't seem to have any better ideas than I do.

The patient is a 56 year old woman with a history of biopsy proven stage 4 pulmonary sarcoidosis (on 3 L baseline) who originally presented with what turned out to be a drug eruption, but has had an interesting course in the hospital characterized by a migratory inflammatory reaction which I cannot explain. She originally presented to her dentist January 8th complaining of tooth pain. He wrote for a course of clindamycin. After 4-5 days, she developed rash on her bilateral hands (sparing the palms). She called the dentist, and he switched her to amoxicillin. She took a few doses, but the rash got worse and progressed to involve her trunk, so she stopped. Wary of medication side effects generally, she started taking her prednisone (prescribed 10 mg daily, long term) more sporadically.

During this same period of time, she complained of decreased appetite, new onset dry cough, and severe malaise. She says she barely left her bed for a few days because she felt so weak. She also noticed swelling of her face and right breast, as well as decreased urine output despite large volume intake. No fevers, chills, night sweats, myalgias, arthralgias, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, recent travel, sick contacts, outdoors exposure, or pets.

Eventually, a relative who is a nurse persuaded her to seek care. Dermatology biopsied her as soon as she presented and we (medicine) admitted her. We checked daily CMPs and CBCs with differential (concerned for DRESS), which were basically unremarkable. LFTs were never elevated, no significant AKI, highest eosinophil count was 1000, which is right in the middle of our reference range. They started her on steroids, and the rash improved over the course of the next week or so. Final path on the biopsy was

&gt; Dermal telangiectasia, neutrophil vascular margination, interstitial eosinophils. These findings would be more compatible with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction including a drug eruption.  These are not the histologic features of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  These histologic features would militate against viral exanthem.  The histologic features of DRESS are variable so that clinical pathologic correlation will be necessary to exclude this entity.

Back to the migratory inflammatory reaction: On presentation, she had visibly asymmetric breasts, right larger than the left, mildly tender but no palpable masses, and mammography was read as

&gt; Bilateral skin and trabecular thickening with mild axillary adenopathy. These findings are compatible with a systemic etiology.

Hospital day 2, she developed submandibular swelling, which was also mildly tender. [Contrast CT neck](https://imgur.com/8JkgnBq) showed bilateral submandibular sialadenitis with inflammation of the overlying subcutaneous tissue, no abscess. This has since resolved.

Hospital day 4, she had hugely edematous left leg (to the thigh), tachycardia, and acute on chronic dyspnea. Venous duplex was negative for DVT, and CTA chest was negative for PE (I was shocked), but showed new right sided pleural effusion and small pericardial effusion. We have since been diuresing her. Initially, the leg got better, but then it seemed to get worse. Concerned for some other process impeding venous return, we got MRI venogram of the pelvis, which was normal. We have been aggressively diuresing her, and the leg seems a bit better today.

Some other aspects of the workup:

* She had elevated protein:creatinine ratio but negative urine dipstick for protein. UPEP showed mixed tubular and glomerular proteinuria consistent with chronic inflammation with no monoclonal spike.
* Free light chains both elevated, but ratio normal, and SPEP consistent with chronic inflammation.
* C3/C4 normal
* Anti-SSA/SSB: negative
* IgG4 level: 26 (ref. 1 - 123)
* ANA panel: negative
* Mumps antibody: negative
* EBV antibody: negative

I guess the diagnosis has to be explained by sarcoidosis, but the bilateral submandibular sialadenitis and enormously edematous left leg don't strike me as classic sarcoid, but then again I'm an intern. It just seems peculiar that she's having this apparently migratory inflammatory reaction (face by history, right breast, left leg, possibly right lung, and pericardium).

I have always been kind of depressed for whatever reason but i've never thought i had a real problem (until now) like my mother or my aunt who suffers from crippling depression. My girlfriend of 5 years left me in september because i was getting more and more apathetic and then i was ""friendzoned"" by another girl i started dating. After these two things happened my depression got worse day by day, to the point that now i can't  study beacuase i think about killing myself 24/7.
I have doubts about everithing.
I don't like the people i met at uni or during the internship and i think i started hating engineers (i know, it doesn't make any fucking sense).
I need help, i need to find a way to calm myself, study, graduate and fix my life.

It offers a 10 week starter course, you have to take it before training with the main group.

Next tuesday is the last training day of those 10 weeks and i will be tested on strenght, conditioning and technique for about 1.5 hours (!) If i fail i will have to do the 10 weeks again before retrying.

All i know for now is that we will be with about 5 trainees and 2 of the trainers, we will do more intense version of the drills and etc that we did before. At the end of the test we will go into the clubs' ring for the first time, against a trainer. We spar pretty light for now, so they'll ramp it up to get us used to more serious stuff before passing into the 'main' group.

I know my technique is good for now, atleast in the sense that i know the basics and can follow with what they ask from me.

The drills worry me in a way. I'm fit and can push myself far if i need to but I'm still afraid of gassing out. I'm currently in an internship (law school) and i will have had a full workday before going to the club for the test. At the start of the test i will already be awake for 10-11 hours. I can't exactly get a day off in my position, is there anything i can do to make me less likely to fail from exhaustion? Maybe diet or some preparation or warming up?

For the record, if my question sounds last minute, me and the rest of the people allowed to the test only learned of it last friday. 

From what i heard the test is very very rough and I'm doubting myself somewhat now from overthinking it.

EDIT: thanks for the advice, I'll update with my results this evening :)

EDIT2: I passed! basically we did continous drills and one by one some of us were picked to go into the ring. Things went suprisingly good, the only remark i got was that my left hook is slightly upward instead of downward. Thanks for the advice!"

amkj45,5,2019-02-02,Question for cat foster:,EmilyKochi,rescuecats,https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuecats/comments/amkj45/question_for_cat_foster/,"To simplify, my boyfriend and I are fostering some cats and we are struggling to get them adopted. I would like any advice so they have a better chance of getting loving homes. 

Backstory: Last Easter my boyfriend and I found 3 teeny tiny kittens living in the wall of our shared complex laundry room. We brought them inside and contacted a Cat Lounge nearby that adopts out their cats and the owner directed me to her rescue that she works with. They told me it was spring and they were at max capacity so they couldn‚Äôt take any more bottle babies. Either we put them out on the street, or in a shelter as weeks old babies. We agreed to foster in exchange for their free chip/spay/neuter services and getting on the adoption website + adoption events. They helped us catch the mom, who is very shy and aloof.

We‚Äôve had them for 10 months. Ended up adopting one of them. The other two are all black, one medium length, one long haired. I‚Äôve lost count of adoption events we‚Äôve gone to. Several people have shown interest but changed their mind to get a cat that wasn‚Äôt black. Breaks my heart.

My boyfriend and I are 21 and 20 in college in a teeny tiny shitty apartment. If they find out we have more than our 2 declared cats we‚Äôll get evicted. We can‚Äôt keep them forever, and we are moving to a new apartment in July which we definitely can‚Äôt sneak more cats in. 

We had thought about telling the rescue our situation and how we have done what we could but can‚Äôt keep 5 cats as poor full time college students with 2 part time jobs and an internship between us. I would hope they had room somewhere else. I would MUCH rather they get adopted than split up between fosters.

I post to Facebook, snapchat, Twitter every month or so, they‚Äôre on the adoption site, I take them to tons of petsmart and petco events. What else can I do? Do you guys have any suggestions?  I love them with all my heart and I want them to have families that love them. "
amkpqq,5,2019-02-02,Puddle Jumping (Chapter 2) [Fiction],AmazingLover96,DrCreepensVault,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/amkpqq/puddle_jumping_chapter_2_fiction/,"


The mysterious man hung up the phone after his quick briefing on this new drug. Who was he? How did he know me? Was he the one I stole the drug from? More questions than answers went through my head as I thought about this situation and the man more and more in depth. The phone began to vibrate again but this time I had a test message. It was from a guy named Brian.


‚ÄúHey baby,‚Äù it read. Suddenly I my whole body began to tingle and vibrate again. I then felt a shocking jolt of pain on the right side of my body as the spasm began to resurface. More and more memories came flooding back. Bob was a gay man and in the closet, he had me this Brian person on Grindr and had been having an on again off again affair behind his wife's back. To make matters worse, he was a minister at one of the biggest Megachurches in the state of California. I‚Äôm talking about the ones where every service is like a concert and the men of the cloth drive the latest cars and wear eight-hundred dollar suits to church every Sunday.

When the pain stopped, I realized the predicament he was in. I was not a religious man at all but I knew being branded gay among church people is very bad for your health. I figured I could help this man, I knew for a fact he wasn‚Äôt poor, but how much money did he have? Could he start a new life? Could I send myself some of his money? Greed and lust for money filled my mind as I raced out of the house and into my car. Which was a fancy black Lamborghini, I then drove to the nearest ATM to check my balance. Old Bob had a total of three point five million dollars in savings. In checking he had an even two million dollars. An evil smile ran across my face. I could drain this man's bank account and send the money to myself. But reality struck me like a brick when I realized that could be traced back to me if I used my main account.


I felt defeated, but I couldn‚Äôt use this situation as a ‚ÄúGet rich quick‚Äù scheme. Suddenly I was startled by the obnoxious sound of a man behind me laying on his car horn.


‚ÄúHEY POPS!!‚Äù the rude man shouted. ‚ÄúEither shit or get off the pot, I have to get some money ASAP!‚Äù


I canceled my transaction and went into the parking lot and waited for shit head to get his money. That is when I remembered the PayPal account me and my dad made when we had the idea of selling used worn panties and thongs. Yes, my dad and I were going to sell used panties so that we could pay for my nephew to go to Disney world for the first time. But I won‚Äôt bore you with that story. Luckily this man had a Paypal app on his phone, he was still logged into his PayPal account and there was seven-hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it. So I sent all of that money to my PayPal account.
A smile went across my face but I knew I couldn‚Äôt get greedy or there would be dire consequences. I know what your thinking, if I‚Äôm him and I‚Äôm sending this money to myself, then I wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble since it would look like a normal transaction. Well with the way technology is today, I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that when he turns back into him he could say I hacked his account or worse, he could hunt me down and kill me. When I switched back into my body I‚Äôd collect the money and delete the account. It‚Äôs foolproof, so I thought. I looked at the time on my phone and I realized it had been almost two hours since I was Bob. 

So that meant I only has twenty-two hours before I turned back into me. I decided that since I just took a huge sum of money from Bob, I could at least help him out with his predicament with being in the closet. So I called Brian and thought of a plan and thought of one fast.


‚ÄúHey baby,‚Äù he said in the most stereotypical flamboyant gay guy voice. ‚ÄúPerfect timing, I literally just went on my lunch break.‚Äù


‚ÄúLet‚Äôs run away together,‚Äù said.


‚ÄúWow,‚Äù he said taken aback. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt anything here for me. I‚Äôm just a lowly accountant, I‚Äôm too smart to just sit in front of a desk thinking about numbers and filling out paychecks. I got money, we can leave tonight, I‚Äôm telling you I just want us to start over somewhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright Bobby slow down. You have kids and a wife, you can‚Äôt just walk away from that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm gonna abandoned them, I will give it some time and explain it to my wife later.‚Äù


‚ÄúI see, you don‚Äôt want it to be so crazy when you come out to her,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou want to be able to exit the situation if need be.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I agreed.

‚ÄúLike when my parents would yell at me when I came to visit, I‚Äôd just leave. It wasn‚Äôt like when I lived with them.‚Äù


‚ÄúYeah so-

‚ÄúHere is my proposal, I say you come out to your wife and then when things get heated, because trust me they will. You drive over to my house and we go to my Uncle‚Äôs Cabin. So go home and pack your bags. I have to go, I‚Äôll call you later baby doll.‚Äù


With a nervous, I love you I hung up. Even though, I wasn‚Äôt going to be this man for a long time, I was still nervous for him. I was getting ready to come out to his wife for him and ultimately end is marriage. I wondered how this would affect his kids, more importantly his wife. Would she take his kids away? Would things end badly to the point they get physical? I was ripped from my questions by the realization that time was ticking. 

So I set an alarm on Bob's phone. I set the alarm for twenty-two hours. I then looked back at the ATM and Noticed it was available. So I drove up to it and with drew one-thousand dollars. After I went to the dollar store and picked up a birthday card, I then mailed the birthday card filled with cash to myself. Yes I know I sound like a greedy asshole but, I need money way more than Bob does.

After I went back to Bob‚Äôs house, I realized how boring this man's life really is. His interests are, listening to classical music, reading Marine Biology books. Eating Vegetables and watching Soap Operas. This man was boring as shit, but time flew by and when I looked at the timer again, I needed to act fast. I only had twelve hours left before the drug wore off, and Bob‚Äôs old lady still wasn‚Äôt home.

‚ÄúFor fuck sake,‚Äù I thought as I turned off the T.V.


I called Rachel to see where she was but she didn‚Äôt answer. Instead she responded via text message, letting me know she was pulling a double and wouldn‚Äôt be home until early the next morning. I didn‚Äôt have much time to help this dude, but I needed to act fast. I decided if it‚Äôs important that she know. I was going to write her a note. So I took a piece of printing paper and wrote down everything. I said how long Bob was gay how I had been with Brian, I confessed like a sinful Catholic. 

I left the note on the nightstand and called Brian. I told him that things got heated and I needed to leave fast. I packed some bags but before I could make it to the car, I began to feel light headed. My legs began to feel like jelly, to the point that I lost my footing. I fell forward and my vision began to blur. Within seconds, everything went black. 

When I woke up, I found myself back in my apartment. Weirdly, I felt refreshed as if I had a great night's rest. I looked at my phone and I had a ton of missed calls and texts. I smiled when I saw the Paypal notification saying the money came through. I then got a call from an Unknown number.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù asked the man on the other end. The voice was the same as before. But how did he get both numbers?


‚ÄúI feel fine,‚Äù I told him


‚ÄúGood, the first time usually isn‚Äôt pleasant but everybody is different. I can‚Äôt talk long but there is a blonde girl headed straight for your place right now. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the same one you nailed back at that party.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù I asked fearfully.

‚ÄúYou kinda stole her cell phone and she kinda has a tracking app on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I shouted.

‚ÄúI have to bounce, but be careful.‚Äù

He hung up and there was a sudden knock on my door.

I rushed over to the door and looked into the peephole. Sure enough it was the girl from the party.

I opened the door and was greeted with a slap in the face.


‚ÄúWell hello to you too,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúGive me my phone,‚Äù she demanded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what your-

‚ÄúYeah you do,‚Äù she said as she invited herself into my apartment.

‚ÄúSure come on in. Make yourself at home,‚Äù

‚ÄúCut the bullshit. Unless you want me to start screaming, I suggest you give me my phone and I‚Äôll go on my way.‚Äù


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my bedroom,‚Äù I said signaling for her to follow me.

‚ÄúSo do you remember anything from the party,‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúI remember dancing with you. I remember having my ass eaten out by a guy in a G-String. I remember having sex, so I made sure I took the morning after pill. Why am I talking to you I just need-


‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù she asked. I noticed that she was pointing to the bad of red tablets.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just heartburn meds,"" I said rushing towards my safe. I quickly entered the combination and took the phones out and laid them on the bed.

‚ÄúWhich one is yours?‚Äù I asked.


She grabbed one of the cell phones and put it in her pocket.


‚ÄúMy friend is outside,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou dodged a bullet sir, so next time think before you steal.‚Äù

I let out of my apartment and closed the door. I looked at my phone and found a voicemail from my boss. After listening to it, I realized I was fired from my internship. I also had some voicemails from potential customers looking for some drugs. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood, I wanted to be someone else again. But I was interrupted by another phone call from an unknown number.


‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said aggravated.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably wondering why, your drug didn‚Äôt outlast your timer,‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúWell you became Bob while he was asleep and he became someone else and thankfully not you. Before you pop another tablet, think about who you‚Äôll become next. You may not be able to steal money from this next person.‚Äù

I abruptly hung up on him. Was he watching me? Was he tracking me? The anxiety was overwhelming. I popped another tablet into my mouth and chewed it up and swallowed the remains. My body began to tingle and I once again fell into darkness. This time, I woke up in a bathroom stall somewhere. I had brown skin and I found a syringe needle jammed in left forearm. Like last time, the memories hit me, My name was Antonio Gonzalez, I was serving life plus one hundred years without parole for a quadruple homicide in a level four maximum security prison.

I was suddenly ripped into reality when I heard someone storm into the shower room shouting for Antonio.

&amp;#x200B;

Longgg time lurker, first time poster. I'm an 18 year old in my second year of college. I was diagnosed w/ BPD around the time I first started college (which explained soo many things), and I'm very fortunate to be doing DBT.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately everything has just felt so overwhelming and I feel like I'm not able to keep up with anything. I have classes and tutoring and clubs and internship applications and therapy and so many goals and aspirations and I just can't.  I don't do the work. I plan on having a productive good day and I just don't. Like right now, I planned on finishing up this paper but I'm just on Reddit instead. And I end up feeling like absolute shit about myself and the cycle keeps going on and on and I feel like I can't get out of it.

ammayy,2,2019-02-02,Recent IT graduate struggling to find a job due to lack of job experience.,JigglyRitz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ammayy/recent_it_graduate_struggling_to_find_a_job_due/,"**So here's some background on my situation:**

I currently live in Greenville SC, and I graduated with an Associates degree in Computer Technology in August of 2018. Since then, I have been working at Walmart to get by and pay my bills. I made a really dumb rookie mistake and picked an apartment that was out of my means (1100 per month with my roommate paying half), so I'm currently living paycheck to paycheck to afford rent along with my other bills until my lease expires. I also worked a brief 3 month internship doing front end web development for a private contractor during highschool. Almost every job that I've viewed in my area lists that it requires at least 3 years of experience in the field, which I obviously don't have.


**What I've tried so far:**

-I've applied to around 30+ jobs, and was contacted by only a couple. One of them seemed quite promising, but they ended up delaying the position, so I'm having to wait another month or so to hear back and find out if I'll be getting an in person interview. 

-I've had one interview, but they ended up going with a more experienced candidate.

-I've asked friends that work in the IT industry if they have positions open at their company (they currently do not, and will not for the foreseeable future). 

-I've tweaked my resume to make it more accurate and appealing.

**My Skills:**

-Computer Repair

-Computer Troubleshooting

-Basic Networking

-Microsoft Suite

-Basic coding knowledge, with more advanced knowledge of C#

-Advanced 3D modeling and texturing skills (Blender 3D &amp; Substance Painter)


So my question is: What options should I consider moving forward in my quest to find a career? I'm tired of hopping from one dead end job to the next, and I want something that will let me leverage the skills I've been building for all these years. Thank's in advance for any advice you guys might have!

ammqf0,12,2019-02-03,Advice on First NLP Project?,theMusicalGamer88,LanguageTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/ammqf0/advice_on_first_nlp_project/,"So, I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student currently at an internship as part of my schooling. My interest in languages only really took off after I finished taking two Spanish courses in high school and attempting to learn French (which I never actually did for the simple reason of I felt like I was torturing myself, but that's for a different thread/subreddit).

Anyways, I was looking for possible Masters programs to do (because why not) and as I was looking at opportunities in other countries, I found one that has a degree in Computational Lingustics. I then asked on r/linguistics if doing this was a feasible option, and figured that I could start a project in NLP to kickstart my learning in the field.

Problem is I don't know where to start. I've seen the various suggestions of chat bots and twitter mood identifiers, but I want to come up with something different to start with. I know I'm just starting out with NLP and deep learning, but I never like re-inventing the wheel.

About a year ago, I gained an interest in conlangs. Would it be possible to do some sort of project with NLP and a conlang (either an existing one or one I'm creating)? Or should I divert my efforts on this project to something related to natural languages?"
ammu2j,14,2019-02-03,I lost my best friend because she started dating our teacher.,UnitedEmperor,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/ammu2j/i_lost_my_best_friend_because_she_started_dating/,"This is a story I've been thinking about for a long time, as it's still something that bothers me to this day. The only major confessions in this story are that I never brought up their relationship to authorities and I can't seem to let go of my former best friend. I created this account specifically to share this story, since I can't share it anywhere else and thought it would help to vent. A lot of this might sound very unorganized, since it's late when I'm writing this. I also apologize if I share way too many details. It all seems important to me, and I'm not sure how to get rid of things that might not be. Most names have been changed or initialed to protect their identities. I still don't know what I want to do about them, but doing them harm by spreading their names on the internet is not one of the ideas.

Before I get into what happened with our teacher, I'd like to preface with just how close I was to my friend. I'll call her Amanda to preserve her identity. In middle school, I (14 at the time, M) shared a lot of classes with Amanda (15) and I noticed that we had a very similar music taste. We met in 7th when I saw her wearing a souvenir shirt of a concert we both went to. From the first day we started talking, you could tell we would have a perfect friendship. Similar to soulmates, I suppose. Platonic soulmates. We talked every single day for many hours for a year. Teachers would often comment that they never saw us separated. She was the friend I spilled every drop of middle school problems into, and I was the same for her. My mom met her current best friend in 7th grade, so I thought Amanda would be my best friend into my thirties. We were extremely close friends all throughout 7th grade year and the summer, where we would often spend the night at each other's houses for days in a row. This continued up into 8th grade year

Band was the main class we shared throughout middle school, and it ended up being the only class we shared in 8th grade. Music is an important thing in my life, and Amanda was particularly good at playing the trumpet, so we both really enjoyed that class. 8th grade band got even more interesting when we had two student teachers helping out our band director (Mr. P, 50-60ish?). I'll call the student teachers Mr. R(20?) and Mr. E (18). For the first semester, Mr. R was only there to get experience for his job, so he was mostly overshadowing Mr. E. Mr. E was very in-the-background and seemed very off-putting at first. Amanda and I talked about these student interns a bit, and I would joke about how all of the girls in the class thought Mr. R was cute. I noticed Amanda disagreed but said nothing more. Towards the end of the semester in November, Mr. R had to move on to an elementary school, leaving us with Mr. P and Mr. E.

My mom used to pick me up after school, and since her house was on the way, she would drop off Amanda, too. She was always about twenty minutes away from the school, so Amanda and I would always stay late after school. Rather than waiting outside in the cold, we would go and talk to some teachers. Most of the time, we would go to the band room to see Mr. P and Mr E. After Mr. R left, Mr. E seemed to loosen up and talked to us more and more. I noticed that Amanda would talk to him a lot more than I would and seemed really awkward or uncomfortable around him. I assumed this was because he still seemed sorta intimidating and moved on. After a few weeks of talking to Mr. P and E after school, Amanda texted me and told me she had a huge crush on Mr. E.

Naturally, I was very concerned and alarmed. A 14 year old doesn't have any business having that big of a crush on a teacher (a sorta weird looking one, too). She made it very clear to me that this wasn't a little crush. She expressed that she wished she could date him, etc. I got upset and told her many things, some of which being ""you can't have a crush on our teacher"", ""that would be illegal"", and ""he won't like you back, move on and don't disappoint yourself"". This made her very upset, and I noticed that as we moved into the later winter months and second semester, she began seeming depressed. We continued to visit Mr. P and Mr. E after school, her to see Mr. E and me just to talk about pursuing music as a career. Amanda continued to express her love for Mr. E, and I continued to swat it down.

Every single day until the end of the school year, we talked to Mr. P and E. I don't know how to explain our (PLATONIC) relationship with Mr. E at the time, since 'friends' might be a bit much, but it was something along those lines. Around the last few days of school, Amanda asked me to ask Mr. E for his instagram (since other band kids had already found it). Through there, she made me ask for his number. I gave it to her. On the last day of school, I wanted to prepare myself for freshman year and (I promise this is important) came out to all of my teachers as transgender (FTM). Mr. E was one of them, and he told me ""you trusting me enough to tell me that really struck a chord with me, that really solidified my decision to be a band director"". From that point on, Mr. E became someone I relied on for advice about transitioning in high school and how it would be in marching band (since he was in it). Talking to him so often about something that affected me so deeply as an impressionable young teenager is what established him as an important figure in my life, and why him and Amanda's scandal still troubles me.

Anyway, back to giving Amanda his phone number. We both texted him often, her way more than I did. I don't know what they talked about since they always kept it secretive, but they gradually became closer and closer. So close to the point where he would drive her places (including his house later on in their relationship) and her talking to him on a first name basis, Leon. In June, they both went to the local pride parade (without inviting me), since they both thought they were LGBT in some way (he thought he was mtf, she thought she was pan. Neither of those stayed). At that point in time, I still thought they were just close friends, despite seeing them constantly together on the snapchat map and her talking about him all the time. That changed when my friend, Bella, told me what happened when Amanda spent the night at her house.

Bella said the night went pretty well up until 3 am, when Amanda kept texting Leon and practically ignored Bella. It was either Leon or Amanda saying they wanted to talk to the other in person, I don't remember, not important. Whoever said it, Amanda ended up telling Bella that she needed to talk to Leon. Bella was annoyed, since it was their sleepover and late, but she said they could have 10 minutes. They talked for thirty minutes on their driveway before going for a walk. Amanda later told me that on their walk, she confessed her massive crush on Leon, and he said he had a huge crush on her. Which still baffles me.

From that point on, something was different between me, Amanda, and Leon. They would talk to each other way more often than they would talk to me, and if they spoke to me, they were short responses and slightly rude. Regardless, I invited Amanda and Bella to my birthday party at a large local pool. We had to stop by Amanda's house so she could get some things, and while she was upstairs, she left her phone face-up on the floor. I saw a text from Leon saying something like ""I love youuu \[heart emoji\]. I was pretty livid, since she's still 15 and he's still 19. I confronted her about this and she got very defensive, saying things like ""it's none of your business"". I let it go because it was my birthday and I was trying to have a good time. While we were in the car, she was texting Leon. I was angry and nosey, so I looked over her shoulder. She told Leon I had found out about their secret relationship and he seemed like he was losing his mind. He was typing in all caps, freaking out and calling me things like ""nosey little bitch"", ""so fucking annoying"". This practically ruined my day, because Leon up until that point was someone 14-year-old-me still looked up to as a musical genius and inspiration. 

As summer went on, Amanda and Leon started to despise me. They saw me as someone who knew all about their dirty secret and how I could easily turn to the police. I can't go much into what they were like, but they became the most toxic-borderline-abusive people I've met in my life. They were both the only people I talked to and they knew that, so they began to berate me and fill my head with lies about myself that, up until a few months ago, I believed. To this day, I still have trouble truly trusting my close friends now. Leon and Amanda made me learn to read small changes in text messages (Okay vs. Ok, Sorry vs. I'm Sorry, Hi vs. Hello, etc) and interpret them in negative ways. I'm still constantly asking my close friends if I'm upsetting or bothering them out of habit from Leon and Amanda.

Anyway, I don't speak to Amanda or Leon much anymore since Leon is in college and Amanda found some new friends who are 'more supportive' than I am about their relationship. I spoke to Amanda recently, saying something petty like 'You and Leon better chill on Valentine's Day' to which she replied 'it's none of your business'. I haven't spoken to any authorities or anyone about their relationship, since Amanda is a bit unstable and heavily reliant on him and Leon's promising life would be ruined by a dumb mistake he might realize he's making.

I also haven't snitched because I'm still thinking about what Amanda and I used to be. I grieve for our old friendship and some part of me still believes we could still have that back, even though Leon completely shattered that. I've found some new friends who are supportive and know about what happened and I've been much happier, but I don't think anything can match what Amanda and I had in middle school. I'll always miss what that could've turned out to be. Leon and Amanda are both toxic and messing with each other in damaging ways neither of them can see because of their 'true love'. They're still together today.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My closest friend I've ever had started dating our former teacher and became extremely toxic-borderline-abusive towards me for knowing about it and telling them it was wrong to be together. I can't snitch on them out of fear of ruining former teacher's promising life and of my closest friend doing irrational things.

amnh3t,0,2019-02-03,Have a few job interviews in Miranda and north Sydney in the next few weeks but i feel sort of worried because of my ethnic background,choleravibrio,sydney,https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/amnh3t/have_a_few_job_interviews_in_miranda_and_north/,"I can easily fake my confidence. 

I know confidence is cool and people are usually drawn to my character. 

I've worked most of my life in Western Sydney and the CBD. you guessed it ... I'm a Lebanese girl and I wear a scarf around my face. The industry I'm settling into is between health-corporate so it's still dominated by white-Australians and Indians.  I've worked with Anglo's, Maltese, Italians and Greeks and always found them easy to work with but usually they come down to the West. But working out of Western Sydney is .. and I've never felt scared or unwanted but I already feel like the whole population up there hates me because of who I am. I've done alot of online work for clients out and many of them (ages 45+) invited me to private dinners at their home, but I just ... felt already like an outsider and ignored those requests. 

Most CBD interviews were bloody intense because I remember the interviewer putting me down and just trying to break me. I've had sessions were phD students tried to humiliate me infront of people and they thought, ""she's the dumb illiterate girl from Western Sydney"" and I just ignored it. 

But the whole Cronulla riots outbreak in 2005 really played with me when I was a kid and I lied for years that I wasn't Lebanese because of the stereotype associated with it. people would either assume I was either Turkish, Russian or Bosnian and I just went with it. 

I feel like as soon as the firm meets me they will immediately be turned off.

I feel like younger people, my age, 22, or just a little younger and older are easier to vibe with. I've had a few interns from Chatswood, Coogee and Bondi come down to Western Sydney and love the area but it's because none of us really care here who comes down. 

I dunno, so my question is, are people up in North Sydney and closer up in Miranda and Cronulla, what's your outlook? 

Ima try anyway. "

But I can't help but think how an intimate relationship with you would be. If only you were Bi or Gay, I would love to spend the rest of my life with you. You are perfect. Your personality. Your looks. Everything. I enjoy living with you, and you make me happy. I love hearing about how your day went, or what exciting things are coming up with your internship search / research / school work / etc. I cherish you, and I want only the best for you. You deserve all the good things in the world, and you deserve to be happy. Having been close with you the past two years, I really don't want to continue life without you. You've become my best friend and I would hate to grow distant once I start working full time this summer. While I can't be with you in an intimate capacity, I will do whatever I can to be the best friend that I can be for you. I want you to be happy. I love you with all of my heart, Mike, and I will always support you. You've helped me so much by staying with me these past couple years, and you've helped me become a better person.

I am looking for a detailed female rp with little to no limits for an abusive roleplay including domination from my side.. I love the rps do be as detailed as possible, and for thwm to be in first person(i am fone with you writing in third too, if its absolutely necessary, and me being in first) The few scenarios i was thinking are: 

1)We are newly in a relationship and you are invited to my home for the first time. Thats when you meet my dominating side for the first time, with me turning you into my plaything either forcefully or in agreement

2)A masterxslave rp, where i play a dom character. This can be as flexible as you want, from us being in a relation, you bring forced or any other form of roles . It's open to discussion 

3)The wrath of a God: This one is a bit more creative and will take place in ancient Egypt. Your character can be Cleopatra, or any other persone you would like who is celebrated for her beauty. However, this beauty was a gift from the God Anubis, in order to spread his word. But since you used your beauty to be wrongfully know as a God, you will have to fave punishment 

4)A stalker rp. I have a few too many ideas which can play out on this. If you are into perverted man stalking on you, let me know your kinks and limits and will base this scene on it

5)You are a celebrity of your choice (can be anyone, ranging from actresses, singers and youtubers, like Madelaine Petsch, Emma Watson/Stone, Adriana Grande etc) and i am a renowned photographer who knows how to take advantage of the situation. I use you after luring you to take your steamy pics 

6)You are an intern under my command. I make sure to get you to work for me fully and slowly start showing my pervertedness by just touching you inappropriately at first but then taking complete control of your body 

Your rp ideas are welcome too if you want to do so. Just let me know. Also i am pretty adaptive too so I can accept many kinks and limits.

Also, i am pretty chill about taking breaks in between the rp if you like the same outside of our rp chat

Hope to hear from you soon! Kik: sokomodokomo"

I am a 22 year old college senior, fortunate enough to have worked in a few Computer Networking internships in my three college summers. When I was a 20, my first boss detailed a great conservative saving strategy: start a Roth IRA young, contribute every year, and when I work full time contribute to my company's 401k. I did my basic research, understood the compounding affect of the Roth IRA, and invested the max $5500 July of 2017. 

My boss suggested this split for the $5500:

50% VOO (VANGUARD S&amp;P 500 INDEX ETF) - 11.267 shares

25% VEA (VANGUARD FTSE DEVELOPED MKTS ) - 30.91 shares

25% VWO (VANGUARD FTSE EMERGING MARKETS ETF) - 32.86 shares

I was unable to contribute in 2018 due to school tuition, but landed a full time job in the Silicon Valley and can look to continue to contribute this year.

However, I checked my Roth IRA for the first time in a long time, and saw my early gains had diminished to a net - .8% loss over the span of 18 months. 

My questions:

1. Should I trust the compounding affect of the Roth IRA even if performance in the upcoming years continues to be marginally down?

2. When is the best time to contribute in a year. Having all stocks, I understand its based off the market performance, but when would one be best to invest in this fiscal year?

3. Should I continue to invest with this split?

Let me know if you have any thoughts, I appreciate any and all advice. I am always open to absorbing information and advice.

Thank you for reading!

In the video, the company brings an fashion designer intern into the office for a day. The guy arrives with zero knowledge of computers. He starts wiping the keyboard, saying that it would remove the virus. He decorates his PC. He brings a puppy named Nigel to the workspace who needs cleaning up and creates a havoc in the office. Towards the end, the designer goes in a heated argument with other employees and starts cursing. Eventually he throws tantrums and is on the floor. While this is happening, the IT manager (whose idea it was to bring a designer intern) talks about how he regrets his choice. This scene is shot like Office (UK) style where there chaos in the background while the manager is talking calmly to the audience.

On PC, it is plagued by gamebreaking technical bugs and Ubisoft seems to be unwilling or unable to something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Previously, i was affected by the RTX loadout screen crash. Fixed that with workarounds from the community (Ubisoft ignored it for months and then endlessly 'investigated'. I just hope the poor intern who apparently is solely responsible for bugfixing isn't totally overworked.). Then the game ran pretty much perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Soon after, GRW suddenly was stuck at the start loading screen. Fixed that by running eacsetup. Afterwards the game started again, but there now was stuttering when flying, then sudden total game freeezes with no error message. Also seems to be a rather common problem which is forever being investigated.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point, i was fed up and uninstalled. Ubisoft should be ashamed for their low to no effort technical maintenance of this game which they are still selling at a pretty substantial price. Buyer beware! In its current state, GRW on PC is apparently somewhat of a lottery, it might run well, but it also could be a total shitshow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**DEATH IN THE FAMILY.**

&amp;#x200B;

We start out in black. True darkness. No light surrounds the place. Nothing but pure, disturbing, empty and total blackness‚Ä¶.. Then. Out of the darkness, out of the black, out of the shadows comes a voice. Eerie, disturbing, erratic and deep.

‚ÄúWakey wakey, pretty bird.‚Äù

A grey light springs from a swinging light bulb. It swings, swings, swings and swings. Its light, unstable, drapes the room, a run down warehouse full of crates, full of masks, full of weapons, knives, guns. It‚Äôs also full of messages on the broken walls. Written in red, the largest one says:

But the unstable light is also shed on the equally unstable creature‚Ä¶. The man‚Ä¶.. The man in the purple suit. The man who laughs. He‚Äôs laughing. He‚Äôs grinning. His face is facing down. His dark, greenish hair visibly messy and uncoordinated. He faces up. His pale, pastier than toothpaste face. He looks, with his bright, pale and lifeless blue eyes‚Ä¶. He looks at his prey. He is the JOKER. His red lips lift up and he begins to speak‚Ä¶. He speaks at his prey. This unstable predator talks to his prey. A young, dashing and beautiful boy. A boy, in a red and green suit. His name? Jason Todd. ROBIN. His legs and arms bound, standing up right, barely awake. His nose and his lip bleeding.

Joker: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, baby boy?‚Äù He says, in a curious tone.

Robin: ‚Äú‚Ä¶. W-w-what the hell?... Where am i?‚Äù Jason says.

Joker: ‚ÄúIs it really the best question to ask yourself, my adorable audience member?‚Äù He says, coming closer, with a joyful and jumpy stance.

Robin: ‚Äú‚Ä¶. You‚Ä¶. Joker. Let me go, you bastard! LET ME OUT!‚Äù Jason springs back to life and tries to move off the bonds tying him down.

Joker: ‚ÄúDarn, bird boy. You‚Äôre even more jumpy than the last boy wonder. Sheesh!‚Äù He then starts chuckling. ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, I always liked you little helpers of the Bat. Because you‚Äôre just so tiny and squirmy! Just the kind of public I like to entertain!‚Äù

Robin: ‚ÄúWhat do you want from you, you clown reject‚Äù

Joker stops chuckling‚Ä¶. He goes white, ironically. Jason stares, defiantly‚Ä¶ Joker takes his glove off, a light smirk on his face. He SLAPS the boy, hard. Jason spits out blood. Joker wipes it away and tastes it.

Joker: ‚ÄúWhat do I want? Hmmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù He puts his hand on his chin. He moves closer to the little boy. ‚ÄúI want to make the Bat‚Ä¶. SCREAM!‚Äù

Jason breathes heavily, stressed, creeped out and trembling. The Joker notices it. He moves slowly from his ear, side-eying him and he DARTS OUT, at the speed of light, right in front of Jason‚Äòs face, while looking at him in a faux compassionate look.

Joker: ‚ÄúAwww‚Ä¶.. Are you scared?‚Äù

Robin: ‚Äú‚Ä¶. No.‚Äù He says, his voice cold, avoiding the creature‚Äôs uncomfortable gaze.

The clown slowly moves closer and says, while brushing his hand through the child‚Äôs brown, smooth big hair:

Joker: ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Then, the Joker moves away fast from the boy and goes to a door at the end of the room and knocks. It opens. Jason sees nothing but darkness. Darkness‚Ä¶.. Then, out of the dark, 6 husky men, mutilated, in ripped up straight-jackets and clown masks come out. The Joker nods comically at them, as they move towards the table to fetch baseball bats, knives and other weapons. Jason looks in fear and in shock. Breathing heavily. The Joker longingly stares at him, and says in an eerily calm voice:

Joker: ‚Äú‚Ä¶. Ya should be‚Ä¶.. BOYS! Have as much fun with him as you want!‚Äù He said, as he took a chair from a corner and grabbed a bucket of popcorn nearby.

Time stops. Jason tries again and again to break free. He tries so hard to get free from the contraption hoisting him up.

One of the men approaches Jason, he runs and runs and runs and runs towards him. He holds his baseball bat back and then swings for Jason‚Äôs chest, scaring his suit. Jason coughs, and coughs. Joker‚Äôs laughing. The man in purple eats popcorn while watching Robin getting mauled. The husky man relentlessly pounds away at the child, right hooks, left hooks and steel bar shots. They kick him, they punch him, they spit on him and beat him. Jason is hit in the stomach and the throat repeatedly by the man, as Joker sings ‚ÄúThe Pretty Birdy will SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM! I scream, YOU SCREAM HAHAHAHA!!!! Ahhh, the FUN we‚Äôre having, baby birdie‚Äù. He always sings, smiles and laughs while the child bleeds. The light bulb still swinging, unstable, and unrelenting, much like the men‚Äôs abuse of Jason. Now, all six are hitting him, with their weapons, making Jason bleed. One man rams a knife into his leg, and Jason screams in pain. The man TWISTS the knife even further and deeper into the flesh of Jason. Joker keeps singing about screams. One man punches his face multiple times, making Jason‚Äôs ears, his eyes bleed. The men are SCREAMING and YELLING and DROOLING like animals at the sight of the bloody child being battered. They love every second of it, and so does the Joker. They break his arms, as he yells in pain. One man, clocks a gun and shoots Jason‚Äôs knee. The hammer falls, and the shell of the bullet slowly falls on the pool of blood covering the warehouse‚Äôs floor.

Jason: ‚ÄúP-p-please, stop! Please!‚Äù He begs, his voice broken by all the hits he suffered. His nose bleeding, the fresh bruises on his face so apparent that you‚Äôd choke up at the mere sight of them.

Jason begins crying, weeping and screaming. His arms dangle in shock, as do his legs. One psycho beats him on the head with a bar. He breathes heavily. The Joker stops laughing and snorting. He gets up and shoots all six men right in the head. He looks at Jason. He goes up to him. He takes a knife out of his suit and cuts the ropes holding Jason. Robin falls down to the floor, hard. On the verge of death. Blood streaming down his face, like a fountain. The wounds of the flesh, and of the suit, symbolic of his youth. He was violated.

Joker: ‚ÄúGo join your little Bat. You‚Äôre free to go.‚Äù

Jason barely able to turn his head, looks at the Joker. He then tries to crawl, his trembling and spent body barely able to move. He beings moving more and more. The Joker, standing behind him‚Ä¶.. But then, while Jason attempts to escape, Joker beings grinning. He then cackles like a mad man and picks up a crowbar from the warm corpse of one of his henchmen. He even pokes the inside of the man‚Äôs head and its grey matter with the crowbar for five seconds, laughing while he does. He then slowly walks, faster than Jason, who‚Äôs breathing heavily, struggling for life. Jason moans, his breath his coarse, rough and animalistic. The Joker, slowly advancing, catching up to Jason, laughing while he does. He arrives to Jason and violently turns him around on his back.

Joker: ‚ÄúHehehe..... I was KIDDING with you! Jeez, audience members really don‚Äôt like to stay for the full show. Those were just my animal showcase. Now, get ready for the main attraction!‚Äù

Jason mutters unrecognizable words, and makes inhuman noises, as a response to Joker‚Äôs words.

Joker: ‚ÄúUhhh, a little louder, lam-chop! I think you might have a collapsed lung, It does impede the auditory.‚Äù He cackles at the sounds of the dying child.

Jason, defiant as before, spits in the face of the clown. Joker is enraged and grabs the boy by the hair, pulling him to a corner.

Joker: ‚ÄúNow, that was RUDE! The first Boy Blunder had some manners‚Ä¶. I think a lesson needs to be taught in order for you to follow in his footsteps more effectively‚Ä¶.. Hmmm, nah, that's a bit too humane. I think i‚Äôll just keep beating you with this crowbar.‚Äù

Joker raises the bar in the air, and brings it back down. Again and again. Up and Down. Up and Down. Up and Down‚Ä¶. Up and down, the crowbar goes. Jason‚Äôs eye lids go up and down. His vision of the world fading, as each crowbar shot amplify his pain. The devil laughs, as he batters and angel, with perverse satisfaction‚Ä¶. Jason has had one thought that kept him alive for this whole massacre. ‚ÄúBruce is coming‚Ä¶. He is coming‚Ä¶. Please, god, help me, Bruce. Help me.‚Äù

In the dark of the Gotham, in the rage of the night, the thunderstorm, the lightning of our world prepares to blow into the ground. A roar, a primal, yet clear roar is heard. Then, we see something. Out of the shadows, comes a creature. A man. The BATMAN. On his vehicle. His black horse. His Batmobile. The engine of the primal machine roars. In the cockpit, we see the creature of the night. Enraged, his eyes red with pure hatred. His gloved palms clenching the steering wheel of his car. Steady, yet unbalanced. The only hit of light covering the creature‚Äôs face is the red interface of his vehicle. His eyes welling up with tears. The engine roars as the wheels accelerate in the dirt and mud of the ground. The moon light being covered by the clouds. Everything is black. There Is only darkness. Rage. Pure rage.

‚ÄúHe is here, boss!‚Äù

Joker: ‚ÄúGood. Bring him some company, boys!‚Äù He says, on the end of a phone. He then throws it on the floor. He gives one last lingering look at the boy below him? He towers over the mutilated child. Bloody and beaten. He throws the phone to the floor, like garbage. He goes to his table, looking at Jason‚Äôs suit.

Joker: ‚ÄúMy, my! Your suit is filthier than that old bastard's head after i shot in front of your boss, the last time we met. Ah, good times. Anyways, let's get to the point, baby bird: You need to get your uniform fixed.‚Äù

He grabs a yellowish can of spray, and advances towards Jason‚Äôs broken body.

Joker: ‚ÄúIn the mean-time, here‚Äôs a temporary fix!‚Äù

The Joker snatches the lid of the can and launches it behind him. He then presses, chuckling and grinning while doing so. He baptizes Jason. The words of his laugh. The words of his madness. The words of his disturbing mind clouding the Boy Wonder‚Äôs suit‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúHAHAHAHA!! Joke‚Äôs on YOU, BATMAN!‚Äù.

Joker: ‚ÄúAhhhh, GOOD AS NEW! Hehehe.‚Äù He then lets go of the can, as it falls on the floor.

Jason‚Äôs POV:

It‚Äôs blurry, it‚Äôs all red, everything is numb, every move is painful, every breath is a chore and a mix of tears. His ears are burning. When the creature speaks, he ears a distorted voice, ringing in his ears.

‚ÄúWell, young man, it‚Äôs been VERY fun, but i'm running late and I have copter to catch!.... And to blow up, kinda the same way I‚Äôm going to blow up this seedy place, hehe. Anyways, brush your teeth, and go to bed before 9.‚Äù He says in a fatherly tone, as he puts his jacket on, and goes close to the door. ‚ÄúOh! Almost forgot‚Ä¶‚Äù His tone changes. He becomes cold and maniacal. ‚ÄúIn case you survive, which isn't likely: Tell the BIG man that I said HI!‚Äù. He leaves. Leaving Jason, bleeding in the dark. His pale blue eyes closed. He is left in darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

Alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Batman arrives to the warehouse. His mechanical steed stops, and he darts out of the doors. He lands on the cold winter snow, as the walks, towering over everything. His cape flaps in the cold and powerful wind, but he remains steady and focused on his mission. A light, then shines upon his tall and enraged figure. A dozen gangsters with knives arrive to try and distract him. He runs head first into them, shatters them to bits. One tries to stab him in the chest and is met with a violent right hand, breaking his nose. The Bat then grabs his arm and twists it like a piece of weak wood, and throws him onto another weakling. The Bat gives no care who‚Äôs in his way. He breaks bones, paralyzes and mauls his enemies. Two men attempt to assault him and the creature of the night blocks their attacks, breaks both their legs, angrily kicking one‚Äôs kneecap, breaking it, and stabbing the other one‚Äôs fibula with the other animal‚Äôs knife. He grunts, and screams with pure hatred and rage. It‚Äôs a MASSACRE! The man in black mutilates his enemies. One attempts to punch him and receives the Bat‚Äôs hands on his throat, lifting him up. The Bat holds up the pathetic, trembling criminal and asks him, with his demonic, inhuman voice:

Batman: ‚ÄúWhere is he!? You will tell me, or I‚Äôm going to break every bone in your worthless body! Do you understand!?‚Äù

The crook tells him the boy‚Äôs in the warehouse behind him. Bruce the punches the worm of a man to the ground, as if he were but a sack of meat. The crook is on the floor, crying like a child, like most of his partners. Weeping, bleeding and aching on the ground. Then, a sound spawns out of the blue. A sound of movement, of instability. A chopper, taking off. It goes above The Bat. And while the light still shines upon him, the Bat witnesses the darkest of the darkest, in the helicopter, the loud sound of the metal wings cannot distract him from the sight of his true enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bat and the Clown. The Clown yells:

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúDARLING! HOW GOOD OF YOU TO SHOW UP! I'LL SKIP ALL THE VILLAIN/HERO MONOLOGUES! ALL I'LL SAY IS: THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP TO YOUR DEATH, BATSY!‚Äù

The clown always loved Batman. He HATED the concept. He hated what he stood for. He hated him. But he loved what he saw, deep inside. The madness. Bruce knows this. In that night, the drift between Bruce and Batman finally and absolutely comes to life.

The Bat catches something. He sees something in the Clown‚Äôs hands. A device. A detonator. The Bat realizes. He figures it out. Even before knowing it logically, his heart knew it. Fire. It was fire. The warehouse, made of bricks, the hardness of the material, the solidity. The crates outside of the warehouse. It becomes obvious. As The Clown bathes in the red lights of the intern part of the chopper, he yells:

Joker: ‚ÄúBOOM! HAHAHAHAHAH!‚Äù

He laughs‚Ä¶.. He laughs and laughs. Bruce realizes his friend, his partner, his family‚Ä¶. His SON is in this building‚Ä¶. In that moment, time stops. Bruce runs, and runs and runs faster and faster, his muscles trembling, as he runs, he is shaking, his eyes wide open. The cold and powerful wind doesn‚Äôt even register with his body. He runs. The metallic wings, the laugh and the thought of his son‚Äôs brunt corpses are the only things that register with him. He only thinks about one thing. Jason.

Time stops for Jason too, he can‚Äôt breathe. He thinks about getting out, about dying. Every thought, muddled up. He knows the place will blow up. He feels like nobody‚Äôs coming. He takes one last breath. He only thinks about the life he had, the friends he had, his family. And he thinks about how alone he truly is, right now. How he‚Äôs really always been alone.

Back to the helicopter, then sound of the metallic wings muffling the Clown‚Äôs laugh. The detonator in its gloved hand. He laughs, he laughs and laughs and laughs‚Ä¶. He presses.

Batman: ‚ÄúJASON!‚Äù He screams at the top of his lungs. His son is alone in there.

Jason, he hears a noise. A beep. A machinery clocking its gears. He knows he‚Äôs gone. He‚Äôs alone.

It goes off. The light, the fire, it all crashes down upon Jason. The bomb blows up. Bruce is a few feet from the warehouse. He‚Äôs too late. So late. It crashes down. It crashes down. The bricks, the fire, the metal. Everything. It all crashes down and flies everywhere. It hits Bruce and the pieces of metal scratch his cape that he uses to deflect any debris. Smoke, ashes and fire fly around. The Bat is shrouded in light‚Ä¶ He loses his balance because of the impact. He falls, he is pushed backwards into the cold snow. The blinding light fades. He sees fire. He sees death. He screams. He screams. Bruce screams. The Bat screams. Looking at the fire. He springs back on his legs quickly and runs towards the flames and the rubble. The smoke films the air, the thunders in the distance hitting the snow mountain tops. The Bat runs and runs and arrives in the flames. In the rubble. It‚Äôs a maze of destruction, of fire and rage. Bruce shouts the name of his son. Again and again. He lifts wooden and steel chunks off the ground, he moves to the right, to the left, front and back, erratically. He falls. His world is upside down. The mere thought of having lost his son petrifies his heart and turns it to ice, no matter the devilish warmth of the fire. He gets up and runs, again and again. He shouts his son, his friend, his partner‚Äôs name. Again and again. He sweats, the flames growing in power, he runs and runs, his limbs unbothered by the heat or the cold‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Then‚Ä¶. He finds something. Among the orange and hellish hues of the warehouse‚Äôs corpse, among the wood, the brick and ashes, the black and brunt ground, there lies a streak‚Ä¶. Of blood. Bruce looks down upon it. As If he‚Äôs looking at the corpse of his parents. Bruce lost everything. Martha, Thomas‚Ä¶. His world. And now, one of the only things he has left that is close to a family is reduced to a streak of blood. Bruce flashes back. The hammer falls, the shell hits the ground and his world is dead‚Ä¶.. He looks how far the streak extends‚Ä¶. A pile of bricks. He looks at it. He is in pure fear. He is now an 8 year old boy, again. It flashes back in forth with reality. The grin of the purple man, his laugh echoing through Bruce‚Äôs head‚Ä¶. And the hammer. The gun. The death. The pile of bricks and smoke and fire tower over Bruce. Two bowls of fire at his right and his left. He is surrounded by fire. By rage‚Ä¶.. He RUNS! He runs to the bricks, breathless, in fear, he is afraid. He lifts the bricks, the rubble, the wood, he breaks everything in his way. He tries desperately to uncover what‚Äôs behind that fort of dirt, blood and misery. He lifts and throws and throws and throws. And he finds him. The boy. The son. The blood‚Ä¶.. Jason. Lying on the ground, bloody, beaten, spent, and vandalized. He sees his son. Bleeding, his skin covered in blood and is slightly charred in some parts. He is gone. Bruce knows. He cries. He weeps while standing over the corpse of his son. He sees his greatest failure. He sees his parents‚Ä¶. He sees his boy, taken away from him. He crouches down, guttural noises fill his throat, he cries and cries‚Ä¶. Bruce takes off his cowl. He takes the corpses of his son and lifts him, still on his knees. The only string of words he can put together in his mind are:

‚ÄúMy partner‚Ä¶ My son‚Ä¶. My fault.‚Äù

The Clown won. That damned Clown. He won. IT won. He took the core of Batman, his heart and massacred it. Bruce remains silent. Weeping over the corpse of his son. The fire surrounding him. The smoke, the embers, the blood, the death. This is how it happened. This is how the Batman died. The only thing that can be heard is the laugh‚Ä¶. The laughter‚Ä¶.. Laughter and rage. Bruce is carrying his son, the mountain tops, the snow, as cold as Bruce‚Äôs heart and the loss he feels. The embers and the fires, as firey as Bruce‚Äôs rage. The broken warehouse, that palace of death, as broken as Bruce‚Äôs soul. Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare: The lone and level snow and fire stretch far away. Words of Percy Bysshe. It is a poem about how we, and our legacy, are all forgotten, destroyed and beaten in the end‚Ä¶. But is it the legacy Joker gave Jason? To be beaten, broken and destroyed? Is it his triumph?.... It is. It is his work. His name is the Clown Prince of Crime. Look on his works, ye mighty‚Ä¶.. And despair‚Ä¶ Cry‚Ä¶. Weep‚Ä¶. Despair. And so, Bruce despairs. Crying, holding his son, as the winds and the cold of the night, as the fire and embers sting his skin. Bruce dies twice‚Ä¶. His path to happiness is truly dead‚Ä¶. His path to madness begins. The Clown laughs. The Bat screams in the dark, alone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Alone.

ampkq6,10,2019-02-03,I feel like stress is slowing destroying my body,4chanOverReddit96,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ampkq6/i_feel_like_stress_is_slowing_destroying_my_body/,"Last year was one of the most stressful times of my life. I had just transferred to my current school and was coming off a semester where I failed a class and felt like a total failure. I knew that I had to absolutely nail this semester or else risk potentially getting kicked out of my college. I started to lose tons and tons of hair whenever I showered or when I was sleeping. It was terrifying and I really thought that I was going to go bald.

Now, the stress is still there just in other areas. I'm trying to get internships and it's so hard because I truly feel like I'm just a bunch of good but not great. I don't stand out so people who do will obviously get chosen over me. The way I speak probably turns people off too and this definitely is linked to my Asperger's. I have no actual support to help me through dealing with Asperger's besides a therapist I have very limited contact with. So here I am, now starting to see tons of eye floaters and at points wishing that I was not alive.

I really just don't know what to say at this point..... My family is a completely dysfunctional, I have no contact with my father, and I feel like with my friends at college that they see me as a pity friend and not someone who they really enjoy to have around. 

I hate everything about my life right now and I absolutely despise how I have NO ONE I can talk to about any of this....."
ampzpw,3,2019-02-03,Moving to luxembourg as a student,WorkingRock,Luxembourg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Luxembourg/comments/ampzpw/moving_to_luxembourg_as_a_student/,"Hello!

I'm a student from France about to start an internship in spring in Luxembourg and I was looking at places to rent in [immotop.lu](https://immotop.lu). I'm trying to avoid luxembourg city, not necessarily because it's expensive - I actually find it reasonable when compared to rent in smaller city like ettelbruck where price are only a tad cheaper - but because I won't be working around the city and I'm trying to shorten my commute as much as possible. 

I've never had to rent an actual place on my own in France, let alone abroad, so I have a few questions. How soon should I start contacting people ? one month, two months ahead ? Should I contact them in french or in english ? Is there any papers or any other things I should have ready ? Any specific thing I should consider before renting something in Luxembourg ? 

Thanks"
ampzwa,1,2019-02-03,"Don‚Äôt know if I should quit job or not, advice please!",mad_dog24,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ampzwa/dont_know_if_i_should_quit_job_or_not_advice/,"I started this job in December. It‚Äôs my first job out of college and I am struggling.

My job is working at a center within a university to recruit interns, basically I‚Äôm in charge of their entire internship program. It‚Äôs a big honor but also a huge responsibility that I don‚Äôt think I was ready for.

My job is a VERY social job that isn‚Äôt very structured and I am very overwhelmed all the time. I‚Äôve never been in charge of anything, so to take all of these responsibilities on at once was just too much. I‚Äôve had so many mental breakdowns I can‚Äôt even count. I‚Äôm having one right now as I type this. It‚Äôs Sunday and just the thought of going back to work tomorrow is enough to make me cry.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma. I don‚Äôt know if I should quit or not. 

Here are the reasons why I think I should quit:
- It‚Äôs too overwhelming and stressful, I cry at least a few times a week
- it‚Äôs taking away from my schoolwork (I‚Äôm a masters student)
- in my performance reviews my boss says I‚Äôm doing okay but not great. So she sees that I am struggling. I have told her this but not to it‚Äôs fullest extent, she just keeps telling me to take charge and that‚Äôs it.
- the job is going to get even more stressful because my coworker is leaving and when she does, ALL her responsibilities go to me.
-I just got asked if I wanted to work more hours and i sobbed uncontrollably on the way home because I thought I couldn‚Äôt say no. So yeah I‚Äôll be working even more and that‚Äôs taking even more time away from school and life.
- I genuinely believe I am not the right person for this job. I am very quiet and not social, this job is the opposite of my personality.
- It‚Äôs not extremely essential that I work right now. I live with my parents and I don‚Äôt pay many bills yet. I‚Äôm happy to say at home until I get my masters and another job. So I am able to quit and be fine.

Here are the reasons I DON‚ÄôT want to quit:
- money, benefits, retirement
- the job is flexible and part time
- I‚Äôm only on month 3 of this job, maybe it will get easier somehow??
- I feel like if I quit now I‚Äôll let everyone down
- quitting now will feel like giving up, like I didn‚Äôt even try
- I will be inconveniencing my entire staff who will have to pick up my slack and my coworkers‚Äô. The staff are already spread thin and overworked as it is.
- my parents are so proud of me that I got this job and always tell me that no one likes their first job and I just have to suck it up for a few years till I get my degree and then move onto something else.
- I‚Äôm going to quit in a few years regardless because I‚Äôm going to look for a job that‚Äôs actually in my field. My boss knows that I will be leaving in 2020-2021 for sure. Why quit now when there‚Äôs already an end in sight right?

So what would your suggestion be? Should I stick it out or should I quit? Thanks for any input!

##Adapted from Alicization V13 Alicization Dividing. Covered Interlude IV, Chapter 9, and the very beginning of Chapter 10, around 40-45 pages 

Alright, it's time to RINKU STAATO into Volume 13, Alicization Dividing, aptly named after our main heroes Kirito and Eugeo have ended up *dividing* after some unforeseen explosive circumstances. Overall, the episode featured very minor dialogue cuts, but featured one huge cut at the very end, unsurprisingly, coming at the expense of Eugeo's Character Development and Motivations, as expected from the Anime at this point. Whereever we got cuts, it was Eugeo taking the entire loss of development, which is very sad, considering the first half of Alicization is more Eugeo's Story, than it is Kirito's Story... But I'm getting ahead of myself, this is the last, relatively ""calm"" episode you will have for the remainder of the second cour, so buckle up and get ready for a rollercoaster!

And yes, title card has not changed to Dividing and remains as Rising. Please upvote to raise awareness to the suffering puppies due to misleading title card.

#It's an adaptation, this much is normal

Starting with basics today ~~totally not because I want to have your attention until I talk about the Major Eugeo Cut, it's not like these titles exist so you can easily scroll down without reading~~, Alice and Kirito's climb from the outside of the tower. Imma keep this short and put everything in simple bullet points for clarity. It's all minor dialogue pieces that either contribute to overall worldbuilding, world logic or minor hints to future, so I don't think extensive paragraphs are needed this week for this section.

* Alice's inner conflict has been glossed over very lightly. A lot of gestures by Alice showcased her conflict, whether she should kill Kirito or help him. When Kirito insulted her, her grip of her Osmanthus Blade tightened as if she was getting ready to slash Kirito, but slowly loosened again after listening to logic. After switching places with Kirito, grabbing him from the neck, her hand holding Kirito tensed and loosened the same way multiple times, as she was considering letting Kirito plunge to his death.

* When looking for a chain to hold them together as a safety net, Kirito suggests taking off his Uniform and Pants to utilize as a rope to bind each other and Alice is baffled at the foolishness of Kirito of getting rid of his armor, after her having promised to kill him once they made it to safety. Ooooh Alice, you naive Knight... Kirito is baka enough to go into battles completely naked and without a sword!

* They sheath their weapons and use generated hooks because after going through multiple battles and using Perfect Weapon Control twice, both weapons are at a low durability. And supporting the weight of their wielders only by being stabbed into the wall with their tips, is putting too much strain on them that Kirito assumes the Black One would shatter within minutes. Also, sheathing a weapon slowly restores a weapons durability.

* Kirito carries not just his ""The Black One"", but also Alice, her high level Integrity Knight Armor as well as her Osmanthus Blade. While incredibly heavy, this is still possible because Fatigue is incorporated differently than real life in Underworld. Unlike real life, you don't really get ""tired"" by doing hard work, so it is possible to strain yourself too hard to accomplish something, but the more you exhaust yourself, the more HP you lose. This was an explanation skipped back in Episode 3, as well as this episode.

* Did you know that the Administrator, aka Quinella, does have a Sacred Arts that allows her to float mid-air? When asking about ""Calling her Dragon"", Kirito also asked if there was a Sacred Arts that would allow them to fly to safety, which only got Alice even more angry due to Kirito's lack of knowledge, pointing out that only Administrator-sama ~~pls step on me~~ was in possession of such a spell.

* The explanation for Gargoyle behavior was skipped entirely. Unlike the Goblins back in Episode 4, Gargoyles are called ""Minions"" for a reason. They do not possess a Fluctlight and run on your average MMORPG Mob AI, which makes them incredibly predictable and thus relatively easy to beat in low numbers. That is also why Kirito looks around towards other statues and confirms his suspicions of them waking up based on Proximity, solely because he knew they'd be in deep shit, if they had to deal with numerous Gargoyles at the same time, making up for their lack of intelligent behavior.

* Questions in Kirito's and Alice's mind after Alice mentions the Centoria Solstice Festival were dropped entirely, however, these were vital for Kirito's recognition of Synthesis 30, as well as Synthesis 30's existential crisis that was being set up. Kirito had just started thinking about how Alice lived in the Church before being Synthesized since if she was a prisoner, she wouldn't be allowed to go to the Solstice Festival. On the other side, Alice had started thinking about this vague memory she had, as well as dreams of someone she had certain nights that she did not recognize.

* [Some intern forgot how to layer a scene](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490243414890119175/541334692771921951/1549133841102.png)

#Key Details

* There is a reason why we got another, albeit short, scene on Ocean Turtle! First, we had the shady guy a couple of episodes back and now, an Escort Ship is supposedly going off the plan, troubling Nakanishi.

* [The escort ship had a fictional name in the Novels however for the anime, they actually used a real JSDF vessel!](https://twitter.com/sao_wikia/status/1091855263072747523)

#Major Eugeo Cut

Alright, so as I said, Eugeo, yet again, suffered a giant ax being hit at his character development like he had endured quite a lot of times throughout the season already, however, at this point, it's incredibly troubling, especially considering where all of his development was supposed to build up to. Without any of these, I suspect his decisions in the future won't have the effect it is supposed to have. To give an extreme example, would you care about Sinon's journey, without knowing why she was joining BoB and why she **had to** win? Would Yuuki's eventual death be as impactful, if you didn't know her as the person who tried her best to live, in a life that deemed her unable to live? It's essentially what Eugeo has been robbed of so far, as well as what he is still being robbed of with 7 episodes until the mid-season break.

But that is why I am here! As Eugeo was climbing the tower, being alone and having lost his mental anchor, Kirito, who had been giving him confidence and keeping him calm all this time, his thoughts were wandering around wildly. He did trust Kirito to survive and save Alice, so much so that he was still moving straight towards his goal, certain that they would meet on the top of the tower. But questions were leading to other questions in his mind. 

&gt; Can Kirito peacefully save Alice?

&gt; Kirito always had a charming way with words, surely he can convince Alice Synthesis 30 to stand down her sword.

&gt; Afterall, he did do the same to both Deusolbert Synthesis 7 and Fanatio Synthesis 2, both of which they defeated without killing them and going as far as saving the Integrity Knights...

&gt; Saving the Integrity Knights

And that was the moment a key question came to Eugeo. His primary goal had been to restore Alice Zuberg's memories and re-instate her into the body that Alice Synthesis 30 was invading at the moment. But so far, they had fought multiple Integrity Knights, and Kirito was unwilling to do anything against the Integrity Knight personas invading the body of a real Underworldian, whose memories were locked up in Administrators Chambers. 

Eugeo knew his partner well enough at this point. He quickly tried to brush off the idea in his mind, refusing to think about it, refusing to acknowledge the existence of what he knew was trouble. When it was time to bring back Alice Zuberg, by getting rid of Alice Synthesis 30, Eugeo knew his partner would not be okay with sacrificing one soul over the other and look for another solution, no matter how long it would take, not caring if that ""another option"" did realistically exist or not...

It then peaked my interest in an IT education so I went to university and had to use Windows because I required lots of software that would only run on windows, though I used Linux in VM a few times

Now I'm finished my formal education and about to go to my first internship as a web designer (mostly front end) I think it's safe to go back to Ubuntu but I'll leave a 64gb windows partition just in case.

Luckily I've quit gaming so I have little need for a Windows OS. I'll probably miss Photoshop and Illustrator but I do rather simple things so open source software should be perfectly fine.

I booted a VM yesterday and even though I can't say I love  everything about gnome, compared to W10 it looks absolutely gorgeous. I've been fed up with Windows for so long now that it feels like a relief to go back to Ubuntu.

So hi there, glad to be back."

It was customary for his writers to send him preliminary jokes each morning and he would whittle them down and add his own flare to them before the writers meeting around lunch time. It was normally his favorite time of day, before the madness of the day hit him full force, but today he was feeling extra jittery. Maybe it was the full rest he had gotten over the three day weekend or it could have been the three cups of coffee he had already had. Whatever it was he was having a hard time sitting still and focusing on the task at hand.

By nine o‚Äôclock he had given up and was scrolling through his Twitter feed when he heard the knock at his door and looked up to see one of his interns peek her head in. He smiled at her warmly as she quickly let him know that the new writer was there to meet him. He had honestly forgotten that they had a new writer starting today but he nodded his head anyway. ‚ÄúOh yeah, right. Uhm yeah‚Ä¶send her in. I definitely want to meet uh‚Ä¶‚Äù he looked at the intern and mouthed the words ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs her name?‚Äù to which the intern mouthed back ‚ÄúCasey‚Äù awkwardly. ‚ÄúRight. Casey, that‚Äôs exactly what I was going to say,‚Äù Jimmy continued without missing a beat.

He stood up from his desk and walked around it as Casey made her way into his office. He was wearing his pre-show attire of dark blue jeans, black Adidas sneakers, and a black short sleeve button up shirt as he walked over to shake her hand. ‚ÄúHi Casey. It‚Äôs nice to meet you. So this is your first day, huh?‚Äù He moved to let her walk further into his office and gestured to the chair in front of his desk. ‚ÄúGo ahead and have a seat. Let‚Äôs talk for a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks Ashley, I‚Äôve got it from here,‚Äù he said to the intern before walking back around to the back of his desk and sitting down in his chair with a plop.

He raised his eyebrows at her and leaned forward towards the desk, clasping his hands in front of him. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶I‚Äôve heard some good things about you. You wrote for ‚ÄòDrunk History‚Äô, is that right? I love that show. It‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs where I get most of my historical knowledge from so I hope to god it‚Äôs accurate.‚Äù

I recently lost my partner for this plot idea and I really miss writing this character. Hopefully I can find someone who would also be interested. I want to play Jimmy Kimmel slightly AU (lowered age &amp; single) against whatever character you choose. It could be someone he works with, another celebrity, or just someone he meets through a mutual friend that has nothing to do with the show. I know celebrity rp's are a little weird for some people but think of it this way. He's rich and can spoil her, taking her on lavish vacations, he's a down to earth really nice guy who does a lot for charities, and he's funny and sarcastic. I included the sample of my writing so you can see my style. I'm looking for someone who can match it in style and detail. I am looking for someone preferably 21+ but 18+ is a must. We can talk more about it if this interests you at all. Please send me a private message rather than commenting on this post.

I'm very excited to put everything from CCNA and other classes into practice, and I'm very excited to learn a lot of new stuff too.

However I'm also slightly shitting myself. I'm going from a classroom (or packet tracer) to working in an enterprise network environment. The organisation deals with about 20,000 users and 15,000 computers, and everything is gonna be very overwhelming until I find my footing. I just worry that I'm going to take half the year to actually find my feet, before I actually start to settle into such an environment :(

To those of you who are in jobs as a network engineer, how were your first days? What advice could you give me to help me settle in?

I don't want to disappoint people by being super slow to pick stuff up, but I don't want to act confident and take on things that I'm not comfortable with either. How did you find the sweet spot?

amsq4n,1,2019-02-03,AITA at my internship?,Lindts,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/amsq4n/aita_at_my_internship/,"So, I did post about this on r/Advice, but the situation has definitely changed. 

For some background, I (21F) started a tax internship about a month ago and my 2 friends are with me (a girl who we'll call AL, and a guy we'll call Y). AL is a junior (same as me) and Y is a senior graduating this spring (not in the Master's program). We're all accounting majors. 

We've all been friends since the start of the fall semester. Everything was great. AL and I get along at work and we are fine. No drama, just support and genuine friendship here. Y, on the other hand, is different since we started working together at our internship. I want to give the full picture, so bear with me please:

Y and I started our internship on 1/2/19 (Wednesday). The first day was really more of a ""get a feel for the software"" kind of day. We were there for 7 hours. During that 7 hours, I got my first taste of doing taxes. Very boring, but also, just work. It was a huge learning experience for me, and it's only gotten better. Anyhow, so we're working away. and Y has nothing but negative opinions throughout the entire day. He doesn't like how things are run. He doesn't like doing taxes (he did volunteer for VITA the previous year and has taken individual and corporate tax (2 tax classes)), and he thinks our boss is incompetent. 

I try to brush it off. Every time he has a bad thing to say, I try to diffuse it by saying things such as ""It's not that bad."" or ""I personally don't have a problem with it"". Things like that, because I really don't have an issue with the way things are run. So before the semester started, I was working 12-5 on every Tues, Thurs and Friday. Y could only work Tues &amp; Thurs from 9-3. Therefore, I always saw him in the office on Tues &amp; Thurs for about 3 hours. Needless to say, whenever I worked with him, it was the same thing. At one point, he did say and I quote, ""\_\_\_\_\_ won't last in this industry."" Now, this isn't personally against me, but I felt really pissed off for two reasons: 

1) He was saying it in the office, where our boss could walk in at any time and overhear it. This could lead to him thinking that I am also participating in talking bad about him. This is the thing that really got me because every single time Y said something that was negative about our boss, I truly felt he was being selfish by jeopardizing my internship and my chances of getting a good recommendation to the master's program. This also applies for AL. 

2)  He keeps acting like he knows everything. He judges our boss as if he's an equal, and while all human beings are equal, in the workspace, we aren't. Our boss has over 25 years of experience as a CPA. That's more than any of us interns have been alive, and that experience definitely makes our boss valuable in the work place, whereas we interns are not as valuable. And my logic, that I explained to Y when I confronted him was ""If you're so smart and you keep acting like you know everything, then where are your clients? Your firm? Your CPA license? Your degree? What about a job offer? None?"" 

I know that I cut deep when I said that last bit. But it's something that is so noticeable. A lot of his classmates have already secured a job offer in advance last fall. Some have secured Big 4 starting positions (and qualify for the CPA exam in NY, our state). He hasn't gotten one job offer and can't seem to get one. So clearly, he's not this overly-amazing future worker who's the best in his class. That's what I was trying to point out, not out of meanness, but just to open his eyes. He's an intern, same as me and AL. There's nothing about him that makes his opinion (which was unprofessional in AL's and my opinion) important because Y has never run his own firm, so how would he even know how to do anything? 

So when I confronted him, I asked him politely: ""Alright, since we're already at this point, I'm just going to ask that whenever I'm in the office with you, could you please just keep your negative opinions to yourself? I would appreciate it personally."" 

This is where things go south. Y immediately denies that he ever said any of the things he said, and AL and I are just in disbelief that he can just lie openly to our face like that. This is how our conversation goes, to the best of my memory since it happened on Thursday:

Me: what was said above. 

Y: \*starts smiling\* I didn't say any of that. 

Me: Are you seriously going to tell me you've never talked crap about our boss before?

Y: No, I didn't. Look, I don't have time for this shit. I have more important things to do.

Me: Okay, well, I'm just saying. I would appreciate it if you didn't. You're entitled to your opinion, but I feel like when you do this, you're jeopardizing my internship.

Y: Look, \_\_\_\_, if you like this job, then you're gonna do well. Unless I'm impacting how you work, I don't see how this personally affects you. 

Me: It doesn't impact my work ability, but you're making this a toxic work place and it's not professional what you're saying.

Y: I'm giving the business feedback. Like at my other internship, I told my supervisor that we needed to start using more technology to keep up with the times and she told me that they were trying to but that it's hard to adjust. But since I gave her that feedback, now they know.""

Me: That's great that you were able to do that, but you're not giving our boss any ""feedback"". You're just saying things behind his back that's just plain rude and isn't constructive at all. 

Y: Look, I really don't have time for this, and you can't tell me what to do.

Me: I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just asking you to be mindful of what you say here in the office.

Y: And I haven't.

Me: Seriously? I have the text messages where you were complaining about your pay. And you even admitted in your texts that you have talked crap about our boss. 

Y: Well, you have the texts. There you go. 

Y gets up to tell our boss that he's heading out (he only works 2 1/2 hours 2 days a week during the semester. When he comes back into our work space, he starts laughing and says ""You should have recorded it then."" 

Personally, I'm confused because now I'm thinking these 2 things might have happened:

1) Did he lie to me and AL because he thought I was recording him? OR

2) Was he recording me? And even if he did, I never said anything bad to incriminate myself because I've shown my boss I'm honest, hardworking, and willing to get work done (without pay) outside the office. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know who the asshole is here. I feel like I'm justified because it's not good to talk crap about your boss, and in our current workspace, it would be hard to not assume all 3 interns are participating in said unprofessional talk. 

Edit: I would also love any advice you guys could give me on how to deal with this as professionally as possible in the work place. I am no longer friends with this person and only have to put up with him until the end of the semester. "

6) If you had an internship experience, where was it and what was it like?

7) What is the interview process like and what is the best way to prepare?

8) Are there any different job prospects for a CPSC grad versus a SENG grad?

amui27,4,2019-02-03,Parents limit me from making decisions,mantassink,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/amui27/parents_limit_me_from_making_decisions/,"I'm 20 years old and on my 2nd year in university. My parents often limit me from taking decisions. Their main argument mostly is that they're paying for my studies and until I live in their house, I must live by their rules.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start an internship at a company which is a perfect fit after months of searching for a perfect fit. Only disadvantage is that it is 20km from university (with my schedule, I could perfectly manage to ride with a car to that place). My parents told me that I could find a spot in a company which is closer to city. What they don't get is that after many job interviews, with my degree (which I'll finish in 2 years) this will be the position that I'm studying for. After the internship I have high chances of being hired and being paid a decent salary.

&amp;#x200B;

They limit me and that makes me more and more unconfident about myself. Their only power is that they're controlling me financially. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I present them myself to them that I'm an adult and I decide what I want to do with my future?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: parents limit me from making my own decisions. How do I prove them I'm an adult with my own opinion and my responsibilities?"
amunay,4,2019-02-03,Akame the Origin,Midoriyas_Shoes,BokuNoMetaAcademiaDnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoMetaAcademiaDnD/comments/amunay/akame_the_origin/,"Part One
The Interview

Meeting Ghost is arguably one of the luckiest things to ever happen to Akame as it allowed her to find a mentor who fully understood her abilities, and who was in a great position to stimulate her growth. However, one cannot say it was all smooth sailing right from the start. It was more of a thorny path with glass and debris scattered on the floor, and the occasional body in a tree. 

It all started with her application back when she had just graduated. The hero office she had interned with during her last year was primarily a rescue one, but during an incident Akame had become involved in and helped solve a murder case. The hero in charge of said office had already noticed her observational abilities, but that case showed him something more. Her passion and dedication in unravelling the truth. That convinced him that she would find her place in a slightly different hero role, than what she had been pursuing. He recommended she apply to Ghost‚Äôs office and after reading up on the place, she did. The application got her an interview and that is what set her on the path to becoming who she was meant to be. 

Akame walked up to the building, it was not a pretty place and the neighbourhood it was in was a troubled one, but that is generally where you find work, when you are looking to capture criminals. Having just graduated and acquired her pro hero license at the impressive age of 18, Akame felt herself prepared for what the future held, but her self confidence was only mostly justified. 

The street was quite empty, which is fairly normal for the middle of the day, but this particular street seemed like it would keep people away regardless. The asphalt was uneven and it seemed the authorities had not bothered with the potholes for years. The sidewalk had wobbly and wonky stones and most trees had more carvings on them than bark. The uniform grey buildings could only really be told apart by the numbers on the door‚Ä¶ except for the one with ‚ÄòHardcase investigations‚Äô hanging over the entrance. It was at the end of the block. Easy to miss, but not that hard to find if you were looking for it. The blank building did not give anything away of what could be hidden inside, its uniformity a strength in itself. 

Akame squinted at the sign. Was this really what she was looking for? Compared to her Aunt‚Äôs offices this seemed‚Ä¶ cold. She shrugged and walked in. The presence of life dramatically increased once she passed the entrance‚Ä¶ in the form of a man smoking cigars reading a magazine. He did not even seem to notice as Akame walked in his thumb in the middle of turning a page. There was not much in the entrance‚Ä¶ the man glanced up then returned to the mag turning another page‚Ä¶ two doors with frosted glass each with a sign, one read ‚ÄòHindsight Law Practice‚Äô, the other ‚ÄòHenry Cross, Private Investigator‚Äô. Once she read the sign Akame headed to the second door with no hesitation. After a knock on the door which received a curt response she opened the door and entered. 

Crossing the threshold one would think something was wrong. It was like all the walls were erased from an apartment, yet everything still seemed to have a distribution governed by its layout. The would be living room had a big wooden desk in the middle with a chair on each side and the surrounding walls were lined by filing cabinets. Akame could not read the labels on those nor could she decipher the writings and drawings on the multitude of whiteboards stored in a separate room. To the left of the entrance was the would be kitchen which was full of more travel coffee cups and discarded grounds than one would think possible for a single person‚Äôs use. The only evident show of hospitality was the presence of a couch and TV, and the rest of the rooms seemed to act as storage. 

Akame processed all of that on a secondary note as her focus and attention were drawn to the man now sitting behind the desk. He was holding a file which she was sure contained her application and possibly any record of her internship work. He wore a grey shirt and blue blazer and a grim expression on his face as he took a sip of coffee. His eyes bore into Akame.

‚ÄòAre you gonna stand there all day?‚Äô His voice was rough, not due to disuse, more like the way one talks when they demand a response. 

Akame stared back unabashed. ‚ÄòMy apologies Sir, I was invited to come in, but unsure if I was meant to take a seat yet.‚Äô She walked over and bowed. ‚ÄòMitsuki Akame, it is a pleasure to meet you Sir.‚Äô She then took a seat assuming his comment meant she should do so. 

Henry Cross stares at the girl in front of him for a moment, then returns to looking at the file. Akame in turn observes Ghost, she had attempted to look into him before submitting her application and found that to be incredibly hard to do. She found that very impressive, although frankly the surroundings disappointed her. It was a very far cry from her aunt‚Äôs shiny office. Her eyes scanned the cabinets behind Ghost, finally close enough to read the ‚ÄòActive cases‚Äô written at the top of the closest one‚Ä¶

Her thoughts are interrupted by a cough. ‚ÄòWhy are you interested in working for me?‚Äô

Akame‚Äôs eyes snapped to attention. ‚ÄòI wish to learn how to investigate crimes and apprehend criminals in the capacity of a hero.‚Äô 

His eyes bore into hers. ‚ÄòIs that all?‚Äô

She tilted her head approximately half a degree as she thought it through. ‚ÄòThat and anything else useful you could teach me about being a hero, Sir.‚Äô

‚ÄòDo you have any secrets that would endanger my business or coworkers?‚Äô He did not break eye contact.

Akame considered for a moment. ‚ÄòMy aunt is a famous hero and unless any of her enemies decide to target me in order to get to her, I see no way that my presence here could bring any adversity Sir.‚Äô

‚ÄòHow honest would you say you are?‚Äô Ghost sat back in his chair letting the file rest on his desk as he continued observing Akame.

‚ÄòI find lies to be a waste of time.‚Äô She did not move an inch sitting up with a straight back her eyes glued to his. 

Ghost closed the file then leaned forward. ‚ÄòWhat do you think of my office?‚Äô

Akame did not look around. She continued maintaining what now seemed like a staring contest. 

‚ÄòIt would seem quite messy. The kitchen could certainly use a cleaning. I am not sure if the whiteboards are arranged in some form of a personal system but to me they seemed to be randomly placed. The filing cabinets, however, seem to be impeccable in their arrangement. I am of course assuming based on the fact they are perfectly lined up and all of them are completely closed their contents could be chaotic, but based on the way you have been holding my file this entire time you seem like a person who would value information better than that. Over all I would say the space is functional but not welcoming in the slightest.‚Äô

Ghost raises his eyebrows for a moment as she is talking then allows them to drop. He once again opens the file and finally breaks eye contact for a moment. He turns a page then returns to looking at Akame.

‚ÄòHave you ever committed a criminal offense.‚Äô

‚ÄòNo‚Äô

Akame stared back, barely blinking.

‚ÄòHave you ever done anything you have regretted.‚Äô 

Akame is taken slightly by surprise by this question. This shows in a slight raising of her eyebrows. ‚ÄòYes, any time I do not perform up the the standards that are expected of me I regret it.‚Äô

Ghost‚Äôs eyes narrow. ‚ÄòAnd what exactly are those standards?‚Äô

‚ÄòI have to perform in a way that would not embarrass my aunt or family.‚Äô Akame replies with no hesitation.

‚ÄòWrong‚Äô Ghost closes the file and puts it on his desk. 

Akame blinks in surprise. ‚ÄòI am sorry S‚Ä¶‚Äô

‚ÄòFrom now on you have to perform to my standards. That is if you want to keep this job. You start tomorrow. It will take a few days to get you a desk, but I am sure you will be plenty busy.‚Äô Ghost stood up, looking at Akame the whole while. 

Akame followed him and stood up. She was knocked a bit off balance by the way this conversation had gone, but her ironclad upbringing immediately instructed her into a bow.

‚ÄòThank you very much Sir.‚Äô Her head nearly hit the desk as the only show of her excitement. 

Ghost narrowed his eyes as he observed her bowing form. ‚ÄòNo need for that here. You can keep the ‚Äò‚Äôsir‚Äô‚Äô but all this courtesy nonsens will just slow the work down.‚Äô 

Akame straightens immediately and observes as he puts her file in a locked cabinet directly behind his desk. She then glances around one more time studying the distribution of furniture venturing a thought as to where her desk would be.

‚ÄòYou need something else?‚Äô Ghost‚Äôs sharp words snap her out of the daze.

‚ÄòOh NO. Sorry sir. I will be here tomorrow.‚Äô She stops herself about 5 degrees into the bow and just nods. 

She gave the man in the entrance a little nod as she left. Once outside she let a big smile crawl onto her face. As strange as this interview had been, it also filled her with excitement. It was so different than anything she had experienced up to now, yet somewhat familiar considering the novels she loved. It had reminded her of her favourite series written by Jill Garth. It took Akame a couple of blocks to recompose her face as she headed home.

amv874,2,2019-02-03,"My parents are drug addicts, my job is too intense, I got stabbed and the cumulative stress caused me to break up with the woman I love",PM_me_Sanic_Fanfics,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/amv874/my_parents_are_drug_addicts_my_job_is_too_intense/,"My parents weren't always drug addicts. But in 2014, after their parents (my grandparents) died, they started a whole new party lifestyle. At first I was supportive. They're approaching 60, they were earning enough money to put food on the table, and they seemed to be having loads of fun, meeting people, coming out of their shells and loving life. Why would I worry? I'm in my twenties and moved out years ago, so I didn't think it was any of my business anyway.

But then the partying started to go too far. I came home to visit once to find my dad snorting cocaine off the kitchen table first thing in the morning. A few months later I found them staying in on a Saturday night to session cocaine together. A few months later I came home to find my mother bombing MDMA with her new, also drug-addicted friend. I'm in no way anti-drugs (I've taken drugs myself in my life), but I recognised that these were not the behaviours of people who were 'having fun'.

I don't know if you've ever tried to confront a drug addict about their problem, let alone your own parents, but it's not easy. I know why they're doing this to themselves. They have a lot of emotional trauma gathered over their lives which was made 100 times worse by the deaths of their parents, and they are not coming to terms with these things. Or, rather, they think they are by burying themselves in drugs and drink. Cocaine especially gives them the mental strength to say to themselves 'I am great!', instead of facing the truth, which is 'I am not doing so great.'

\*

I moved away in 2013 to begin my career in advertising. It was a bad time to enter the industry. Britain was still digging itself out of the financial crash which meant unemployment was high and wages were low. I worked hard, doing unpaid internships and freelance work, attending evening schools and working part-time in a shop, all to realise my dream of breaking into the advertising industry. When I finally got an offer for a junior position, it forced me to move to a new city. But I didn't mind. I was 23 years old and it felt like an awesome adventure, so I happily went along.

I knew it was a tough industry. But my god. Late night finishes, working at the weekend, taking my work home with me... I slipped right into a way of working that quickly consumed my life. I wanted to progress so badly that I made myself into a workaholic. I quickly stopped having fun, and started to feel chronically anxious. I developed insomnia. That, plus the loneliness that came with being in a brand new city, meant I spent my first year in the industry teetering on the edge of a break-down.

And it didn't get much better. The further I progressed, the more responsibility I shouldered. I would handle more accounts, bigger projects, nastier clients and crappier managers the further up I climbed. I enjoy what I do, and I'm very good at it. I even have a bit of a reputation in the industry. I'm 'successful' in that respect. But I'm *still* on the edge of a break-down. In 2018, it all became a bit much, when I took a big step up to a senior position and suddenly found myself snowed under with the amount of work I was expected to do. I had no choice but to work long hours, every day, dedicating every thought I had to my job. I completely lost the ability to switch off.

\*

I'll always remember July 11th 2018, for two reasons. First, England lost to Croatia in the World Cup Semi Final. And second, I got stabbed.

I had been at the pub with my girlfriend to watch the game. It was a weekday match, so it started in the evening. It then went to extra time, so we ended up staying out later than expected. When it finally finished, we headed home. Neither of us had eaten, so when we got back to our house, I offered to go down the road and get some food from the chip shop. As I walked down the road, a fight spilled out of the pub a few doors down from us (not the one we had been at; this had always been a slightly dodgy pub, but even I didn't expect it to be this bad).

I watched a guy get his leg broken around the knee, while two other men fought each other with weapons. I found myself right in the middle of it, just staring at the carnage. But it got bad when one man managed to smash a glass bottle over the head of the other guy, then with the broken end of the bottle started hacking and slashing at him, even stabbing at his throat. I decided, in that moment, that I had to do something to stop a man from being murdered, so ran in to try and stop the assailant. But as I ran in, the attacker turned his attention to me, and started stabbing and slashing in my direction. I managed to dodge him, and distracted him long enough that he got tired, a bit scared of the number of people staring at him, and ran away. It was only as I went to tend to the guy he had severely wounded that I noticed the gaping stab wound in my arm and the shards of glass embedded in my hand. He had got me after all.

In the space of a few minutes, I had gone from having a wonderful night (sure, England lost, but hey) to being the victim of assault. I was shocked and confused, and most of all scared. This had all happened right outside our house. I knew we lived in a rough area, but this was something else. I left the hospital that night at 5am, went home, had one hour's sleep, then walked into work the next day as if nothing had happened (the ad industry doesn't have time for people who get stabbed in bar fights).

\*

My girlfriend was amazing. I met her soon after I moved to the new city for that junior position, and we shared so many adventures together. We even travelled around the world. But in 2018 everything changed. We moved to another new city, started new jobs, and both found ourselves dealing with a lot of stress in our lives. There was a break-down in communications, and this caused us to have constant, horrible arguments. She accused me of cheating. I accused her of being lazy. Neither of these things were true; but we were both just angry all the time.

I understand now that she was probably as depressed as I was. She was never the most emotionally aware person. When I was stabbed, she didn't really show much emotion. And when I've struggled in the past, it's taken me literally saying to her face 'I am struggling' before she has noticed any of the signs. But I never minded, because I knew she cared; she just wasn't very good at expressing it. However, last year, with both of us under so much pressure, we both missed vital signs in each other. In my head, I kept telling myself I needed to get away from her, that I needed to find someone who could care for me. I failed to recognise the irony at the time, which was that she was the only person who ever could, and ever did.

It was in October, and in the midst of yet another argument, that I snapped and made an impulsive decision to end the relationship. I had no idea at the time whether it was the right decision, but things felt so bad between us that I couldn't really see any other way. Within a month, I had moved out of our house, she had cut off all contact with me, and I had started seeing other people. (Was I using hedonistic behaviour in a desperate attempt to fill a void in my life? You betcha. Did it work? Did it fuck.)

\*

I had my first mental breakdown at the end of last year. It was intense and, if I'm honest, kinda fun. I took some time off work and went to live in a hostel in Denmark. I disabled all my social media accounts, turned my phone off and used the time there to just... be alone. It was great. And it helped to give me the mental clarity to see where it had all gone wrong. The drug-addicted parents, the job, the stabbing... everything in my life that I had failed to come to terms with myself, I had taken out on my now ex-girlfriend.

Unfortunately, knowing now what I didn't know then, I am crippled with regret. If only, if only, I had come to terms with all this sooner, if only I had worked on that relationship and made it stronger, if only I had not rushed into such a terrible and final decision. Things could be so different. Unfortunately my ex doesn't want to see me ever again. I don't blame her. My behaviour around the time of the break-up was as unforgivable as it was irrational. I didn't mean to be a bad person. I never do. But what's done is done, and I don't expect her to ever take me back. The only thing left to do now is move on.

\*

My parents are still using drugs, but I've spoken to them about it. I've also enlisted the help of my extended family to try and help them turn things around. My job is still far too intense, but I'm working now on an exit strategy. I'm saving as much money as I can in the hopes that later this year I can finally start to pursue some of my other passions. And the stab wound is still there. It's pretty ugly, but at least I've moved to a nicer place and, even though I'm alone now, I feel much more comfortable here.

I'm so sorry for what I did. I ruined my own life, and my girlfriend's, by being rash, impulsive, and unable to control my emotions. At 28 years old, I feel I should know better. I can never undo what I've done, but I'm doing everything I can to try to turn things around and make sure it never happens again.

Anyway Reddit, you're the first person I've told this story to. I hope you liked it. It was good to get it off my chest."
amv8ao,2,2019-02-03,[M4M] [SciFi] One in Ten Men,vdude2,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/amv8ao/m4m_scifi_one_in_ten_men/,"*The world awoke to discover a change‚Äîa* ***big*** *change.* 

*The reports aligned with the emergence of the sun over the horizon. First the eastern seaboard of the United States. Asia. Africa. Europe. In the initial confusion, people thought everyone was changing. But it wasn't everyone.*

*Within a few months time, it was determined the final number was 90%. Nine in ten men awoke to a vagina between their legs. The organ they had been so accustomed to were gone. No one knew the cause. Some people claimed it was the Earth was now in the hands of an angry god. Some women claimed it was karma finally catching up for all of the bad behavior the penis has led men to perform. But by the end of a single day, 19 out of every 20 people on Earth had a fully functioning vagina but otherwise remained themselves.*

*The Mass Vanishing‚Äîas it soon came to be called‚Äîappeared to be random. There was no rhyme or reason as to which men were affected and which weren't. But it* ***was*** *entirely predictable how the men reacted. There was a spike in suicides at first, but that leveled out. Some openly embraced it, but the majority seemed to descend into great denial, assuming things would reverse and pretended like nothing has changed in an effort to keep people thinking that* ***they*** *weren't among the men who were changed.*

*The reality of the situation set in quicker than the cultural institutions could change. Suddenly, women found themselves in competition with men for the attention of the 10% who still retained a penis. Those men found themselves on the receiving end of a phallocentric cultural phenomenon. Despite the fact that the Great Vanishing was random and they had nothing to* ***earn*** *the power that now befell them, they became highly valued in society. It didn't take long for the penis to become the defining characteristic that separated humanity. The world reorganized not along a masculine/feminine divide but rather a phallic/yonic divide. The cock had cultural cache like never before.*

---

If you've read this far, welcome to a strange and twisted alternate reality I recently concocted. 

I'd like to build a story set in this world. For the most part, I'm rather flexible on the characters. I'd prefer two men‚Äîone with a cock and one without‚Äîbe at the center of the story, but what that looks like is up for negotiation. A few ideas I had so far would include:

* A masculine, power-hungry corporate executive (or even a government official) is one of the men who has lost his cock. He doesn't want the world to know this, so he's pretending he still has it. However, a problem arrives in the form of a haughty and assertive intern who *didn't* lose his cock. Emerging on the other side of the Vanishing with his cock has only inflated his already exaggerated sense of self. The intern knows the secret of the exec. The exec benefits from the intern staying silent, and the exec realizes what he needs to do to keep the intern silent (which perhaps he even comes to enjoy). The intern benefits from the favoritism and perks bestowed on him. The exec realizes the benefit of having someone with a real cock (a rare commodity!) at his disposal.

* A suburban family of three is turned upside down by the Vanishing. The father loses his cock, and it takes a toll on his relationship with his wife. Their college-aged daughter, who's living at home while attending classes, is dating a bratty guy her age. The relationship between the father and the daughter's boyfriend has always been contentious, but in the aftermath of the Vanishing, the boyfriend becomes a more audacious showboat. The extent of the boyfriend's assertion of power in the house eventually takes the form of him luring the father into a sexual relationship and threatening to expose it if the father should try to stop the sex.

* A gorgeous transwoman who transitioned at 18 is one of the random (chromosomally male) individuals who *retains* a cock. Her masculine boyfriend is one of the men who *loses* his. Their relationship is radically changed with the introduction of a vagina into their life‚Äîfirst her unbridled envy and resentment paired with his anger and impuissance. But it becomes a change that, eventually, both come to see as a net positive.

But I'm also open to your ideas. Kinks include power dynamics, world-building, and the intersections between sex and gender in a sociological sense. I'm willing to enter some stronger kinks than my usual vanilla fare, but all characters must be 18+, violence isn't welcomed, and bodily fluids and filth are excluded. "

amvg2d,1,2019-02-03,Grad Student Looking to Tackle $6k CC Debt,bloonan,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/amvg2d/grad_student_looking_to_tackle_6k_cc_debt/,"I've read a ton of different posts on here, most of which have all been super helpful! However, I wasn't able to find one catered specifically to my situation (where I don't have an income, and won't for the foreseeable future). 

Background:

* 24-year-old grad student, \~$6k of debt at \~23% APR (Venture)
* I quit my modest-paying paralegal job 3 weeks before starting law school. I didn't have a *ton* saved at the time and had to move during this period. First/last/deposit and other moving costs (furniture) and general costs of starting school added up and contributed to this debt. I had a temporary spending problem when heading into a big chapter of my life. I have completely stopped using the card, haven't increased my debt since (aside from school loans) and have never missed a payment
* I receive \~$10k per semester for living while in law school. I'm a first year (3 years total) on my second semester. There are no loans available in the summer unless you're taking classes (not typical/my plan)
* I might (*might*) get a paid internship this summer, it's entirely possible I'll have to do an unpaid externship
* Credit score = 720, been dropping from 770 over last year due to utilization ratio
* Rent = $1225 + \~$40 utilities (Seattle)

Option #1: Debt Consolidation CC

* I've seen this advertised a lot on this sub. I'm hesitant to take the hard inquiry hit by applying for one of the many recommended cards because I can't imagine them approving someone with no income 
* If I am approved, I find it hard to believe it would be for $6k

Option #2: Private Loan 

* I see this recommended much less, but still occasionally. I've been leaning towards this option more and more. 

Option #3: Wait...

* Keep paying high interest, hope to get paid this summer, live frugally and work as hard as possible to pay it down

Option #3(a): Sprinkle of Loans

* My school keeps a reserve of \~$3k for us as a ""reserve""
* This pot of FedPLUS loan doesn't accrue interest until the day you decide to pull it out, or you can elect to never pull it out. I've yet to touch it as I want to keep my loans as low as possible

During World War II, the United States removed approximately 1000 Japanese Latin Americans from Peru and brought them to be interned in the United States' internment camps. Leaders at the time had hoped to remove all Japanese-Latin Americans from both North and South America, claiming them to be probable spies who could sneak in though the southern border, but only Peru agreed,and did so owing to complicated domestic politics surrounding the importation of Japanese laborers. The US had intended to intern *all* Japanese Peruvians, but were unable to work out the logistics.

Peru, meanwhile, had stripped those interned of citizenship such that they would never be allowed to return. After the war, the US tried to send them ""back"" to Japan (some were immigrants, but others were second generation Peruvians). Many refused to go, so the US kept them as prisoners even long after the end of the war, interning them and contracting their labor to private company Seabrook Farms, which is still in business today. It took in many cases years to regularize their status, and only after the intervention of the ACLU.

These individuals were denied the reparations that were offered to Japanese USians owing to the fact that they had come to this country as ""illegal and undocumented aliens"". Further hearings were held in congress in 2009 to extend reparations to these individuals. The attempt failed,  and to add insult to injury, famed racist Rep. Steve King was on the congressional subcommittee in which the hearings were held, and the results were predictable and racist.

A final twist, at the same time that the US was trying to send these Peruvians to Japan, they were forcibly relocating Okinawans to make their base, and one way they did so was to compensate them with a parcel of land in the Bolivian rain forest. To this day, there is a town called Okinawa, Bolivia.

amwlj3,4,2019-02-03,Finally getting out for good,Awkwardsauce25,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/amwlj3/finally_getting_out_for_good/,"I've posted here before about being trapped and going back and forth from working shitty jobs to schools that became scammy, then having to move back home.

Well SHTF and I'd had enough this past week when I was gone for military training,  came hone early to find the bathroom I'd been using was cleared out, trash, junk, mine and guests' toiletries are gone. WTF i go look in the basement dungeon Ive been sleeping in until the summer I was supposed to get out. There in boxes is all the bathroom junk. Im like running on 24hrs of sleep from the past 6 days, already emotionally drained bc Id passed my recert with flying colors and the trainers told me I shouldnt leave medicine bc I was good at it. 

So I text and get the response that I'd ""been mouthy about the bathroom, so you got kicked out"" at this point Im tempted to take pics of the basement bathroom my brother'd been using bc it was so filthy and i was held to a 1x a week cleaning standars which Id been doing anyways just not when they could actually see me doing it. (i.e. the weekend, which was in prep for this recert training and catching schoolwork up) the mouthy bit was when I was confronted before leaving for training, I said I didnt need to be told twice it would get done just not now. it turned into Nstepmom screaming at me then trying to ""embarass"" me in front of brother's fiancee as I sat for the obligatory Sunday dinner of awkwardness. 

I was 100% done and went to pack my military gear and books for school. so when i got back after getting 4 hrs of sleep and driving 3hrs home, i was ready for a shower, nap, quick clean up, and homework before getting ready for drill that sunday. surprised by this bullshit of the bathroom cleared out and turned into a drug cabinet/junk drawer, I was already at my wits end. 

I snapped and packed my shit. They'd already said I wasnt welcome there and needed to go. Texted my sergeants I needed out and they hooked me up with a couch to sleep on. 

So storm comes in from Polar vortex, sleeping on couches/futons since class was cancelled. looking for apartments at places that are closed bc of storm. 
little brother gives me a place to sleep helps me look for places.

Go home yesterday to finish packing stuff and do schoolwork try to avoid the Nrents. Failure on my end because I wake up start packing and then Ndad is in the door blocking my exit telling me ""no one wanted you to leave"" and now its turned into ""youre paranoid schizophrenic"" and ""we're concerned for you"" and ""you think everyone's out to get you"".

I say that's gaslighting and an attempt to delegitimize my feelings of being the only one held to a standard imposed without warning or agreement. I'm compared to my estranged mother who was supposedly diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder by court order a long time. told that even though Im not waving a knife around trying to kill people now, that Im the age bio-mom started having ""delusions"". So, background, Ndad was diagnosed by a psych with borderline personality disorder and Ndad stopped attending brother's appts after. 

Ive been diagnosed with ADHD and seasonal depression. never anything more. 

Being cornered into a room with no other exits triggers anxiety attack and I get angrier and Im saying mean shit and Ndad says the only reason I joined the military was bc I had a crush on my ugly ass recruiter. (ndad, im a lesbian) 

Told that Id made this shit all up and the abuse wasnt real and I always said everything was everyone else's fault. told Im an alcoholic and theyre worried about me. bc i have one bottle of Jaeger in my closet for weekend pizza night. 

Then it escalates, I'm rebellious and immature and wont help ""set the standard"" with my brothers. That Im like my bio-moms family and need to just cave to Ndads demands and control and God will punish me for what ive done and my disobedience.

Guys Im 27, I moved back bc a masters program was a scammy thing and put me 30k in the hole without making any progress to med school. I made good on my mil contract to get a different degree. planned on internship for summer so I could move out then.

now Im leaving for good. this all just proved that the gaslighting really had me delusional about their abuse and the past abuse. They had me in the honeymoon/scapegoat phase after Id done a ton for them and helped out all holiday season. 

Im moving out for good and the Army is helping me pay for three months rent with an emergency family fund I donate to periodically.  It's possible to escape their bullshit and live your own life 
they will try to hurt you really bad when you go, but dont listen, they know their control is slipping. 

you guys can escape too. Im just happy to be moving out for good now. "

While applying for 2nd year internships I started to realize that the traditional method of applying to jobs with a resume/cover letter are not the way to go, but I haven't figure out what is. I've started talking to people who are more in tune with the silicon valley/tech world and it seems like you should be:

\- sending cold emails to recruiters

\- finding random people on LinkedIn that work at your ""dream"" company and messaging them asking for referrals 

\- unless cover letters are mandatory don't bother

\- find startup companies and send them emails regardless of whether they have a careers page (they are likely too small to have one but are looking to hire)

amyk7m,1,2019-02-04,"38 [M4f] The Office Bet: Feminist Marketing Intern vs Alpha Director of Sales (MDom, Reluc, Dub-Con, Size Difference)",[deleted],DPP_Workshop,https://www.reddit.com/r/DPP_Workshop/comments/amyk7m/38_m4f_the_office_bet_feminist_marketing_intern/,"I worked with your father and despite being younger than him I am somehow his boss (probably because I graduated from an Ivy league and well.. your poor Dad didn't)

I'm kind of a bully around the office but I'm tolerated because I actually deliver results (both because I'm actually somewhat intelligent and also because my family has old-money connections which allows me to get meetings that people like your father couldn't dream of scheduling).  I'm a total loud mouth who is above the rules - I come in an hour or two late every day. No tie. Sleeves rolled up.. walking in like I own the place. The HR complaints are rampant but between understanding exactly what I can get away with and putting up numbers nobody else can touch ... the powers that be look the other way. You must have thought my parents owned a huge share in the company with what I was able to do and they didn't - which made it all the more infuriating to you. 

Your Dad got you a summer internship and because you can't stand types like me, and you have nothing to lose you seem to be the only one in the office who tries to remind me of my place. You didn't want a job here anyway - you're just doing it for the resume padding - so I don't have the leverage of holding a potential job over your head. *At least you had that.* You were gonna go work for a humanitarian organization that helped abused women as soon as you graduated - watching me and my underlings hoot and howl as we mocked that Gillette ad and toxic masculinity in my office cemented that for you. 

To avoid conflict of interests - you were put in the marketing division and not in sales with me and your Pops. This further emboldened you to remind me of things like proper workplace attire, the time work starts, and that I shouldn't be obsessed with my fantasy football league on my phone during joint division meetings. In fact you, were like a tiny hero to your colleagues - mostly women who were equally sick of my chest pounding every time I brought it another couple million for my division. I made sure everyone knew - and you at least tried to make sure I knew how apathetic you were about your internship and how that meant you could challenge me openly since, as you constantly reminded me, you didn't want to work here anyway. 

Anyhow the office does something called ""Summer Olympics"" as a team building outing where we compete in some fun physical challenges. You realize you're being put up against me in a physical activity you excel in (perhaps swimming or hurdles) and while I'm in great physical shape, I'm 10+ years out of college at a desk job, and you're on the swimming/track team and practicing almost everyday -  the event didn't rely on raw physical strength (which is what you associated as my strong suite since you totally didn't catch yourself checking out my tanned forearms or feel that quiver in your knees when I tower almost two feet above you) so you thought you had a chance to finally publicly humiliate the alpha dog.

We make a side bet unknown to the rest of the company that if you win - I surrender my parking spot (right in front - where everyone could see whatever my new car was for the quarter) for the rest of the year to your Dad (he's been taking my shit long enough and his bone spurs are starting to bother him) but if I win - you have to do my laundry for the rest of your internship (a month or so - it wouldn't be so bad).

What you don't know is that my alpha male sweat and musk has a stronger than expected reaction with you - and my pheromones seemed to induce submission...

Your disdain for me when I first drop off my laundry (mostly my sweat soaked gym clothes) in front of everyone at the office, including your father, makes it all the sweeter...

-----

On the surface I'm looking for that younger woman with Daddy issues whose biology betrays her into lusting for a big, manly, older stud to breed her into submission. Something we all know and love! 

But outside of that I really want someone who can flash a personality - even when doing the most submissive of acts. Nothing get's me going more than realistic, fiery, passionate, multifaceted dynamic between two individuals. Yes I'm dominant, yes you're submissive but how do they play out? How do you reconcile your authentic feminist views with someone you view as misogynist? Do you make sure to verbally insult him at every turn while your body does his bidding? Does that just turn you on more? 

Or do you get to know him and realize some of his more obnoxious qualities are just symptoms of character values that you actually have been missing with your relationships? Between endless lessons of learning how he likes his cock deepthroated do you actually engage in conversations which make you say ""Fucking shit - I could actually fall for this big fuck"" 

**Kinkwise I think I've covered mostly everything. What I really want is dynamics! Also I'm kind of a hopeless romantic **

**My limits are: Lame replies. Anyone less than 18 years old IRL as well as in the scene . Poop. Pee. Death. Physical beatings as a way of control. Anything super unrealistic some exaggeration is good fun**

A good reply is something that shows thought about anything I wrote above. I like to get to know people before we jump into where the peen goes. 

Thank you for reading!

The first time we met, everything was going smoothly and we finish the night at my home
But during this night, I learned that she was dumped by her ex-boyfriend just before Christmas when this dude came back from a 3 month internship abroad, and because of that, she have hard time to regain trust on people, especially guys.

And after that, we continue to see each other and talking 
So when we were in my home, we had slept in the same bed, but I didn't do anything because, first I was afraid and second, I think it was a bad thing to profytate of the fragility of someone. 
Sometimes she said that I'm really important for her or when her depression and anxiety would be gone, she would need me. 
But at the same time, she reminds me that she don't know when she could be retrust someone or other things like this.

And during the month, she has leave the city for two weeks, because everything made her think about her ex boyfriend and she hated it.
So I waited for her, it was hard for me and it was a this  moment I know I got feelings for her ...
We had see each other last Wednesday, it was really great, we were more tactile to each other, but I didn't try anything more, even when the occasion was great. I wanted more, but I was afraid.

Still, I'm seeing her, Tuesday to eat ""Crepes"",(it's a special week for this, in my country) and I'm still asking myself, if it's ok to try to kiss her and see where it gets me

TL,DR : It's been 1 month that's I met this girl, she has lack of trust on guy since her last relationship, but when we are together, everything is great
I will see her again next Tuesday and I'm still asking myself of what to do during this ""date"""
amza1c,2,2019-02-04,26[M4F] Learning to code.,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/amza1c/26m4f_learning_to_code/,"""Calm down. Deep breaths. Tell me what's going on.""

The unthinkable had happened. Relatively new and hip as it was, your job at a media company evaporated overnight, and you weren't even a glorified quiz writer like the lot of your colleagues, oh no. You used to be a strong, proud woman bringing to light minority issues and exposing injustice with opinion pieces. People called you a journalist. That's why you were on the phone with a high school classmate, crying your heart out.

""It's okay, it's okay. You've been through worse, you can manage.""

But you hadn't. School to college to a secure salary with a lot of investment behind your employer, you'd lived a good life, and then... Then all the disgusting bigots on Twitter were laughing at you, repeating that awful ""learn to code"" mantra over and over again! They showed no respect to your degree and experience, and outright proposed a blue collar job to a white collar intellectual!

""Eh, don't mind them. People can be mean, but that's all they are. Words on the internet can't hurt you, can they now?""

They could, and they did. You were better than you cared to show, though. Smarter. Quicker to react. Out of all problems, the bigots were right about one: you had no job, and in this economy, you had to secure one fast. You weren't going to announce it, and you weren't going to wait for the rest of your former colleagues to understand how right the trolls were. Of course it wasn't a coincidence that this classmate of yours worked at a tiny tech startup. He would surely teach you how to code, maybe even secure you an internship for the time being?

""Sure thing, we'll talk. Come up to our office tomorrow morning, we'll see how you can make this work. Just remember, tech is a little different from journalism. Don't be surprised if you find things unusual.""

You would come. Of course you would. After all, your old job was already being done by a new employee, on a wage instead of salary, and a laughable one at that.

So this story is inspired by recent events in the media, and covers the story of a former writer at not-buzzfeed (bonus points for the character being feminist, lesbian, minority, you name it) trying hard to outsmart everyone and actually learn to code to make a living. She's in for a rough awakening, as it turns out tech doesn't want to teach her to code from the ground up, and would rather have her for her other important assets.

Message me with what kind of character you want to play, and what kind of kinks you want to incorporate into the story."
amzctc,5,2019-02-04,My Parents blame me for my social phobia,EchoJunior,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/amzctc/my_parents_blame_me_for_my_social_phobia/,"Social anxiety/phobia, I always had it.


During K-12 it was to the point of selective mutism. The only reason I responded to ppl (if they asked me sth) that time, although in the volume of an ant,  was because I didn't want to stuck out in the crowd



I graduated college, dropped outta grad school (long story but also related to my social anxiety) several months ago, so my parents so graceously let me live in their apartment in my old childhood room. It had a calming effect, actually, all my old stuff surrounding me.


But whenever either of my parents are pissed off about sth, they direct their anger at me somehow, in an illogical fashion. I try to explain the logical flaw they have but *they* yell *I* am the one talking bullshit. I'm done at this point. And they know what phrases hurts me most, and probably for most social anxiety sufferers. Crazy bitch, threatening to call the police and have me thrown out. You know how when you are in your depressed period, you have barely any energy left to even get out of the bed? I'm in that state, so I need to shut the fuck up and listen to them yelling. I'm not a perfect daughter so I also say hurtful things, but that's because my somewhat peaceful lunch has been destroyed by them calling me (literally) 'that's why you are a crazy bitch', 'human garbage',  and it's the only time they bring up Western culture - young adults 'kicked out' to live on their own.

But I know these days, it's impossible for almost every country, So many young adults live with their parents. It changed for us millenials. But my parents only know things they watched from American movies and 80s/90s/early 00's trend of young people living on their own.


They pull that bullshit out and guess what, when it comes to physical violence, 'when in Roma, follow the Roman rules, father rushes into my room all buffed up, order me to take off my glasses. Which means he's gonna punch hell outta me including my face, I may be masculine but he still has that old notion of femals have to have beautiful faces. When I started dressing up like a guy (just simply I liked it), he give all the toxic masculanity to me.'You have short hair, deal with it, guys deal with it all the time. Um excuse me that's was 50 years ago in this shithole of a country, and it is slowly spreading that it is OK for guys to show feminine side. Maybe not yet in my region. 



The comments and talk behind the back that drove me to a complete mental breakdown in high school, to the point where  I was too tense WHENEVER, 24/7. Even in my own room alone. My muscles all over my body was tense, including my face. I was afraid to look up at the teacher's board becuse I was frightened to death about locking eyes with anyone. It was so serious in high school, that some teachers/kids looked at me weirdly. That alone was uncomfortable, but at least they were kind enough to not comment about it unelss I'm a close friend. that's when I leaved in the US for a short while. I'm dragged back to my born country, a 2nd world with too much competition that thousands of teens commit suicide after the annual University Entrance Exam.


Rambling aside, both my parents yell at me 'that's why you are crazy, oh you crazy bitch. Why don't you try to leave a normal life?'



I TRY SO HARD. I TRY SO HARD NOT TO LET MY LEGS WOBBLE WHEN I SET FOOT AOUTSIDE THE APARMENT, I can't socially function normally w/o my prescription anxiety pills. My doc told me tey are addictive for some reason (it just makes you sleep)


Blaming ME for a wooden decorative frame something falling out of my room's door (which is physically unlikely probably), when in reality, it's because the apartment is getting old. They complained about nothing when my brother's door did the same thing a long time ago, even joked and laughed about it. But in my case? I slammed my door several times when they were saying hurtful shits because I'm not a perfect human being. I'm not specially kind. I'm just normal/ maybe above average, when it comes to moral issues. But they call me human trash, crazy bitch, all the phrases I TOLD them years ago, in high school, when I had my first breakdown.






I should be grateful to those two people giving me a roof and a safe place to stay without having to become homeless in a 2nd world where there are barely any shelters for homeless people, let alone those for women. AND for those with severe social anxiety, they hesitate to make a call to order a pizza.


Since I am legally adult, BOTH team up and YELL at me, threatening to call the police to get me kicked out. I know they have all the right. But I know (and they know) the moment I actually completely get out, I have barely enough money for barely a month's rent and I have literally no idea where to start, small things like all the paper works, because I was raised in an overprotective environment. I am way too naive/clueless when it comes to socialization stuff.


My mother mocks me 'well you got a lotta money!' I regularly show her my bank account to let her know and to get her in the loop, just as a daughter does. Then I get this. It's not even a lot. Just enough for a shitty apartment's downpayment + one months' rent &amp; bills &amp; and food.


My brother, whom I'm most close to in a friendship way, is away on mandatory army service. My sister, US citizen, (born there) currently having a very successful carreer. From what I learned from both of my parents totally wrecked relative things (we literally have no relatives lmao, even when they have siblings).


From that, I know sibling relationships are important. I'm on the verge of entering a prooer adult world, and I am terrified of how my sibling relationships are gonna change. Mu sister and I aren't that close, but she's nice enough share my thoughts that I would do with my friends (but I have no friends lmao). She even let me stay at her place in NYC when I visited her for a couple weeks as a graduation present from my sister. My mother actually gave the fund so sister could not be burdened by me.


My sister, she is one of those people you see on NYC - clean- cut, sharp, very intelligent, confident.. and also beautiful. She's in a completely different social league than I am. She lived in the US for a while now, so she seems to have her personality Americanized, and my parents don't understand it. Saying my sister is 'arrogant' 'I earn more than my parents' things. To survive in NYC as someone working in one of the top law firms, I know it takes certain confidence, socialism, likeabilty, *in addition* to intellectual ability.




I eat food in my room alone, to make my parents feel like I don't exist, and I offer to take out the trash sometimes. I mostyl stay quiet.



I love my mother (my father seems to be a bit of a narcissist with anger issues - common traits for ppl in the filed of academia), she is perfect to me, but I go fucking crazy when she yells stuff like 'that's why you are a crazy bitch', and other worse words with similar meanings that cannot be translated into English.


I heard those every fucking day during high school, my grades flushed down the toilet, I almost got to the point where I was almost on the border of schizophrenia.




You know, I might be wrong, but when I see lots of American/Canadian movies, escpecially recent ones, lots of young adults live with their parents. They are even allowed to drive the car! My father is obssessed with his car, so I'm not allowed, and if I ask he makes excuses like I haven't really' got the experience - but I have 2 fucking licenses. Motor bike and a standard car. I see all those American teens getting to drive a car (I don't care the brand or how old the car is. I just want one of my own.) in movies, and during my time in an America high school, I was jealous of all the kids even younger than me driving home.


Well cars are expenseive, so I turned to sports bikes - I always loved casual cycling, took a class last summer, and ever since I and *dying* to get a sports bike of my own.



I know they have maintenence fees if I own one (plus the gas  is almost 5-10 times more expensive than that of the US!), but that will motivate me to work odd jobs here and there. It would give me more confidence, because I can actually 'do' something that is 'big'. Yeah driving a vehicle is a bigass deal for me. I won't even get a chance to borrow my father's old second car (he's OCD, checking all the cctvs in the parking lot if his new Bentz has a slight splotch, spending the ENTIRE day to find who did that.).

He won't even allow it. At this point, I'm done getting their permission, I'm spending half of my savings to buy a bike. I applied nursing colleges, I'm pretty sure I will be rejected from both


You know that tightening feeling in the chest? I'mm trying to control that, so I can finally make up my mind to go browse the Honda/Yamaha/Kawasaki shops around my region. I'm just too tied. I can play video games but I want other things.


I'm jsut fucking exhausted and frustrated. I want to immigrate to the US eventually, by becoming a registered nurse, (currently waiting if I am accepted a nursing college). Or Canada, because I heard it's more friendlier to immigrants? idk. That way I can keep in touch with my sister who is so busy with her work. She's one of my life models. She's confident, smart (not only intellectually, but also with social stuff, logic, etc.). Plus there are some social/political reason. The politics in S.Korea is very unstable, as most ppl know, and all they do turns out shit. The education system changes every goddamn year. Just confusing as fuck. And they don't even allow same sex themes to be even mentioned in the media. There are censorship, oh yes. And as a nurse, Korean hospitals treat them like orderlies (not that orderlies are bod, they are an important part of the hospital). But RNs spent thousands of dollars to get that RN-BSN and studies an enormous amount, almost similar to that of a med school student. But they are just...nothing. For example, there are no anesthetic nurse thing here. The MD in anesthetics do all the procedure during surgery. Nurses are blatantly looked down upon doctors, even from those interns who just graduated from med school. And the nursing society here is extremely toxic, even when compared to other countries. There are always 2 or 3 RNs per year ending their own lives in a big hospital. Peer pressure, bullying, all that female aggression shit. It is common for a senior RN to pick out who she doesn't like, and give her all the bad shift hours, making her miserable. I hate that. I just want to focus on work. Btw male nurses are welcomes with open hands. There are few males in the nursing industry, we need more of them. But for now, they are paid more, adored by senior nurses, given chances to participate in some procedures as they are 'stronger' than the general female nurses. Yeah gender wage gap is not often coming up here, as every 2nd world country does. All the women in dramas are housewives, talking to their husbands in 'upper form' while husbands talk to his wife like talking to a child.

My parents are currently bashing my sister for she couldn't come visit this year. Well, she told me there was some shitstorm at her work (a good one, fortunately), so she had to keep in touch with a lot of people. She is needed and loved by employers. She can actually do something to the benefit of the US economy (she works tax thing). And I admire her for that. I didn't get a chance to be close with her since she went to dorm school since high school, and went to a university in the US.


I attempted to get a working holiday visa to Canada, got rejected for some reason. I was trying really experience the culture there. Unlike most people who go on that visa, I am comfortable enough with English, so for me it was more like getting the feel of the Canadian culture, and how the society works. I spent several years in the US during childhood, so I know basics. But it seems the US just heightened their borders, so I'm aiming for Canada instead...I also prefer the snow &amp; quiet (relative). Idk I love snow.


Thank you for reading my rant. Now I'm calm and stopped crying lol"
amzfh2,0,2019-02-04,Types of employment 40 hours or less,SantaClaus3,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/amzfh2/types_of_employment_40_hours_or_less/,"Hi!  I‚Äôll be graduating with an environmental engineering degree in June. I enjoyed school and am good at it, 3.74 gpa (but I had to work my ass off for that). However, I am definitely not going to be happy if my future job is hugely stressful, corporate, you‚Äôre expected to work like a slave, if you have to spend the majority of your time just... plugging numbers in a spreadsheet and constantly tweaking some stupid design  or PowerPoint presentation on a computer, going to mindless meetings, faking your emotions, pretending to be excited about some company‚Äôs mumbo-jumbo bs... 

all day for 60 hours a week... 30 years... 

dealing with any form of corporate bureaucracy for that matter. I won‚Äôt tolerate another minute of it and I don‚Äôt want to have to squeeze myself into any mold that I‚Äôm not meant to fit in. It‚Äôs all bullshit to me and even if I did try to fit the mold I‚Äôd probably eventually have a mental breakdown in front of everyone. 

I‚Äôm speaking from past experience at two different internships in two consulting firms. One small (run by nut jobs who farted loudly and verbally or even sexually harassed employees on a regular basis) and one big (felt like a.. creepy entity filled with zombies on their computers who‚Äôs souls were crushed long ago). 

Basically, I hope to get a job that‚Äôs somewhat enjoyable, ideally 40 hours or less a week (I have tons of hobbies that have nothing to do with engineering like writing music, art, nerding out on geography, politics, language learning, reading books, experiencing wild travel and outdoor adventures...). 

I don‚Äôt care about climbing no corporate ladder, getting a PE in four years, making water taste sweeter, cleaning up all the nasty chemicals in the ground that gas stations out there because Americans need cars and cars need gas and Americans need cars because it‚Äôs just how America works... sure maybe the rewards of working hard and dedicating my life for ten years to just, being a really good engineer would pay off.. 

but frankly I don‚Äôt care. 

I just want to make cash so I can pick up my hobbies and maybe go back to school for a global studies or art degree or something.. because learning is so fun and it‚Äôs the kind of challenge I actually enjoy.  But not learning how to fit into a corporate environment. 

if I pushed myself I might be one of those really creative engineering types who invents new stuff. But frankly... I just don‚Äôt take engineering seriously enough... at least not compared to how it seems all my classmates/colleagues appear to... and with that attitude I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be someone you‚Äôd want to have stamp designs lol. 

TLDR:

Jobs for someone who‚Äôs top priority is work life balance? 


UPDATE:



Wow I didn't expect so many replies! thank you to those who actually gave solid advice and didn't jump to conclusions about me (which may be tempting due to the nature of what I have written).



To summarize what I'm reading, in general:

-go work for a public firm (yes, I most likely will. Several classmates completed internships with the City of ____ and had nothing but good things to say. Or there is this other company that looks really great and I have heard nothing but good things about it.. I became cynical after the two experiences I had. Does not mean I'm giving up hope on finding a job in engineering I enjoy, but my post does make it sound like that for sure).

-Find a different career (considering that, but if, putting my terrible attitude aside for a second here, academic performance as a STEM student as well as the ability to communicate well have any viability in eventually becoming a good engineer, I do want to try it out for a while)

-and other stuff that prioritizes things like financial security...

A few responses.

Financial security, I believe, is something that can be accomplished by defining what your priorities are. My priorities are to live a simple life (dare I say, minimalist), not have anyone to else care for (I'm ace, so it won't be an issue for me), and to keep learning the truths of life until the day I die. I also want to maximize my own potential to make the world better and be happy myself. I just don't know how quite yet, and I'm trying to figure that out.

Unfortunately from my very limited experience, it feels like school in no way reflects the real world. Which was hinted at to me by my superiors, yet not fully articulated. And usually discussed in a positive manner. Like, ""Once you get a job, it will be great! School's the toughest part"". --But I spend 60 hours doing school each week, and enjoy it--It's fun and fulfilling (although granted it takes time away from other things I enjoy, which I listed above, but I'm not giving up hope that it will be worth the sacrifice).

I am very naive, I admit it. Actually, to take it even farther, I know nothing.

To address why I picked environmental engineering:

I saved up some money before school, then hitchhiked, volunteered, and couch surfed in a lot of places, came back realizing the excesses of the my culture, and how it has its priorities backwards (from my own personal perspective. If I am wrong, call me out on this). I then decided the best thing I could probably do with my brain is become an environmental engineer. At least I would have some knowledge in finding ways to improve the human condition, and the condition our world is in. Tying into that, I think it's the curiosity I have for... stuff(?) that drove me to engineering, because it combines some really awesome things about existence, like math, science, communication and creativity, into one field. If this is engineering, I want this (while sparing ~10 hours a week to study a language and play an instrument :) ). If engineering is becoming a zombie at a computer desk for sixty hours a week to climb up a corporate ladder, obtain badges and honors, earn a high salary (what for?), I don't want that, or need it. If I am being naive here, please help educate me. I don't want to be this cynical, and I do want hope!!!

One last thing. I have heard/read that getting an engineering degree still promotes marketability for other fields. From the limited knowledge I have, I assume these may include academia/research, becoming a technical writer, teachings... anything else?

Any thoughts on this?

Oh also a four day work week... what's the likelihood of landing that (and still being willing to put in 40-50 hrs?).

amzv7m,55,2019-02-04,I wrote an article about CFS/ME leading to feelings of inadequacy and failure + a little revelation I recently had. How do others deal with this sort of thing? [Article text below],JackACR,cfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/amzv7m/i_wrote_an_article_about_cfsme_leading_to/,"One of the hardest things I‚Äôve had to face since being diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ‚Äì right up there with all of the pain, fatigue and brain fog ‚Äì is feeling like a failure.

Before I was ill, I had one goal and one goal alone. I was going to be a journalist, and nothing was going to stop me. I was your typical Type A; working hard to become a success was a major priority, second only to family. I was doing okay, too. I‚Äôd got my undergraduate degree, done an internship at BBC Television and was studying for a master‚Äôs degree in communication.

But, like so many people with CFS and other chronic illnesses, so much was taken away from me once I became ill. I had to drop out of university, move back in with my parents, and, suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt even write a sentence let alone an article. There was pain, nausea and plenty of other symptoms, but the biggest blow was the fact that my dream had disintegrated right in front of my eyes. I saw myself as having gone from a promising young journalist to a complete failure in a matter of weeks.

Eight years later, I still struggle with feelings of inadequacy and failure. Just to lay it out there, I‚Äôm thirty-one, I live in my parents‚Äô spare room, I‚Äôm still ill, and I‚Äôm perpetually broke. On top of that, I see my peers (friends, former colleagues etc.) excelling and achieving amazing things. It‚Äôs difficult not to compare myself to them. I‚Äôm pleased for them, of course, but their success always makes me wonder what experiences and achievements I‚Äôve missed out on by becoming ill.

Obviously, I shouldn‚Äôt be torturing myself like that. Having CFS is not my fault, just the same as with all other sufferers. Additionally, I know I‚Äôm very lucky in that my profession of choice (writing) is something that can be done from the house, and physically speaking it doesn‚Äôt require too much energy ‚Äì I can at least work a bit.

This is not the same for many other sufferers of CFS/ME. In my case (and following a modest improvement in my health) I have at least managed to carve out some kind of writing career; I‚Äôve written a few books and I write the odd article too. However, I know I‚Äôm nothing like the productive and healthy version of me would be, and that is often frustrating.

But, recently, I‚Äôve had something of a revelation. The other day, I completed a major writing project and found myself confused as to why I wasn‚Äôt suddenly happy and fulfilled. Surely completing projects means that I‚Äôm not a failure anymore, right? A short while later, I complimented another writer on a piece they‚Äôd written and got much more of a buzz from their happy reaction than I did from finishing my own project. That really made me stop and think.

I realised that, since becoming ill, I‚Äôd spent so long agonising over what I had and hadn‚Äôt achieved that I‚Äôd forgotten something I really shouldn‚Äôt have. Being a kind person is far more important than where I am in my career. The next time I feel like a failure, I‚Äôm going to try and remember that!

- Jack Croxall

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Even when I had recovered enough from CFS to start working a little, I got more satisfaction from a small act of kindness than I did from completing a (relatively) major work project."
an1qsn,34,2019-02-04,I was just an animal bred for their tricks,PotentialWalk,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/an1qsn/i_was_just_an_animal_bred_for_their_tricks/,"I've been thinking about my childhood and adulthood. I am a 24 (m), 25 this year. 

I've come to the conclusion my whole life I was basically a dog, trained behaviorally to do what my parents wanted. Any misstep out of their pre-ordained will was punished with unending criticism, especially from my mom. My dad is so aloof he wouldn't stand up for himself. 

There was no mercy in my household. What bothers me the most was the constant Orwellian surveillance. My mom checking my back account regularly and commenting on my spending, incessant checking of my grades and homework, asking me if I had done my homework etc. 

I remember one evening in college (I lived at home which was a nightmare) I told her I was going swing dancing with some friends. Her response? ""You dont know how to swing dance.""
 
I couldn't even share my successes. In college I was doing graduate work in counseling. My professor asked me to intern with him at his private practice. At the end he suggested I could go for my doctorate. I was so excited! I told my mother. Big mistake. Her response. ""I don't see you doing doctoral work.""

Does the pain end? I can't see past my grief...."

Veiligheid over het bericht ‚ÄòHet rommelt in de straffabrieken van het  
OM‚Äô&amp;#40;ingezonden 5 december 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het onderzoek uit het NRC-artikel, waaruit blijkt  
dat het openbaar ministerie &amp;#40;OM&amp;#41; onterecht straffen uitdeelt? Zo ja, bent u  
geschrokken door dit nieuws? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
Kloppen de genoemde cijfers in het NRC-artikel wat betreft het aantal zaken  
dat is afgedaan met een strafbeschikking waarbij de schuld van een  
verdachte niet adequaat is vastgesteld? Hoe verklaart u deze aantallen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 1 en vraag 2  
Ja, ik heb van de berichtgeving kennisgenomen. Nee, ik ben daar niet van  
geschrokken. Zoals ik heb toegelicht in mijn brief van 19 december 2018[1]  
werden de genoemde cijfers onjuist gebruikt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Wat is uw reactie op de in het NRC-artikel genoemde casussen, waaruit  
blijkt dat er soms straffen voor het verkeerde feit zijn opgelegd door het  
OM? Hoe heeft dit kunnen gebeuren en vindt u dit acceptabel?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
Uit het door het Openbaar Ministerie &amp;#40;OM&amp;#41; verrichte onderzoek kan niet  
worden afgeleid dat de schuld van een verdachte niet adequaat is  
vastgesteld of straffen zijn opgelegd voor het verkeerde feit. Het betreft  
een intern kwaliteitsinstrument binnen het OM waarin steekproefsgewijs  
dossiers zijn getoetst door collega-officieren. Het onderzoek, en daarmee  
de genoemde aantallen uit dit onderzoek, hebben dan ook geen betrekking op  
de rechtmatigheid van de door officieren van justitie uitgevaardigde  
strafbeschikkingen. Het OM gebruikt dergelijke onderzoeken om de  
uitvoeringspraktijk te kunnen verbeteren. Daar was dit onderzoek ook op  
gericht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wel is uit de rapportages uit 2014 en 2017 van de procureur-generaal bij de  
Hoge Raad[2] die toezicht houdt op het OM, duidelijk geworden dat er in de  
begin jaren na de invoering van de strafbeschikking door het OM niet altijd  
sprake was van een goede registratie van de schuldvaststelling.  
Met behulp van het Kwaliteitsprogramma Strafvordering OM2020 zijn  
hieromtrent verbeteringen doorgevoerd. De voortgang van de verbeteringen  
wordt door het OM gemonitord door middel van metingen. Ik onderschrijf de  
verbeteringen en genomen maatregelen door het OM volledig. Het is van  
belang dat het OM blijvend prioriteit geeft aan het verbeteren van de  
kwaliteit en door middel van metingen en audits het effect meet van de  
genomen maatregelen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Is het u bekend in hoeveel gevallen, sinds het begin van het werken met de  
strafbeschikking, de schuld van een verdachte niet adequaat is vastgesteld  
door het OM of zelfs straffen zijn opgelegd voor het verkeerde feit? Zo ja,  
om hoeveel gevallen gaat het? Zo nee, bent u bereid dit te onderzoeken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
Voor de cijfers en een toelichting daarop verwijs ik u naar mijn brief van  
19 december 2018.[3] Zoals reeds aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 3, kan  
op basis van de cijfers niet worden gezegd dat er sprake was van een  
onjuiste schuldvaststelling. Wel is het juist dat in een aantal gevallen  
sprake was van een onvolledige interne registratie van de  
schuldvaststelling. De procureur-generaal bij de Hoge Raad die toezicht  
houdt op het OM, constateerde dit reeds in 2014. Met behulp van het  
Kwaliteitsprogramma Strafvordering OM2020 heeft het OM hieromtrent  
verbeteringen doorgevoerd.[4]  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Wat vindt u van de stellingname dat het OM zich verdedigt met de  
argumentatie dat er niet per se sprake is van een onterechte bestraffing  
maar dat de gegevens van het NRC slechts aangeven dat er over een bepaalde  
zaak ook anders gedacht zou kunnen worden? Vindt u deze werkwijze wenselijk  
en getuigen van voldoende zorgvuldigheid? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, wat gaat u  
hier tegen doen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
Ik verwijs naar het antwoord op vraag 3. Zoals ik ook aangaf in mijn brief  
aan uw Kamer van 19 december 2018 over de evaluatie van de Wet OM-  
afdoening[5], onderschrijf ik de handelswijze van het OM om geconstateerde  
gebreken aan te pakken en ‚Äì mede door inzet van een interne  
kwaliteitssystematiek ‚Äì structureel verbetering te brengen in de uitvoering  
van de OM-strafbeschikking.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
Klopt het, dat er soms geen dossiers worden bijgehouden door het OM en het  
bewijs waarop de strafbeschikking is gebaseerd, dus niet is terug te  
vinden? Zo ja, vindt u dit ook uitermate zorgelijk? Zo nee, waarom wordt  
dit dan toch geschreven in het reeds aangehaalde NRC-artikel?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
Zoals reeds aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 4, is het juist dat in een  
aantal gevallen sprake was van een onvolledige interne registratie. De  
toezichthoudende procureur-generaal bij de Hoge Raad constateerde dit reeds  
in het in antwoord op vraag 3 genoemde rapport uit 2014. Overigens wordt  
hierbij opgemerkt dat een onvolledige interne registratie in de eigen  
systemen van het OM geenszins betekent dat in de betreffende zaken  
voorafgaand aan de beslissing van het OM geen kennis is genomen van  
bijvoorbeeld in politiesystemen vastgelegde relevante informatie.  
Met behulp van het Kwaliteitsprogramma Strafvordering OM2020 heeft het OM  
hieromtrent verbeteringen doorgevoerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Klopt het, dat als een strafbeschikking aan de rechter wordt voorgelegd, de  
rechter uiteindelijk maar in een derde van de gevallen de straf handhaaft  
die het OM had opgelegd? Wat vindt u van deze cijfers? Rechtvaardigen deze  
cijfers een onafhankelijk onderzoek naar het omgaan met de strafbeschikking  
door het OM? Zo ja, wanneer kunnen wij dit onderzoek verwachten? Zo nee,  
waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
Het verzetspercentage in misdrijfzaken fluctueert de afgelopen jaren tussen  
de 12% en 14%. Voor de periode 2015-2017 werd 78% van de verzetzaken op  
zitting behandeld. Van de verzetzaken die op zitting worden behandeld  
leidt:  
- 24% tot een vrijspraak of ontslag van alle rechtsvervolging;  
- 64% tot een veroordeling met strafoplegging;  
- 6% tot schuldigverklaring zonder straf.  
In de overige gevallen is het OM niet ontvankelijk of is het verzet niet  
ontvankelijk.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Door de procureur-generaal bij de Hoge Raad die toezicht houdt op het OM,  
zijn reeds onafhankelijke onderzoeken ingesteld naar de uitvoering door het  
OM van de OM-strafbeschikking. Ook bij de recente evaluatie van de werking  
van de Wet OM-afdoening[6] was sprake van een onafhankelijk onderzoek. De  
uitkomsten van metingen en de meest recente cijfers in het kader van het  
kwaliteitsprogramma Strafvordering OM2020 van het OM laten een verbetering  
zien van de juridische kwaliteit in de toepassing van OM-  
strafbeschikkingen. Zo is bijvoorbeeld het aantal vrijspraken in 2018  
gedaald naar 21%, vond in 69% strafoplegging plaats en is het aantal  
schuldigverklaringen zonder straf gedaald naar 5,4%. Om deze reden acht ik  
een nieuw onafhankelijk onderzoek onnodig. De door het OM genomen  
maatregelen onderschrijf ik volledig. Het is van belang dat het OM  
prioriteit geeft aan het blijvend verbeteren van de kwaliteit.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
Klopt het, dat er strafbeschikkingen worden uitgedeeld zonder motivering?  
Acht u dit in lijn met de eisen van zorgvuldigheid die men mag verwachten  
bij een dusdanig verstrekkend middel? Zo ja, waarom?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
Zoals reeds aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 4, is het juist dat in een  
aantal gevallen sprake was van een onjuiste registratie van de  
schuldvaststelling. De procureur-generaal bij de Hoge Raad die toezicht  
houdt op het OM, constateerde dit reeds in 2014. Met behulp van het  
Kwaliteitsprogramma Strafvordering OM2020 heeft het OM hieromtrent  
verbeteringen doorgevoerd. Bij het vervolgrapport ‚ÄòWordt vervolgd: Beschikt  
en gewogen‚Äô geeft de toezichthoudende procureur-generaal bij de Hoge Raad  
onder andere aan dat de belangrijkste conclusie is dat het openbaar  
ministerie met grote inzet en voortvarendheid gevolg heeft gegeven aan zijn  
eerdere bevindingen. Op zowel het gebied van de schuldvaststelling, als de  
kwaliteit van de dossiers en de doorlooptijden, constateert hij dat  
duidelijk vooruitgang is geboekt &amp;#40;Kamerstukken II 2017/18, 29 279, nr.  
399&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
Klopt het, dat twee parketten in 2016 en 2017 dusdanig grote achterstanden  
hadden dat officieren van justitie samen met de rechtbanken zogenoemde  
‚Äúveegzittingen‚Äù organiseerden teneinde het OM in tientallen zaken niet-  
ontvankelijk te verklaren? Wat vindt u van deze gang van zaken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 9  
Het aantal strafbeschikkingen dat door ingesteld verzet tegen de  
strafbeschikking opnieuw bij het OM instroomde, en die moest worden  
beoordeeld en aan de rechter moest worden voorgelegd, was onverwacht hoog.  
De capaciteit van het OM, maar ook de afgesproken zittingscapaciteit, was  
daar niet op berekend, waardoor de doorlooptijd flink toenam. Dit heeft er  
toe geleid dat het OM vooral in 2014, 2015 en 2016 vele zaken heeft moeten  
seponeren vanwege de ouderdom en dat om diezelfde reden in andere zaken de  
officier van justitie niet-ontvankelijk is verklaard.  
In mijn brief aan uw Kamer van 19 december 2018[7] heb ik aangegeven dat  
bij de afdoening van dergelijke oude zaken een afweging wordt gemaakt of de  
doorlooptijd in een zaak van dien aard is dat voortzetting van de  
vervolging onredelijk zou zijn. De officier respectievelijk de rechter  
maken daarbij een afweging tussen de ernst van het delict en &amp;#40;de lengte van  
de periode van&amp;#41; rechtsonzekerheid waarin de verdachte gedurende de looptijd  
van het strafrechtelijke onderzoek en de vervolgingsfase heeft verkeerd.  
Vervolging zou in die gevallen onbillijk of ondoelmatig zijn, indien men  
tot de slotsom komt dat het belang van strafrechtelijk ingrijpen te gering  
is geworden of de ‚Äòredelijke termijn‚Äô van het EVRM is verstreken in verband  
met de lange tijd die is verstreken na het plegen van het strafbare feit.  
Ik betreur het dat het nodig was om zo veel zaken te seponeren, maar ben  
content met de door het OM getroffen maatregelen ter verbetering van de  
uitvoering van de OM-strafbeschikking.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
Bent u bereid te kijken naar de leesbaarheid en de duidelijkheid van de  
brieven die het Centraal Justitieel Incassobureau verstuurt? Zo nee, waarom  
niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10  
Ik vind het belangrijk dat iedereen de brieven van de overheid kan  
begrijpen, dit onderwerp heeft dan ook mijn aandacht. Het CJIB heeft in  
samenwerking met het OM diverse stappen gezet om de leesbaarheid en  
begrijpelijkheid van brieven van het CJIB te vergroten. Zo is in juli 2017  
de leesbaarheid van de verkeersboetes &amp;#40;Wahv&amp;#41; vergroot. Het uiterlijk is  
gemoderniseerd, de informatie over de overtreding en de hoogte van het  
boetebedrag is overzichtelijker weergegeven. Daarbij is het taalgebruik  
minder juridisch en op de boete staat informatie over  
betalingsmogelijkheden en op welke wijze beroep ingesteld kan worden. De  
verkeersboete is hierdoor beter begrijpelijk geworden voor bijvoorbeeld  
laaggeletterden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij de leesbaarheid van de strafbeschikking zie ik nog ruimte voor  
verbeteringen. Met betrekking tot de strafbeschikking stuurt het CJIB een  
brief uit met daarin de hoogte van de strafbeschikking. In deze brief wordt  
tevens medegedeeld dat de strafbeschikking mogelijk consequenties heeft  
voor de justiti√´le documentatie van de betrokkene en wordt verwezen naar  
een website waar nadere informatie te vinden is over justiti√´le  
documentatie. Met de strafbeschikking wordt een toelichting meegestuurd  
waarin uiteengezet wordt op welke wijze iemand in verzet kan gaan tegen de  
beslissing.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De brief en toelichting kunnen echter, net zoals bij de verkeersboetes het  
geval was, mogelijk in nog beter begrijpelijke taal en vorm worden  
ingericht. Het OM is daarom voornemens om samen met het CJIB de teksten van  
de brieven met betrekking tot de strafbeschikking te herzien. In het eerste  
kwartaal van 2019 worden daarover gesprekken gevoerd. Ik vind het een goede  
ontwikkeling dat het CJIB hier samen met het OM naar gaat kijken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
Bent u bereid, in ieder geval tot er orde op zaken is gesteld, er voor te  
zorgen dat gestopt wordt met het opleggen van strafbeschikkingen door het  
OM? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 11  
Nee. Bij brief van 19 december 2018 bood ik uw Kamer de beleidsreactie aan  
op het rapport ‚ÄòEvaluatie Wet OM-afdoening‚Äô.[8] Uit die evaluatie volgt dat  
de strafbeschikking een blijvende plek heeft veroverd in het Nederlandse  
sanctiebestel. De strafbeschikking draagt naar het oordeel van de  
onderzoekers bij aan de hoofdoelstellingen die ten grondslag lagen aan de  
Wet OM-afdoening, waaronder het vergroten van de doelmatigheid en het  
versterken van de juridische grondslag van de buitengerechtelijke  
afdoening.

an2u0j,37,2019-02-04,They're trying to control the one thing they said I could do on my own,Warriorette12,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/an2u0j/theyre_trying_to_control_the_one_thing_they_said/,"I'm a third year university student in the UK, from the US, which means I'm applying for grad programs this year. From the summer, my Nparents 'threatened' to make me go through the process of applying on my own, but I've been fine with it. I wrote up my personal statements, got my transcripts and passport/visa documents in order, and got my references. When I went home over the Christmas break, both my parents seemed surprised that I'd done so much on my own, but congratulated me and said that I didn't have to worry about the application fees because they'd send me the money for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Time comes for me to put all my applications together and I asked my mom to send me the money for the application with the closest deadline. She responds by saying 'give me an approximation of how much you need for all the applications so I can do one transfer' so I tell her the schools I'm applying to, how many programs for each school, and how much each application would cost, giving her a total amount in both dollars and pounds (because of the exchange rate), and letting her know I plan to send in all the applications within the week. She sends about $300 and tells me to let her know if/when I'll need more. This was Thursday. On Saturday, I have sent out half the applications and tell her I need more and give her the exact amount. She ignores my message to send me a link to something about summer internships. She then asks if I sent out all my Christmas cards. I say yes and ask her again to send the extra money for my fees. She says she hasn't sent it, but wants me to send her the email receipts for the applications I've submitted already. I do so, thinking that she'll only send the money once I do. No reply.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything goes down this morning, Monday, when I ask her again if she's sent the money because I don't see it in my account. She responds saying that I have no reason to send her so many messages about money for the fees, and that I should pay for the rest of my applications with my monthly allowance (which usually only barely covers food and transportation for the month) and she'll reimburse me. She says that if I want the money so badly and can't wait, I should ask my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

My response, verbatim: ""You told me over the break that you and Dad would handle my application fees. I am only messaging you because you said you would send extra and you haven't, so this is on you. If you didn't want to send the money, you could have said no so I feel ignored or led on. I am not going to spend my monthly food and transportation money for application fees if I can't trust you to reimburse me since you have gone back on sending the money upfront. I want my applications all done by the end of the week so I guess I'll ask Dad for the money. Sorry for bothering you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Two minutes later, I get a call from my dad asking ""what is this about you badgering your mother for money?"" and says my mom sent him a screenshot of the message I sent (apparently with no context) and he refuses to let me speak until he connects her to the call too. Before I can say anything, she starts going on about how I've been hounding her since Thursday asking for application fees and that my message was very rude and that I shouldn't have said 'this is on you'. She then BLATANTLY LIES to him, with me on the other end, saying that I never told her how much money I needed overall and that she gave me $300 to get started because she was being generous and that I'm just throwing it back in her face now, said that she didn't know that I was applying to more than just one school right now (so why send the $300 for one school?). My dad asks me why my message to my mom is so rude and that they don't deserve to be spoken to like that because they are my parents and ""we're here working our butts off for you and you repay us by being rude?!"" 

My mom reiterated that she wanted me to pay for my applications using my money out of my allowance and they'll pay me back later. I asked her ""how is that different than just paying me up front?"". She said ""I'm busy, I can't deal with this right now"" and left the call. My dad said that from now on, I will pay out of pocket and they will reimburse me, so I ask him the same question: ""how is that different than just paying me up front?"" He hung up on me.

&amp;#x200B;

They'll probably want me to come home for Easter. I'm not going.

EDIT: I took this post to r/relationships, asking how to move forward, and I‚Äôm saddened by the number of people saying I‚Äôm spoiled and entitled and that I should be grateful for what I‚Äôve already been given, or making excuses for my parents."

I'm a viz artist for a smallish architecture firm in South Carolina (started as an intern architect and sort of created this role for myself). I'm very comfortable in Revit, SketchUp, Lumion, Podium, and Photoshop (our current workflow for renderings and animations), but I want to hone my skills in 3ds max, vray (our office license is for 3ds max, so I've never used it with SketchUp), and Unreal (for VR applications). 

My question is this: are there any conferences (specifically in the US) anybody knows of that are specifically for arch viz? There seem to be tons for computer graphics, but they seem to be more catered to game developers/FX artists.  I know of d2 and Total Chaos, but I'm not sure my bosses will jump on board to send me to Austria or Bulgaria for a week. 

I know there are loads of free and low-cost resources for learning these programs online, but my bosses have specifically offered to send me to some conferences if I can find ones that are stateside...and who am I to turn down an all-expenses-paid trip?

Thanks for any help!"

an47zc,6,2019-02-04,[24/F] my mentor (sort of boss) confessed his feelings for me,ourinteractive,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/an47zc/24f_my_mentor_sort_of_boss_confessed_his_feelings/,"This was something that happened a few months ago. I'm mostly wondering if ladies here have dealt with/felt these similar emotions, which I don't even know are justified or not.

I interned in the summer during my graduate studies in New York for someone who was about 30, and the only one in charge of this small marketing department in a cultural organization. Very small staff, and very close group of friends I made in a short amount of time. I felt like even though these were people who'd been at the org for years and I was only an intern, we were best of friends immediately. Thus, my relationship with said boss was pretty friendly/not just a mentor-student dynamic, but he also taught me things and guided my projects day-to-day. 

So my last day of work, he lured me to a coffee shop under the guise of de-briefing on my internship experience (literally, he said let's get tea-- which we tend to do with a group of coworkers during the day-- but I said let's get boba and come back but he insisted on ""having a place to talk"" thus why I went to the cafe.) 

We talked for awhile but he basically said I actually have something to tell you-- to which I then immediately knew what was going to happen-- and he told me he had feelings for me. I get it, because our dynamic had always been of a comfortable friendship, but this was TOTALLY OUT OF THE BLUE FOR ME. I actually then told him I had a long-distance boyfriend (which I actually did but didn't mention over this internship because that relationship was ill-defined up to that point) and he seemed to jokingly say ""ah, I have competition."" To which I'm like.... no, you're not even in the race. Is it weird when you hear that from a guy, as if you were some trophy they could train for and win? Anyways, he then launched into this ""let me enumerate the reasons I like you"" and praised me for awhile for my personality/ambition. I'm sitting there awkwardly knowing I am trapped. He admitted he was about to ask me for drinks too. But just, a lot of what he said irked me through this convo. BUT he's a good guy, he knew he didn't want to abuse his power, and we left with me sort of just more-than-ever trying to keep everything super super platonic and veering away from personal territory.

My thing is: does this situation sicken you, if you've gone through something like this? I don't know why, but just the simple act of a guy liking you that you don't like (and don't have the faintest idea of his affection) makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable. This mentor knew I was leaving New York after this and said he would regret it if he didn't tell me. I think that's fair to some extent, but also feels completely unnecessary as I had never shown an ounce of interest in him, so what did he think it would accomplish aside from making me uncomfortably sit there, re-evaluating what the hell happened this summer.

I know this is in the past, and I'm not seeking any advice on how to deal with this any longer (our coworkers are all still in good terms after I left,) but I'm more CURIOUS if these feelings of disgust/creeped out-ness resonate with any other women? Even with guys who aren't overtly creepy... I can't quite put a finger on it."
an4fqh,1,2019-02-04,Internship Help,bmv17,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/an4fqh/internship_help/,"Hello all, sorry if this becomes a lengthy post I need some advice.

I am a current sophomore with a business administration and accounting double major, 100% leading towards accounting. I have a 3.368 GPA and currently taking Intermediate accounting 1 (have a 95% currently) and Cost account 1 (98% currently). I am behind in accounting due to the fact I came into college as a biology major, then switched to business and then added accounting start of my sophomore year. 

I have been applying for internships anywhere and everywhere, mainly in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Rarely do I hear back from any business or firms. If I do I get a screener and never make it past that. I think of my self as a pretty good interviewer (I guess not lol) with a strong resume and cover letter. I really want to get real world accounting experience to make myself a strong candidate for big 4 upon graduation. I am unsure if I want to do tax or auditing yet, honestly I'll take an internship in either. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I feel as though all my peers have internships already and I'm here continually applying and just hoping I can get past the screener if I even get one.

an4r22,2,2019-02-04,"Starting over: Lived in SF before during rough patch, debating moving back or to LA?",wanderwest3,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/an4r22/starting_over_lived_in_sf_before_during_rough/,"Hi Reddit!

Asked this in r/AskSF as well. TLDR at the end.

I am trying to decide between moving to SF or LA. *Note:* I am **NOT** asking which city is ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù better as I‚Äôve read through a ton of the other posts on here - I just want to get opinions on what might be a better fit for ME personally. I know ultimately only I can figure that out with time/experiences, but I do want to hear your perspectives based on my background/preferences.

**Context:** I was born and raised on the East Coast and spent the last \~6 years of my life working and living in Manhattan. I LOVE New York (how busy it is, global community, food, culture), but I need a change. During college, I visited SF for a week and fell in love with the city and made it a goal of mine to move out ever since. I visited another two times over the next several years to ‚Äúmake sure‚Äù it‚Äôs what I really wanted before initiating the conversation to transfer with my employer.

In July of this year, I moved out to SF (from NY) with my boyfriend of 4.5 years. Long story short, after signing a year lease, I found out in late September my now ex-boyfriend was cheating on me, which I did not see coming at all. On top of that, work and the rest of my personal life were just falling apart - I was working extremely long hours under high stress for a team that was VERY understaffed, didn‚Äôt have any friends in the SF office (SF in general) and would go days at a time without talking in person to another human being. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but I have never in my life hit rock bottom in terms of my mental health. I lost 40 lbs over the two months there from stress, slept maybe 4 hours on average a night, had panic attacks (first time in my life), woke up with excruciating back pain from being so physically tense and would vomit regularly from nausea/stress.

After I found out about the cheating and the extent of the lying, coupled with the way I was feeling physically and mentally, I pulled the plug on the apartment, SF, the relationship, my job (temporary leave) and went back to my parents‚Äô house. I decided I can‚Äôt live my life on this path and have since been speaking with a psychologist (4 months now), working out, eating right and journal/meditating.

Around 2.5 months after flying back to my parents‚Äô house, I decided to go to LA to visit a friend. This was the week that really turned things around for me (before that I woke up every day in crying/vomiting spells). I can‚Äôt pinpoint what it was exactly, but visiting my friend is where I started to genuinely feel again that there is more to life. I laughed, I took in the sun, listened to music in the traffic, went out to different restaurants/bars and just really started coming back to myself.

I‚Äôm at a much better place mentally and actually think it was the universe‚Äôs way of shutting doors for me that needed to be shut. Someone has also taken over the lease in SF so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. Fortunately for my company, I can move relatively easily between the SF and LA offices. However, I am really confused about which city I should pick between SF and LA. Some points specifically:

1. **SF is originally what I wanted AND I actually lived there for 2 months**. Cue my friends here saying ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt let him win.‚Äù I think long-term I ‚Äúfit‚Äù in SF more, I really really love the casualness of the city (I know some may disagree), greenery and crisp air. However, being there I was really depressed (context above), which I feel was compounded from how small the city is (I felt claustrophobic) and the fog/grayness. Leaving work late was also pretty depressing since downtown would be absolutely dead, at least comparing to what I‚Äôm used to in New York.
2. **LA feels like a new start.** This is both a pro and a con for me. At least with SF, I feel like I have more experience seeing what the city was like, both good and bad, before moving. I‚Äôm not sure how comfortable I am with basing a decision to move (although I know it doesn‚Äôt have to be permanent) off a one week vacation in LA. But with LA, especially it being a bigger city, I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúavoid‚Äù or ‚Äúreclaim‚Äù places that I went to with my ex or at the lowest point in my life - every experience will be my own, new and with me at a much better mental space.
3. **I have more friends in LA than SF.** In SF, I felt completely alone. I know friendships are something that come with time (though in NY I have never struggled to meet people at work, school or internships) and to be patient. However, I do have two really good friends that live in LA, including the one that I stayed with. My friend introduced me to her group of friends who were really friendly, understanding and supportive of what I went through - some even shared their own experiences. I think this was a huge factor in me feeling like I ‚Äúreclaimed‚Äù myself and start to feel a turn in how I‚Äôm feeling.
4. **Unsure about long term desire/viability to live in LA from a career perspective**. Career wise, I‚Äôm interested in product management and/or technology consulting. Maybe I am wrong here, but from my job search online (I am looking to switch into a new career/job), SF/the Bay Area seems to have many more options than LA. Because I‚Äôm looking to switch positions, I don‚Äôt know if I just go back to SF now (I see myself there longterm anyway).
5. **Afraid of getting worse again if I go back to SF**. In the short term, I do have a fear that if I go back I will just undo all the ‚Äúwork‚Äù I‚Äôve done in getting to a better mental space and I will be completely alone (without my ex) for a while, at least until I am able to make a friend or two. With LA, I feel like in the short-term I will have a much better time. I have really good friends there to start off, the weather is warmer/sunnier so I can pick up surfing, train for a marathon (I know I can do this in SF too), swim at beaches which I LOVE and be outdoors.
6. **Cost of SF vs LA:** In LA, if I really wanted to I can afford to get my own apartment, which is a goal of mine to have my own space especially after being with my controlling-ex. In SF, I would need to find roommates, which actually might be beneficial in making friends and having people to talk to.

I know it may seem like I‚Äôm over-complicating this decision and that ultimately I can‚Äôt predict outcomes, however I do wanted to get advice/opinions from the Reddit community. A lot of the advice I‚Äôve gotten from my friends has been quite simple (‚Äúdon‚Äôt let him win‚Äù vs ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should ever go back to SF‚Äù‚Ä¶)

**What I'm leaning towards:** At the moment, I‚Äôm leaning towards going to LA and looking for a month to month lease, applying for jobs in both cities and playing it by ear from there. I‚Äôm still quite young (mid-20s) so I‚Äôm okay with just having fun in a city for a year or two before deciding on something longer term.

**TLDR:** Need help deciding between SF and LA. I originally wanted to move to SF (visited 3x prior) and ended up living there for two months, however it was at the lowest point in my life (depressed, ex-boyfriend of 4.5 years cheated, long hours at work). Went back to parents‚Äô house to reassess my life. Went to LA for one week (first visit) and loved it/had a great time with my friend and now that I‚Äôm at a better place, debating whether I should move back to SF (what I originally wanted but potentially triggering/undo progress) or start fresh in LA (maybe not best career move/didn‚Äôt spend much time there)."
an4ym8,1,2019-02-04,I'm rebranding after hitting 400+ subscribers,alexsibila,YouTube_startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTube_startups/comments/an4ym8/im_rebranding_after_hitting_400_subscribers/,"I'm new to the subreddit so I wanted to share some of my story and why I decided to rebrand recently.

I joined YouTube in 2009, the summer before my freshman year of high school. I have always loved the community, and some of the amazing things that were created just from making internet videos. I started posting some videos shortly after joining, nothing serious, just videos I had made with my brothers. I knew I liked YouTube and creating videos, but I never really made it a priority after joining. 

Fast forward to 2012. I'm a sophomore in high school, and playing high school basketball. The day before our tournament game we travel to a neighboring town to check out some of the other teams that we may play in a later round. Fortunately, I had a smartphone at this time and was able to get [this video](https://youtu.be/qzqiGHT_djs) of future NBA players Gary Harris hitting a half-court game winner in the first round of the tournament. I use the little data I had on the ride home to post the video to YouTube, and by the morning, it had over 80k views. A local news station posted it in their article covering the game, and it was also ESPN's #1 play in their top ten that week (unfortunately they didn't use my video). Fortunately, my channel was monetized at this point, so I also got a nice check the month after this video was posted.

After that I didn't post much for a while. I was in high school, and I was already a shy, socially awkward kid and didn't want anything out there that could be used to poke fun at me. I started college in 2014, and saw this as an opportunity to be a new person, more confident and not be afraid to be my true self. Freshman year goes well but between friends and school and sports I really didn't have time or the motivation to create videos. 

Then I get to my sophomore year of college. It was at this time I discovered Casey Neistat, and I was completely blown away by his storytelling. Then I made my decision to start a vlog, he was living this awesome life, so I figured I could do the same thing. Luckily I had accepted an internship in Tulsa, OK for the summer after my sophomore year, so I basically would have 3 months on my own to work on it.

So I get to Tulsa the summer of 2016, get all my stuff moved in, and start vlogging. I vlogged every single day for 90 straight days. I've recently made them all unlisted but you can still see them in the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDhdt5X5A3yMkswdVSqiOuyBHVivF57f). I wasn't very good at it, but definitely made a little progress as the days went on. And most of all I realized that my life is nowhere as exciting as Casey's. Luckily on my very last day of vlogging, I went to a Drake concert in Columbus, OH. Here he brought [LeBron James on stage](https://youtu.be/5acS0MiLZXI), and again I lucked out by having good seats and a good camera on my phone. So I recorded it, posted it to YouTube that night, and by the morning it had ~150k views. ESPN actually picked it up as well and my video was used on sportscenter the following day. The exposure was good, and I got a few subscribers out of it but none that were there for my content, just that video. 

After that I decided to stop vlogging, I wasn't really enjoying it and I realized my personality really didn't fit that style of video. I made a few more videos during my junior year of random stuff I was doing, but nothing really took off. 

Senior year comes now, and I really start to study filmmaking. I take my first actually video class (as an engineering student this was tough to fit in to my schedule) and absolutely love it. Probably one of my favorite classes in college, looking back on it. In the spring before I graduate I start making weekly videos about my track meets, so that reignited my creative video-making. But track came to an end, and I didn't have anything to make videos about. 

So I've graduated now, but I still love making videos. So I did some thinking, and recently decided to rebrand my channel to cover electric vehicles. I've been a long time Tesla fan since I first joined YouTube, and have always been a renewable energy enthusiast. This was one of the driving factors to get my engineering degree.

So that was a very long winded way of saying I think I finally found my niche. I love electric vehicles, I know how to shoot videos and make them look/sound good from experience, and my editing has been slowly improving. I've been revamping my channel recently, making some of my old videos unlisted and changing a lot of my branding. If you actually got through this whole story and would like to check out [my channel](http://www.YouTube.com/alexsibila) that would mean the world to me. I love hearing everyone's stories on YouTube, and I hope you enjoyed mine :)

TL;DR: I took a long winding road to finally find my niche on YouTube covering electric vehicles.

We finally decided to try and make it work since i went back to my country and things went great for a while. Problems arose about one year into our LDR because she kept on bringing up bad stuff from our past, friends interfering ect. It got so bad that we broke up for a while but eventually figured out that we missed each other too much. We talked through our problems for a long time. Me not being attentive enough towards her feelings and her attitude/behavior when she got mad. I supported her through her studies ans exams for the whole of 2018, even went to visit her two times last year and helped her financially throughout. But the problems keeps on coming back. The way she got treated by my so-called friends back in 2016 is still wearing on her mind and the way i was back then is also being brought up time and time. I feel like ive given her time, trying to understand her feelings about it. But i cant keep on being cussed out and blamed by someone who says that she loves me. Im at my wits end about this relationship and dont know what to do anymore. Im feeling like im a punching bag and i have no idea what to do at this point.

Will a Cambridge Masters (in either maths or CS) help me in this regard? I've heard people say that, without doing the undergraduate first, it is looked upon as a vanity degree and there's very little chance it leads onto a PHD position. Thanks in advance for any advice you could give.

An actual clinic.",ItsTaft,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/an6ley/eps_cries_of_rage_inside_a_clinic_an_actual_clinic/,"I'll keep the intro short, I was doing an internship in an audiology clinic of a public hospital in summer of 2018 (I'm an audiology student)

Luckily the clinic I was working at is one of the top clinics in the country with 95% well mannered patients. But sometimes, when the stars align, Karen's kids have gotten good grades and there is only one chocolate bar left at the store, we have these kind of patienst

ED: Entitled Dad, EM: Entitled mom, the child is a nice quite kid. CA: Clinic audiologist in the event.

&amp;#x200B;

So I entered the clinic 5 minutes than usual that day, which was 9.05 am. The moment I entered through the doors I heard a friend shouting ""ENOUGH, SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET OUT"". After reaching the crime scene I saw ED flailing his arms around shouting ""This is crap, you cannot treat me like this, everyone is seeing what you are doing"" meanwhile the shouting friend is glaring at them like he is Inigo Montoya and they killed his father. After this the secretary, keeping his calm, escorts them outside (My friend is around 1.92 and quite well built so he looks quite scary when angry and our secretary was one of the night shift guards at the psyche ward of the hospital before he got relocated. ED is around 1.75cm so you can imagine the scene).

Meanwhile EM is doing nothing but follow and shoot death glares at everyone, meanwhile one of the audiologists (CA) is just standing still with the smuggest but calmest smile you can ever imagine.

After asking around what the hell was going on, the story unfolded. (This part is from 4 different eye witnesses which includes a Prof, 2 other interns and the CA) .

EP's were bringing their child for speech therapy (Speech therapy department is also inside the same clinic). When they arrived at the hospital at 9 am, the therapist had not arrived yet, which sometimes can result in people arriving 5 minutes late because parking of the hospital is an absolute nightmare.

The EP'S had arrived and without checking in with the secretary, went into the inside section and asked about the therapist which CA replied with ""Oh he hasn't arrived, he will probably be here in a few minutes"", which ED replied with a death stare and a loud ""What are you?"" (Yes, not ""who are you"", probably meant as a ""what the hell are you,""). CA told me that at this point she had realized the situation so she replied with ""Oh I'm just a human working here""

This is the part where I walked in.

ED \*getting louder\* : WELL IT'S OBVIOUS YOU ARE NOT A FURRY ANIMAL, WE ARE HERE ON TIME AND WE WANT OUR SERVICE CALL THE THERAPIST IN RIGHT NOW.

CA: ""Yepp just a human.""

At this point CA decided to take her leaves since she probably has a patient waiting and EM decides to take a large step trying to cut her off, bumping hard into a Prof. Then I realize the dumb EM collided into the second top Prof in the clinic, literally the woman who is second to the Head of the Audiology department. A woman so lovely but who could tear you a new ear if you made her angry. I was expecting her to rampage but she said nothing at all. This is the part where it'll get funny.

Secretary stepped in, with a stern warning, pulling EM a little from her shoulder to get her away from the Prof, and EM goes "" HOW DARE THEY MAKE US WAIT WHEH WE ARE PERFECTLY ON TIME WE WANT THE THERAPIST.

After this point, police is called, EP's got charged with white code (assault against hospital workers, usually gets you banneed from the said hospital). But no worries, children are unaffected by this, so the child went on with the therapy.

Edit: But sadly we later laerned the EP's were more like AP's, which I call Abusive Parents, the father coming before had thrown kids backpack into the trash for reasons we have no idea. "

I am a senior at UTSA majoring in computer science, and I graduate in May. I am considering employment at Southwest Research Institute and H-E-B as a developer. I have been an intern at H-E-B since last summer, and I currently have an offer from H-E-B for full time employment. Southwest Research wants to interview me in two weeks, which puts me at a crossroad. I'm not sure if I should accept one job over the other. They both offer pretty good pay and benefits, but it seems SwRI will offer slightly more than H-E-B (I have a friend who just got hired at SwRI). On the other hand, SwRI is a government contractor and I may be working on projects I'm not personally comfortable with. Does anyone have advice on which company might be a better choice? Of course this is a highly opinionated decision with many factors weighing in, but I would like to hear advice either way (and if you have worked for either of these companies, even better). Thank you!"

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, Its around Prom season and I see all the couples around the hallways walking around all happy n shiz. I see people who are spending time with their SOs and them kissing and holding hands without a care in the world. All the people around me always ask me ""Oh are you gonna take your Gf to prom?"" "" Hey you should bring your Gf and we can hangout as couples"" and etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This pisses me off because me and my Gf cannot do this, not for a long while at least. This is because her parents are hyper-religious and they won't let her even look at a boy the wrong way. It makes me mad because I want to be able to hold her hand and kiss her openly, I don't like feeling like nothing more than just a secret. I hate feeling like this and the fact that me and her have a somewhat long distance relationship (20 min drive, but I can't drive because no car) makes me even more mad. She doesn't go to the same school as me, and we see each other once a week, but still, I wish I could see her more often. We are happy together when we see each other, and most of the time things go very well. But when we see other couples, we get sad because we realize we can't do any of that. When any of her friends ask her ""Is He your boyfriend?"" We both have to play it off as us just being friends, and at this point, I've kinda become numb to it. As a matter of fact, I kinda feel myself feeling somewhat numb to a lot of things that happen to me and her, honestly. It makes me feel like a terrible person because her parents will hurt/abuse her, and I have basically gotten used to it and I know its wrong. Anytime her parents make her cry, I kinda just look at her and think to myself: ""why can't we just have a normal life? Why can't I just come over and not run the risk of her parents attacking me and her at the sametime?""

&amp;#x200B;

What drains me even more is that when we go to Prom, I won't be allowed to take her because her parents caught her saying she loves me a lot. So basically, I have to be okay with her going to prom with another dude and I have to find my own person to go to prom with. It's not right and it's not okay, I sometimes contemplate breaking up with her because of how difficult things get but I know she isn't the one calling the shots. Instead, her traditional parents are the ones deciding who they feel is a best fit for her to date. They're the ones who punish her for dating a dude at the age of 18 and saying she's not allowed to date until the age of 21. It makes me extremely mad. It's not like I'm even a bad dude either, I have a internship at a well established brokerage firm, I go to a private school, I go to Church every Sunday and volunteer when I can, and I do my best to support her. I just feel very worn out and I just wanted to say something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on what I can do? If anything? I don't want to breakup with her because I love her and I know this isn't her fault. I apologize for how long and rambly this post is. "

I think the determinant factor for me will be the quality of CS program at each school, and whether or not there is a significant difference in the quality of academics. If anyone, especially those who‚Äôre currently enrolled in the CS major, can help, it‚Äôd be much appreciated. 



1. How is the CS program at A&amp;M? Regarding academic, reputation, curriculum, professors, etc. ? Are there enough funding/resources for the department? 

2. How is the employment opportunities for CS at A&amp;M? Are there enough internships for students still in school? Are CS graduates able to get a job locally or in Texas? What companies recruit at A&amp;M? 

Update: 3. It‚Äôd be great if someone who is majoring/has majored in CS can talk about A&amp;M‚Äôs CS department‚Äôs  reputation in the tech industry. And how is it compared to other schools that are ranked ~top 50 for CS/engineering?

I've spoken to my supervisor and asked about opportunities to expand the work I'm doing.

My background is in hardware security and design (at least from schooling and internships) and I would like to get back to that at some point. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen here and I'm concerned that I'll lose my grasp on hardware. 

I already find it hard to remember basic concepts about the MIPS stack and programming in assembly. That used to be one of the few things that separated my resume from the pack and I have no way that I know to really practice that again. 

So questions - How can I practice hardware, assembly, etc. if I can't do it at work? Are there any resources or labs that I can get into? What types of skills are most usable in the future, and what are some parts that would welcome an interest in this side of security? I heard that some exploit development requires knowledge of assembly but that's were my information ends.

Feeling a bit confused on my current situation and hoping you all can help me.

I was recently offered a co-op position by a food and beverage company.  I will be doing process engineering work throughout the fall semester and return to work for said company again during junior summer.

The position sounds interesting, however, I'm not sure if I should go through with it or not.  Taking a semester off for the co-op doesn't really appeal to me.  On the flip side, I will gain practical engineering experience and will be able to work on multiple projects.

After graduation, I want to go into pharmaceuticals.  Ideally, I would like an internship in pharma this summer and also for junior summer.  However, the food and beverage company wants a decision by next week, so I don't have much time to wait for other companies to get back to me. 

My uni's career fair is this week so I will be able to network with some companies.  Some of my applications to pharma companies have been forwarded to their respective hiring managers.  I think a part of me is still hoping to obtain a pharma internship for this summer.  I believe that I have a solid technical background, but my interviewing skills are a bit lackluster compared with others.  All being said, getting an internship is not guaranteed.

Is still getting an internship in pharma a realistic hope?  Are pharma companies still recruiting and will they be open to chemE sophomores?  

Will the skills I will gain through this co-op help me with getting into pharma?  Will going through with this co-op ultimately be a good choice career-wise, or would trying my luck for an internship be better?

Thanks in advance for any advice."

I'm kind of a bully around the office but I'm tolerated because I actually deliver results (both because I'm actually somewhat intelligent and also because my family has old-money connections which allows me to get meetings that people like your father couldn't dream of scheduling).  I'm a total loud mouth who is above the rules - I come in an hour or two late every day. No tie. Sleeves rolled up.. walking in like I own the place. The HR complaints are rampant but between understanding exactly what I can get away with and putting up numbers nobody else can touch ... the powers that be look the other way. You must have thought my parents owned a huge share in the company with what I was able to do and they didn't - which made it all the more infuriating to you. 

Your Dad got you a summer internship and because you can't stand types like me, and you have nothing to lose you seem to be the only one in the office who tries to remind me of my place. You didn't want a job here anyway - you're just doing it for the resume padding - so I don't have the leverage of holding a potential job over your head. *At least you had that.* You were gonna go work for a humanitarian organization that helped abused women as soon as you graduated - watching me and my underlings hoot and howl as we mocked that Gillette ad and toxic masculinity in my office cemented that for you. 

To avoid conflict of interests - you were put in the marketing division and not in sales with me and your Pops. This further emboldened you to remind me of things like proper workplace attire, the time work starts, and that I shouldn't be obsessed with my fantasy football league on my phone during joint division meetings. In fact you, were like a tiny hero to your colleagues - mostly women who were equally sick of my chest pounding every time I brought it another couple million for my division. I made sure everyone knew - and you at least tried to make sure I knew how apathetic you were about your internship and how that meant you could challenge me openly since, as you constantly reminded me, you didn't want to work here anyway. 

Anyhow the office does something called ""Summer Olympics"" as a team building outing where we compete in some fun physical challenges. You realize you're being put up against me in a physical activity you excel in (perhaps swimming or hurdles) and while I'm in great physical shape, I'm 10+ years out of college at a desk job, and you're on the swimming/track team and practicing almost everyday -  the event didn't rely on raw physical strength (which is what you associated as my strong suite since you totally didn't catch yourself checking out my tanned forearms or feel that quiver in your knees when I tower almost two feet above you) so you thought you had a chance to finally publicly humiliate the alpha dog.

We make a side bet unknown to the rest of the company that if you win - I surrender my parking spot (right in front - where everyone could see whatever my new car was for the quarter) for the rest of the year to your Dad (he's been taking my shit long enough and his bone spurs are starting to bother him) but if I win - you have to do my laundry for the rest of your internship (a month or so - it wouldn't be so bad).

What you don't know is that my alpha male sweat and musk has a stronger than expected reaction with you - and my pheromones seemed to induce submission...

Your disdain for me when I first drop off my laundry (mostly my sweat soaked gym clothes) in front of everyone at the office, including your father, makes it all the sweeter...

-----

On the surface I'm looking for that younger woman with Daddy issues whose biology betrays her into lusting for a big, manly, older stud to breed her into submission. Something we all know and love! 

But outside of that I really want someone who can flash a personality - even when doing the most submissive of acts. Nothing get's me going more than realistic, fiery, passionate, multifaceted dynamic between two individuals. Yes I'm dominant, yes you're submissive but how do they play out? How do you reconcile your authentic feminist views with someone you view as misogynist? Do you make sure to verbally insult him at every turn while your body does his bidding? Does that just turn you on more? 

Or do you get to know him and realize some of his more obnoxious qualities are just symptoms of character values that you actually have been missing with your relationships? Between getting to know more about who he is in the company and the endless lessons of learning how he likes his big, hairy, balls licked do you engage in conversations where you learn that due to the success he's brought to the company - he also able to  champion for a full 6 months of maternity &amp; paternity leave, instituted a program where the company covers adoption costs and vet bills for rescue animals, and also pushed for the nations most aggressive and progressive health insurance plan for all of it's employees  make you say ""Fucking shit - I could actually fall for this big fuck""? Or is it all somehow self-serving? Send a reply and find out! 

**Kinkwise I think I've covered mostly everything. What I really want is dynamics! Also I'm kind of a hopeless romantic**

**My limits are: Lame replies. Anyone less than 18 years old IRL as well as in the scene . Poop. Pee. Death. Physical beatings as a way of control. Anything super unrealistic some exaggeration is good fun**

A good reply is something that shows thought about anything I wrote above. I like to get to know people before we jump into where the peen goes. I typically like to keep things on Reddit but might ask to chat a bit over DM as we get to know each other.

What should I do?,DefensiveV,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/an8zuh/my_25_defensive_mood_swings_is_hurting_my/,"Throw away account. Just wanna get some solid, anonymous advice.   This Sunday will mark my boyfriend and I‚Äôs 2 year relationship. It‚Äôs been a loving journey, but also one of the roughest.   

When I met my boyfriend, I was 23, still living at my parents house. They were extremely controlling parents - borderline narcissists, who refused to let me get a job, so they could control my finances and and keep me at home. They did other stuff, but this post isn‚Äôt about them - just bear in mind they were really, really controlling. I was a full time college student who had to travel between my internships - so the money they gave me could only be for gas, and food expenses. So I didn‚Äôt have much of a social life outside school activities.   

The little friends I had (along with my amazing boyfriend) eventually convinced me to get out, ASAP. They taught me everything that gave me extreme anxiety - from budgeting, insurance, and taxes; things my parents always told me to not worry about. They even helped me fill out the FAFSA as an independent, which allowed me to get full tuition!   

I got a part time job and moved in with my boyfriend, despite the massive episode it caused my family. He held my hand while I confronted my parents, and he even defended me against them. I never loved a person so much. Everything was sooo much easier living with him. I didn‚Äôt have constant anxiety anymore, I earned my keep, and I didn‚Äôt feel like the burden my parents use to make me feel.   

However, months later, things kinda turned sour. After getting my nexplannon birth control implant replaced, I started suffering extreme vaginal dryness, and it also made me prone to yeast infections. My gynecologist didn‚Äôt believe me, told me it shouldn‚Äôt, gave me cream after cream, but nothing work. By the end of last year, he finally took it out of me - but it was too little too late, my sex life with my boyfriend was at a halt. The anxieties of whether or not i has a yeast infection, or if he‚Äôd hurt me, caused my boyfriend to stop initiating sex. My vag issues also dropped my libido heavily. I stopped all my medications just get revive my libido after I got the implant taken out last year - it‚Äôs still elusive, mostly because anxiety.   

Speaking of the anxiety. For the past year I‚Äôve been suffering what my boyfriend calls ‚Äúdefensive PTSD.‚Äù Basically if he says one thing wrong, I get really defensive, over analyze, go into a huge depressive episode and by the end I apologize excessively because I honestly never mean anything I say during those moments. He says I act like he‚Äôs against me, or trying to control me, when really he‚Äôs just requesting me to be better about certain things - like doing the dishes more, or helping around the apartment. I tend to act like he‚Äôs my parents or something.   

I‚Äôm finally off my birth control, graduated from school, and have a job that pays me modestly more than all my other jobs. We‚Äôve moved in together at a brand new place we love. I‚Äôm on new meds, but I can‚Äôt afford therapy right now - gotta wait to build my savings a bit more from my new job. 

Arguably though, I should feel absolutely fine - so why do I still have these defensive behaviors?   Sorry for the long read reddit, but I need advice. How do I stop being so defensive towards my understanding, dependable loving boyfriend? I don‚Äôt want to lose him.   

TLDR; My angry vagina and defensive mood swings have been harming my otherwise amazing relationship with my boyfriend. How do I stop being so defensive?"

Sorry but English is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a little background story. In June 2018 my now ex GF (25F) moved to another European country for an internship and after roughly one month, while I was on my way to the airport to visit her, she texted me she was worried about our relationship to continue and that we needed to talk as soon as I got there. At that time I was pretty hurt in my pride and dignity and, as a childish reaction, I decided to not take the flight and go back home, giving her another demonstration that I wasn't ready to fight for our relationship. needless to say, we broke up over the phone. or better, she dumped me. At the time I didn't understand her motivations and felt very bad for her behaviour towards me. She said she came to the conclusion that, even tough I helped her a lot struggling with her issues and insecurities during our 3 and 1/2 years relationship, she had to learn how to stand by herself and deal with things on her own, without me being her crutch. I walked away as I usually do when facing this kind of situations: boosting my pride by saying ""I'm too good for you"", ignoring my responsibilities along with the fact I wasn't the perfect bf you can have. My reaction was rage, and not sadness. I could only think ""how dare you?"", never questioning my failures as always.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple of months I started to feel different. i don't know exactly what happened but for the very first time in my life I realized something was wrong in me and in my way to interact with significant people in my life. That's when I decided to see a therapist. What can I say, it's been the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life. At first I was very skeptical about it; I mean, i'm a middle class, european, healthy, white straight man.  What do I have to brag about, right? i've been seeing my therapist for 7 months now and the amount of things i've learned about myself is incredible. And most of them aren't pleasant surprises but more like a brick in the face. most of my certainties collapse during therapist sessions and I learned a lot about my (dis)functions, especially in my relationships area. Even though some sessions where very though to digest, being a very proud guy and acknowledging you were mistaken was a pretty harsh thing to do.  But now I am finally aware of what LOVE means and how stupid and ignorant I've been most of my life. Love is hard work, love is patience, love is respect, love is Knowledge, love is care. Love isn't just giving stuff. Love is time and interest. It's not just a feeling of ""falling in love"". Love is giving the most valuable aspects of your life to another human being.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the day I realized all of this and how I've been mistaken my whole life, I cried like a baby for hours, thinking about all the things I did wrong to what I'm now sure was THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. The point is that now I don't know what to do. I feel the urge to go, drive 1000km and tell her I was wrong, that I can be different and finally LOVE her like she has never been loved. give everything to her not expecting anything in return besides her beautiful smile. I just want her to be happy but I am scared she is happy without me and eventually find some other guy ""better"" than me. I just want her to know I CAN be that guy. I can be a better version of myself because I finally know what was wrong with me and I am ready to show her in every possible way. But what if she doesn't believe me? How can i blame her? I've been a shitty little prick in 3 years relationship with her? how do I tell her I'm different now? I would love to ""win her back"" but not just for the sake of it but because I know she deserves love as I mean it now. I want her happy and be happy with her. Nothing matters more that that to me. I finally know I really LOVE her.

&amp;#x200B;

I think there's no worst thing that acknowledging you where mistaken and being afraid you won't be believed."

I came from another firm working in a completely different side of tax, which has no correlation to the tax I am currently doing. I have been learning a lot since I started but have not been able to get enough work because people know I am brand new to this side of tax. I keep asking but people always say ‚Äúthe work will come.‚Äù I‚Äôm looking at my colleagues, and see that their schedules are all filled. Do I just have to keep my patience? I don‚Äôt wanna be that person who works less billable than everyone else. I feel like the best way for me to learn is to actually do the work. A manager took me slightly off of a project that I had just started on because she wanted to give the majority of the hours to someone with more experience.

Jeez I‚Äôm sounding like an intern but any advice to woo the managers and seniors to give a new guy work would be appreciated. I really don‚Äôt want to be just a busy season hire"

anaxqu,11,2019-02-05,Geekheads is 2 years old,ExtraEater,geekheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/geekheads/comments/anaxqu/geekheads_is_2_years_old/,"can you believe it? the geekheads discord has survived this long without a major fallout or even a shutdown (see the popheads discord). two years ago, we were getting hyped for lady gaga's superbowl and now we were probably busy doing literally anything else for this superbowl.

the community at the time of geekheads' creation, the community at the time of the 1st anniversary, and the community now are all insanely different groups, let me tell you that. i haven't been on as much, but i still feel obligated to look over some of the notable events.

if i forgot something please yell and tell me i will include it i rushed this lowkey.

#some history pt. 2

* here's [pt. 1](https://redd.it/7vk3wq), which i recommend everyone reads again as a recap.

###february 2018

* remember that invites are closed now. this will be important later.

* the last hints of the old times. dude and deathmonkey left around this time.

* a #memes channel finally opens.

###march 2018

* TDD3: Geekheads Apprentice commences, involving a bunch of business-related challenges with an aim to secure an apprenticeship under Donald Trump. a few very notable events happened:

 * Joyride, perhaps one of Geekheads' shining moments. it featured none other than the lovely /u/poppinmmolly ""masquerading"" as Zara for a fake Zara Larsson song titled ""Joyride"" and managing to fool pop fans and reputable sources on the way.

 * the auction, which spawned :pillsbury:.

 * Erica, our favorite unemployed former intern.

* geekheads superlatives happened. fun fact: elite ~~and rokin~~ were the only participants who didn't get a single honorable mention or award.

###april 2018

* remember popheads abcs from december 2016? well geekheads started it back up! however, it was very bad and underwhelming and we all collectively forgot it.

* TDD4: Discord in Paradise commences, modeled after Bachelor In Paradise and incorporates elements such as couples and breakups. this was not considered part of the TDD series, but it has been retroactively deemed TDD4 since then.

* musical chairs happens, a game involving entering songs and ???? idk how to explain it tbh but basically it lasts into may and went all the way from A-Z + #.

* because of the nature of the game, a lot of people who didn't normally use geekheads before started using it again to play this game. everyone who was anyone got pinged a lot to save songs, and all sorts of users remembered of geekheads' existence.

* a few things happened:

 * [keysmash] eclipse

 * fibromyalgia-gate

 * idk what else but Owl City won a letter so that instantly validates the whole thing in my mind

###may 2018

* i like to think at about this point the community started to change noticeably because of musical chairs and new users springing up. even though invites were off you could say there were a lot of ""new"" users (some literally invited in anyway, but we all love those guys).

* the Great Emofish Debate happens on the 17th where it's essentially arguing over the inclusion of a depressed cartoon fish in the emoji list. this somehow managed to lead into other ethical and emojical geekheads debates i cba to list rn.

* the disney character rate happened.

###june 2018

* ??? did anything happen ???

###july 2018

* [flint, michigan finally fucking got some clean water.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8yaqcl/what_is_the_biggest_unresolved_scandal_the_world/e29kt8m/)

* elitegate happened. this occurred entirely in the popheads server, but it's pretty integral to geekheads as the main investigators were geekheads members. tl;dr - elite alleges he was in a car crash, the ever-so-suspicious TK and porz do some investigation, they find out he was lying, elite leaves, and now there's a [huge compilation of his lies out in the public domain](https://imgur.com/a/WOleXFb)

* shippy arrives. soon enough, he'll leave a lot and continue to arrive monthly.

* TDD5: Geekheads Con commences as the first geekheads TDD that's actually about geeky things.

###august 2018

* porz vs. claire happens, it results in porz getting banned.

###september 2018

* [Best of Geekheads, Vol. 2](https://imgur.com/a/4JhuR9K) comes out.

* [Geekheads Take Public Transit, pt. 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412059916942049310/487995810978594846/Public_Transit.png)

* [Geekheads Take Public Transit, pt. 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412059916942049310/488180149741682698/Public_Transit_pt._2_CENSORED.png)

* a TDD involving a murder mystery was announced, but nothing came of it.

* the Great Invite Summit happens, i don't even remember what came of this long-ass event because it ultimately didn't matter since two people were invited minutes later.

* porz returns by popular demand, everyone's excited but it kinda doesn't matter bc he dipped from the server pretty soon afterwards anyway

* ship rate (whatever number) happens, it involves user-voted pairs since the geekheads population is so big now.

###october 2018

* a brief reform happened and we get some Dua Lipa - New Rules for our discord. as far as i can tell, nothing changed after this.

* a special (spinoff? related non-canon story? idk) for Iowaheads was written by Molly as a Halloween special.

* we were all so bored that we did the Geekheads Purge in which a bunch of inactive members were all wiped from the server.

* evan left :(

###november 2018 - the month of extra

* in the fight of the century: shippy vs. kromo. shippy got very direct about his feelings on kromo and the mess spiraled so out of control that the #league-of-nations channel was created to discuss kromo's presence. i think at some point the mods got emotionally blackmailed but the details are fuzzy.

* extra (me) created a [fake TVTropes page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xf9HY70JdkYL10pOFPXicERjXxxaocNGmpgMqjohx1o/edit?usp=sharing) for Geekheads, which came to be the subject of a lengthy voice chat session later in the month. 

* geekheads briefly devolves into insanity after ""Extra"" wins a server name rate and the server name briefly becomes ""Extra"" with a green default discord avi as the server pic.

* TDD6: Supernanny commences, involving the contestants catering to a 16-year old on the discord (extra, me) and their childish needs. it lasts into january 2019.

###december 2018

* a second secret santa is organized by Naps, and this time all sorts of gifts are welcome. here are two very notable gifts

 * gews (oh i'm sorry, the ""secret santa"" who didn't want their identity revealed) gifted this [amazing artwork](https://i.imgur.com/BfUUu1f.png) to the lovely jamesfrog

 * tk gifted Molly Jeopardy to the lovely poppinmmolly. in this game, he created a bunch of questions about Molly that were to be answered by Molly's closest colleagues as chosen by Molly herself. the game commenced, and Rokin came out on top.

* [""Sapphire Wins an Award""](https://imgur.com/a/96Yq8zh)

* the second annual Geekheads Awards.

###january 2019

* a very anti-climactic month, i'll admit.

###february 2019

* super bowl

* current day

anbcd6,94,2019-02-05,"After about 8 years of smoking, I haven‚Äôt touch a cigarette in a week.",[deleted],happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/anbcd6/after_about_8_years_of_smoking_i_havent_touch_a/,"Today marks a full week that I haven‚Äôt smoked. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I did, but I‚Äôve never been so proud. I didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it past the first day. 

I started back in high school and tried to quit a few times, but it was always because of someone I was dating, my parents, etc. It was never because I wanted to. 

A few days ago I was sitting in court (I‚Äôm an intern working on my JD) and an attorney sat down next to me who had just smoked a butt. 

He couldn‚Äôt breathe. He‚Äôs face was bright read for hours (assuming he has high blood pressure), he smelt so bad, and it ruined his overall appearance of being an attorney. 

That night I was high and wrote myself a letter about quitting. 

Low and behold it‚Äôs been a full week and I have not touched one! 

Surprisingly this time has been much easier. I am sure it‚Äôs because of the Juul (actually using it for what it was designed for), but I‚Äôve also been keeping a lighter and unopened pack with me. This has been helping with the anxiety I used to get before when I quit of not having them readily on me. You have to understand, when you carry something with you for eight years, it‚Äôs hard to just stop. 

Whatever it is, it‚Äôs working though! "
anbwwt,6,2019-02-05,I'm sabotaging my life.,coolguy69420wastaken,malementalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/anbwwt/im_sabotaging_my_life/," (Sorry this whole thing is so Incoherent, long, and rambly I wrote this over a course of multiple days whenever I had the motivation, energy, and will to write through whatever feelings this made me feel and hence wrote it during multiple states of mind. I don't really want to edit it though, because its quite raw and really says what I want to say despite it being fucking hard to comprehend. I originally posted this in a panic on mental health but was quickly lost in the crowd, I thought I'd post this here, I know this long ass intro paragraph which precedes yet another intro paragraph is making this even longer and here I am apologising for the length, so sorry again xD. Anyway, if any good soul has the iron will to read through this shit storm and not get bored and click off, thank you so much.)

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I didnt know whether to do advice or mental health or to just delete all this? ahahah man i dont have a clue, but I had to get this out, theres so fucking much though, so sorry if this is too much.  
Hey guys, its me Mr.Throwaway here. (I mean I don't really know why I'm using a throwaway, only two of my friends know my actual reddit account, and my story is so fuckin specific and my typing and that username might be a dead giveaway, so if they do read it they will probably suspect its me straight away, but if they were to ask if this was me I'd just deny it and because I said that here they would be like ""HMMMMM"" but because they wont be able to be 100% sure it was me I think it would be funny, anyway my thowaway username is way better than my main)The title may sound exaggerated and maybe a little Cliche, but I really do feel like I'm sabotaging myself. I've alwayshad mental health issues but they really manifested themselves around the end of highschool and when I first started College (I'm from the UK so I was 16). In Highschool I was bullied alot and I started to get alot of anxiety and self-confidence issues, this all came to a head when it was the day of my Physics GCSE exam. In Highschool I \*LOVED\* physics It was my dream to go on to become a physicist and I had my whole life planned ahead of me, in year 10 I got awarded with a university bursary, which would mean if I went on to study physics in University I would be granted 6 grand, which was pretty sweet especially because the bursary was supposed to be given to the year 11 student who showed the most prospect but it was given to me instead (which was kinda awkward cos I had to go to the end of year, year 11 awards ceremony to pick up an award when I was in year 10 I was so scared xD) because of this my dad and his wife would always brag about me to everybody whenever I visited. Physics felt like it was all they talked about when I visited which was kinda weird, I never really bonded with my dad much but it was nice to see him so proud of me but it did put a tonne of pressure on me. The thing is though, is that although I was getting excellent grades in physics, my grades in maths were faltering. All of the above kinda cumulated into my first (of many) panic attacks in my life. It was 4 hours before my exam and I was about to go in early to study with my friends, when I Froze in front of my front door for about ten minutes before walking into the kitchen and sitting down for 3 hours not able to work out what was happening. I sat there for hours, before my older sister, who due to some pretty fucked up family issues I never got along with that well, found me and gave me a pep talk, It really meant alot to hear that from her, I always felt unloved by my sister but that meant the world to me. I ran to school and arrived maybe 30 or 40 minutes before my exam and all of my friends were waiting for me worried sick, I burst into tears I wasnt able to concieve what in the ever loving fuck just happened, and hugged all of them, I was a pretty closed off guy back then so that actually was a big thing for me, I cried until the exam began, I aced that exam btw. (well kind of I was 2% of an A\* so I only got an A but I'm not picky an A was great)

Some similar shit happened after that, but I got counselling from a teacher and my mum organized for me to see some doctors in the summer holidays, but for some unknown reason I just couldn't express myself, I couldn't Pry my fucking problems from my mind, I knew something was wrong but I could never figure it out. So my issues were just pinned to Anxiety, and I was Sent to group counseling for a few months which just made me feel worse.

Anyway, when college started, I loved it, I wasn't bullied anymore I made alot of friends and I was only doing subjects I was interested in (Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Maths, The four fuckin horsemen). But my physics and maths grades started to plummet, and I kept on forgetting homework, and I started finding it harder and harder to get in on time. Eventually more and more occasions like that physics exam one started popping up. One time I froze outside my maths class and stood there for 50 odd minutes before running off and crying in the park, and one other time as soon as I saw the college as I was walking there, I had a panic attack and just sat in a back alley crying looking through fuckin LoL item builds for like 4 hours until I could go home without my mum realising I hadnt gone in. It was like I was trapped in my own mind, like I was someone else entirely looking out of a foggy window SCREAMING at my self to just fucking move but nothing it was fucking torturous. Eventually it all got too much for me and I spent more and more time avoiding college until I stopped going all together. This was around Christmas. That December was the first time in my life I had ever Contemplated suicide, it sounds dumb but you see, it felt like my life was crashing down around me, my life long goal snatched away, I felt like I had disappointed my family and my friends, I was confused about my future for the first time in my life, and on top of that the depression that had been growing for that last year or so was worse than ever, like a god damn black hole in my gut ripping me apart. Eventually, I realised though that, even though I wanted to die, I was scared of dying without a idk legacy of sorts? I don't want to die without leaving an impact, like as selfish as it sounds I've fantasised about how much I'd love to sacrifice my life to save someone else, not because of some selfless heroic nature inside me, but because I'd die but I'd also be seen as a hero and remembered when I die, so because of that, I pushed forward desperate to get my life back from myself.

It took me Idk three months or so? Something like that for me to recover from the Pit I was in I was helped out by a new friend I met who eventually became my first girlfriend which was nice, she helped me feel better about talking about my problems and opening up, and also being with her really boosted my confidence (omg I said that they wouldnt be 100% sure but that last point was so fuckin specific there would be no doubt in their fuckin minds WHY IS THIS ON A THROWAWAY WHEN IM NOT HOLDING BACK THESE KEY BITS OF INFO, I guess its hard not to? I mean I could of written this more vague but idk I like going into more detail.)  
Anyway come that spring/summer I was applying to get back into that same college, eventually I succeeded and got into a triple science BTEC the qualification wasnt as good as the 3 science A level I wanted but that was fine as long as I got to do science, I had realised now that I wanted to learn psychology I wanted to do anything in my power that no one would have to go through this sshit this awful life I was going through. However many of the teachers there had heavy doubts after what happened the year before and it was incredibly hard to persuade them that I should come back and that I could handle another year, it was only the help of an incredibly nice and supportive teacher I had the year before vouching for me, that they changed their minds. Right now I don't blame the teachers that had their doubts, but back then I was so fuckin angry that they would try and get in the way of me trying again, because back then I \*KNEW\* I would succeed that second time, I mean I COULDNT fail, especially after how I felt the last time, God knows how awful I would of felt if this happened again, but as you can probably guess I did, I did fail again, it took me a couple of months longer to crack this time, but in the Spring, due to my Steadily Decreasing Performance, and attendance, due to the exact same reasons as the year before I was expelled during a very tearful meeting between me, my mother and my teachers.  
That year wasnt a complete failure as that year it was the first time I opened up to my friends about my issues, one of my proudest moments of my life was when I was walking to class, when I suddenly froze hid in a corner and burst into tears, instead of hiding or running away like I would usually do, I texted my friend asking him to walk me to class. He came out of the cafeteria straight away, ignored the fact I was crying said hi like he would usually and said ""aight, lets go to class"" he talked to me about everday stuff and treated me like a normal person, he didnt patronise me or worry over me, he just walked me to class. When we arrived I gathered my self for 5 minutes while he talked to me before I gave him a hug and went in. I was super proud that for the first but sadly last time, in my life I won over whatever the fuck happened to me. On top of this I started 1 on 1 counseling and group counseling, I never felt group counseling to be very helpful, but 1 on 1 counseling was quite helpful.

There's a problem with 1 on 1 counselling I had though is actually something that I don't think I've mentioned yet. I feel like I'm multiple people, which is weird, the two ""people"" feel like they have the same personalities but also like they completely lack empathy for each other. As in one moment I will be begging my self to get over my fear of dying without an impact because I just WANT to die, crying and crying, staring at a wall, my heart going crazy, being in a deep foggy swamp, unable to move forward, the fog so dense that I can barely see my hands in front of my face, just wanting to lie down, give up and drown, but the thought that I might be just 10 more minutes from a reprieve to this hell that keeps me going, and then 5 minutes later I'll be laughing and ignoring anything happened. To clarify, I always feel that blackhole in my gut, but when it starts to suck me in I feel like another person, unaware that anything was EVER ok, begging to be saved but not being able to go into the next room and ask my mum to save me. Suffering in silence KNOWING IT WILL ALL BE BETTER IF I GET HELP BUT UNABLE. But as soon as that goes away I know I felt bad, but I don't care I think its funny, I laugh at myself, I know that I SHOULD CARE but the fact I know I should care but dont want to try and care makes me laugh the absurdity of my situation is so fucking funny to me, and its SO HARD to remember the times when I'm Swampy, when I'm feeling ok, If I try if I REALLY try I can force myself to remember, but I rarely think to do that, and usually it ends up with me entering a bad state. On top of this my none bad self has an uncanny ability to not give a shit about anything, or maybe thats the wrong way of putting it, I am almost afraid of caring. See usually I enter these bad states when I think too much, which is why I often bombard myself with stimuli as when I have a lack of something to occupy my Brain, my ears and my eyes I start to freak, which makes it so fucking hard to do stuff like play guitar and draw and read and write and design my DnD stuff and Painting my models and designing shit and researching science and history and clean and wash and do normal shit. Anyway as soon as I start thinking about my life and things I need to do I start to freak out, I really have to think HARD to occupy all of my brain and ONNE HUNDRED PERCENT focus on something or have distractions while I'm doing something otherwise my brain will start going into bad places and I'll start to think about that black hole and The fog will return. So caring is not really something I enjoy as a lot of the times that includes alot of thinking, and especially when said caring is caring about my own future and myself so I tend to avoid caring and thinking about myself because that means I'll start to think about that bad. (However one exception to this no thinking thing is talking, I LOVE TALKING TO PEOPLE, even if Im an anxious little dongus, and as weird as it sounds, I fantasise about talking to people about things I enjoy and kind of talk to my self about the things Im interested in and would love to think over more, which in itself allows me to think about that shit. (However one exception to this talking to myself being an exception to the no thinking thingy is that whenever I talk to my self about myself, I am no longer fantasising about talking to others, I am straight up having a conversation with myself about my self hatred and how FRUSTRATED I am and how retardly absurd and funny I find it all, but how much I feel like I'm suffering but how I feel like I'm weak for suffering like this, BUT HOW I KNOW IM NOT WEAK FOR SUFFERING LIKE THIS EVERYBODY WOULD, I know that but I keep telling myself that I am weak. Also it doesnt feel like the two mes that are talking are 2 different people, It feels like Im talking to myself and debating myself about the things about myself Im unsure about which is everything? God I dont tfucking know.)) ( I imagine all my use of weird brackets in weird places is confusing, I hope its not even though, I'm actively, currently doing it, I just like writing how I would talk, I go on a lot of tangents, but then again, I could edit this and get rid of all this confusing shit, but idk I dont want to, it wouldnt feel natural, I want this message to come directly out of my head, I don't want it to read like a history essay or someshit, Idek why tbh Its not like it would take away from anything.)  
Jesus fuck back to the point, So this poses 4 problems with counseling and even seeing doctors. One would be when Im freaking out in a bad place, whatever, I physically, well mentally, but kind of physically cant go. If I had an appointment tomorrow and I had to get up at say, 6AM, I'd probably get up at 6AM, but if that day I started to get enveloped, fog would slowly start to Wrap around my head, I'd mindlessly get ready to set off but all while I am doing so I will be actively telling myself in my head, ""you can't go in, you wont, you know you wont, you know how you feel, its impossible."" and I'll keep getting dressed, not in a rush VERY SLOWLY like a fucking zombie ,all while telling myself ""No, shut the fuck up, Im going to iM going I CANT NOT GO I NEED TO""  
but why am i not in a rush, I havent put my coat or my shoes on yet and I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago, ""Why are you still getting ready, you know you cant make it, you have failed again"" and at this point, I will either give up, curl into a ball and let the fog fill me until my mum eventually comes into my room and says something like ""wasnt you supposed to go????"", and Im not the type to lie, I used to lie to my mum about why I wasnt going places, but nowadays I just tell her, shes always disapointed in me. If I leave I will make my way there as normal SHOUTING IN MY HEAD ITS ALL OK IM JUST GOING TO ARRIVE AND ITS ALL GOING TO BE FINE, But I do know that I wont go in when i get there, the only reason I left the house is to comfort my self to pretend for 10 minutes that im not a pathetic waste of space, that I can do it, but I know I cant, and Ill arrive Ill see the location, my heart will sink and Ill turn around and walk home.  
And the other problem is that if I wake up not feeling bad, I'll still get ready, but I wont rush I wont even think ""errr its 7am already you NEED TO GO NOW"" I wont think of the time, Ill just mindlessly thoughtlessly follow the motions with as many distractions as possible, and when I leave the house, Ill put on music, (I cant leave the house without music, I need something to listen to, and without music without that to listen to all the noises i hear outside will freak me out and Ill start going into a bad place) Usually as soon as that music is in my ears and Im outside, Ill notice the time ""WHY THE FUCK DID I LET IT GET THIS LATE"" Ill freak out and rush to the appointment in a panic. Very rarely Im on time, usually Im late, When Im late I start to think I cant help but think what are they going to say whats going to happen I should be there Im not Im late, I begin to entrap myself once again, Frozen I dont know what to do, sometimes I do go in when Im late most of the time I dont  
On top of that, If i even get to the session, I'm usually in a calm state, because heres the thing I get anxious BEFORE I get there once I arrive, Im calm as can be, but as soon as I get asked ""so whats up"" or ""whats the issue"" or whatever, I go blank, what the fuck is the issue???? I mean there is one, I know, its my mental health theres something up with it, what is it what is it. usually when a doctor asks me that I go silent for a few seconds get frustrated and say something along the lines of ""I dont know, I think, maybe, I mean its like Depression and anxiety I guess, BUT ITS NOT JUST THAT, but I guess its just depression and anxiety...."" and they either give me a perscription for anti depressants or tell me to go to group counseling. The one on one, Counseling is better, when they ask me whats up, I struggle to answer and they see that, they pull answers out of me, usually after a counseling session I FEEL LIKE MYSELF, because Im tellingthem about my problems and that puts me into a little bit of a bad place, but the fact Im talking to someone about it, naturally Im joking about it, Im laughing about it, which puts me inbetween these two places. When Im on my own I cant Laugh and joke AND think about it, but when im in a counseling session they force me to in a way. But again that usually takes the majority of the session to get me into that state. ive only ever had two one on one counsellors, 1 was just a highschool, history teacher who cared and allowed me to speak to them, I will never forget them, and the other was a College counsellor who I got told to have sessions with after my first failure. She was always worried when I would laugh about my suffering and about my self hatred and my situation, she thought I had some kind of dissociative dissorder and understood my problems talking to doctors so gave me a letter to give to them explaining her experience counseling me, but the doctors told me that she was wrong and said it was probably just depression and anxiety. I was always laughing about it, she never saw me in a bad state, until one day my then girlfriend found me, frozen in the prison of my own mind, I can barely remember it, but she Grabbed me picked me up and took me to the counsellor, the counsellor saw how much of a wreck I was, I was not in that body at the time, felt like I was watching through third person, tears swelling, mouth gaping, eyes red, shaking, when she saw me she rescheduled her current appointment and brought me in to talk to, I was in that state for maybe 5 10 minutes talking toher before in a SNAP, I wiped away the tears, apologised for the inconvienence laughed about how much of a nuisance I must of been, and started joking about the situation, I KNEW how fucking strange that was, but I didnt particularly care, it was really REALLY funny.  
Also I just remembered this and didnt know where to put it, but one time maybe a month ago I was in my room when I started to fall into that black hole, I silently Cried and cried it was the worst I felt in years (the start of this story happened in 2015 so its been about 4 years) anyway, I was wracking my mind trying to convince my self to let my dreams of making a name for myself and leaving a legacy go and just fucking kill myself and end the suffering, I told my self how ridiculous I was sounding, I cant I CANT DO THAT JESUS, when I suddenly thought ""my fucking god I NEED TO TELL SOMEONE NOW i NEED TO JUST TELL MY MUM, but I wont will I? Ill just start laughing and not caring and just fucking open a youtube video"" thats when I smiled to my self and was like ""omg im literally doing that now ahahahahah FUCKING HELL THIS IS SO RETARDED AHAHAHAHAH I CANT BELIEVE IM THIS FUCKED UP AHAHAHAHAH"" so thats probably like a problem? I mean Im laughing about that as Im writing this.

ANYFUCKINWAY JESUS, when we last left of the TIMELINE, I had just failed to get through my second year of college, Shortly after this, I started to isolate myself, I really started to hate myself and because of this I distanced myself from my then girlfriend and unfortunately we broke up, tough break, it was a fuckinnnnggg rough breakup as well, but we are all cool now it was mostly my fault it was so rough. On top of all this, I hadnt succeeded to get through a year of college twice in a row now and my friends were all moving on to university, they were all so successful and I was so proud of them all, BUT SO GOD DAMN ENVIOUS, I DREAMED ALWAYS DREAMED OF GOING TO UNIVERSITY, GETTING A PHYSICS OR A PSYCHOLOGY OR A FILM DEGREE IM INTERESTED IN SO MANY THINGS I JUST WANTED TO LEARN AND GET QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCE THAT UNIVERSITY LIFE. so that summer I was in a REAL bad place, but I gathered my self, I told my self, that I was going to I WAS I NEEDED TO, succeed that third time, the college I was in wouldnt let me get a 3rd year, So i had to move to a different one, no biggy, unfortunately they didnt think me capable of doing a triple A level or a triple BTEC course so instead they said the only course I was capable to was a health and social care qualification (which to be fair was kind of fucking insulting to those in the health and social course, what are they less than triple Science guys??? I mean christ people in the health and social course have to do internships in old peoples homes and in mental health care places on top of their coursework which isnt exactly fucking easy, Imsure if they can succeed in that they can succeed in the triple science fuck AND I Heard that same story in a lot of the students many of them wanted to do A levels but told that the health and social care BTEC was the only thing they were capable of, fucking bastards). The thing is with this third time is that by now I was 18 turning 19, while the people I was in class with were like 16, on top of this I knew no one in the college and soon as all my friends were now living successful lives in their universities I was all alone, and it was incredibly hard to make friends with anyone in that class, because for one Im awful at approaching people and 2 all of them were fucking cunts xD. Well not all of them, most of them were quite nice admitedly my personality just clashed with many of theirs, only one or two of them were really cunty, HOWEVER I did make one friend in that university, she was basically me but with tits so we got along quite famously xD. Unfortunately though she moved to a different college (we still hang out every now and again) so I was alone again apart from the few times I managed to meet her or go join my friends in uni, but those occasions while amazing were rare, as Im not exactly from a rich family, and the times Ive tried working I fucked it up fast and was fucking terrorfied, which I still find pathetic cos i dont want people to think Im lazy, I swear im not fucking lazy i just cant do it.

Eventually I sabotaged my self again though, It was maybe this time last year when I stopped going to college again, when I failed again. I always used to say "" Hey, third times the charm right??? WHAT COULD GO WRONG "" Id laugh, I \*KNEW\* I was going to succeed that third time, I didnt have a doubt in my mind, Until well I failed. shortly after that I visited my friends uni flat, I think we played poker, and played a little bit of super seducer, and laughed and we might of filmed something for one of the rarty Films i make , and as I lay on their sofa at night, everyone was asleep, I cried, all their friends were so nice, EVERYTHING WAS SO NICE, I just wished I could be with them, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE US THREE AGAINST THE WORLD, They are so much better than I am, I love them so much because they can get through anything, I dont tell them enough, I layed on their sofa knowing I wouldnt be able to go through a 4th time I begged my self to just go to their kitchen and slit my wrists, I BEGGED AND I BEGGED BUT I COULDNT DO IT, I CANT.

I havent mentioned my father since one ofthe first paragraphs, hes not a big part of my life, but I do visit him maybe once or twice a year for a weekend or so, it took me a whole year to tell my dad I dropped out of college the first time, Man was he angry, he was so disapointed, his wife was worse xD, I remember once In a pub before I told them, they were bragging to their friends about how I was doing triple science and maths and how proud they are and how im going to go to uni and go do physics and then how I wanted to get into quantum physics and I sat there hating myself How the fuck was I supposed to tell them what on earth do i say. I didnt tell them because they would be disapointed in me and I was right, I shouldnt of held that from them, my relationship with my dad as always been strenuous, I love the guy, and He loves me but my god He doesnt make an effort xD, He never payed child support, He hardly ever came to visit and he hardly ever got me anything for christmas or my birthday, and obviously that shit doesnt mean anything today, but when I was a child that was a big deal, I mean its not like he was strapped for a cash either, I remember one time him promising me to take me and my sister on a cruise, and how he'd buy us passports and it will be amazing, my mother isnt exactly well off so that idea sounded like a fucking dream, but nah never happened, he went on his fuckin own, and when i was little twice a year he'd go abroad with his wife and her kids and my uncle, cousin and my grandparents never once did he bring me, my brother or my sister. I still havent been abroad yet, but it didnt even need to be abroad I just wanted to spend time with him xD the most exotic holiday ive been on was blackpool for 3 days with my mum, it was one of the best weekends of my life, she was so strapped for cash, but took me to as many places as she could, even extended it by a day. And he complains that I dont send him christmas cards anymore xD. Admitedly, thats just my petty way to get back at him xD.

but yeah I spent 6 months after i dropped out of college half heartedly looking for a job, knowing I was too scared too afraid of both the social aspect but mostly of failure I knew was going to happen. My family were all so disapointed and for good reason, I was pathetic, stuck in my room leaching of everybody for months but it would always fcuking sting, whenever my brother, mother, her asshole boyfriend or my dad who thinks he knows me, told me to get one, it was always said in a patronising way, well apart from my mum she was more supportive about it. BUT I KNOW WHY OF COURSE THEY WARE DISAPOINTED OF COURSE THEY ARE PATRONISING WHY WOULDNT THEY BE.  
anyway I got a job around August, I was lured in by the promise of managerial training, and big money, but of course it was a fucking scam. If any of you guys know the ol' Direct sales Slave circle Scam, you'll know what I got into. I worked maybe 50 to 60 hours a week and the most i made in a week was ¬£100, I tell people thats why I left. That isnt why I left. I knew I was in a scam, but I was so desperate I just wanted to make it work, I had seen the warnings I had seen the signs but i was SO GOD DAMN DESPERATE FOR SOMETHING IN MY FUCKING LIFE TO WORK OUT, I stuck with it, but naturally my fucked up mind started to stumble, so ultimately I had to leave. Luckily The scam required me to be TECHNICALLY self-employed so i wasn't ""fired"" per say which might have left a scar on my already pretty fuckin barren CV. I left that scam late September, and since then I've been quarter heartedly job hunting. everytime I get a job interview, I know it wont work out, theres no fucking hope for me, I almost never went i always crumbled. I always failed, This is the longest period of pure self hatred and pure darkness Ive been in, I have no money, in fact Im in fucking debt, When I got that scam job I THOUGHT I would have steady pay so i fucking stupidly signed up for a phone contract  
So im currently about ¬£180 in debt, so that means no more going to see my friends, One time my friends payed for me to see them, but I dont want to be more of a leach I cant do that again.  
My friend managed to set me up with a job though, I start training tomorrow, Im so terrorfied of stumbling again, because, For the first time before starting something new, Im not 100% sure Ill succeed, I know Ill fail, I know Ill just fuck it up again, and what do i do then? On one side, I dont want my Hope to die, Ive always been a happy go lucky ""OF COURSE I CAN DO IT JEEEEEEZZZZ WHY ARE YOU DOUBTING ME"" kind of guy, When I do things Im either full of real confidence or false confidence, even while doing things that scare me like talking to girls Im full of confidence in my actions, but thats all gone now. In 2015 after my first failure, I shook away the darkness and screamed at the sky that I could do it, that it was just a stumble and Ill stand up and fight through the pain, that in 10 years someone will write a fucking book about me and some student will read through it like ""oh darn what a cool guy, he had a tough youth, cool guy I want to be like that guy"" because they had to. I had to make a difference, I had to, EVEN IF IT WAS FOR ONE GOD DAMN PERSON. Theres no hope now, I still laugh I still joke, but theres no optimism now, theres no happy go lucky, i just put on a masquerade.  
I'm so scared."

anc8xr,2,2019-02-05,"Potentially getting fired from my job sometime this week, what should I do?",Throwaway_Feb42019,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/anc8xr/potentially_getting_fired_from_my_job_sometime/,"Hello, /r/personalfinance! This is a throwaway for reasons specified below. Some details have been changed, but the general gist of it is there.

There was an accident involving machinery at my company which made the news; one of my co-workers was talking about it on Facebook, so I replied to his status with a link to a Reddit thread. I posted pictures and a video of the aftermath (taken from the Reddit thread).

The next morning, I got called up to see the managers when I reported for work. The managers were angry that I used some technical terms in my comment, as well as the fact that I was spreading videos posted online. They also said that because my profile indicated I worked at the company, I was acting as an unofficial representative of the company, which is bad‚Ñ¢.

From my perspective, I was discussing something that happened at work with my coworker, and shared another discussion. The ""proprietary terms"" are fairly generic, but since the company uses them they're considered ""proprietary."" They suspended me without pay and told me that I'll get a call back after HR reviews my case. Then I'll come back to work one more time and get told whether I'm fired or not.

The good news: I'm union. The union rep assigned to my case thinks that there's a solid chance I'll be put back to work, especially since there were about a dozen other people caught in the same situation (and more that the company either didn't know about or decided not to prosecute). I have the contact information for the union, but I haven't heard anything from them since I was suspended.

Another thing: I'm injured, and in California's Worker's Comp program. I broke a bone at work a month ago, and although I'm healed enough to go back to work, my employer was still making me go to checkups on company time and get physical therapy on company time. I've now missed 2 PT sessions and a checkup.

I should be hearing back sometime this week from management regarding the outcome of what HR decides. The union should be there, and while the rep again thinks that I'll be put back to work, there's a chance that I'll be let go. Other than this incident, I'm in relatively good standing, with no history of discipline.

I'm also currently a student at a state university. I'm on academic probation because my job has been demanding me too much and I couldn't focus on school, but at the same time I can't afford to drive to school without a job (it's a commute). Buses/trains don't run late enough to pick me up, and the bus ride will take a few hours.

I'm also waiting to hear back regarding an internship at another company. I sent a follow-up email 2 weeks ago and got a reply saying they were still working on getting back to me. This would be a temporary internship over the summer, and nothing has been offered to me yet (I would still have 2 more rounds of interviews to get through).

---

Now, the financial situation as of now:

## Credits:

* I'm going to get at least 2 more paychecks. The first will be for what little I worked last week; the last will be about 20 hours of sick + vacation pay. Between the two, I'm expecting about $400, after taxes.

* I have $40 in checking and about $500 in savings. I had a bigger emergency fund, but my girlfriend got into a car accident last month and I helped her pay for a new car. I also helped her with rent, since she missed a lot of work due to the accident.

* I have about $400 in a HSA. I also currently have medical insurance through my work.

* I have about $500 in a tax refund coming to me, whenever Uncle Sam sends it. It's going to savings.

* I've been putting money into a 401(k), since the company has been matching it. I don't know how to access this outside of using employer-provided links, though, and I don't know how to transfer it to another company if needed.

* My parents have offered to help if I need it. They're really proud of me going out on my own and working, though, and I'd be ashamed to tell them I got fired.

* Assuming I change jobs, I probably have a good chance of getting a job at McDonald's or something. I feel like I would hate my life there more than I do at my current employer, though, but it would be a steady paycheck.

* **TOTAL:** $540 available right now, $400 available within 2 weeks, $500 whenever I get my tax refund. I also have $400 in an HSA and my parents have offered to help.

## Expenses:

* My share of the rent is about $650. I just paid $800 in rent on the 1st. Lease is up in May. We were originally planning on going apartment shopping next month, depending on whether I got an internship/promotion.

* This week, I have internet ($50) and phone ($50) bills.

* In a couple weeks, I have to pay the electric bill ($60 or so).

* I have 2 credit cards. One has $600 on it and one has $800 on it. Both payments are $50 each, due in about 3 weeks.

* My girlfriend's parents have paid for groceries that we're going to rely on if I lose my job. These groceries should hopefully last us until the end of the month. Usually this costs about $100.

* My car has just lost a headlight and needs an oil change. I can put off the oil change for a hit longer, but I might get pulled over regarding the headlight any time I drive at night. I have a 3/4 full tank of gas. Filling up costs $30; I usually fill up every 2 weeks (assuming a daily commute).

* School charges me $8/day to park. I go twice a week.

* **TOTAL:** $116 due this week, $16 due week after, $76 due in 2 weeks, $116 due in 3 weeks, $666 due in 4 weeks.

---

With that out of the way, questions:

* Assuming I get put back to work, should I stay? I've been wanting to leave for a while; my spark is gone and I've been thinking about getting something more in my career path. However, without a degree it's likely I'd be relying on temp work, since it's the only thing in my field that I'm qualified for.

* I was waiting to hear back regarding a promotion to another department within the company; I actually thought I got called in to see the managers at first because I got promoted. I doubt I'm going to get it now, but a friend of mine has told me to push and see if the union will keep my record clean. Is it even worth it? I don't know how much power the union really has; I've heard a lot of stories about when they messed up, but not a lot about times they've pulled through. I'm not sure how much of that is selection bias, though.

* Assuming I get fired, do I still list this company as part of my work history? What do I say when interviewers ask why I left? It's my only significant work experience, even if it's not in my field.

* If I rely on my parents... How much should I ask for? Moving back in is pretty much out of the question; my girlfriend can't afford to live on her own, and her parents are out of state.

* How do I maintain an emergency fund? It feels like every time I get ~2 months worth of funds saved up, life happens and I get back down to little or nothing. Before this, it was placing a deposit down on our apartment. In theory, we *should* get most of that back... although my cat has done a number on the place.

* I've looked at the CA state unemployment laws, and it seems as if I would be eligible after a phone interview, since I got fired for a one-time offense (assuming I get fired). I made about $20k last year through the company; how much would I get for unemployment? How does that work?

* Is there any recourse for not being able to go to doctor's appointments/physical therapy? I'm *technically* on Worker's Comp (I have state paperwork), but I was being accommodated at work. I need a company ID to get into the physical therapy area, and I don't have one at the moment. The bone I broke has been hurting and getting stiff without PT, but that also might be due to the weather. Again, I don't know how helpful the union will be in practice.

Thanks for your help!"
ancmjt,306,2019-02-05,I managed to turn my life socially and academically (with help) around in the span of less than two years,JohannesClimaco,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ancmjt/i_managed_to_turn_my_life_socially_and/,"During the summer of 2017, I was incredibly depressed. I had failed 3 semesters of university in a row and I felt like I had ran my life into a corner. To be honest, I felt incredibly suicidal and spent multiple days crying spontaneously about how I was going to end my life. I was about to return to school in the Fall but I hadn't spent any time after a year of leave preparing even though this would be my last chance of returning to school.

However, things turned out incredibly different that year. Some things ended up happening that allowed me to not only pass my classes but get on the dean's list. I also ended up finding a paid internship for that summer too.

The most important thing that happened is I ended up getting a new best friend. They had roomed with me for the last couple of months, which made us pretty close. This changed my attitude towards social interactions dramatically. Instead of desperately trying to find a good friend at uni, I figure my bff's friendship alone could be fine. This allowed me to have a more chill attitude while socializing and made me much more appealing.

Another thing I decided to do was to get some roommates. I had lived in singles before, which meant that I would go days or weeks without real socializing. I asked the university housing office to specifically place me in a suite, even if it meant living with strangers. This arrangement allowed me to have company and for me to practice socializing more often. While I didn't become bffs with my roommates, it was a fine experience that didn't have any drawbacks for me. 

Something else that helped me was getting an Adderall prescription. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, but I felt uneasy taking stimulants because I always felt sick. However, I found that for me, taking them with food helped. I try not to take my medicine too often, just usually when I'm cramming for exams. But it made a big difference.

I changed how I wrote papers too. Before, I felt paralyzed when I was writing them because I felt the need to use fancy-shmancy language with a lot of jargon. I also felt the need to be perfect. However, after I forced myself to write a paper by putting down anything I thought of, the teacher gave me a pretty good grade. I found out that teachers often don't want complicated papers and are fine with simple papers that are easy to read. Thus, I stopped forcing myself into a writing style that I was uncomfortable with.

I also tried to get to know my professors better and attend office hours, which I had never done in the past. My professors were generally happy to see that I had interest in the material and I was engaged in class. I think it also made them more amenable to giving out extensions. In general, I think professors tend to be incredible resources in university that a lot of students miss out on. 

Another thing that happened was in the Spring semester, I tried applying for an internship I found on a university club mailing list I had subscribed to. I found out that the internship had a sister program on the day the application was due. Since I had such little time and my GPA was so uncompetitive, I figured there was no chance I could get in. I went to a coffee shop that Friday and wrote some things down as practice. Later, I did get interviewed and accepted to a paid program that I never could have believed was possible. Part of the reason was that my professors had written good recs for me. It was definitely a stroke of luck, but I'm so glad I took the time to apply too. You never know what you will get into. 

My summer internship was a big changing part of my life. I got to get flown into another state and spent much of the summer traveling around. I had a lot of ideological differences with my friends, which I think my the summer very frustrating at times, but I don't regret the opportunity to have new, authentic experiences and continue developing my interpersonal skills. 

I don't have any advice except for keep trying (but not too hard). For better or worse, things happen that are out of your control. Not everything has been roses, but my life has dramatically improved for the better. 

I do recognize that a lot of the things that happened to me were outside of my control. My parents had the ability and desire to see me go back to school after multiple failures. My best friend decided to take a chance on me despite me acting shitty to them in the past. My internship took a big risk in deciding to hire me.

For a lot of people, I don't think this post is helpful at all, but maybe your luck is waiting around the corner. Who knows?"
and1qb,1,2019-02-05,"""How dare you tell my kid what to do!""",FloofusLongus,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/and1qb/how_dare_you_tell_my_kid_what_to_do/,"So, when I was in high school, around 16-17, I did an internship in a bookstore. It was owned by an elderly couple, that were highly religious, but always treated me well, we even had religious debates, since I am agnostic. Never had any issues, some weird customers, sure, but every place gets those.  


The only story that stayed with me was of this one lady and her son.  


The kid was maybe 3 or 4, a cute boy. I love kids and want my own, so I often end up keeping an eye on kids when they are in my store. His mom went with the owner to talk about what books she wanted while I watched the register. I see the kid climb on one of the low shelves, that had no top, and then starting to run across the books... I was shocked and quickly came to him, picked him up, put him on the ground and told him, mind you calmly and in a baby voice, that he shouldn't do it, since they were for sale and if he broke them, he'd get in trouble. He seemed to understand what I said and nodded and I thought it was over.  


Big mistake.  


His mom runs to me, screaming at me that I had no right to tell her child what to do and I was limiting his ""personal development and creativity"" and a lot of mean words. I was young and emotional, still am, and I just began to cry. The wife of owner came to us, I sobbingly explained what happened and she told me to rest in the back while she dealt with this.  


I just cried in the back, a coworker came to soothe me and since it was summer, the lady gave us all coworkers ice cream (we did that once a week, get ice cream from tips we got). Apparently she told the mom to leave and not return till she showed her employees respect.  


I live far away from there, but when I visit there, I always stop by the bookstore, I am glad she actually supported me and didn't blame me for this nutcase's behavior."
ane0r2,7,2019-02-05,I‚Äôve finally figured out what I want to do professionally,Skrait2DVD,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ane0r2/ive_finally_figured_out_what_i_want_to_do/,"When I was a kid, I started producing electronic music. I loved it (and still do) and was pretty decent at it. For years, I was dead set on pursing a music career, but when I about 20, I decided the lifestyle that comes with it just wasn‚Äôt for me. This put me in a weird spot during college because I had absolutely no idea what else I wanted to pursue. I ended up getting a super broad degree and banked on my internship and campus involvement landing me a job somewhere. 

As you can imagine, this didn‚Äôt work out too well. I‚Äôm 24 now and I‚Äôve worked at a few different places trying to find a good fit and discover a new passion, but didn‚Äôt have any luck. This made me pretty depressed and having no clear direction brought me tons of anxiety. However, back in November of last year, I was talking to a coworker about our career plans and he said he was considering learning programming. Something clicked in my brain and I thought ‚ÄúBoom. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm going to learn programming.‚Äù

Since then, I‚Äôve been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pursue a web development career. I‚Äôm studying and coding everyday and absolutely love it. I‚Äôm hoping to start freelancing by the end of the year, or if I‚Äôm really lucky, land a full time position with a company. It feels so great knowing that I‚Äôm finally going down the ‚Äúright‚Äù track and I just wanted to share my excitement!"
ane5u4,13,2019-02-05,At what point do I worry that I'm being under-utilized during a busy season Big4 internship?,b4intern,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ane5u4/at_what_point_do_i_worry_that_im_being/,"So I'm about a month into my internship with a b4 firm in the southeast region. The other interns keep talking about how they don't get home until 10 or 11, work full days on weekends, etc., but I have had it surprisingly easy. I get to leave at 6, with little to no work to do at home/ on the weekends. I know that some engagements are worse than others in terms of work/life balance, but as I roll onto my second engagement, I can sense that this one will go about the same. My first team seemed to like me a lot, told me I was doing great for an intern and doing good work. Unfortunately, my senior hasn't submitted my official review yet, so as far as I know they could have been just acting nice.

I know that not working enough during busy season isn't really worthy of complaints, but I just can't help but feel like it could be a sign that I might not get a full-time offer. Has anyone else had a similar experience (either as an intern or with an intern) and could give me some insight?"
aneo3d,32,2019-02-05,New computer book with nuclear students/engineers in mind,digital_superpowers,nuclear,https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/aneo3d/new_computer_book_with_nuclear_studentsengineers/,"Hi. I'm a reactor physicist/technical engineering manager in the US advanced reactor business. A lot of people ask me what they should do to prep for a nuclear design job. Along the way, I realized that while the reactor part of education is fairly obvious, the computer side is less clear. So I independently wrote an e-book tour of various (almost all open-source) tools that I've learned through the years and have been able to leverage towards reactor design. I added some bonus stuff in there too. It's broad, so it has to be brief on each topic. 

Some nuclear-specific tips:

* The command line is your friend. Do not fear it. It will help you immensely
* `grep` \+ `awk` and/or `perl` are great for quickly grabbing what you need out of reactor simulation software. You gotta know about regular expressions to use it well
* Column editing is essential for preparing input files for reactor codes
* `Python` programming should be taught to all middle-schoolers. Everyone in the industry should know a few basics; it can increase data-management efficiency by several orders of magnitude. For mod/sim, the guy at INL who taught me Python was soon upset that I finished my 3-month internship in 2 weeks and had to teach me other wonderful things
* `Imagemagick` \+ `ffmpeg` are great for turning a bunch of individual plots from different timesteps of a simulation into a sweet movie. 
* `GnuPG` is a great way to transfer proprietary and/or export controlled information to associates.
* Inkscape is amazing for figures in publications or dissertations
* `units` can convert femtobarns to square teraparsecs (the conversion between those is 1.05 googol)
* Web apps written in things like Django are incredible for lightweight corrective action systems and other process stuff
* `git` can do your science and docs in a traceable and rewindable way
* `LaTeX` and its little brothers Markdown/`pandoc` and rst/`Sphinx` are unbelievably powerful for technical documentation written by both computers and humans (think auto-updating validation documentation). 

The book is called [Digital Superpowers](https://digitalsuperpowers.com/). I can't promise that it's good because it's my first book and no one has reviewed it yet. But I think you of all people may find it useful. Again it's solidly intermediate, so if you've been programming for years, it may be too simple. "

anf7pg,2,2019-02-05,Should I go travel abroad for a semester?,Jkl1999,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/anf7pg/should_i_go_travel_abroad_for_a_semester/,"I have been lucky enough to travel to some amazing places so far in my life so I know that if I were to go abroad I would have an amazing time. I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science, I am on track to graduate a semester early so I do technically have the time to do it. My hesitation is that I would be going my Spring semester junior year, I am worried that if I go I will have a difficult time getting an internship for that summer. I know that an internship the summer before graduation can lead to a job offer so I don't want that to happen. On top of that if I go abroad I would not be taking any CS classes that semester, which would turn into a full semester + the summer without doing CS material, which I don't want to do. Despite the negatives, I know that it would be an amazing experience, and I love traveling. I know that I likely will not have the opportunity to travel for months at a time ever again in my life. I have also considered maybe only doing a winter session abroad next winter, this wouldn't affect my plan to graduate early, nor would it prevent me from taking certain CS classes. However, the winter sessions abroad are much shorter and limited in options. "
anfmm2,5,2019-02-05,I managed to turn my life socially and academically (with help) around in the span of less than two years,JohannesClimaco,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/anfmm2/i_managed_to_turn_my_life_socially_and/,"During the summer of 2017, I was incredibly depressed. I had failed 3 semesters of university in a row and I felt like I had ran my life into a corner. To be honest, I felt incredibly suicidal and spent multiple days crying spontaneously about how I was going to end my life. I was about to return to school in the Fall but I hadn't spent any time after a year of leave preparing even though this would be my last chance of returning to school.

However, things turned out incredibly different that year. Some things ended up happening that allowed me to not only pass my classes but get on the dean's list. I also ended up finding a paid internship for that summer too.

The most important thing that happened is I ended up getting a new best friend. They had roomed with me for the last couple of months, which made us pretty close. This changed my attitude towards social interactions dramatically. Instead of desperately trying to find a good friend at uni, I figure my bff's friendship alone could be fine. This allowed me to have a more chill attitude while socializing and made me much more appealing.

Another thing I decided to do was to get some roommates. I had lived in singles before, which meant that I would go days or weeks without real socializing. I asked the university housing office to specifically place me in a suite, even if it meant living with strangers. This arrangement allowed me to have company and for me to practice socializing more often. While I didn't become bffs with my roommates, it was a fine experience that didn't have any drawbacks for me.

Something else that helped me was getting an Adderall prescription. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, but I felt uneasy taking stimulants because I always felt sick. However, I found that for me, taking them with food helped. I try not to take my medicine too often, just usually when I'm cramming for exams. But it made a big difference.

I changed how I wrote papers too. Before, I felt paralyzed when I was writing them because I felt the need to use fancy-shmancy language with a lot of jargon. I also felt the need to be perfect. However, after I forced myself to write a paper by putting down anything I thought of, the teacher gave me a pretty good grade. I found out that teachers often don't want complicated papers and are fine with simple papers that are easy to read. Thus, I stopped forcing myself into a writing style that I was uncomfortable with.

I also tried to get to know my professors better and attend office hours, which I had never done in the past. My professors were generally happy to see that I had interest in the material and I was engaged in class. I think it also made them more amenable to giving out extensions. In general, I think professors tend to be incredible resources in university that a lot of students miss out on.

Another thing that happened was in the Spring semester, I tried applying for an internship I found on a university club mailing list I had subscribed to. I found out that the internship had a sister program on the day the application was due. Since I had such little time to complete my application and my GPA was so uncompetitive, I figured there was no chance I could get in. I went to a coffee shop that Friday and wrote some things down as practice. Later, I did get interviewed and accepted to a paid program that I never could have believed was possible. Part of the reason was that my professors had written good recs for me. It was definitely a stroke of luck, but I'm so glad I took the time to apply too. You never know what you will get into.

My summer internship was a big changing part of my life. I got to get flown into another state and spent much of the summer traveling around. I had a lot of ideological differences with my friends, which I think my the summer very frustrating at times, but I don't regret the opportunity to have new, authentic experiences and continue developing my interpersonal skills.

I don't have any advice except for keep trying (but not too hard). For better or worse, things happen that are out of your control. Not everything has been roses, but my life has dramatically improved for the better.

I do recognize that a lot of the things that happened to me were outside of my control. My parents had the ability and desire to see me go back to school after multiple failures. My best friend decided to take a chance on me despite me acting shitty to them in the past. My internship took a big risk in deciding to hire me.

For a lot of people, I don't think this post is helpful at all, but maybe your luck is waiting around the corner. Who knows?"
anfnkp,7,2019-02-05,Taggosaurus's Experiments,taggosaurus,creativecoding,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativecoding/comments/anfnkp/taggosauruss_experiments/,"**Hello everyone**!

This is my first post on Reddit. I'd like to share my story (and work) here to get some feedback and guidance. I'm also trying to somehow get a job by showing off my hobby projects on reddit to avoid [getting whiteboarded](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-is-hiring-broken-it-starts-at-the-whiteboard-34b088e5a5db).

**About me:** I'm a 23 yo, male student from India, currently a final year bachelor's candidate pursuing Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani University.

In 2017, I stumbled upon Keith Peter's [lab](https://bit101.github.io/lab/), he made around 150 creative coding experiments w/ native HTML5 Canvas (and many before 2017 as well) and I was really impressed with (+inspired by)  him. Then after some months I got to know about existence of processing and p5.js so I started making my own [experiments](https://ayushsharma.net/experiments) and eventually reached 155 as well by making one everyday like him. I did this because he became a statue of discipline in my eyes and I wanted to become something similar to my siblings (plus I also wanted to impress a cute girl...which didn't go very well for other reasons).

Anyways, source code for all my experiments is available [here](https://github.com/a-y-u-s-h/experiments) (if you star it, you have my thanks!)I have listed, explained, and attached short videos of any 5 (out of first 10) of them below (I would've done it for all but Reddit doesn't allow more than 5 videos in a single post.). Feedback is appreciated!

1. Exp. 1: [Illusion with Circles](https://ayushsharma.net/experiments/1): ([source code](https://github.com/a-y-u-s-h/experiments/tree/gh-pages/1))

[Experiment #1: Illusion with Circles](https://reddit.com/link/anfnkp/video/jlx7iiuewle21/player)

&gt;There are points on smaller circles moving along circumference with tiny phase difference relative to their neighbours. And all the smaller circles lie on bigger circle. User can tune the knobs to change number of smaller circles, radii of objects, speed of rotating points and visibility of various objects (lines, small circles, big circle).  
&gt;  
&gt;I remember making this in around 30 minutes during free time I had between two classes - 7th September 2017. After realizing that this kind of cool output was worth the time I put into it, I began creating something cool everyday for next \~155 days. Took a lot of will power back then but was worth it.

2. Exp. 2.  [WaveOps](https://ayushsharma.net/experiments/2): ([source code](https://github.com/a-y-u-s-h/experiments/tree/gh-pages/2))

[Experiment #2: WaveOps](https://reddit.com/link/anfnkp/video/kamo1yq4ame21/player)

&gt;Exp. 2 was also part of a formal project under a EEE faculty. Objective of my project was to create a Signal Processing Lab as teaching aid for a course called ""Signals and Systems"". In this one user can select two waves, give them shapes, pick their frequencies and amplitudes. The third wave (bottom-most) is the output of some operation between above two waves (addition, multiplication). It also will show you representations in frequency domain.

[Experiment #5: Lissajous Figure Creator](https://reddit.com/link/anfnkp/video/jfx6nwg9pme21/player)

&gt;By 5th experiment I became a person who used to think what to create tomorrow every night before going to sleep. Most of my inspirations initially came from my high school physics course. I remember being taught Lissajous Figures so I tried building something that I can show people to explain what they are.

[Experiment #6: Fractal Tree](https://reddit.com/link/anfnkp/video/5m8mqotjrme21/player)

&gt;I usually just create non moving things and add the controls in the end. It was mind blowing for me as well ..when I first tried adding controls for angles of the branch. Looks cool! A good ice-breaker when I show people my experiments personally.

5. Exp. 7 [Orbital Motion: 2D Implementation](https://ayushsharma.net/experiments/7): ([source code](https://github.com/a-y-u-s-h/experiments/tree/gh-pages/7))

[Experiment #7: Orbital Motion - 2D Implementation](https://reddit.com/link/anfnkp/video/ytk249dkwme21/player)

&gt;I began making this thinking that I'll make something related to [the Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan). Ended up with this. Usually it takes many hours of imagining what to make and approximately 2 hours  (¬± 1.5 hours) coding it.

**Dilemmas I'm facing:**

**1.** These are not the only projects I have, neither JS is the only language I know (I know around 16-20 and I switch between them swiftly because I've spent months modifying my workflow). JS experiments is what I do as a hobby. And that is why I'm conflicted: I can show these off to someone who's ready to listen (most people don't even see the projects) and maybe get a job somewhere, but do I really want that? Associating what I love with work may destroy my love for it. So getting a job related to UI is the last thing I want even though I love doing it.

**2.** So keeping that in mind, I honed my Data Science, Backend development and Data Engineering skills in last 12 months, learned several other languages and paradigms; and honestly I find DSC and backend work more doable than front end work (managers seem to have lots of unrealistic expectations from frontend guys), but no one is Data Science community is ready to hire someone with a Bachelor's having a bunch of [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) certificates and no industry experience other than a 5 month long internship. ""Data Science market demands people who are specialized in it"" - I was told during my data science internship. Or maybe somehow I haven't stumbled upon anyone even considering to hire me (the one's who want to hire offer ridiculously less amount of salary, like almost equal to average rent at that location). I don't know what's the problem - I add these experiments to my resume to show that quality of my work is nice when I'm dedicated, but maybe this same thing indicates to recruiters that I am master of none? I have no clue.

**3.** Till now I haven't tried my hands at freelancing. I haven't tried to make a start-up that maybe makes software to interactively teach concepts? (I'm very good at this but I have no clue how to about how to make it a business). I have enough technical skills to handle every aspect involved in this, but maybe I fear starting out poor right after graduation. So I'm playing safe and trying to get a job so that I can collect some money and experience for initial few years in a decent paying organization.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes to Recruiters:**

If you hire me, all your dreams will come true. If you want to truly test me, please give me a take-home assignment instead of asking me to memorize some algorithm and explain it on a whiteboard or to code it up in some kind of collaborative editor or on Codechef or Hackerrank. That's not what real development is like IMHO. I have seen competitive programmers getting hired into tech giants like Google, Amazon who code up really bad code that's way past saving (and also make my eyes bleed) and some really good coders who create amazing tangible things finding it difficult to even get a job. What's wrong with this world?

Hey, DPP. I'm looking for partners to RP and write with.

I have some extra info for what kind of stuff I‚Äôm into along with a few sample prompts for you down here. I also have plenty more in my profile ranging from simple MF pairings to threesomes and group scenes even up to a prompt roulette and CYOAs both for you and me. I'm always open to suggestions of themes and ideas we could work forward with.

I play long-term and prefer shorter replies, that allow better interaction, usually one or two paragraphs, except for when longer descriptions are needed. I also only do written character descriptions and expect the same. I like introductions, building the dynamic and flirtatious interaction between the characters along with the obvious smut to make things feel more enjoyable and relatable. I don‚Äôt tend to play extremely dominant nor extremely submissive characters but usually on the flirtier and more active side, though I do like the corrupted cute &amp; innocent girl aspect a well.

I also like to write the introductions, so I can set the mood. Some change of pace for the guys of DPP.

##Prompts

**Black Gentlemen‚Äôs club** [GM4M]

It was an urban myth in your city. An elusive gentlemen‚Äôs club dedicated only to serving black men as patrons with quite an open menu. Even a few people around the town were rumored to be there as volunteer staff including the principal of your old school, the hot local news anchor and even mayor‚Äôs wife. You, like everyone else took these as a story meant to ruin their reputations. That was until last night.

Late at night you got a knock on the door and by the time you got to the door there was only a black and gold colored envelope on the doormat.

‚ÄúDue to the recent departure of a member a new spot has opened in the membership of The Black Lounge.

Please take the keycard provided with the invitation to 569 Regal Avenue to get access to the most esteemed establishment of our community. 

Entry to the venue is permitted every day between 10pm to 4am and 11am to 3pm. Leaving outside these hours is prohibited‚Äù

In the bottom of the letter were three pairs of lipstick stains.

Was this what all the rumors where about? You felt the need to find out. 

On Friday night you dressed up in your two-piece suit and decided to investigate. The address led you to a Victorian manor in the old rich neighborhood of the town. You recalled it belonging to the founders of the town up until the late heiress‚Äô passing, which moved it to a historical association founded by the heiress. You showed the keycard at the gates and drove to the parking in the back of the building before making your way in.

The lobby was decorated mainly with red velvet and mahogany, the only person there alongside you was the receptionist. Blonde ponytailed woman on her early 30s dressed in a black button up.

‚ÄúWhat would you like today, sir.‚Äù she asked.

**Friend‚Äôs brothers** [F4MM]

My friend Laura had abandoned me in her room and would be gone for at least two hours with her parents with her. I could hear her brothers, both of whom were certainly lookers, playing something downstairs. Since she had done this to me I felt no pity for her for what I was going to do next.

My name is Emily, I was wearing black low-cut t-shirt showing my C-cup cleavage. With that I had paired white sports shorts with long athletic socks in my feet. I had my brown hair tied to a ponytail with some hair hanging loose on my cheeks. I was 5'7' tall. My eyes are blue, and my nose is slightly up tilted.

I stood up from her bed and walked downstairs where the guys were playing. With determination I walked between them and the living room table, bent over to pick up the remote, exposing my firm ass to them in progress, and sat down on an armchair with it.

**Tomboy taking advantage of her looks** [F4GM]

I‚Äôm Sam. I had never been the girliest of girls, opting to wear hoodies and jeans instead of dresses and girly blouses. But that didn‚Äôt mean that I had differing tastes or less of a thirst for men. After having been broken up from my ex for months and moving to a different city I decided to take the best out of my looks as my thirst had taken out of me.

I had cut my hair into an undercut the previous evening and this morning I was ready to hit the swimming hall. I put a loose hoodie on along with my black jeans. I knew my face was androgynous enough to allow me to pass in the men‚Äôs side. Especially with my A cup breasts and average sized butt on my 5‚Äô8‚Äù body.

I jumped on my bike and quickly arrived at the place, bought a ticket and took the first step into the men‚Äôs locker room area.

##Ideas

**Tomboy**

I want to play a tomboy, white tanktop with tiny breasts under it, hair cut short or boyishly to shoulder length, cargo pants and sneakers

**Flight attendants**

Play set in a red-eye with you and some flight attendants going at it when other's are sleeping.

**Blackmailed threesome**

For this I'm looking to play a cheating woman in a high position with you playing both the man I'm cheating with and the person who catches us. Two basic ideas are you being a high school student (18+) who catches his two teachers going at it. Or an intern in my company who catches me with a rival ceo etc.

**MILF**

Basic idea of your hot neighbour MILF. I haven't figured how to start this one out.

anfxko,27,2019-02-05,All I wanted was my apple :(,biryaniluver69,EDAnonymous,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/anfxko/all_i_wanted_was_my_apple/,"I live at home with my mom with my older sister. My sister usually eats from out and my mom doesn‚Äôt grocery shop so it falls on me. I have a job, an internship, am studying for the LSAT, and go to the gym every day, so my schedule is pretty tight. 

I try to limit my grocery shopping to once every two weeks but that can be hard since I only feel safe eating fresh fruit in the morning. I try to buy lots of frozen veggies, but I like to have fresh fruits &amp; select fresh veggies (like mushrooms, carrots, spinach) in the house. 

I lived by myself in college, so for a long time, I bought only enough produce for myself. But then, my family would eat all of it. So, I started to get more of these things. But then, they would go bad. Like they wouldn‚Äôt eat them when I got enough for everyone. So I just continued getting enough for only me to reduce waste. 

Anyways,  my mom hasn‚Äôt gone grocery shopping in months and it‚Äôs really beginning to frustrate me. I have such little time to get it done and then when I do, all the food I purchased for myself is gone. The other day, she went grocery shopping and bought $70 worth of frozen meals! She didn‚Äôt buy a single piece of fresh produce. So I made a quick trip to the shop and got two apples, two cucumbers, baby carrots, and hummus. I don‚Äôt eat much these days, so the carrots and cucumbers are a great snack for me. Apples are usually my breakfast. 

Today, I came home from the gym and my mom tells me she ate my apple. I was upset, but didn‚Äôt say anything about it to her because she‚Äôs very difficult to deal with. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable eating anything else now. I have no time to grocery shop today and I‚Äôm so hungry :( I wanted my apple so badly

And now I‚Äôm so stressed about having to take the time to go grocery shopping this week that I feel too mentally clouded to study :( She really disrupted my whole day by doing this and I feel so frustrated since she bought herself all of those frozen meals but still goes and eats the only food I feel comfortable eating 
:( 

I don‚Äôt know if any of this makes sense but I feel so frustrated and just needed to vent

anfyvq,1,2019-02-05,"I thought I wouldn't survive my freshman year of college. Two years later, I'm financially independent and will start my dream job this summer.",SorryImBooked,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/anfyvq/i_thought_i_wouldnt_survive_my_freshman_year_of/,"TL/DR: things got better--and I'm so glad I'm around to see it

&amp;#x200B;

My freshman year of college was a very difficult time for me, and there were a couple times that I almost tried to permanently 'solve' my problems. I couldn't see how I could make things better, I was so lonely, and I felt like a burden to my friends and family.  The only thing stopping me was that I couldn't find a way to make it look like an accident and I didn't want to make my mom sad.

For context, I grew up with a family member that treated me in awful ways. I had a spot in my closet that I would hide from them.  I looked up to them so much, and I spent all my energy trying to impress them and make them like me, but nothing worked. They had a special smile they would wear when they made me cry--whether in sadness/pain/anger, and it chills me now to remember, but at that time because I had grown up with that person, I thought I was a terrible person because I never made them happy. Just about every day they would tell me that they, my parents, and my friends didn't love me, that no one loved me because I was ugly/dumb/not funny, etc. Now, I realize that they were projecting their own insecurities on me, but it's hard to overcome years of the person you want to impress the most telling you that kind of stuff. Even now, it's hard sometimes to accept the fact that people actually do love me--even my parents and friends.

I've been told that I'm a happy, cheerful person, and I really do try to be! I never let on that I was living through this when it was going on, because I didn't want to bother anyone, and I genuinely thought that I was a terrible person who deserved to be treated in such a way. I genuinely believed, growing up, that I was not loved by anyone, and that I didn't deserve to be. Because why would anyone treat someone that way unless that was the case? But, even if I didn't deserve love, I tried my best to push love out to everyone I met by being super happy and friendly. I especially acted that way to that person. I thought that maybe if I poured out enough love to them, it would one day come back. While I made a lot of acquaintances that way, I never made many close friends. I always kept (and still struggle with this) people at an arm's length because I'm so scared they'll see the same awfulness that that family member saw, and realize that they need to  either treat me the same way they did, or be disgusted and leave.

That person moved away at the end of my senior year of high school. I thought when they left, things would get better. But, it seemed that the constant fear that I felt every day in the presence of that person kindof helped hold me together, and when they left, I didn't have that framework anymore and I started to crumble. I got into a relationship the summer before college with someone who had similar qualities to that family member, and he dumped me right before orientation because I didn't allow him to get close to me/ wasn't ""emotionally available"", whatever that means. Also, I didn't want to put out lol. College was really hard, and I didn't have many friends. My classes were tough and my job sucked, and I was struggling to come to terms with how I was treated growing up. On Christmas day, that family member told me, in front of other people, that they didn't love me, they never did, and that they were so annoyed that I kept trying to love them. That was the worst thing anyone has said to me, I think.

That Christmas was two years, and since then I've dropped out of the state school I attended, because I became so depressed that I physically did not have the energy to get out of bed to go to class. I took online classes at my local community college, and one day recruiters came to my class, I spoke to them, and got an internship! Then, as an intern, I interviewed for a full time position. On the two year anniversary of the day I was a few minutes away from ending things, I got my offer letter for what is literally my dream job at my dream company. I start that position this summer!

I signed a lease and I move this weekend to an apartment far away from that room and house with all those horrible memories. I'm financially independent, and it feels good to be able to take care of myself. I don't have many friends, but the friends I have are amazing. I have a wonderful boyfriend who is so caring, kind, smart, funny, and handsome. He is genuinely one of the most kind people I have met. Because of certain things that family member did, I have a big fear of people touching me, and it was an issue with my last relationship. However, I feel so safe in his arms. He makes me feel cozy with love, if that makes sense. If someone as smart as he thinks that I deserve to be treated well, then it must be true!  I probably won't ever tell anyone the details of what happened when I was growing up because it's just too sad. And I'm so ashamed that I didn't fight back enough. I probably could have prevented a lot of it if I had stood up for myself more. But, I'm healing. I'm breaking out of the mindset that I'm unworthy of love, and every day is a little better. I know bad things will continue to happen, because that's life, but I'm surrounded by so much love and I know I have people in my corner. With that, I think I can face anything!

I used to never believe that things would get better. I lived so long in fear and without hope. But, believe me, things do improve! I know these are just words on a screen, but if you have been through/are going through anything similar, please please know that it is possible. You don't deserve the bad things that have happened. You are worthy of love! Good things are happening, and will happen! Just make sure that you are around to see just how wonderful life can be."

I would classify my use of cannabis to be sporadic.  It started regularly my freshman year of college in which I used very little, but found a lot of benefits from the plant.  I am now a Junior in college.  Over the summer breaks I have smoked maybe once or twice, mostly due to living back with my parents.  Last year my use really ramped up and I started smoking every day.  I now believe that my short term depression(sorry, didn‚Äôt know what word to use) last year was caused by smoking too much and neglecting my grades.  And that brings me to where I am now.  Throughout the month of January I smoked every day at least twice, sometimes more. 

My reasoning for quitting is because I have a bad grade in one of my classes and also that I may be drug tested for a possible internship that I got.  

Yesterday was the first day that I had the motivation to clean my room, bathroom, and do the laundry.  Before I would have gotten high and then not worried about the mess.  

I have always in my life struggled with addiction and overuse of the things that make me feel good.  Some of the things include alcohol, porn, nicotine, and using my phone too much.  I have been clean from nicotine now for 2 weeks or so. Porn probably 4 or 5 days.  

One of the things that I did was write out some goals that I have and took some time to decide if my problems are things that are helping me get closer to those goals or if they are holding me back.  I truly believe that cannabis is a very useful medicine and can help people however some cannot use it responsibly.  

I considered breaking my bong last night but decided against it.  I will probably come back to weed at some point in my life.  Right now I need to take a long break to reset my brain and give myself time to think about how to be able to use responsibly.

This is my first time posting here, hopefully I am following all of your rules.  This is pretty much just a dump of information on my part that lets me get out what is on my head right now."

Like many of you, I was fairly neurotic during the admissions process (refreshing status checkers every day, spending pretty much every hour on this subreddit). I figured that getting into law school would ease my anxiety and I'd spend the next three years happy, fulfilled, challenged, and self-assured.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, there is no shortage of news articles on the mental health challenges faced by both law students and practicing lawyers. You are likely aware of these problems. You might even be a little concerned. Conversely, you might not be thinking about it too much right now. I was somewhere in the middle - I was aware that it was a problem, but figured I would get to it if I ever ""started feeling depressed"". I had had some chronic depression in the past and told myself I would be able to identify and tackle it if it came up.

&amp;#x200B;

I did okay my first semester. I kept up with my classes, saw friends every once in a while, and tried to eat reasonably well (although it can be hard when you're in a rush and there's free food at events). I ended up doing fine grade-wise and will not be at any major disadvantages going forward if I keep it up. However, it was not until after my last final that I realized the anxious-depressive cycle I had fallen into. I hadn't suddenly ""started"" to feel depressed. Slowly, over the course of the semester, I slept worse, had negative thoughts about my classmates, worried about never getting a job, ate worse, and had trouble keeping up with my friends and family back home. I told myself I was just a little stressed but took no active effort to start building the habits I told myself I would get to. After all, the first semester is more disorienting than it is busy and is not a conducive environment to making major life changes for the first time. I was unwilling/unable to start things like figuring out my sleep schedule, eating as healthy as I could, exercising, or just generally being aware of the kinds of thing that contribute to my anxiety and how to best address them. I'm doing better now because I spent my winter break evaluating what I could've done better and I am acting on my goals (plus, I have an idea of what law school is like now). There is no shame in realizing you need to make changes in your life. I know my stubbornness got in the way of being happy and feeling fulfilled in law school.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're feeling a little stressed now with the process of applying, this is a good time to try to find things that can relieve that pressure. Mindfulness techniques (highly recommend Headspace), exercise, watching Netflix, going out with friends, or a combination of all of the above can help you figure out what works and what doesn't. The truth is, a lot of law school looks like this process right now (waiting over a month for your grades sometimes, not hearing back from internships, the blind leading the blind on everything from jobs to classes, and so on.)

&amp;#x200B;

So please, if you're putting off building good habits for when you start law school, please try to start now or as soon as you are able to. It will save you a lot of mental energy later and you'll be able to maintain the perspective needed to get the most out of law school (while it's a lot of work, much of the stress tends to be self-inflicted or completely divorced from the actual demands on your schedule.)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this can help at least one person evaluate what they could do now to help them 5 months from now.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** **Build good habits (mental health and otherwise) that you can carry through with during law school. There is a reason you hear the same advice over and over again from people in this field. That is because it is important advice that everyone wishes they had taken more seriously when they were in your shoes.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some background for the story: I'm 17, and summer after junior year, I secured an internship with a mobile vet practice near where I live. Every day for two months, I traveled around with a Vet and a Vet Tech. We say probably 5/6 people a day, and we got along quite well. They were super nice, and I got to do things like draw blood, administer IV's, and give sub-Q injections. I was pretty hands-on the entire internship, and I had kind of a knack for working with animals. (I'm not saying any names of the people I worked with, b/c I want to protect their privacy)

&amp;#x200B;

It was a regular day in the van, and the three of us were arriving at our second-to-last appointment of the day. The records in AVImark (bookkeeping system) showed that it was an older Yorkie who needed some vaccinations, as well as a urine sample and blood drawn for a heart-worm test. The Vet tech filled me in on the EM (entitled mom) and EK (entitled daughter) who lived here. They were always kinda up in your face, thinking their dog needed every test available, and the daughter loved to ask questions (sometimes too many questions). Oh well, I thought. I'll have to deal with some shitty owners every once and a while.

&amp;#x200B;

We got out of the van and headed into EM's house. The dog was sweet as could be, but she was a little nervous around men. The vet is a male, and the tech is a female, so the tech and I took point on the hands-on part of the visit. I checked AVImark and drew up the rabies and DDHP vaccinations, set them on the counter, and when I turned back around to grab them, they were gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

They were in the daughter's hands. She was 16, not much younger than me, so I tried my best not to sound patronizing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey, do you think I could have those back? I gotta make sure your dog gets her vaccinations

EK: Yeah, I know she has to get vaccinated. I'm gonna do it

&amp;#x200B;

I was insanely confused, and I had no idea how to respond to this. Thankfully, the vet tech stepped in to help me

&amp;#x200B;

VT: Sorry hun, we can't let someone not working for us administer any treatments, for our safety, your safety, and most importantly, the animal's safety. 

&amp;#x200B;

EK huffs dramatically and finally hands me the vaccinations. I administer both of them, and I thought that was going to be the end of it. Boy was I wrong. When it came time to draw blood, I pulled out the butterfly catheters (we use .25g and .23g normally, but on a smaller, older dog, we used a .28g in order to access the veins), and, of course, EK was all over them. Like, she literally snatched one from my hand and proceeded to open it. In a panic, I go to snatch the catheter back. This is where all hell breaks loose. EK had already uncapped the needle. A .28g needle is extremely thin and extremely sharp. That needle went right into my palm. The EM is also screaming that I could have hurt her child. Now keep in mind, I have no problem with needled or blood, and this isn't actually hurting me so much as making me uncomfortable. But believe me, it looks GROSS. (A lot of this is paraphrased cuz it's been a few years)

&amp;#x200B;

EM: are we paying you to come here and taking learning opportunities from my daughter? You're not taking her education seriously, and you're putting her in danger!

Vet: Ma'am, I'm going to need you to calm down. VT already explained that your daughter can't administer treatments for liability reasons.

ED: I'm taking AP biology, and I'm gonna be a med student. I have to learn somehow!

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm fed up. I'm done being professional or timid.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Are you kidding me?! You STABBED me. VT told you that you shouldn't be touching this stuff, but you still did. (This is where I got petty, and I exposed my stabbed hand for EM and EK to see. Low and behold, EK was squeemish, and her mother pretended like she was gonna pass out. Good luck in med school if you can't even handle that.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, to wrap this story up, I'll skip around the arguing about legalities and how the EM wants to sue us, so we'll sue her right back. We get to the point where the EM says she's never inviting us back again. Vet laughs and leaves. The dog never ended up getting her blood drawn, and we charged them an extra $300 for ""Destruction of Materials"". The second we're back in the van, the Vet starts calling up all the other mobile practices within a 50 mile radius and blacklists this woman. He also gives me $300, telling me that the money was from the bogus charge, and to put it into college savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

My hand was fine. I pulled the needle out, disinfected it, and bandaged it up before we left the house. I ended up with $300 for my college savings account, and I got to yell at an entitled kid. It was a pretty funny appointment, and the Vet bought us all slurpees between this nightmare appointment and the last one of the day

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: EK tries to treat her own dog w/ needles, is told to stop, stabs me with catheter, but ""it's okay cuz she's gonna be a med student"". I end up with $300 for college, and the EM is blacklisted from all other mobile vet clinics

TLDR at the bottom !

I‚Äôm 21F and she‚Äôs 22F. We met in high school 5 years ago and after a getting to know each other period we became best friends. 

The past year she was often abroad because of her studies and we saw each other less often. But we still managed to see each other and the relationship was great. 

This school year I‚Äôm studying abroad and have been away since end of August. We have not seen each other since June when I went to visit her for a few days where she was doing an internship. 
I‚Äôm back now and I‚Äôm supposed to see her tomorrow. And I feel conflicted. 


First in November: she was in a bad place regarding her studies and what to do next etc. She was also abroad so she went back home (as it was possible for her given her specific situation). I obviously helped her as I could even if I was 2500km and two time zones away. 
I also had a rough patch in November, because of my studies not being what I anticipated and being away from my family for so long. She didn‚Äôt notice and didn‚Äôt help (though I don‚Äôt blame her because we talked about it, I still have a little resentment)

Back to the present, we were supposed to spend the whole day together tomorrow. But it‚Äôs not possible anymore because she has to tutor a gymnastics class and I can‚Äôt attend for insurance reasons. 
(I get the insurance thing but still, it kinda bummed me out a bit). 
Also she is working (to help out her mom, so it can be flexible if needed) so the times we can meet are limited. That is also because I‚Äôm home only for a relatively short period. 

We were also supposed to exchange gifts for both Christmas and my birthday (which was in January). And I‚Äôve just learned that she forgot my birthday presents at her mom‚Äôs place. In itself it‚Äôs not that bad but added to the rest I really feel like I‚Äôm not a priority for her anymore.

I know it might seem childish but understand that I don‚Äôt want to be the number one in the list, obviously. But still, we‚Äôre supposed to be best friend and I consider her like a sister. 
And she has a busy life and everything (divorces parents, a job and a gymnastic tutoring thing (no idea how to describe that better)) and I understand that and respect it. I also know that me being abroad is also part of the problem because we have two different lives in two different countries and we have each our own little every day problems 
But I feel left out. 

So my question to you is what do you think about the situation ? (I can provide more info if needed) 
Am I being unreasonable in my expectations about our friendship ? 
Should I just shut up and suck it up, hoping it‚Äôll be better when I come home for my studies ?

TL;DR : haven‚Äôt seen my best friend since June, we are (in my opinion) drifting apart due to the distance of me being abroad for my studies. And our get together tomorrow has already been dampened by several things 
(This is my first TLDR so sorry if it‚Äôs not the best)"

I got rejected by pretty much all the positions I applied to (even small town positions) and/or didn't receive any responses from the employers. I am really desperate for a job right now. Last week, I came across freelance medical writing while searching for career alternatives for pharmacists. I read more about it in random articles and on the AMWA website, and thought it might be a good fit for me. I've always enjoyed writing and learning new knowledge. Becoming a freelance medical writer just might be the answer to my unemployment. The only worry I have is my lack of actual pharmacist job experience (I only have internship experiences). Many medical writers don't have a scientific background, but because I have a PharmD, would getting started be much more difficult just because I have never worked as a pharmacist? Would it be harder to find clients? Any feedback/advice is appreciated. Thanks!

I am currently in my last year of college, with my field of study being Marketing and Communications.

Throughout college I have got 2 internships:

1)in Marketing - big cosmetics global company
...just to find that the creative and fun part (advertising, campaigns, promo materials and social media content) is being done by outsourced marketing agency. Spent 5 months on the internship.

2) in Communications - huge pharmaceutical company - currently
Writing press releases now and then and assisting my middle-level colleague with day-to-day operations.
I am though in charge of making social media monthly plans and content for Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn (Facebook is outsourced to agency because it's just support for a medical/pharm website that is made and lead by the agency). But to be honest, it's not a complete social media manager/ community manager experience because mostly my content is recycled corporate database images and articles from the previously mentioned medical website. Also, I have no experience with paid promotion, campaigns and analytics (the company doesnt care about social media presence and there is literally zero communication between company and customers)

I really got into making social media content and I think I can see myself in a content creator/community manager/social media manager role, compared to other roles but I cant seem to score a entry level job at an agency just yet.

Any tips? What skills should I learn, how to learn them and if any of you are working in agencies, what would you like for your potential future employees to know?

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

&gt;I left Escapist Magazine (Volume One) in September 2011, almost exactly  three years before the entire video game industry tore itself apart,  fracturing along battle lines that included enthusiast, press,  publisher, developer, man, woman, conservative and liberal.  
&gt;  
&gt;After I left Escapist Magazine, I co-founded Polygon, got a lot of shit for producing a documentary in which we claimed [‚ÄúGames journalism is broken‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMQKXVBU8F0),  and left Polygon and games journalism entirely. Then GamerGate happened  and a lot of other folks said ‚ÄúOh wait ‚Ä¶ maybe something might  actually, in fact, be wrong with games journalism.‚Äù Then a lot of people  did a lot of stupid, hateful things. It got really hard to have a  conversation about what audiences want from games and the people who  write about them without both calling back to and sometimes summoning  the people who did such stupid, hateful things.  
&gt;  
&gt;The memes about what GamerGate was ‚Äúreally about‚Äù are too numerous to count, but the most well-known is probably the image of *It*‚Äôs Pennywise the Clown whispering up from the storm drain that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about ethics.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;It depicts those who supported GamerGate as evil clowns, telling a  lie about ‚Äúethics‚Äù to lure innocents to their ‚Ä¶ doom, I guess? And as a  snapshot of what most people on the press or industry side think of  GamerGate, it‚Äôs right on the money.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most of the people I talked to about GamerGate at the time it was  happening were journalists or developers who experienced a movement that  had nothing to do with ethics and everything to do with hurting women.  People were doxxed, bullied, harassed, threatened, actually assaulted,  SWATTed, forced to relocate or change jobs, and flat out terrorized  during GamerGate. Pretending an enormous, motivated group that relished  in making other people hurt didn‚Äôt exist, or was exaggerated, not only  insults its victims, but is simply unreasonable and illogical. It  requires a willful ignorance not worthy of debating.  
&gt;  
&gt;Put simply: someone involved with GamerGate may have cared about ethics, but the movement was about hurting people.  
&gt;  
&gt;And yet, despite the specter of these nightmare people and their  disgusting behavior, there is still a conversation to be had about  ethics, transparency, consumer rights, and how, in spite of all of our  surface divisions ‚Äî whether we‚Äôre developers, writers, or players ‚Äî  we‚Äôre all people who just fucking enjoy video games. We deserve better  games, ethical journalism, transparent business practices, and respect,  and we‚Äôre not getting a lot of that.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs taken a few years for me to feel comfortable even approaching  this topic. I guarantee my doing so will cause some consternation among  my games press colleagues, and possibly some readers. But now, almost  five years since its inception, several facts about GamerGate are  inescapable and clear:

1. The movement was at the time, and remains to this day, inseparable  from the targeted harassment, identity politics, and profit-driven hate  mongering of many of those who claimed to support it.
2. Although people like Milo Yiannopoulos became the loudest voices  claiming to represent ‚Äúthe movement,‚Äù their idea of ethics was to hire  dozens of interns to ghost write their books, not pay them, and then  run.
3. The people most qualified to have a meaningful conversation about  ethics in journalism couldn‚Äôt reasonably engage on that topic while  fielding death threats from those demanding they do so.
4. It is still to this day difficult to start a conversation about  the very real issues of ethics and transparency ‚Äî in publishing, in  criticism, in consuming ‚Äî without reopening the terrible wounds caused  by the bad people who used those topics as a smokescreen to conduct  their harassment, terrorism, and culture war.

&gt;And this is a goddamn shame. All of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs impossible for me to look back on those years without pain and  regret for all of the lives damaged, careers ended, and opportunities  wasted. And for what? Ensuring the sanctity of review scores? That  concern simply doesn‚Äôt even register when compared to the pain and  anxiety, harassment, and stalking some of the industry‚Äôs most creative  minds have had to endure for years simply because they are female and  work in gaming. I would set fire to every review score, review, and  video game and then shove them all off a cliff if that would prevent  anyone from having to endure that level of abuse. To those who willfully  enabled and enacted this terrorism, I say this: Fuck you. You are  pathetic. And we don‚Äôt need you.  
&gt;  
&gt;And yet video games aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Nor are reviews,  reviewers, or consumers. How do we have this conversation about ethics?  How do we ensure there is transparency in the process, that consumers  can trust that what they are reading or watching is a reasonably  objective opinion and not coming from one of the paid agents that have  become legion in the post-YouTube era.  
&gt;  
&gt;This goes beyond reviews. As the costs of making AAA games and the  volume of non-AAA games both increase exponentially, AAA game publishers  are rolling out¬†[bad idea](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2018/11/05/blizzard-betrayed-its-fans-and-the-press-only-made-it-worse/)¬†after [bad idea](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2019/01/01/how-bethesda-killed-fallout/)¬†to  retain market share and increase revenue. Those goals aren‚Äôt inherently  bad in and of themselves. But some of the methods employed definitely  are. For every hat store, there‚Äôs a [loot box](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2018/09/18/experienced-points-loot-boxes-are-bad-for-publishers-too/). For every truly additive story-driven expansion, there‚Äôs a final chapter to a game [released without one](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/2018/12/08/final-fantasy-xv-is-still-disappointing-me-three-years-after-its-release/).  Game makers are exploring uncharted waters while attempting to navigate  a dramatically shifting market landscape, and the voices of consumers  acting as watchdogs (and those in media who support them) have been  effectively silenced by an ocean of dipshits with a grudge against  women. It‚Äôs time to start earning back that trust.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don‚Äôt know what form it will take. And I don‚Äôt know who will stand  up to lead it. But I do know three reasons why another consumer movement  is all but inevitable:

...

&gt;There are good ways and bad ways to ask customers to pay more.  Publishers owe it to their customers to keep an open dialogue about why  they‚Äôre adding tricks and gimmicks, how they‚Äôre being implemented, and  what, ultimately, they‚Äôre asking us to pay for when we purchase a game.  So long as we don‚Äôt have a unified voice on this issue, we continue to  lose time and money on doomed-to-fail experiments conducted with highly  anticipated games. *Star Wars: Battlefront II*, I‚Äôm looking at you.  
&gt;  
&gt;During and after GamerGate, I spoke with many game makers about the  impact the movement was having on the industry, and how they were trying  to address it. More game makers than I‚Äôm comfortable admitting told me  they weren‚Äôt thinking about it at all. To them it was an ‚Äúaudience  issue,‚Äù not a ‚Äúdeveloper issue.‚Äù To them, the problem was safely  contained within the confines of games media websites and comment  sections. While most developers I spoke with had feelings, thoughts, and  opinions on the matter, they simply weren‚Äôt equipped or interested in  addressing the voices of millions of customers heatedly arguing about  often contradictory things. Yet they would all talk to someone with a  platform serving that same audience.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is the role the press can, and should, serve. You have a right to expect transparency in that process.

The South Africans noticed the first body about five meters from the crash site, or, they found the top half of the first body, having dragged itself to its fateful resting place and leaving a trail of dried blood and crusty entrails behind. 

Moving inside the plane, they found more bodies. One was identified as British UN intern John Wooshing. A shard of glass had been lodged in his jugular and his cold eyes stared blankly towards the dented ceiling of the DC-6. The third body is when the investigators began to be alarmed. Yusuf Abdel Maher, an advisor from the United Arab Republic had a bullet hole in his forehead. A profound form of dread overtook the investigators‚Ä¶

---

British helicopters flew slowly, crawling above the dense rainforest. They were searching for something, for anything that would give evidence in the crash. Before long, they found the Polish MiG, wedged in a thick and twisted branch. The pilot was a burnt husk, caught in an eternal scream. One of the investigators on the helicopter that first saw him, jotted down the coordinates in a small notebook, so that the Pole‚Äôs remains might the recovered at a later date.

After 14 hours of searching, and several teams of men making alternating trips over the rainforest, the Brits found a scrap of metal, part of a wing, which had collided with an okapi, severing it in half horizontally. Although drenched in blood and badly burned, the crew was able to recover the shard of metal and identified it as being part of a Fouga CM.170 Magister. This was a French jet, and while at first, members of the crew believed it to be a miraculous breakthrough, the jet is currently in service of the air forces of Finland, Belgium, Cambodia, Morocco, and Katanga. They are left with more questions than answers.

Back at the crash site, investigators found and identified 12 bodies:

*John Wooshing* - United Kingdom, killed on impact

*Finnegan Bright* - United States, shot

*Yusuf Abdel Maher* - United Arab Republic, shot

*≈ªelis≈Çaw Mackiewicz*, Polish, UN Secretary General‚Äôs Security Force, shot in combat

*Pavel Dawid Dobrowski*, Polish, UN Secretary General‚Äôs Security Force, shot in combat

*Wac≈Çaw Jezewski*, Polish, UN Secretary General‚Äôs Security Force, shot in combat

*Ibrahim Ousmane*, Somalian, UN Secretary General‚Äôs Security Force, shot in combat

*Sven Bergman* - Sweden, killed on impact

*Lars Abrahamson* - Sweden, shot

*Yakov Kamarov* - Soviet Union, shot 

*Siggi Thorsdottir* - Iceland, shot

*Mihaijlo Dobranoviƒá* - Yugoslavia, shot

The investigators separated the bodies into natural deaths and murders. More British troops had been called in, as well as Rhodesian and South African troops, securing the crash site, with South African Marmon Herringtons en route. British transport planes dropped 50 troops and an additional 30 investigative personnel in the area, and a no-fly zone was established. 

On one of the bodies, the investigators recovered a note:

*Important men,*

*Send smart man to Dar el Salam in 14 day*

*Don‚Äôt be stupid*

The investigators looked to each other‚Ä¶ things just got a lot more complicated. One of them suggested that the missing people were taken by the attackers. Another suggested that it was the scavengers that the Polish forces reported. A third suggested that no options can be dismissed, before casting a shady glare at a Rhodesian soldier. 

One thing is clear: the Crisis in the Congo is going to get interesting.

**List of Missing Persons:**

*Dag Hammarskj√∂ld*, Swedish, UN Secretary General

*Wojciech Jaruzelski*, Polish, UN Secretary General Security Commander

*Ingmar Nystr√∂m*, Swedish, Special Aide to the Secretary General

*Davis MacBannister*, United Kingdom, Special Aide to the Secretary General

*Buck Goldberg*, United States, Congolese Translator to the Secretary General

I've been stuck at 210 for maybe 3 weeks and I fear that i've hit a plateau and i'm wondering what I can do to get out of it or if it will go away on its own. 

My diet is pretty good I would say. I do 16:8 with only water, coffee and tea from 8pm to 12pm. When I start eating I have a big salad with protein or salmon with a side salad. My dinner is usually something fast casual because I don't usually have time to cook (ex. Chipotle burrito bowl or another salad with protein). I'll also start drinking coffee with just milk during my eating window. I also eat a snack like a protein bar between meals and will have a protein shake with my dinner along with creatine. I take 2 days a week off from IF usually starting Friday night and returning to fasting Sunday. 

I am very active. At my internship and school i'm constantly walking around. Outside of being a college student I also do Jiu Jitsu 3 to 4 times a week along with lifting 3 to 4 times a week. Some days i'll throw in 30 minutes of cardio after lifting to burn even more calories. 

Some problems that could be affecting this is sometimes I don't get enough sleep (So 8 hours) or it could be that i'm not counting my calories and macros. 

Please let me know what I can do to break this plateau, i'm really hoping to lose another 10 to 20lbs. My only thing is I really dont want to track my calories and macros. Thanks!"

annaxp,1,2019-02-06,My (25F) family is making me question my identity and who I am as a person,ilovedolphins99,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/annaxp/my_25f_family_is_making_me_question_my_identity/,"I come from a history of bullying and a string of relationships with people who treat me very bad (verbally abuse and infidelity) and never really standing up for myself. I‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúgive people chances‚Äù and ‚Äúsee the potential in others‚Äù kind of girl, but it leaves me burned most of the time because I allow not so great people in my bubble. My last relationship ended July of 2017, so it‚Äôs been a little bit since I‚Äôve been out of the dating game. I decided to give myself time alone to reflect a lot about my life and how I should live it fruitfully in my benefit. 

I‚Äôve changed a lot about the way that I view myself and forced myself to be less ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù and emotional to logical and realistic. So, not too much of a ‚Äú3 strikes, you‚Äôre out‚Äù mentality, but just stricter on how people should treat me. I wouldn‚Äôt say I hold onto grudges either way, but I just want people to know that they can‚Äôt treat me like a door mat. I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm asking for TOO much. I believe I‚Äôve made several new friends who show me support since I began this journey. However, my family is a completely other situation. 

Whenever my dad (56M) gets angry at me for just about anything, he insults me pretty terribly. This results with us not talking to one another for several weeks until my mom brings us together and says ‚Äústop fighting, you‚Äôre family.‚Äù For years I‚Äôve just accepted this kumbaya reality, but I decided to change it and hold everyone in my life at the same level. 

Months ago, I left home for an internship and I have a souvenir that was very special to me that my ex bf gave to me. I had left it under my bed in a specific section before I moved out. When I moved back in, my whole room was changed (furniture was replaced, bed was moved, etc). My sourvenir disappeared. For months I kept questioning where it was and my mom just laughed about why I cared and dismissed it. One day, I went looking for it all around the house - nothing appeared. She later revealed that she ‚Äúhad no idea what souvenir I‚Äôm talking about‚Äù and blamed her old age in forgetfulness. I became pretty mad and decided to stop talking to her bc she lost my belonging and had no business touching my things in my absence anyway. A few days later, she told my dad who came into my room and closed the door behind him. In the midst of his terrible insults, he claimed that the souvenir was thrown away and that ‚Äúit‚Äôs his house so he could do what he wants‚Äù. He told me to fuck off and continued rambling. He mentioned something about being dead to me and stormed off. It was hurtful but I got over it. 

I refused to talk to both of them for about two weeks and my mom began sending me apology texts and requesting to meet. I told her my side and explained my points:
1. It was disrespectful to touch things that don‚Äôt belong to her
2. Her laughing at me when I‚Äôm actively looking for my items isn‚Äôt cool
3. My dads comments won‚Äôt be tolerated

She kind of defended him by saying ‚Äúwhen people are mad they say things they don‚Äôt mean‚Äù. But I told her that I don‚Äôt take that as an excuse just like I don‚Äôt take her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old and forgetful‚Äù as an excuse for losing my sourvenir. (Background: my family hates my ex and ironically, the souvenir belonged to him and they knew that bc it had his name on it)

It‚Äôs been a week since that meet up and I‚Äôve been ok with my mom. Normal because I forgave her and moved forward. Still don‚Äôt speak to my dad. 

My dog bit my dads hand two days ago and he began to bleed. Today, he went to the hospital bc apparently it may be infected. I was told by my mom to reach out to my dad, which I did not. I come home and go straight to my room. My mom comes inside and shuts the door behind her to basically tell me:
1. I need to learn to forgive because holding grudges is a sin 
2. She was mad that she had to come apologize to me and that I didn‚Äôt approach her in the last fight we had 
3. I have no friends because when I had a surgery, 2 people came to visit me
4. I will regret not talking to my dad should something happen to him
5. She believes my ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù stems from being unable to find a full time job in my field that allows me to relocate (???) 
6. She questions my newfound attitude and being intolerant to anyone‚Äôs faults
7. She claims that I need to read the Bible more to build a kinder heart 
8. I apparently ‚Äúhurt my brothers feelings all the time‚Äù without giving me any context about what she was talking about. 

I told her basically to leave bc she was personally attacking me for the majority of the conversation and it wasn‚Äôt productive. I didn‚Äôt yell, insult, or anything back - I just rolled my eyes occasionally and said ‚Äúmhm ok‚Äù. She left and said ‚Äúthis is why you‚Äôre always a loner and you‚Äôre impossible to talk to‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve always thought of my mom as my best friend but her logic is making me question her and myself. I‚Äôm conflicted. Am I being too harsh or irrational? Should I have contacted my dad over his infected hand (which I still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what it was)? Should I let go of my ‚Äúgrudge‚Äù and act like my dads insults weren‚Äôt anything? What should I do?

Then the other side of me thinks this is all a storm of emotional manipulation and that I finally (FINALLY!!!) am seeing past all of it and standing up for myself. Holding my family to the same level as I would a friend or bf. I don‚Äôt know what to think. 

Any help and advice would be soooo appreciated. 

FYI: I‚Äôm graduating soon with my masters and where I‚Äôm located, it‚Äôs hard to live on my own with the rent costs and low salary. I‚Äôm in a part time job program that pays 80% of my degree which is really nice, but salary is shit. I‚Äôm actively looking for a full time job to relocate as soon as I graduate because it might just help my relationship with my family not be as bad as it currently is. 

**TL;DR;** : my parents feel that I need to be more kind and forgiving when they insult me or ridicule me because we are family

I JUST PASSED MY RD EXAM!!! I'm still in shock and i'm so proud of myself!

&amp;#x200B;

This past year and some months was a rollercoaster of emotions, which were full of many ups and many downs. I got matched to a local dietetic internship a year ago, decided to finally put the trigger and get married, and got diagnosed with diabetes along the way (how ironic). 

&amp;#x200B;

So one week before starting my internship I woke up and put my glasses on, only to realize I still could not see clearly. Combine this with a bit of physical symptoms I kept ignoring (polyuria, polydipsia, ect). Decide to go to urgent care and see whats the issue, Dr. comes out and asks how long i've been diabetic for, tells me my A1c is 14% and i should go to the hospital asap. My weight at the time was around 205 lbs and I am 6 ft tall. What a terrible day that was!

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a month past that I get my A1c down to 9.2% on Metformin along with eating much better. 3 months after that I'm down to an A1c of 5.2%. All seems well, but I was just never set on the type 2 DM that the doctors assured me that I was since the medication seemed to be working. Decided to go to an Endocrinologist and get some more tests run and get a second opinion. Came back positive for anti-insulin antibodies and GAD positive, along with a low C-peptide lab as well. So after a lot of back and forth between doctor appointments, I was finally correctly diagnosed as a LADA Diabetic, still going decently well on my honeymoon phase. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back now, I basically had to rebuild myself over the past year, my now wife was by my side through all of it and supported me through all the stress, all the anxiety, and all of the depression I found myself consumed in. I came out of that mess a much more positive, confident, and insightful person. Life may never be quite as easy as it once was, but I know I can get through any obstacles I may run across. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I moved out on my own I took the first good paying job offered to me (construction) and didn't have a chance to pursue that. I've been doing that for almost 5 years now and I want a change, and I think I've found the field I want to be in.  

I'm looking in to networking administration/engineering and was wondering if anyone on this sub has made such a drastic jump in career paths? I have no formal education on the matter, and I'm not sure if I could even afford to go to school for a degree so I'm stuck learning on my own homelab. So far I've built myself a server capable of running VMs, got some enterprise/prosumer networking gear (aruba 10gbe layer-3 switch,edgerouter x) and will likely need some cisco gear to learn iOS on. At what point in my knowledge base should I even consider applying for internships etc? Or is the Vancouver/Fraser Valley networking job market so competitive that I shouldn't waste my time without formal education.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."

She is not a good listener at all. When she goes on dates all she does is talk about herself and all the amazing adventures she goes on. She doesn‚Äôt ask me or the other person about themselves or how they feel. She always has to be in a relationship - she can‚Äôt stand being single. She thinks that any guy who looks at her or talks to her likes her. Every conversation she has with me revolves around talking about a guy hitting on her. She pressures me to lose my virginity in a month. She thinks that in her relationship with her boyfriend, if either she or her bf were to cheat, it would be her. Whenever she sees me wear a cute outfit, she has to get the same outfit. She tries to be the best dressed and cares about attracting guys by dressing sexy

On her birthday I got her an amazing bday present. Bought a gorgeous blouse and filled the gift bag with candies and chocolates and wrote her a thoughtful and long card. She loved it.

On my birthday, I just got cheap sunglasses from forever 21 and a cheap t shirt. No handwritten card. No thought.

The other night she quit her job at Wendy‚Äôs bc her manager sucks and she was telling me about it and I felt sad about the way she was being treated. She told me she hates taking crap from others and I was like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt we all?‚Äù And she was like ‚Äúyeah I can‚Äôt take crap from others and the only people I can give crap to are the people I care about. Like my bf, my parents, or you‚Äù I was like ‚Äúyou give me crap?‚Äù And she was like ‚Äúyeah I give you crap like when I can‚Äôt get something for our apartment then I tell you to get it‚Äù

Then she got a phone call from one of her co workers at Wendy‚Äôs and they were talking about how she quit the job. She didn‚Äôt know who‚Äôs number is it but I heard that the coworkers wanted to keep in touch with her and for her to text each other. She was like ‚Äúomg she‚Äôs like the sweetest person ever she texted me asking to keep in touch‚Äù

I felt sad hearing  this because I remember I used to wait 5 hours for her to get out of her last class so we could go home together, how i would listen to her talk about her guy problems and her self esteem problems, how I would give her uplifting and encouraging advice, and I genuinely cared about her happiness. But with all the shit I told you about earlier (how our conversations turned out to be her talking all the time, talking about her dates and all the guys she‚Äôs into, how she stopped listening to me), it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not valued or good enough at all. I want to be a best friend but I guess I never was, or she doesn‚Äôt value me for the friend I am. 

Another day I came into the living room and my roommate was telling her 16 year old sister to drink wine and her sis kept on saying no. Then I said to her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt pressure her to drink if she doesn‚Äôt want to. She‚Äôs only 16‚Äù and my roomie was like ‚Äúwell she will drink anyways so why not start now?‚Äù (She comes from a Muslim family where drinking isn‚Äôt allowed) And me and the sister were so mad. Then my roommate got mad at me for ‚Äúinterfering‚Äù and I was like ‚ÄúI just came to the living room to say hi to you and then I saw this‚Äù And she gave me attitude for that 

Another day  I told her about something great happening to me... I found someone who could get me an internship... then she said ‚Äúoh maybe I can work there too‚Äù even though I worked hard for it 

I met a guy who knows my roommate - he revealed to me that everyone at my roommate‚Äôs workplace doesn‚Äôt like her. She bullshits on everyone, especially girls who are prettier than her. She told the guy not to talk to me (when she brought him home to meet all of the roommates) because I apparently use my looks to get free things from guys, that I‚Äôm a party girl, that I date a lot, and a lot of other mean things about me that aren‚Äôt true at all. I don‚Äôt use my looks for money at all. I have a job and my parents support me sometimes with college tuition. I don‚Äôt party a lot since I‚Äôm busy. And I don‚Äôt date a lot too. The guy knows that I‚Äôm a really cool person, and he could sense that my roommate is ‚Äúcrazy jealous‚Äù of me. She is spreading rumors about me 

All of a sudden, she wants to hangout more with my REAL best friend (RBFF), the one who was truly there for me. My roomie told me today that she wants to hangout with my RBFF. I kind of don‚Äôt want her to hangout with my RBBF, but my RBBF told me she doesn‚Äôt like her anymore from all these things I mentioned

I‚Äôm also just really annoyed with how she wants to do everything I want to do.

Me: mentions how I want longer eyelashes. 

Roommate: *next day does extensive research on lashes because now she wants lashes too* 

WHY DOES SHE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO?? It‚Äôs annoying. 

I really need to move out. It‚Äôs driving me nuts that she wants to do everything I do and copy my lifestyle!!!"

&amp;#x200B;

I know AWS and am currently running an S3 bag with Route 53 redirecting.  I had an internship interview and I couldn't explain what a pipe was or a redirect.  I felt embarrassed and would greatly appreciate a list of projects I could put into a github?  I do not want to be a Javascript engineer, the money is nice, but I truly want to engineer system tools and I have the perception that I could use C in an SRE role, which is the language I have the most attachment too (It twas my first..well C++/C anyways).

What I know:

Basic Linux

Basic AWS

Git

Docker (need to work on config script knowledge)

Kubernetes (haven't been able to test minikube yet but I read the docs)

PHP, Python, Bash, C

I know enough networking to test for a CCNA within the month, and possibly an AWS developer cert within 2 months.  I don't want to spend this money, unless these are valued more than experience?  I find that a solid GitHub with great documentation and readme's are combat certifications?  Let me know if I am missing anything in this analysis or if I have been misinformed about any of this.  Technology recommendations are ok but I would rather hear what Core technologies I need to ""fill in the gaps"" and if you could recommend good tutorials (not necessarily cheap but not a $399 course ""that your friend made"" unless your friend is Stephen Grider).  It seems like Linux is hard to learn unless you have real life situations that come up at work.  Simulated problems online seem like mindless robotic commands and I lose touch with what I am actually doing."

Don't know what to do.,Broodjekroket97,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/anp5cr/im_22f_having_panick_attacks_and_upsdowns_since/,"Hi reddit.
I'm shaking constantly, so writing this as an European will be a fun thing.
It's a long story,  sorry
I do want to say that we do have a lot of good days aswell. Just mostly When I feel good as Well that I can handle him better than when I'm feeling bad and getting panick attacks. It's going from 1 to 100 in a sec when a bad thing happens. He doesn't ask how my day was? Should we break up? It's very tiring and annoying, but afterwards on the good days I always think I'm lucky and happy.

Long story short about me:

I grew up in the Netherlands. Mother was abusive to dad. Home too late from work? Sleep in the car. Never kissing or hugging or anything nice. Mother died when I was 11 to cancer suddenly. I completely changed and got suicidal. No friends would understand me how I felt and no help. At 14 something else happened. Let's say that was my illegal first time.  consent but didn't want to lose my only friend that was 26 and understood me.
I went to therapy for 6 years. 28 hours a week I've had everything. My only fear now is getting to that same low point again of seeing no way out.
The point I was most happy in life was when I was single and riding my bike and when I met my partner in new zealand during an internship. We did some travelling and now I'm here in Melbourne.
My problems here are that I miss my family, get a but homesick for that and got depressed with anxiety. --&gt; panick attacks, throwing up, No sleep and a lot of crying.
I went to the doctor here for a therapy program, but the waiting lists are long and inconvenient with my job.


Short story about my bf:


He had the perfect life. Loving mother, dad, 2 sister and brother and dog. Big house. Champion in soccer. High school sweetheart for 8 years through uni until she cheated (they never talked fights out and she hit him). He has a very good degree and is positive and fit. A bit cocky sometimes. - points are that no one talks. Not about depression or anything. Not about feelings. It's horrible. He is very quiet and things just go along and nothing is wrong. He met me and went with me to my country. After 3 months he had seen it and he had A good job offer in Melbourne so that's why we moved here eventually. 
He uses humour to get over a problem. Making someone laugh to make them feel better. Having a panick attack? Farts real loud. 


Problems:


We are different. I want a lot of sex (3-4 times a week) he wants 1 time when he is in the mood and then the positions he finds nice. During sex I'd say how about *** and he says no. Just no. I find it too awkward to go against him in the heat of the moment and demand like but I want this. He always gets me off, or atleast I will myself when he is close.
He is very uhm sure about what he wants or what he thinks it's normal. Saying stuff is hard because I often get a ""No you're not"" or ""why?!"" In a blaming/ direct tone.

We have quite some communication issues. Feeling wise it feels like my feelings and expression of those are like a burdon. Like I'm nagging. I know I can get quite negative of this isn't good and that, but I don't mean it that way. I just need to vent.



Before this relationship I was a very confident and quite happy person. I was in a relationship before with a guy that hung on to me like crazy. Bad retail job, No friends, goals, hobby or sport but.... He was the kindest and loveliest person I've ever met. But just that wasn't enough for a relationship, so I broke it off. It always felt more like a friendship, so I didn't really felt heartbroken. More like I lost my best friend, but for the better.

Now, I'm in a very tricky spot. I talk a lot with my partner but he has a very strong will and I am not so secure anymore after emigrating, new job, new bike and 18000 km away from home. I feel like crying most of the time and have a really hard time, where my partner has not. He is fine. A bit stressed sometimes but then again, different than I am. He wants to support me and tries, but because he is hard headed and stubborn he often goes over my boundaries and feelings. This makes it worse.


A typical situation would be like:

I'm feeling bad about something he said as a joke (comments on how I do something or don't) like ""why are you putting that *item* there? It doesn't make sense?!"" With an irritated angry tone that makes me feel on the spot. I later want to talk to him about it but somehow I offend him when I say ""I felt a bit hurt when you said that because it makes me feel like I can't do anything right"" or "" because it makes me feel on the spot"" he then irritated says ""why?"" I explain why and then he doesn't get it or sometimes does and tries to comfort me but will never say sorry I won't do it again. Or anything in that direction.

The other day we were cooking. Well we.. I was. He was giving me comments on that I wasn't done yet with chopping and stuff. I got annoyed. I told him I got annoyed by that (I'm not a good cook. Never cooked alot so this is a first on this frequency) I asked him some stuff about salt etc. He walked away. I asked him later what it was about. He said you need to learn it yourself I'm not gonna help you.
He is taking control over the situation by not helping me. I don't really feel like a relationship like that. We are not doing it together.


Just now I was giving him the contract papers to look over but ""No what are you doing?! Put them on my desk""
It's those little things that I'm like. Really? Is it that hard to be kind?

I just feel my self image going downhill alot and resenting him. When I tell him that he says he doesn't mean it that way and I should know that because he loves me and wants me to feel good. Okay things are good again until 2 days later something similar will happen.


I know I'm easily to change with my mood recently and don't have any friends yet so my mood is really what I get from him. I try to change that with work and my bike and making friends but it's hard. I am very happy at work mostly but at home I get full with worries and doubts sometimes when a situation happens again.

Situation now why I write:


We are moving in out of the place we are currently staying/sharing to our own place. He says things will get a lot better after that. I'm very very excited. It's a beautiful house and I've been looking for furniture and got a day of at work (co worker gave up her free day for me, I cried a little) and I brought the news just now that I will be there for the moving. He said ah nice. No enthusiasm or anything. I got a couch for free from my boss. Ah cool. It's just.. it makes me having another panick attack.
I had a panick attack today while looking for couches about the thought that a couch will probably last longer than my relationship. It's just a shit thought and I got myself hyperventilating. Great.

Right now I'm just thinking of pushing it through because he is a good guy sometimes and makes me feel good on a lot of moments when there isn't stress. I'm just waiting for therapy I guess..


TL;DR I get why you didn't read, it's long haha. My partner and I are very different. I don't know how to handle my panick attacks and where they come from. I've never had this before in my life it started only 3 months ago."
anp9rc,5,2019-02-06,Should I move for my job?,JConstantin1,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/anp9rc/should_i_move_for_my_job/,"I am having a real hard time deciding here, so here it goes.... I am a recent software engineering graduate in Denmark, even before I finished my education I was being recruited to go and work back for where I did my internship in Barcelona and the original plan was for me to go back there. But I am having big second thoughts and I need to decide what to do soon, plus I need somewhere to vent because it's driving me crazy.

The job is in a big company in a pretty exciting city, however the job itself isn't that exciting, the projects are not interesting to me and there are times when I wont be doing anything. Coming from Denmark the pay is not good as well, it's pretty descent for the city but I can earn 3X as more here. But it's a job, and I need experience especially as a newly graduate. It's not so much about the money since Denmark helps me to live pretty decently while I am unemployed and looking for work here, so the way I see it the only reason I wont to take it is the chance for experience in a big company for future employment,

Another thing that bothers me about leaving is all my friends are here and I know barely anyone there, I speak the language and I can make new friends there but still i don't feel good about leaving my entire network behind. A different issue is that I am currently in a relationship, we haven't been together for too long and she says she's willing to try long distance, but I don't know if we will last if I move and I like her and I want to give us a chance.

There are more reasons to stay/move besides this, from the food to the weather, but these are the big ones. I really appreciate any advice.   "
anpxqk,3,2019-02-06,Good stuff,Megladon-sandwich,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/anpxqk/good_stuff/,"I just wanted to share something happy. 6 months ago, I left my boyfriend of 4.5 years, partially because he told me he was having doubts about whether I would be able to handle the hard parts of life ahead with my anxiety/mental health‚Äîbold thing to say there, as I‚Äôve been the one to get good grades throughout college, get internships, hold down a great job in research, and help pay his bills, all while managing chronic anxiety, depression, and severe depersonalization/derealization disorder.

I‚Äôve also recently fell into a new relationship with someone, We‚Äôve been dating for 4 months.

anrvgs,1,2019-02-06,CH or migraines?,cat_ate_the_hat,clusterheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/clusterheads/comments/anrvgs/ch_or_migraines/,"I started getting awful headaches almost every day for the last 4-5 weeks. I went to the doctor a  few times. Told me it was just stress the first time, I asked for muscle relaxers the second time as I read it helped some people and I do have very tight neck muscles, and the third time I went I asked for a CT scan because it hurt so bad I threw up and I was starting to worry it was something else. He told me he really didn‚Äôt think I need a CT Scan, but gave me the order anyway to make me feel better I guess. I‚Äôm going to get the scan this coming Monday. I mentioned cluster headaches to my doctor and he told me I can‚Äôt have them because those who do get them so bad they can‚Äôt get out of bed. He thinks it‚Äôs just from stress, TMJ, and my tight muscles. 

When I do get the headaches they only come in the morning and I feel a very sharp pain in my left eye and temple that sometimes radiates to the top of my head and jaw when it gets really bad and my left eye will get a little red and watery. They usually only last 1-2 hours if I take Tylenol right at the start of one, only twice did it hurt for about 2 hours and then lingered throughout the day. Those 2 times I also threw up, but I think it‚Äôs because I took too many vitamins/Tylenol on an empty stomach, but they were also the worst headaches I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve been taking melatonin every night for the past week which has been helping, but I noticed if I sleep a little too long, I‚Äôll get that sharp headache. I also wear a mouth guard for teeth grinding when I sleep now.

I‚Äôve had this happen before in the winter of 2017. They lasted a month and went away after I started going to the chiropractor and Tylenol usually helped when I got them. Tylenol still helps sometimes but if I take it too late the headache comes back 30min later.  

I‚Äôm just confused as to whether they‚Äôre cluster headaches or migraines because they do come during times where I‚Äôm feeling stressed. The first time I got them it was around the time of finals in my freshman year of college. This time it was right before the start of my second semester of junior year, and I was worried about getting an internship and I‚Äôm also the president of an organization at school so I was stressed about that. They‚Äôve only happened in the winter and the headaches started at different times, a little over 2 years apart. As I‚Äôve mentioned, I have very tight neck muscles and my spine in my neck is also twisted, so I often feel pain in my neck and shoulders from that as well. 

So I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôre actually cluster headaches or maybe migraines that are caused by stress, tight muscles, and maybe weather changes? Any thoughts? Thank you

&amp;#x200B;

Preface: I‚Äôm not a lawyer. Consult a tax and/or employment law attorney before implementing any new benefits. You can also check out the IRS guidelines to how fringe benefits are taxed.¬†

Being a startup is tough. Sometimes you don‚Äôt have enough cash, or time, but you need the best people possible to build up your product and make sure you are competitive. We‚Äôre always trying to think of ways to reward our employees without breaking the bank, while also showing how much they matter to us and how much we value them. 

The biggest cost we face is losing an employee. When an employee leaves, we lose some of the knowledge that they have. Even if we‚Äôre great at documenting that institutional knowledge, we‚Äôre never perfect. Even interns at Tinfoil often work on big-picture, large-scale projects that affect the whole business.¬†

We have spent a lot of time exploring standard and fringe benefits, assessing how they can affect employee happiness. We also believe that people of differing backgrounds add different perspectives, leading to a stronger company and a stronger set of products. These benefits help us recruit a diverse company, with many of our current employees being LGBTQ+, international, or women. Other security companies struggle to find diverse candidates (e.g., cybersecurity is comprised of only 14% women). We feel like we‚Äôve started down a good path.

Outlined below are some of the benefits we‚Äôve tried in the past, or currently have in place, along with the advantages and pitfalls you might encounter.

**Background**

We‚Äôre a 7+ year-old company, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. We raised a seed round in 2011, but are currently profitable and have not needed to raise a Series A. Many of these benefits were implemented before we hit profitability, and ramped up slowly so people remain excited about what is next.

## Healthcare

**Overview**

Healthcare, vision, and dental were required benefits when we started Tinfoil. Our first employee wouldn‚Äôt have joined without them.

Amount we put toward benefit

* 85% of a base plan for medical (typically, the best gold we can offer). Employees can get $0 premiums by choosing a less robust plan.¬†  

* 100% of vision.  

* 75% of dental.  

* Dependent coverage of 50% (for all of the above)

**Why?**

We didn‚Äôt want to cover 100% of the best plan we could, because we prefer folks have some skin in the game and pick the plan that‚Äôs most appropriate for them, rather than just picking an expensive one they don‚Äôt need or won‚Äôt use. We also wanted to make sure that we could help cover the cost of dependents. We didn‚Äôt want to cover 100%, in order to make sure we really were better than the healthcare offered by their spouse‚Äôs plan (if their spouse‚Äôs employer provided healthcare).

**Benefit to employees / company**

The benefit to employees is obvious, but companies also benefit from healthy and happy employees. Healthcare can affect one‚Äôs financials, and if an employee is worrying about their finances, that‚Äôs time they‚Äôre not spending focused on the company.

**Who it affects**

Every employee

**Pitfalls**

If you don‚Äôt pick a good enough plan, or if you don‚Äôt cover enough, some employees may not feel comfortable joining your company.

**Employee response**

We‚Äôve never had any issues with the amount we cover, but we have had some issues with the provider we pick. We were using Anthem and our employees chose to cut back the % we cover (though it would cost them more) to have a more reliable provider whenever we had to submit for out-of-network costs. We ended up with Blue Shield and had more profit the following year, so brought the employees back to 85% coverage (from 75%).

**Anything else to watch out for**

Be attentive to your employee‚Äôs health. You can‚Äôt ask how healthy they are, but if they mention they‚Äôre concerned about covering healthcare bills, be proactive in helping them fix the issue.

## FSA (Flexible Spending Account)

**Overview**

An FSA is a Flexible Spending Account. Employees can put money into this account, pre-tax, and use the money on healthcare related items. At the end of the year, any leftover money can be rolled over into the next year (if your plan allows a rollover) up to a maximum amount. Anything that‚Äôs unable to be rolled over is forfeited to the company.

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

We added an FSA for one year, allowing for up to a $500 rollover (the maximum federal allowance). We cut it because so few people used it, and those who put money in didn‚Äôt end up using it.

**Benefit to employees / company**

This is a benefit that allows employees with high or consistent medical expenses to pay for those expenses pre-tax.

**Who it affects**

All employees, except founders and highly compensated individuals (generally those making $120k salary, or those owning 5% or more of the company, but there is a whole list of stipulations defining highly compensated individuals; again, talk to an attorney for further assistance).

**Employee response**

Some employees were excited to get their glasses pre-tax, but our team happens to be generally healthy. Few employees put money into their FSA, and those that did didn‚Äôt use the full amount in it.¬†

## Family Planning Assistance

**Overview**

We provide assistance for family planning, including egg freezing, IVF, adoption assistance, surrogacy, sperm freezing, vasectomies, etc. The benefit needs pre-approval by the founders / HR ahead of time, though we would like to get a good automated system set up.

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

$5k/year with a $25k lifetime max

**Benefit to employees / company**

This allows any of our employees to build their personal and family lives any way they see fit.

**Who it affects**

All employees

**Pitfalls**

You have to tread lightly when it comes to reproductive health, and you can‚Äôt ask for proof of use of this benefit, which is why external platforms are helpful to implement. We also highly recommend only executives or HR receive approval requests to avoid any potential discrimination.

**Employee response**

Our employees were surprised when we added this benefit, and it led to a lot of interesting debate. From that debate, we added coverage for things like sperm freezing, vasectomies, etc. We also leave our policy open to be modified at any point in time, and keep our doors open for any benefit suggestions.

It has been great for LGBTQ+ and female recruitment. Even if somebody doesn‚Äôt end up needing it, they appreciate that there is a support system set up for them and others like them.

**Anything else to watch out for**

There are many reasons why companies implement this benefit. If your intent is to delay motherhood or get women to work longer, you‚Äôre setting yourself up for a toxic culture. You also have to be careful about how you message these benefits, so that the intent is not misconstrued.

You can also consider covering additional allowances for services beyond the norm. For example, you may discuss whether or not to cover the FDA approval process for egg or sperm donation. Going through this process allows employees who never use their eggs or sperm to donate them to a friend, family, or other person in need. There are other caveats like this that you‚Äôll want to consider and decide whether to include, and whether to add additional funding toward them.

There are a lot of platforms to help you with family planning assistance to avoid some of the legal headache of managing reimbursement for health. Unfortunately, we found most were cost-prohibitive for us and didn‚Äôt cover everything we wanted to cover.

Sadly, this is a taxable benefit. Your employees can submit it as a healthcare expense on their tax returns to hopefully recoup some of what is lost with the initial benefit payment.

## Charity Match Program

**Overview**

One of our values at Tinfoil is community. We believe in making sure we support our values and any community our employees are a part of. As such, we‚Äôve established a charitable donation match program.¬†

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

We match up to $1,000, annually, in charitable donations made by an employee.

**Benefit to employees / company**

This allows our employees to support causes they care about and shows our support for them and their beliefs.

**Who it affects**

All employees

**Pitfalls**

We once did a fundraiser at a conference where, for each badge we scanned, we bought a meal for the homeless. One person (out of the thousands we spoke with) said that giving to the poor causes them to stay poor forever. Though we could debate this topic forever (especially given that we were donating meals rather than cash), there will always be somebody who doesn‚Äôt believe in giving to charity. That‚Äôs ok.

We implemented this through our benefits and payroll provider, Gusto, which helped to make sure that the giving by our employees is anonymous. Gusto knows how much they donated, and matches it for us, but we don‚Äôt need to know, and we prefer it that way. Employees are free to support any cause they believe in, and we will match it, as long as it is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

**Employee response**

Not every employee takes advantage of this benefit, but those that do, love it. The response, in general, has been really positive, and people like the fact that we ‚Äòput our money where our mouth is‚Äô with regard to supporting the community around us.

## Fitness Reimbursement

**Overview**

Healthy employees are happy employees. We encourage folks to regularly exercise, and will reimburse for any exercise class, including gym memberships, dance classes, exercise classes, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, etc.

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

Up to $80 of expenses spent each month.

**Benefit to employees / company**

We all get healthy! When an employee starts exercising, we‚Äôve seen their productivity increase significantly within weeks. We also love when they become passionate about a new hobby and can teach everybody in the office something new.

**Who it affects**

All employees

**Pitfalls**

Some companies only cover the cost of gym memberships. This limits who can use the benefit. Open it up to include lots of different sports and hobbies!

**Anything else to watch out for**

We have an attendance requirement for this benefit. You must print out your attendance or have your instructor / trainer sign off that you‚Äôve attended at least 4x/month or 75% of offered classes, whichever is lower. This allows some employees taking a 1x/week class to attend 3 classes a month and still get reimbursed. There is flexibility on this policy if you‚Äôre traveling for work and can‚Äôt attend your usual classes or gym.

This is a taxable benefit, so make sure you‚Äôre tracking it correctly. Talk to an attorney.

## Long Term Disability

**Overview**

It‚Äôs important to remember that not everybody is healthy and if one of your employees does have a lasting illness like MS, debilitating cancer, etc., they should still be supported somehow. Long term disability insurance allows your employees to receive a portion of their salary if they‚Äôre unable to work again.

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

We cover 100%. It‚Äôs a reasonably affordable benefit, but really gives us the ability to support our employees in the case of an unforeseen, disastrous event.

**Benefit to employees / company**

This gives us all peace of mind, and allows us to focus on the big picture of the business, rather than worrying about our personal life and finances.

**Who it affects**

All employees

**Employee response**

Employees who have had family members with debilitating illnesses at any point in their lives appreciated being given LTD.

**Anything else to watch out for**

We don‚Äôt do short term disability (STD), because CA-provided STD is better than anything we can buy. As we expand our employee base outside of CA, we‚Äôll consider adding short term disability.

## Fun Items to Check Out

**Overview**

To prevent burnout, we want to encourage people to go out and do fun things outside of work. We‚Äôve started to purchase small things for the office that employees can check out for the weekend or a short period of time. Examples include an ice cream machine and inflatable kayak (+ life jackets + paddles).¬†

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

There‚Äôs no set amount, but as we have started to add items we have started to keep track of them.

**Benefit to employees / company**

This allows employees to use something they could buy themselves, but would rarely use.¬†

**Who it affects**

All employees

**Pitfalls**

Make sure you have waivers for specific items, and a sign out / return sheet. Each item must be signed out and, if it isn‚Äôt returned, it must be replaced by the employee. Accidents happen, so if an item breaks we are lenient and don‚Äôt make the employee replace the item. Most things are under $100 on Amazon, so they‚Äôre easy and quick to replace.

**Employee response**

Some things are rarely checked out, and some things are checked out regularly. It‚Äôs nice to have a variety of items to offer.

## Educational Stipend

**Overview**

One of our values is curiosity. My co-founder and I started Tinfoil with the goal of wanting to learn something new every day, and this is one way we can help our employees achieve that goal for themselves.¬†

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

We provide up to $5,000, annually, for furthering education. This must be manager approved, relevant to your work (though it can be a broad application), and must be paid back, on a prorated basis, if you leave within one year of the end of the training.

**Who it affects**

All employees

**Pitfalls**

Make sure you ask for proof of completion of the course before you reimburse, or a passing grade if an exam exists. We always want to see our employees finishing what they start before we cover new education adventures.

**Employee response**

We‚Äôve had employees take $10 Excel courses and $500 coding courses. We‚Äôve also had some of our employees without college degrees begin to pursue those. We love seeing them grow when they‚Äôre given access to something they wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise.

**Anything else to watch out for**

Federally, the maximum amount you can pay toward education for your employees before it‚Äôs taxed is $5,250. Make sure you‚Äôre within the law, and tax it correctly; talk to an attorney.

## 401k

**Overview**

A 401k is a simple retirement plan. Most employees will likely partake in a 401k, unless they are foreign and face unusual tax implications.

**Amount we put toward benefit &amp; Why**

We match 100% of the the first 3% of an employee‚Äôs salary that they put into their 401k, and 50% of the next 2% of their salary. So if an employee puts 5% of their salary into a 401k, we match 4% of their salary.

**Benefit to employees / company**

Employees are able to build up their retirement plan pre-tax (using a traditional 401k) or post-tax (if you choose to offer a Roth 401k option), while also getting a match for a percentage of their salary.

**Who it affects**

Potentially all employees.

**Pitfalls**

Companies can run into a lot of issues with non-discrimination testing, so we‚Äôd highly recommend implementing a Safe Harbor match, which removes the need to worry about non-discrimination testing. Talk to an attorney.

**Employee response**

Our employees were ecstatic when we added the 401k.¬†

## Coming soon:

**529 College Savings Plan**

Once we have more employees with children, we‚Äôll be offering college savings plans. Gusto now provides this with Gradvisor. It can allow employees to save for college tuition, or to save for education for family members pre-tax; it can also be used to save for certain K-12 programs and expenses as well.

**Life Insurance**

It‚Äôll be awhile before we are able to add life insurance. For a business under 50 employees, most life insurance policies we looked at were cost-prohibitive or didn‚Äôt cover enough. Our employees are hoping for life insurance policies that cover a multiple of their salary, rather than a fixed amount.

**More fun items to check out**

There are always more fun items employees could check out to use on the weekends. When we‚Äôre around 50 employees, we‚Äôd love to get SF Zoo passes and Monterey Aquarium passes. A lot of family-friendly organizations allow businesses that donate to receive bulk tickets / transferable tickets as thanks. This allows us to work toward our community value while still providing thanks to our team members.¬†

As with anything HR related, there can be issues. Be quick to respond to concerns, and always keep an open-door policy. Employees may come up with something brilliant for your team you just haven‚Äôt thought of yet."

anuqkp,68,2019-02-06,"With career fair week starting, here are some tips that I found out during my last year of living",I_am_bot_beep_boop,iastate,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/anuqkp/with_career_fair_week_starting_here_are_some_tips/,"**Background:**

I am an average student, my GPA isn't good at all. I was able to land an internship and it has significantly helped out in every shape, way, and form of future job searching.

**Pre-Career fair tips:**

**1a. Visit Career services** Visit your career services adviser ASAP to tune up on your resume. Your resume is obviously a big part in marketing who you are. Typos, grammar, and information not needed are huge turn offs to an employers time. Take time to research how to write a good resume, and then meet with your career services adviser. No need for fancy font, fancy paper. Remember KISS, keep it simple stupid.

**1b. Update your LinkedIn Account** Make sure it is similar to your resume, the beauty of LinkedIn is you can add as much information as you want. Remember business professional photos and content only. 

**2a. Research the companies** that will be at the career fair. Coming prepared is key. Game plan your exact movements, who you are talking too, etc. I created a spreadsheet to help keep me organized. This is an example:

Location|Company|Job Title|
:--|:--|:--|
Table 22|Reddit Co|Reddit Analyst

This minimizes your time wandering, looking like a fool. Everyone is watching you, and if you're the slow person walking around with their mouth open, it makes you look bad.

**2b. Research the company in depth.** When you see company A has Job title B you are interested, that isn't enough. Take the time to write down talking points about the company. People love talking themselves and what they represent up, so find positive things about the company. Awards, charity work, current events are great talking points. Also, at least have a general knowledge of what the company does. Don't waste the rep's time by making them explain what the company does. Your goal is to make it a short meaningful conversation, rather than a long boring conversation.

**3. Dress to impress, but not burn a hole in your wallet.** Yes, wear your nicest clothes, but no don't go out and buy fancy clothes and spend. While most men and women will be wearing business professional, you do not need a suit and tie for a career fair. Jobs have shifted from business professional to business casual in the workplace. My internship was a button down shirt with khaki/black pants. No tie, no suit, and even then I was probably over dressed. You won't land an internship/job with fancy clothes, big watches, or other accessories. Dress as nice as your current wardrobe allows you.

TLDR Pre-career fair: Research the companies, jobs, and dress to what your wardrobe allows you. Be as prepared as you can be.

**During the career fair:**

**1. Ditch your buddy.** We love being with our friends, and the career fair is not the time for that. Whether you like it or not, they are your competition. This also helps your conversations be more personable, as you don't want to tag team a conversation with a representative. It just comes off as not as interested.

**2. Ditch your elevator speech.** The classic elevator speech is a boring, time wasting trap. Rep's are there all day hearing elevator speeches and yours probably isn't meaningful enough to stick out. Instead, work your elevator speech around your conversation. For example, here is how I would start a conversation:

&gt;I_am_bot: ""Good afternoon (shakes hand). I'm [Insert name] and saw that [their company] is here and I was interested in [position listed]. Do you have any information on [position listed]?

This can obviously be altered, but it's a way better start than you reading your memorized boring elevator speech. I'm 15 seconds in and already talking about the position(s). The conversation ALWAYS leads to the meat of you elevator speech, as you can explain your interest level, class year, graduation date, major, etc. I received this tip from a club leader at the COB breakfast. I asked him what's one mistake candidates always make during the career fair, and he told me the elevator speech and to ditch it.

**3. Body Position.** This is pretty simple. Eye contact always, firm handshake, stand up straight, listen and speak when you can (don't interrupt!), nod your head when being given information, it's a ""I understand"" response without physically speaking it. Don't fiddle with your hair, keep your hands still, do a vampire cough/sneeze. You are being analyzed more than just what your resume says, and how you use your body are indicators to people.

**4. Take Merchandise** Companies bring a butt load of stuff. Pens, cups, USB sticks, bags, etc. Take it! They want it out of their hands. This shows you have interest in their brand. Be polite when you do, you can ask if you can take an item. They'll almost always reply happily saying ""TAKE ANYTHING YOU WANT.""

**5. Have plenty of resumes available** Even though most companies will tell you to apply online, or that they don't take resumes, always have enough to give at least 1 per company you intend to talk to. If you have a business card that works as well, but resumes work just as well.

**6. Ask for contact information outside of the career fair** LinkedIn and business cards are the 2 best ways to connect with your representative after the career fair. Always ask if they have a business card, and ask if we can connect on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is the future of job connections

**7. Fake it to make it** As mentioned before, the career fair is a pre-interview interview. A lot of company rep's judge the candidate by if they were someone they would want to work with. Be bubbly, personable, and chatty. People, as mentioned before, love talking about themselves, and the more you can get a rep to talk about themselves and the company, the better. This is a way to market yourself, and if you're shy you won't look good. Step outside your comfort zone for 2-3 hours. 

Anymore questions I would be happy to give answers, and if I think of anymore tips, I'll add them"

Hi guys I want to get straight to the facts and important info but if I need to elaborate more on something specific  please ask as it will help you guys asses my situation even better


Ultimately I‚Äôm a junior right now in the bachelors for ME program and it has really been a rough ride, not in terms of academics but having to work while having to take a minimum of 12 credits to receive financial aid. I‚Äôve had to work +40 hours a week since before my freshman year to be able to afford these classes and it obviously was detrimental to my academics, hence my situation now. I can‚Äôt really ask my family for help as we‚Äôre all dealing with a pretty shitty financial situation. Anyways, my gen ed courses are ones I have been flying by in but the engineering specific courses that require a little more time and practice (math/science +engineering core) were JUST good enough just to move on( 50% C‚Äôs, 40% B‚Äôs and occasional A‚Äôs)

Here is the embarrassing part: so the one course that is the absolute basis for mechanical engineering  (EGR 250: intro to thermal engineering) is the course that I struggled with the first time I took it and failed. Now, I had  sporadic test scores where I would do good on an exam (like 85+%) and then get a score like 40%. This large variation in test scores really just stems with how much time I had to devote to this course as opposed to another one.             -&gt;Basically, I failed this course 3 times which is absolutely embarrassing and I‚Äôm completely ashamed. &lt;-
[This one course has kept me from moving into the actual ME program classes, but I received conditional major standing since 250 would be the last course I needed to take before entering my actual ME courses. So, this way, I was able to take 2 ME courses (properties of materials and mechanics of materials which I got B‚Äôs in]

I petitioned to repeat the course one last time, also stating that this would be the only course I would take in winter semester just to prove that I am capable of succeeding in this program when I am not working and am capable of handling the challenges and focus that I am required to handle in the school of engineering ( stopped my engineering internship voluntarily and my retail job) 

When I received word that the Academic standing committee denied my petition (after fall 2018), they also stated that I am not allowed to further pursue engineering at Oakland. This decision was made at the end of December and I was absolutely destroyed and lost. Then I was dropped from the ME courses I would have been taking now, but can‚Äôt because of EGR 250. Now I am not taking any classes at OU or any other school because of one of two reasons: I couldn‚Äôt take anything at a community college at the time because classes were full/not worth the money or time OR it didn‚Äôt make sense taking another gen ed at OU if it didn‚Äôt count towards a degree if that makes sense. 

Fast forward to now: I got another mechanical engineering internship at the beginning of January and have been working my tail off trying to learn as much as I can. All of this is useless unless I have an actual degree. So, I applied to Wayne State mechanical engineering, got accepted for summer semester and am going to take differential equations just to prove to OU that I am capable of college level work. I may also take the engineering static‚Äôs course at Wayne. 



HERE IS MY MAIN QUESTION: 

Since the decision from the academic committee, I have been working on a re-admission application to OU.  The re-admission application wants an explanation of the circumstances under why I left OU( for a semester) and how I‚Äôve used my time away. 
*******************************************
‚Äî&gt; Is there any chance they can consider me for re-admission? Any major things I can add to help convince them to give me one last chance?&lt;‚Äî
*******************************************
 If I didn‚Äôt care for this degree I would have switched my major after the committees decision, but EVEN after two months since the committees decision, extensive thinking on what else I can pursue, talking to advisors from other programs, talking to my parents, talking to engineering advisors, I really cannot see myself doing anything else. 

Notes:
- I am still in good standing within the program (2.8 GPA)
- I‚Äôll admit it, coming out of high school my math skills were average and I did have to retake calc 3 at OU
-Commuting to Wayne M-F would really be a pain/ mess with my family‚Äôs work/school schedule unlike OU which is a 10 min drive from my house
-I have to submit my re-admission application to be considered for summer semester by March 1. If I decide to hold off, take the classes at Wayne over the summer, and then submit my re-admission app. to be considered for Fall 2019, then I also can prove with hard grades that I am capable of succeeding.
-I have been studying my thermodynamics textbook since December, just learning as much as I can for the course and practicing as many problems I can

SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS BUT I NEED TO TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT: STUDENTS THAT ARE CONVICTED OF CHEATING AT OAKLAND ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR PROGRAM IF ITS THEIR FIRST OFFENSE AS OPPOSED TO MYSELF WHO CANT CONTINUE BECAUSE I TRIED TO DO TOO MUCH (pay for my classes, hold internships, ACTUALLY TRY to learn as opposed to a student who just goes and cheats. This logic just doesn‚Äôt make sense and stings even more knowing that students who cheat can make it farther than me.

I really just want to finish at OU ultimately as my official degree process is 77%. If I have to finish at Wayne State, my transfer credits would put me at 36% progress towards completion of the ME degree= more time and money


please help me, I just have all these thoughts/plans in my head I need more advice from students that are thinking from the same level as me :/

anvd96,32,2019-02-06,The birth control I've relied on for 8+ years has been discontinued and now I have to have a conversation much sooner than I was expecting.,AutomaticSpeech,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/anvd96/the_birth_control_ive_relied_on_for_8_years_has/,"I found out a few hours ago that the only birth control pill that has ever worked for me has been discontinued and none of the pharmacies around me have it in stock. I just made an appointment for tomorrow morning to discuss getting my tubes tied with my OBGYN.  

I've done research on tubal ligation and the many methods available. I understand the intended permanence of it and have a lot of personal reasons for being CF. I am confident that this will be a life long conviction, but in the event that it isn't I would much rather regret not having kids than have kids and regret their existence.

I've known for sure for about 6 years that I do not want children and that I absolutely do not ever want to be pregnant. I'm 21 years old and will be 22 in a couple months, and I didn't think that I'd pursue sterilization until I was in my mid to late 20s. I'm feeling a lot of anxiety over my current situation. I'm in my last semester of college, seeking an internship, and ready to launch myself into my career once I graduate. I don't feel like I have the time or energy to put my body or my mental health through the process of finding a new birth control. I had a very hard time trying to find a pill or method that didn't give me horrible side effects when I first started birth control, and my experiences with the generic of my long term birth control have been worse than the side effects I remember from the first handful of methods I tried.

I guess I'm feeling stressed because I feel like my hands are tied. I'm in a long term, very committed relationship and I don't want to give up our sex life. My previous birth control was free through my insurance so condoms are already an added expense that will eventually become a lot. Natural family planning feels too risky to me as I've always felt very paranoid over becoming pregnant. Every person I've known who has gotten an IUD has had a bad reaction or adverse experience with it and my first OBGYN steered me away from it a few years ago. 

The answer seems simple to me and yet I'm feeling nervous. Are there any CF people who have gone through something similar to this? Can anyone offer any insight/advice/opinions?

anvri5,10,2019-02-06,Working in Folsom for 6 Months. Where Should I Stay?,DarkerGlass,Sacramento,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/anvri5/working_in_folsom_for_6_months_where_should_i_stay/,"Hey! I'm a grad student from Phoenix, AZ and just accepted a 6-month internship with Intel in Folsom. I'm gonna start in mid-May and have until then to look for a place to stay for the duration of the internship. I'm not really sure where to look so I'd really appreciate any and all recommendations since I've never been to Sacramento.

&amp;#x200B;

Some key things I'm looking for in a place:

1. 6-month lease in a preferably 1 bedroom or a studio apartment with rent and utilities under $1400 (pretty flexible on the budget). I'm also cool with renting a private room in a house.
2. Pet-friendly. I'll be bringing my small 20ish lb dog with me. 
3. I'm bringing my car with me and plan to drive so I'd like a commute of at most \~30 minutes away from Intel campus with traffic. 
4. Decent nightlife. I don't go out every night but I'd like to be close to some great spots if possible.
5. Safe-ish community. Doesn't have to be gated but I'd like to live somewhere where I can at least not have to worry about my car getting broken into.
6. Furnished would be a huge plus. I have furniture at my current place but I don't know if it would be worth it to move it 750 miles for a temporary living situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at apartments in Folsom close to Intel but they all seem overpriced. Is it possible to find what I'm looking for or should I change my expectations?

Thanks!

anw1x0,35,2019-02-06,To the homeless man who nearly died in front of my eyes,kidwiddahat,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/anw1x0/to_the_homeless_man_who_nearly_died_in_front_of/,"I had seen you every single day on my walk to my internship in the city.

You were always stationed at that exact same corner, outside my favorite lunch spot, right next to that old beaten up newspaper stand. 

Completely ignored and invisible to the world, I always tried to embrace you somehow, whether it was a casual hello or a small donation to enable you to purchase a meal that day.  To remind you that you're just as, if not more, human then all these faceless cogs you painfully see walk by every day in their expensive work outfits and such.

It was a beautiful July afternoon, and I was on my way to eat at the restaurant in which you frequently stationed yourself outside.  From about a block down, I saw you stand up, slowly lift your head, and begin walking towards that busy city street with countless cars, trucks, and bikers alike, flying past you at a million miles an hour. I wish I had acted sooner than I did.

A large construction van approached you. You inched closer and closer towards the street. As it seemed to be just feet away from you, you hurled your body in front of it.

I looked around in a state of panic, not fully grasping what had just happened. Not a single person, other than myself, had even noticed. People simply kept walking by, talking to their friends, staring down at their phones, too lost in their own worlds to care, let alone even notice.

The van had been going too fast for you to throw your entire body in front of and it only clipped your shoulder. Half of a second sooner and I presume you would've died right then and there. Still standing there, like a frozen idiot, I watched as you lied, motionless in the street, as cars sped past, blaring horns and all.

I watched in horror as you stood up, composed yourself, and began walking towards the middle of the street. Without a care in the world, you laid down, face-up, awaiting that one impatient driver, like the rest of the world, to not notice you and end it.

This was when a surge inside me prompted me to stop thinking and act. I dropped my backpack and ran into the middle of the street and stood over you to alert drivers that you were there and to go around. I embraced you and frantically tried to get you to stand up and come with me back to the sidewalk.

It was like you didn't hear a word I said. With tears pouring down your face you painfully told me that not a single person in the entire world knew your name, nor cared.  So I asked you what your name was. I told you my own. I begged you to stand up and come with me. To let me buy you a meal and sit down and eat with me. You refused.

I stood in the middle of the street with you for what seemed like hours, cars angrily passing, giving me the middle finger and disgustingly honking their horns feet away from where you laid. The police eventually arrived, stopped traffic, and I was told to go back to the sidewalk. I watched as they stood you up, and brought you to the other side of the street. An ambulance arrived and after a few minutes of arguing, you got inside of it and drove off.

That was the last time I would ever see you.  My internship ended a month later. You never returned to that spot. 

I have no way of contacting you.  I have no way of knowing of your well-being. I thought to call local hospitals, but remembered that you never told me your name.

My one wish is that I could have somehow just gotten you to tell me your name. So that no matter what else, at least one person would know who you are in this world.

I desperately hope that you're in a better place now, and that things are beginning to turn around for you. 

You seemed to be a kind person. You didn't deserve any of what happened that day.

Ok, so let me start from the beginning:

My name is William Visser, and I‚Äôm an 18 year old Dutch student at the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam.

For the past year, I was a video editing intern at one of The Netherlands biggest reality tv production companies, where I learned a lot. 

Next week I will return to school for 3/4 months.

In those 3/4 months, I will do my exams, which I expect to pass.

I will then receive my MBO 4 - AV-Specialist degree, which is comparable to an associate degree from a community college (or at-least I‚Äôm told). 

What I really don‚Äôt know right now, is what I‚Äôm going to do after that‚Ä¶ 

I really want to be the editor of big TV-Shows (would prefer drama) or Movies/Documentaries, and eventually move to the US or Canada.

So my question to you guys is:

How do I start? 

Should I first apply for jobs here in The Netherlands? Or should I try to find a job in America or Canada? 

I don‚Äôt really have the money for film school, so that‚Äôs probably not an option‚Ä¶

So, there's this situation going on between one particular gentleman and myself. But lemmie start from the beginning.

I met him in July last year on an excavation expedition I went to to get my internship done. It was great, we were talking about stuff, not very important or anything, just getting to know each other and having great time. 

Then, we both were offered a job on other excavation expedition that was supposed to last for the next 6 months. I was there through the whole mission, he was only until the end of october and then sometime every two weeks for a few days. Anyway, during that time we got caught into something i would call friends with benefits living together. The nights were great, during the day we were simply busy working, but it was still fine. He told me then that i cannot Fall for him, because he's just being him and he likes to have a friend-sex buddy but he does not want a relationship. I got it, i Just ended a toxic relationship a few months before myself, and I was totally fine with his conditions.

But! And that's a fun part for me. Meaning, I don't understand a bit of it.

When our work was over and we were gone back to our lives, he started writing me these messages sometimes while drunk, sometimes sober. He says in them that he fucked up and despite our agreement he thinks about me, he misses me, that sort of content. I do too, of course, and so I tell him when couragious enough, but thats it, end of conversation. And then it happens again.

Now, I had to stay somewhere in the city he lives in, I had a flight. So i asked if I could stay the night, he said sure, okay, and yeah. Simple cuddling stuff was going on, he told me he is a little bit jealous of me spending my time with other men. Then he got angry because I told him it was nothing serious between us and he wanted it that way. He told me then he likes me very much, and that was the reason I could stay the night and not some potential things we would do. Kissed me goodbye.

And now, I really dont know what to think about all this. I have a huge crush on him for months now, but I can get over it. But what if I dont have to? I mean, I am too afraid to ask if anything changed from the moment we established the agreement, I am too much afraid to get a refusal from him.

How do you guys see this? What should I do? "

His great size and disheveled appearance did not help in the slightest. My sincerest apologies, but here is the unaltered transcription. I hope to have an understandable translation soon.**


Alrecht, sae it was me an' Gavin, a shiny cheil gonnae by Arius, a halflin' i've worked wi' afair called Ucor, an' tois elven men callin' themselves Flint an' Cultras. Arius was dressed fancy, probably noble-born, an' seemed tae be anither divine sodger, loch myself. Ucor's sneaky, wi' an yak fur pickin' it enemies' weak spots an' anither yak fur gauld. Cultras kept up wi' heem, weavin' ben fights lookin' fur th' reit time tae strike, while Flint stuid in th' back an' kept us aw in fightin' spirit wi' his graphite loons.

We waur hired fur aw ay twintie seconds afair th' tois scoots vanished, but we figured they'd be back in time tae lae. Ne'er seen a sneaky type loch 'at gie up oan a chance fur pay. Arius an' Ah got uir moonts loaded up, an' those tois cam skulkin' back jist in time tae shove aff. Half a day later, we waur in a farmin' toon, ready tae gang. We speart puckle questions, got some supplies, an' sit it fur th' moontains. Ah swear 'at dobber Nils was watchin' us, laughin' onie time Ah hud tae climb anythin' bigger than a pebble.

Abit halfway up, we foond a cairn, looked loch fowk waur ance buried thaur. Ah ken 'at coz th' tois rogues foond somethin' an' got immediately surroonded by skeletons. They're beyond lucky Arius an' Ah waur thaur, an' th' time it took us tae gie tae them served weel tae remin' them ay uir priorities. Ur it woods, if rogues coods ever learn tae nae leap head-first intae trooble.

Arius an' Ah pit th' corpses back tae rest an' we returned tae th' road. We barely gart it anither tois minutes afair th' perytons foond us, dive-bombin' us an' nearly killin' Gavin. Fortunately, they only nearly killed th' halflin' ridin' wi' me. They flew at stoatin speed an' kept jist it ay reach, leavin' us swingin' at boss air. Th' rogues an' bard kept hittin' them frae afar, an' Arius an' Ah woods burst whenever a body got close enaw. We eventually managed tae fend them aff, breakin' antlers an' halflings in th' process. Ah patched up Ucor an' we kept oan.

Cultras proved useful, scootin' aheid wi' a summoned owl an' findin' baith th' nest an' their numbers. Ucor cam up wi' a plan tae distract them wi' th' larger members ay uir ceilidh, namely myself an' Arius, while he an' Cultras woods strike th' beasts frae atop th' cliffs behin' them. They started climbin', an', thankfully, lae ay us took th' road lae ay th' way tae th' top. Th' plan went aff withit a hitch, immediately downin' a body ay th' beasts an' scatterin' lae. They main hae thooght we cooldnae burst them frae th' grin, an' they waur half reit. While Ah started castin' mah most powerful speel, Arius summoned wings ay lecht an' flew up tae barnie them in close range. Jist as he mit them in battle, Ah called doon a beam ay lecht frae th' heavens, burnin' them aw wi' divine fury.

'at woods hae bin it, except th' feckin' mammy ay aw giant flyin' cannibal deer cam doon an' nearly killed me an' Ucor. Flint kept me oan mah feit, while th' wee dobber Ucor somehaw managed tae pull ben blaw efter blaw frae a beest big enaw tae flin' Gavin loch a toy an' swallaw me whole. Dae yerself a favur an' dornt underestimate 'at lucky dobber. Arius flew efter it loch a sparraw mobbin' a hawk, duckin' under claws, catchin' horns oan his shield, an' stabbin' it at every opportunity. Ah kept movin' mah holy lecht tae keep it burnin', an' th' rogues kept shootin' it whenever possible, aw while Flint kept us rarin' an' ready tae gang. But e'en sae, it wasnae enaw. Th' beest wasnae fallin', an' we waur aw a body guid blaw frae losin' uir heids.

Sae Flint an' Ah cam up wi' a plan in th' heat ay th' moment. Ah left mah moonbeam burnin' intae th' moontainside, stuid up oan Gavin's back, an' summoned th' ancient vines ay Melora. Together, Gavin an' Ah snared th' beest, but it wasnae enaw. It was far tay strang, pullin' against us. Frae th' sam moont, Flint called tae th' beest wi' th' tongue ay th' bards, stunnin' it lang enaw fur us tae brin' it crashin' intae th' grin.

Wi' 'at, th' humble sparraw turned intae a divine falcon, as Arius dove doon as fest as a bolt ay lightnin', stabbin' his sword sae deep an' unleashin' sae much righteoos judgement 'at almost a' fowk was blinded fur a minute efter. Ah was th' only a body tae see, an' dornt teel mah guidwife, but Ah dornt hink i'll ever see a secht sae bonnie again in mah life.

An' loch 'at, we waur dain. Ah collected puckle arrows tae make myself a fancy helmit, a' fowk got paid. Ah wasnae tay sure abit them at first, but Ah hink eh'd happily serve again wi' onie ay them.


**Scribe's Summary: As best I can tell, the adventuring party consisted of Logan (the speaker), Arius Gildhorn, Cultras, Flint Amastacia, and Ucor. There are repeated mentions of one ""Gavin"", and, as best I can tell, it refers to the speaker's mount, a celestial moose.

anwm2v,1,2019-02-06,This Organization is a Scam.,_terribad,YearUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/YearUp/comments/anwm2v/this_organization_is_a_scam/,"Hello everyone. 

For those of you considering doing YearUp, let me tell you about it as an alumni who went through the program and got hired on a contract basis within a F500 financial services firm. 

Year Up‚Äôs mission is commendable and something that anyone who has a empathetic/thoughtful heart will support. Year Up‚Äôs actions, however, lead me to believe it is a scam organization. I, along with many other alumni, disassociated ourselves from the program after completing it for being exploited, misled, and lied to for a year. I haven‚Äôt been able to find this information anywhere on the internet, and I believe this deserves to be seen by anyone considering taking time off from college to join this shitty program. Let‚Äôs begin (this is from a Year Up NY perspective): 

1) During L&amp;D, you are paid $300 on a bi-weekly basis, for working from 8:30-3:30 (6 hours w/ 1 hour lunch) and early dismissals on Wednesday‚Äôs at 11:30 (3 hours) totaling up at 27 hours/week or 54 hours each pay cycle. Know how much in pay that is? $5.55 an hour. And that‚Äôs before getting pay deducted for holidays and infractions. It should be closer to $4 an hour. And you have to live like this for 6 months. Not only that, but they expect you to be a literal retard going into the program, ‚Äúteaching‚Äù you things that are common sense and having half-assed instructors teach about things that either a) they don‚Äôt want to teach about or b) everyone who isn‚Äôt a retard and has some prerequisite knowledge of their track (which they should) knows. It was a waste of 6 months of my life, and I would have been better off if I‚Äôd been able to attend classes at my college instead of this program. But it doesn‚Äôt end there! 

2) During Internship, you are paid $400 on a bi-weekly basis typically having to work an 8-5 or a 9-6 (8 hours of work w/ 1 hour lunch) totaling in for at least 40 hours a week or 80 hours each pay cycle, for a whopping $5 an hour. But many interns (myself included) feel like they have to go above and beyond and typically stay longer doing 8-6‚Äôs. And it‚Äôs even less $ than I‚Äôm suggesting because of mandatory holiday pay cuts and infractions. Let me put this into some perspective: I had a summer intern train me when I first came into the firm who made $25 an hour. I did literally everything he was doing, and had done even more and had more responsibility than him by the time my internship ended. But sure, go ahead and keep paying me less than 1/5th of his wage. This is very demoralizing. Especially when everyone around you in the office is able to survive on their own with the money they make, but Year Up gives you pennies in comparison. ‚ÄúFor the experience‚Äù my ass. This is exploitation. 

3) Referring back to the end of point 2, all Year Up is becoming, is a scaled organization for cheap, semi-skilled labor at slavery wages to exploit young adults to do repetitive, unfun tasks that you couldn‚Äôt force upon anyone with actual qualifications. And they market themselves as a ‚Äúlife-changing organization‚Äù, give me a fucking break. Sure they may be one or two outliers, where they truly get wonderful careers out of the program, but the overwhelming majority of participants get exploited for 6 months by corporations and Year Up. For those of you considering leaving college to do Year Up, you‚Äôre better off finishing your degree and getting a job that way. 

All in all, this organization is a scam. I hope anyone who considers this shitty program reads this before they join. Stay in school and work hard at it, that‚Äôll pay off more than this scam does. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that corporate partners pay $26,000 for each intern to Year Up to host them for 6 months, and Year Up receives donations from sponsors that end up paying for the rest of the student‚Äôs headcount, which is $34,000 per student. Doing the math, participants see less than half of that (way less if you count infractions). What happens to the money Year Up saves from giving out infractions? Who knows. From experience, I know the organization spends a ton of money on marketing itself to prey on other young adults and also a ton of money on catering food (literally had catered food at least once or twice a month). Is that really more important than paying your participants a livable wage? Yes? Cool.

Also wanted to mention that if you bring up any of these conditions to the staff, their go-to response is ""you should be grateful you're getting paid anything at all, we don't have to pay you!"" which is true, but would lead to your scam organization having no participants and seeing it for what it really is. But go ahead and keep masking yourself in a thin veil of ""opportunity"" and ""life-changing"" to keep tricking young adults into working for slavery wages. "
anwq2y,16,2019-02-06,Mom finally decided to go NC with grandparents and it‚Äôs getting messy,BrokenLemonade,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/anwq2y/mom_finally_decided_to_go_nc_with_grandparents/,"This is long and complicated and my feelings are jumbled, so if any clarification is needed, please ask.

For some context, I‚Äôm 23F, no siblings, and spent college going back and forth, and finally moved out in 2017. My parents and I have a decent relationship and talk fairly regularly, I go home for holidays and they come visit me sometimes.

My mom has always had a difficult relationship with her parents, but she feels a lot of obligation to be the ‚Äúgood child,‚Äù so she‚Äôs always let them stay in our spare room, use our laundry, kitchen, babysit their dog, go to dinners, be polite and accommodating. It‚Äôs definitely always been a case of bemoaning their arrival, sucking it up while they‚Äôre in the house, and then being relieved that life can go back to normal once they leave. For the past ~10 years, they‚Äôd usually come up in the summer and go back and forth between an RV park and my parents house. I never liked it much and felt like she let them walk all over her.

My grandfather is not a nice man. Angry, stubborn, racist, chauvinist, probably misogynist, selfish, difficult to get along with and judgmental. My mom has told me that he physically abused/s my grandmother and I don‚Äôt have a reason to doubt her. I do not care to get along with him. My grandmother hasn‚Äôt ever really done anything bad except defend him, and they do come as a package deal.

As far as grandparents go, they‚Äôve been okay, they visited a few times and would send presents and postcards and tell me about what they‚Äôre doing, but I feel like growing up a lot of contact was hedged by my mother. As I‚Äôve grown up and become more responsible for communication, they never fell very high on the contact list because it didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd have anything to talk to them about.

In any case, this last Christmas they decided to send Christmas presents to my parents and not to me, which really pissed off my mom because they didn‚Äôt bother asking any questions or offering any sort of justification for the decision, and she took it as them excluding me from the family. I was okay with it, just kind of shrugged and said I figured it would happen eventually. She asked them if there was another package coming, my grandfather said no, my grandmother called mom and tried to explain it as they didn‚Äôt have any communication with me and my mom blew up and told them if they didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with me that she didn‚Äôt want anything to do with them (this all happened the Sunday before Christmas, which was a lot of fun). I‚Äôve been telling her to go NC with them or at least stop letting them stay in the house if they cause her so much strife every time they‚Äôre in the area, but mom would always she felt responsible because they‚Äôre family.

A few hours after, my GF sends an email about how I have never tried to reach out them, how they were taught respect for their elders, how at my age he was taking his grandparents out on ‚Äúexcursions‚Äù, whenever they would visit my nose would be in a device, I don‚Äôt ask questions about where they‚Äôve been, etc, etc. It was self serving and stupid and had no hint of apology and entirely targeted things I had supposedly done wrong. To be fair, some of those things are true (I don‚Äôt try to contact them), but it‚Äôs clear that he wants a grandchild that thinks he shits gold and clings to his every word. I guess it‚Äôs been a weird war of attrition, where they don‚Äôt ask me about my life so I assume they don‚Äôt care, so I don‚Äôt care about them in return. I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my responsibility to reach out to them at this point, and it certainly wasn‚Äôt when I was a child.

In any case, there was no contact between the GPs and my mom or I, so it mainly boiled down to me trying to figure out if it‚Äôs actually my fault and I have done something wrong or if they‚Äôve done something wrong and I‚Äôm fine to not want to talk to them. Mom‚Äôs pretty firmly on the NC side, and figured it wouldn‚Äôt come up again until this summer when my cousin graduated high school (my mom and her brother live in the same town).

But no. Mom‚Äôs birthday is this month, and so yesterday GF is tries to call and leaves a message about how they‚Äôre sending a present and hopes she doesn‚Äôt send it back. Mom calls me in a sort of ‚Äúhow do you feel about this/what should I do‚Äù sort of discussion. I tell her that her relationship with them is really up to her, and that if their problem is with me that they should be contacting me and not her.

I figure that‚Äôs it for the day, my boyfriend and I go to lunch, we play some video games, and suddenly my phone rings‚Äîit‚Äôs my GM. I seriously consider not answering but end up answering, since I told myself that if they called me I would answer. It‚Äôs not a pretty conversation. My GF takes the phone a bit in and I don‚Äôt remember much of the conversation except he went back to the ‚Äúyou were never interested in what we were doing‚Äù (didn‚Äôt need to, he sends emails, has a facebook he never tried to add me to, and my mom would tell me if they were up to anything particularly interesting), ‚Äúthe last few times we were over, you were always on a tablet or a phone‚Äù (he always has his nose in a book and tbh I don‚Äôt see the difference). In any case GM takes the phone back, and the entire conversation was about an hour long. I told her I wasn‚Äôt interested in having a relationship with an abusive and angry man (‚Äúhe isn‚Äôt AS abusive or angry,‚Äù says GM, I bitterly laughed), and then she went back through when I was born and every time they came to visit, with very specific memories and everything, and then brought up the quilt she made me for my college graduation present. I feel very guilty about that quilt, because I know it was a lot of work and I don‚Äôt use it.

The conversation ended with me telling her that I might want to have a relationship with her, but I am uninterested in my grandfather. I told her I needed time, but that I would call her within the next month sometime (originally I told her it might be weeks, it might be months, and she asked me if I could think a bit quicker and then asked me not to take that the wrong way). 

So in between my mom calling me in the morning and my grandma calling me in the afternoon, my mom called my grandfather and their conversation was extremely short. It broke down after my grandfather brought up an old bookcase my mom keeps in the office that belonged to my great grandfather. It has a lot of old books, some first editions, other rare books, and some things related to his Native heritage. My grandfather wants this bookcase and says it‚Äôs his. Mom says he gifted it to her and belongs to her. I believe he probably cares more about this bookcase than his relationship with either my mother or me. My grandmother might actually be interested in me as a person, or she might just want to use me as the key to everyone ‚Äúgetting over this‚Äù.

Problem is, I‚Äôm not sure I really want to put the time and energy needed into this. I‚Äôm already exhausted, and I really don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with my grandfather. My mom‚Äôs planning on getting a letter of no trespass since they‚Äôll probably show up this summer and she doesn‚Äôt want a scene over this bookcase or any of the other things he‚Äôs storing in our house because he lives in an RV. What I really wish is that I could have an honest conversation with my grandmother and that maybe some of it would trickle into my GF‚Äôs cold, shriveled heart. Is it possible to have a relationship with my grandma and not my grandfather? The guilt over possibly being a bad grandchild weighs on my heart, and I keep thinking about my grandmother crying and my grandfather getting angry at her and hitting her (which my mom tells me probably still happens). On the other hand, they haven‚Äôt been the best grandparents and they‚Äôre definitely bad at communicating and honesty and maybe they don‚Äôt deserve to be in my life.

Also, I hardly ever call anyone, even my mom or my best friend. I hate it. I have depression and anxiety and I‚Äôd be more likely to want to text my grandma on occasion but she has an old flip phone, while my grandfather upgraded himself to a smartphone (which he is on all the time, hypocrite).

This just eats up a lot of my mental focus and social energy and makes me distracted and irritable, and I wish I knew what to do. On top of this, two of our elderly family pets passed away in the last month, my graduate school application got delayed and I‚Äôm stressing about whether I‚Äôll have a job in six months when my internship is over. Again, if I can clarify anything I will, I left a lot of specifics out."

BSc in Sociology, during my last year of school and 1year after I was working in IT recruitment. It was challenging, interesting, I got to learn a lot in terms of tech, but after a while I felt like my results were always dependent on someone else and that no matter how many frameworks I know, whether I get a joke about ‚ÄúUDP‚Äù, in the end still can‚Äôt apply my tech knowledge in practice. Wanted to challenge myself and study analytics-related major, since I‚Äôve always had interest for that and I felt comfortable with math. Throughout my life I have studied in US, Finland and Germany.

**Current education:**

I decided to pursue a degree related to Data Analysis in Sweden. Considering that for most Data Science programs I didn‚Äôt meet the requirements (not a CS major, I just had some Statistics, Probability, Data Analysis courses within my bachelor program), my best option was an Applied Social Data Analysis program at one of the universities here. During the 2 years of Master I was able to get the basics of R, Python, Tableau, SQL, play around with some projects to grasp everything better. Of course, I‚Äôm not a programmer, but I really enjoy working out solutions and I dont get frustrated from spending hours figuring out my bugs/researching info.

**Language skills:**

I speak Swedish with all my friends, have a pretty good pronunciation and always get understood, I get the jokes and can keep the conversation going, I‚Äôm fine with writing (but there is definitely room for improvement). I was even allowed to skip 3 levels in my Swedish program because I was learning so quick. I also speak fluent English (no accent), have basic knowledge of German.

**The actual problem:**

I really want to find some internship (even unpaid) related to data analysis just to get some hands-on experience and test what I know and understand needs to be improved. So far out of **all** the applications I‚Äôve sent out, I only got one positive response (from another EU office of that Swedish company).

Sometimes if the platform allows to track the resume, I see that the recruiters dont even open it for weeks on end, and then a month later I get an automated reject. Out of curiosity I even applied for recruitment/hr assistant positions (because it's still something I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing) which didn‚Äôt even call for Swedish, but also got rejected everywhere. Of course, I tailor my CVs and personal letters.

I have a pretty Russian-sounding name, Im not from EU, but my current visa allows me to work (I have a part-time job as a swimming TA for kids). I have a proven track record at school, my teachers give me good feedback, everyone I worked with had only positive comments about my performance.

**How to get companies to consider me? Maybe some tips on IT companies who are diversity-friendly?** At this point I‚Äôd be happy with a non-paid position just to try myself out.

**Summary:**

* 25yo
* social sciences background
* non-eu
* looking for a position in data analysis
* geography: Stockholm/Sk√•ne/Sm√•land
* need tips"
anxb9d,38,2019-02-06,Freshgrad here. Is this a normal working environment in Indonesia?,Begone_THOUGHT,indonesia,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/anxb9d/freshgrad_here_is_this_a_normal_working/,"Posting this from my throwaway account.

Background: I‚Äôve just graduated from university last year (2018) and got my first full time job since December at a small consultancy company. I‚Äôve only done internships before in a bigger company, so I‚Äôm not sure if my view of acceptable work behaviour is skewed or not. For comparison, I used to interned for companies based in gedung kantoran di daerah Kuningan, Semanggi &amp; Sudirman with 40+ people. Now the office I work for is di ruko di luar Jakarta yang sebelahnya restoran and only has 4 people in it.


I honestly enjoyed the nature of consulting itself and dealing with clients. However, my boss‚Äô behaviours and my coworkers‚Äô put me off from continuing the job. I want to know if this is me feeling like an eNtiTLed MiLLeNiAL or is this actually toxic. Example behaviours:

- my boss calls me and Coworker 1 stupid to our faces for asking a question, we have an open floor plan so everyone else heard then. ‚ÄúLo bego banget sih‚Äù , ‚Äúih emang ya lo masih bego‚Äù, ‚Äúih gimana sih kan kemarin udah dijelasin? Ko nggak ngerti2 sih‚Äù (i was asking for a confirmation to see i was doig the right thing lmao)

- my work involves doing cold calls, every time i get off the phone my boss criticised me. I‚Äôve never had a job doing this before (they know this) and the people I contacted, I still keep in touch with so I know I must be doing something right. ‚ÄúAh kamu belom bisa ngapa2in‚Äù , ‚Äúkamu masih payah nelponnya‚Äù , ‚Äúgimana mau punya klien lo ngomongnya masih blepotan?‚Äù , ‚Äúudah lah, telponnya taro di depan Coworker 1 aja. OP gausah angkat2‚Äù

- coworker 1 is a kiss ass and will jump on my boss‚Äô wagon to tell me off when I made a mistake. However, Coworker 1 is just repeating what my boss has said so they don‚Äôt really add points anyway lol. I know you will always get this in any office so i understand. I‚Äôm just adding it so you can get the picture.

- coworker 1 excludes me in 90% of their conversation. When they‚Äôre saying something to the room, it‚Äôs always mentioning the boss‚Äô name or Coworker 2/3. Even though they often ignore her and I always respond to what she‚Äôs saying. Again, this is not so much a problem cos it says more about coworker 1 self than it does about me.

- EVERYONE always calls each other fat to their faces. ‚ÄúAh kamu mah sekarang gendut‚Äù , ‚Äúpantesan gendut lo‚Äù , ‚Äúdia naik x kilo loh, jelek ya sekarang‚Äù (talking about our client).

- my boss has made every one of her employees cry. They all told me that it‚Äôs just her not knowing how to phrase her words dengan sopan but she means well. I think my boss is rude lol.

- in my annual evaluation meeting, I was telling her about an incident in which Coworker 2 was being rude to my potential clients. My boss responded with ‚Äúiya gue tuh nggak ngerti deh perasaan Co1 &amp; Co3 biasa aja, budaya bencong kali ya tukang gosip‚Äù (Co 2 is a flamboyant guy, he‚Äôs probably seeing someone hasnt told anyone, i dont think it‚Äôs called for to call your own coworker bencong especially in a formal setting).


I still have a lot more to tell but here‚Äôs the gist of the bad stuff. Is this workplace environment normal in Indonesia or should I push through the bullshit until I get to the place of other coworkers?"

The team sounds great and it's in a field he's interested in, but what sounds sort of weird to me is that he's being hired as a contractor instead of as an employee. Is this normal? My internships have all been as an employee with W-2s, so I'm not super familiar with how a contractor works aside from the fact that they have to pay their own taxes (and that none of their salary is withheld). Does this mean that a contractor's hourly pay should be higher than a normal employee since they don't have any taxes withheld? Aside from not having healthcare and other benefits covered by their employer, are there any other losses from taking a contractor intern position over the summer instead of an employee intern position?"

anyf3c,1,2019-02-06,[25F4M] Daddy's Hot Best Friend,courtneylovebug,DirtyKIKRoleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyKIKRoleplay/comments/anyf3c/25f4m_daddys_hot_best_friend/," 

My Dad's best friend has been around since I was 18. And was the first man I ever had a crush on. He's ten years younger than Dad. But when they had a business merger, which made them a lot of money, he invited his new friend and business partner over for dinner. Mom was happy to meet him as well. Anyone who made Dad richer made Mom happy. Meant she could get away with going shopping on her credit card more. And then just make it up to my Dad later. In private. Since I knew she really liked to use Dad's foot fetish against him. It's kind of hard to forget when you see your Dad on his knees in front of your Mom doing that. The flashy heels. The licking. The heavy petting. And then scaring them because they were caught. All because their only female child had a nightmare and wanted to be comforted. The thought of that night and others like them still make me shiver.

Dad's best friend though. He was like a man's man. You could tell that he kept himself in shape. And he dressed well. In tailored suits. So they would hug every part of his body just right. And give off that clean and well trimmed appeal to clients and being the Boss of his firm. And it probably also got women to notice him in a crowd. If he went to the right bar. Seeing him like that time after time for dinner just made me melt inside and, well, between my legs. Sometimes it felt like he didn't know the affect he had on women.

When I graduated from High School he sat with my parents. Cheering me on alongside my parents as I walked across the stage. Making butterflies flit about my stomach even more. And he stayed for the graduation party that my Father threw with Mom's party planners help. There was elegant food and plenty of picnic tables in the yard for everyone to enjoy the nice weather. Dad was proud of me. I had graduated as the number one student in my class and had written a speech as valedictorian. And I had been accepted to the college my Father went to for the Fall. Yale. When he found out he was over joyed. I mean I was happy too. I was going to a really good school. So, unlike my older brother, I could follow in his footsteps and work in field of law. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a lawyer. But I knew I could figure it out at Yale.

Dad's friend and I had a moment alone at the party. I had gone to my room to be alone for a moment and he was there. Looking around in my room. He had a black bag in his hand. Holding it by the strings. He looked up at me with a smile. Which made my face flush and my knees weak. I walked over to my desk so I could lean on it. So I wouldn't fall over in front of him. Then he moved closer to me. Looking me over with those dangerous eyes that any girl could fall into.

""Your speech was really great. Full of wisdom I didn't expect from a 18 year old woman. I think it was the perfect send off for your class."" He said.

He held up the bag to me.

""Would you open my gift here?"" He asked.

I nodded and gingerly took the bag from his hand. I turned my body a little and set the bag on my desk. I opened it and there was a card on the top. I smiled. I opened it. There was a gift card to my favorite store. For $1,000. Which made my jaw drop a little. I recovered and then noticed something else under it. I put the card down and took out the thing in bag. It was hoodie sweater. I let it fall open. I smiled when I saw that it said Yale. And it was one size bigger than the usual size I bought. How did he know that I did that?

I looked up at him and there was a sparkle in his eyes. Like seeing my reaction had made him happy.

""Um..Thank you. For all of this. It means a lot. I honestly didn't even expect you to be here."" I replied. ""So thank you for coming and thank you for the graduation gift.""

""Its not a problem. I'm happy to be here. I was happy for you when your Dad said you decided on Yale. I went there as well."" He replied. ""So I feel like its a right of passage to get you the sweater. And the gift card is so you can get some clothes that are respectable for a college wardrobe.""

I smiled. I was trying to resist the temptation to push myself up off the desk and kiss him. To show how thankful I really was. But I didn't. I stayed put. Trying to make sure I was breathing right. He licked his lips briefly. Then he leaned in to kiss my cheek. But I moved my head and his lips landed on mine. I kissed back. Which led to more kisses. My arms wrapping around his neck. Chest to chest as we kissed. Then we heard foot steps and broke apart. I looked at the card. My Dad walked into my room. Rambling about this is where we had been hiding. That Dad and him needed to go to Dad's study to talk a little business before going back to the party.

When they left the room I went to the bed and hugged myself. I had gotten to kiss a man I had lusted after for so long. The party ended at midnight that night. Sometimes I would catch him looking at me. But I tried to focus on having fun with my friends. Enjoying the food. The cake. And etc. Summer was over before I knew it and I was packing up for college. Mostly with clothes I had never worn before. Because of the gift card. I moved into my dorm. And had an awful roommate my first year. Second year wasn't so great either. Third year I got lucky and had my best friend as a roommate. But it was summer again. And I had to do a internship at a law firm.

Which my Father, of course, got me a prime one at the firm he co-owned. And the person I was to report to and help all summer was Dad's friend.

This was going to be a long summer. As a 21 year old female intern. And being around a man whose touch I longed for again. That no college lover or Boyfriend had been able to make me feel. Compared to how it felt that night at my graduation party.

I looked around my college dorm. I was all packed. Dad and him were using their cars and mine to get my stuff home. Where I would be staying for the summer like always. Seeing him lift boxes and plastic tubs of my stuff was somehow sexy. And I was aching between my legs. Oh. How I wanted that man.

Between our 3 cars everything got home and unloaded in the same day. I spent the next few days unpacking what I needed. My mom had surprised me one day with a shopping spree for office appropriate outfits for the summer. Since she knew I had none and Dad approved it. Mom didn't stop until I had enough to rotate through in month. To keep myself looking fresh. And, of course, shoes to go with them.

And now here I was. In front of his office. Setting up a desk that had a plaque with my name on it. I was nervous and excited all at once. Because I had been working very hard in college on my courses to become a lawyer.

All I had to do was survive being this close to him. Every week day this summer.

So at this point in time she is 21 years old. Her Dad is 45 years old. So the male lead is 35 years old. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. This character needs to be played as the Alpha type. That knows what needs to be done in his public and private life. And very much so knows what he wants in his love affairs as well.

So..How will you play this character and get her to fall into his idea of fun? While keeping appearances of being professional at the office? While dealing with the struggle that they are falling for each other? And what her Father will think?

Turn OFF's: Anal, scat/piss, blood, rape, heavy S&amp;M, Deep Throat blow job,and being degraded.

Turn ON's: Light biting and biting back, kissing, Having my earlobe bitten/suckled on lightly, having my boobs played with, Oral Sex(Giving and getting), breeding kink, cream pies, moderately rough sex, Cuffs for the wrists, under the bed wrist/ankle cuff system(With consent/safe word), Lingerie, and fingered on my g-spot.

anygrf,3,2019-02-06,Thoughts on my idea for my internship site?,sesame-yeezy,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/anygrf/thoughts_on_my_idea_for_my_internship_site/,"I‚Äôm a BSW student in my second semester internship. I‚Äôve been at this agency since the fall.

Without getting into too much details about the agency just for privacy reasons.

Basically, it‚Äôs a big brother program but for children, adults &amp; seniors.

A big problem the agency has is we have hundreds of clients waiting to be paired up with a friend. The friends come from the community and are all volunteers. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to get volunteers to volunteer their time. It is a year commitment and maybe that‚Äôs a turn off. 

But I was thinking, what if looked at each client profiles and began pairing clients up with one another? To qualify for this program, you have to be in recovery of your mental illness &amp; not actively suicidal. So a lot of these clients are very lonely and socially isolated. 

If we carefully examined the clients based on diagnosis &amp; knowing them personally, wouldn‚Äôt it be worth a shot pairing them up? They are human beings at the end of the day &amp; not these dangerous people that need careful supervision. I think it‚Äôd be empowering to pair them up (with both of their consent). They both would relate to struggles of being diagnosed with a mental illness &amp; being socially isolated. 

Just having someone who‚Äôs going through the same thing as you could be empowering and give them confidence to get out more often &amp; be more involved in the community.

The end goal of the agency is for clients not to rely on it. Rather to instill confidence &amp; skills to be able to independently be active in the community. 

I think this is a great idea to remind clients that their diagnosis doesn‚Äôt define them &amp; that they‚Äôre human beings who deserve friendship like anyone else.


Maybe I‚Äôm completely in the wrong but it really gets to me knowing that hundreds of people in this program are all alone, desperately waiting just for one person to show they care :( 

Thoughts and input is welcome! My agency is super laid back and open to ideas but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest anything out of line so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here asking for some opinions. Thanks "
anynot,11,2019-02-06,Career advice,jarboogies,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/anynot/career_advice/,"I am about to finish my electrical engineering degree, and I am terrified at the moment. I have been working internships every year throughout college, and I've noticed a big problem. My anxiety tends to create self fulfilling prophecies which always set me back.

A good one is that my anxiety tells me that I am going slow on my work, and that my boss prefers my coworker over me every single day. This becomes true as my output decreases while my boss keeps handing my coworker projects (he actually does prefer the other worker, simply because she's been there a few months before me and he's become used to her before I started.)

I am terrified about how I will function as a professional, and am looking at visiting a doctor to see what to do next.

Has anyone else dealt with this? If so, how?"

Was that really long? I know my problems are small. I think a lot of people are going through worse things. I know it's hard for some people to find jobs. I was on unemployment for a long time. And I was on food stamps. One day I applied at store I've been working there. Is it what I want? No I miss programming. I think I'm a little spoiled. I graduated college. I got my degree in Computer Science. A lot of people can't afford to go to college. So I feel spoiled and stupid. I had some internships. A lot of those didn't last because I wasn't serious about my jobs. I was online a lot and some people were mean to me online. That affected me at work. I didn't work hard. I got fired because I made stupid mistakes. My last programming job was 4 years ago. I miss coding/programming. I was happy. It was my happy place. It is a hobby of mine. I don't know how to get back into it. I know some languages, but I don't know. Is it too late for me? A lot of people are thinking, ""I can't relate to her.""

ao08ge,20,2019-02-07,College/Other General Thoughts,AdmirablePangolin,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/ao08ge/collegeother_general_thoughts/,"I think as a introvert, I‚Äôm definitely having a different college experience from the stereotypical one people often associate with college (I.e having a lot of friends, partying a lot etc) I only have one close friend on campus (and a few acquaintances) most of the time if me and this close friend ever go out it‚Äôs to a restaurant or a museum not really a party. I usually just go to class, my internship and spend my free time either studying/doing homework or I‚Äôm in my room by myself and I‚Äôm pretty content with this. A lot of times I‚Äôll go out to places by myself and have a good time, or go to club meetings and other events on campus that I‚Äôm interested in alone as well. I think society puts so much pressure on people, especially young people to be sociable and to go out and do certain things or else your not ‚Äúliving life‚Äù but honestly just do you and find your own path. Idk just some late night thoughts I was having, I‚Äôve noticed both with myself and on this Reddit society makes us feel inadequate or we‚Äôre doing something wrong for wanting to be alone most of the time and not be more extroverted but I definitely think it‚Äôs time we stray away from that sort of thinking "

ao0u7l,4,2019-02-07,A Question for SFSU Computer Science Students/Alumni,dan0543,SFSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFSU/comments/ao0u7l/a_question_for_sfsu_computer_science/,"I posted a similar question in r/SJSU. Since I‚Äôm considering both schools, I figured I‚Äôd ask this subreddit as well. 

How easy (or difficult) was it for you to land internships or a full-time offer post graduation at a great tech company in Silicon Valley? Anybody got offers at FAANG?

Due to SFSU being in the Bay Area, I‚Äôd assume that internships/jobs aren‚Äôt too difficult to come by, but im sure theres competition from UC‚Äôs, Stanford, and the like. 

I‚Äôve seen people say that since SFSU isn‚Äôt a top tier school, its fairly difficult to land an internship/job, but others say that proximity to tech companies is key. What has your experience been like?"
ao114x,1,2019-02-07,SPOILERS‚Äôs internship prediction thread,Deletesoonbye,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/ao114x/spoilerss_internship_prediction_thread/,"Now that Deku has shown himself to posses the Black Whip quirk, I‚Äôm seeing a ton of people suggest that he‚Äôs going to intern with Kamui Woods. I hope to god this happens. However, rather than trying to do a fanfic sort of thing, I‚Äôm trying to make a prediction on what could possibly happen. If anybody else wants to make preditctions, comment down below.

-All Might has to contact Kamui Woods again, due to having his contact from the Kamino Ward raid. 

-Kamui Woods seems like the sort of person who has little experience in interning. This, coupled with his familiarity with Deku from the beggining of the series, could have him be a reluctant mentor. 

-Eventually, Deku masters his quirk, and Kamui Woods‚Äô character gets devleoped

-Mt. Lady is essentially Kamui Woods‚Äô sidekick at this point, despite having her own office. Considering how she saved Deku and Bakugo from the villains in a rare act of decency from her, she does not have the fondest memories of him. She would be present throughout much of the potential internship arc, but mostly for comedic effect from what Mineta bugs Deku about afterwards (sadly, but likely. I really just want more of her.)

-Additionally, Edgeshot is on Kamui Woods‚Äô team. He also helps Delu train his quirk, but allows Kamui Woods to do most of the work due to the similarities between Arbor and Black Whip

‚Äî ‚ÄîAlternatively, Mt. Lady and Edgeshot also developed with Kamui Woods. This is part of why I really want Kamui Woods to mentor Deku on this: you kill three birds with one stone. Both Kamui Woods and Mt. Lady have been among my favorite characters since the beggining, and I was dissapointed to see Sato‚Äôs boring super strength (it‚Äôs strong, but it‚Äôs just really bland) more often than Mt. Lady and Kamui Woods‚Äô much more interesting quirks AND designs, so this is the perfect opprotunity to develop both them and Edgeshot.

These sort of threads are legal right? If so, comment down below about either thoughts, or other ideas/predictions"
ao16yd,5,2019-02-07,[Xpost] Why do I feel so lonely even though I'm close to god?,NtnStone,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/ao16yd/xpost_why_do_i_feel_so_lonely_even_though_im/,"Sorry for the cross post I just need answers..please.

## Why am I so lonely even though I feel close to God?

I am AoG in terms of denomination and I've been apart of the church basically my entire life. And I was always bullied in school. I ended up having terrible self esteem and self-imaging issues. I didn't start to get serious about being a Christian until high school. It was then I started reading the bible on my own and studying and really growing. In high school I met a girl online, and we got into a relationship. She was my entire world at that point. We stayed together until college where God called out to me. He told me to break up with her, she was holding me back from getting to know him more. We were together for seven years at that point. I finally broke up with her and that was the night I finally spoke in tongues. It was a worship service on Thursday night. I'll never forget it. I felt the presence of God move in that building and it hit me like freight train.

&amp;#x200B;

But following that break up and that amazing experience I've felt and extreme loneliness. Not from a standpoint of friends...I have great friends, great people who support and love me. But actual love. I broke up with her when I was 20, we dated since I was thirteen. I'm 27 now, and since then I've felt this intense longing for wanting to be in a relationship, yet after that it never worked out. I had small little flings here and there, giving my heart away to people who probably didn't deserve it. It was out of loneliness. And when I went to serve at my church, I had a crush on one of the interns there. She ended dating another intern. Whenever they were together I would get jealous, and my heart would heart. They had what I wanted. My friends from college all of them have paired off and gotten married, some even have kids now. Yet I'm still alone. I know...that God's Word says in Matthew 6:33 "" But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. "" And I have...I've been trying. I go to God for everything...yet I'm still alone. And tonight I guess I reneged that one. I contacted another one of those women to get closure. I found out that she had just ghosted me, up and left me. Found out she had a new boyfriend on instagram so I went to ask why, what went wrong, and I knew what went wrong. She wasn't living for God and I was. Unequally yoked...it wouldn't of worked, but there was some part of me that was (and still is) so desperate for a relationship again. I had get some closure about it or something, but all I got was a headache and more heart ache. So here I am...I'm in pain. I've asked God many times why is it like this for me. What am I not getting right? What am I doing that's causing this. And I can't figure it out. I'm hurting so much, yet I hear everyone say the same thing. Go back to Matthew 6:33.

&amp;#x200B;

I try and I try. I've given God everything, yet this pain and feeling of loneliness remains. It's gotten to the point where my parents (jokingly I hope) have given up on the idea of me getting married and having children. And it hurts so badly. Yet I ask God to take this pain away from me, to fill me with something more...and it keeps coming back to that. And tonight was the point at which I just feel, empty. I don't know what else I can do but pray, but I've been praying for 7 long years for something to happen or for me to get over it..yet I can't.

I'm sorry for the terrible formatting and long form post."

Thankfully my boyfriend woke me up on time, since I had to get to my internship.

I woke up to my boyfriend gently running his fingers through my hair and nuzzling my face. 

I made a pretty big deal about how he woke me up. While he thought I was being silly, I really just couldn‚Äôt get over how cute it was.

Growing up, I faced a tremendous amount of physical abuse at the hands of my dad and three older brothers, and it was not uncommon for my mom to actually pour water on my face to get me out of bed.

Needless to say, the way my boyfriend treats me is a stark contrast to the way my family did. 

The novelty of being touched so gently still hasn‚Äôt worn off. 

While I know relationships aren‚Äôt always forever, this is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt completely safe with a person.

Sighing dejectedly, I snapped it out of my pocket and pressed it against my ear.""What do you want?"", I snapped. ""There's a situation, I need you to check in right now"" replied a monotone electronic voice, having been filtered by various identity scrubbers. ""Sure thing boss, but I'm off duty so this counts as overtime"", I warned her. Before she could formulate a retort, I ended the call and made a beeline for my car. My two bodyguards, sensing the urgency, had the doors opened and the engine running as soon as I got there. ""To Comet Pizza, on the double"", I huffed as I slid into the comfortable padding of my taxpayer funded Mercedes S class. I thumbed the well conditioned leather as the vehicle pulled away from the curve and merged into traffic, the blue strobes dancing off the reflective surfaces of other vehicles as we overtook them. We're not going to be affording new ones anytime soon, I mused. We were still recovering from Obama‚Äôs transfer of half our logistical budget to Iran. However, given their weapon enrichment had run into trouble - we had no choice but to reinforce their coffers if the plan was to stay on track. As we blew through traffic lights and intersections, I gazed solemnly out the heavily tinted windows at the dark clouds brewing on the horizon. It looked like Weather Control was brewing up another thunderstorm. I racked my mind for the details. Something about high-winds and gigantic hail. After a few moments I stopped trying to reason about how they‚Äôd cooked it up. Ultimately, the climate change scare tactic was bringing us in tons of research funding, which is just what we needed in these fiscally precarious times. 

A couple minutes later than I‚Äôd wanted to, we pulled up at the Comet Headquarters. As soon as the guards had cleared me for entry, I stepped out and made for the entrance at a brisk pace. Some time ago, a highly dangerous and informed public actor had discovered the entrance to this lair, which wreaked havoc before the puppet police removed him. I shook my head in disgust. How could security have been this lax. Nonetheless, we‚Äôd solved the problem by now. Half the unit on site was liquidated for it, and we‚Äôd made progress against the treacherous INTERNET patriots who‚Äôd exposed it.  Once inside, I made my way into the basement, past the now abandoned child cages, and faced a dark, seemingly ordinary concrete wall. Without even looking behind me, I gestured to one of the trailing bodyguards to hand me the vial of childs blood. Resisting the urge to drink it, I extracted a paintbrush from my handbag (made of childs hair, of course) and dipped it into the vial. It took me less than 30 seconds to paint the pentagram ‚Äì still too long. I longed for the good old times when all we had to paint were the four elegant angles of the swastika. Alas, HR had ultimately gotten their way with the branding overhaul. ‚ÄúA fresh take on globalism‚Äù, was the refresh motto if I recall. As expected, a whirring sound ‚Äì dampened by the concrete ‚Äì was emitted from behind the wall. Seconds later, it split open with an ringing clang. The heavy metal hinges swung the now parted concrete slabs outwards to reveal a circular vault door engraved in satanic verse. I stepped forward expectantly, and a set of biometric sensors extended out of a hidden panel in the door. I paused, scrambling through my handbag for the scalpel. After finding it hidden under a heap of soy syringes, I made a professional incision around my hand. With a grunting tug or two, it came off mostly bloodlessly, exposing my webbed claws to the damp air of the basement. I quickly pressed it against the sensor. ‚ÄúWelcome, agent of Soros‚Äù a pleasant but tinny voice spoke. ‚ÄúNow, please lean forward for IRIS authentication‚Äù. I dutifully removed my contact, and leaned into the exposed eyepiece. The ochre yellow hue of my reptilian eye reflected off the lens. After the machine dolled out another similar greeting, I tossed my now expired human glove and contacts into a portable incinerator, and stepped into the retreating vault door.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never here when we fucking need you‚Äù, snarled the boss as we hurried through the corridors towards the site of the emergency. I stifled a comeback, feeling that now was not the time to antagonize her. Still, I felt she often forgot that reptiles like myself were simply not as active as our human collaborators. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the alpha project. It‚Äôs been compromised‚Äù. I froze, my blood running just as cold as it always did. ‚ÄúHow s-s-so?‚Äù, I stammered, accidentally letting my forked tongue slink out between my teeth? ‚ÄúSee for yourself‚Äù, she responded. As soon as we rounded the corner at the morgue, I froze in horror at the catastrophe before me. There, alongside Seth Rich‚Äôs autopsy chamber, sat the overturned dolly of Ruth Bader Ginsburg long deceased corpse. A gaggle of interns were occupying themselves about the scene ‚Äì most removing debris and other fluids that had pooled around the chamber. ‚ÄúI take it the facial cloning project wasn‚Äôt complete when this happened?‚Äù, I asked quietly. ‚ÄúNope‚Äù, said the boss. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really in the shit now‚Äù. I groaned and leaned against the wall, picking my brains fruitlessly for a solution. This would put our Democratic takeover of the supreme court in far more jeopardy. I later found out that one of our interns had been moving a vat of sizzling child-cooking oil down the corridor to the cafeteria when one of the wheels had broken, sending the vat of boiling fluid careening into Ginsburg cryogenic chamber, in turn destroying the expensive cooling systems and taxpayer funded facial cloning device. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been called in for a meeting with the No.1‚Äù, the boss spoke, interrupting my train of thought. After gathering myself together, we set off for the meeting room. 

The air was thick with tension as Soros ambled into the meeting room. Almost all of our best and brightest were there. We all snapped our heels (I was still wearing my human legs) together as he reached the podium, and let out the usual ‚ÄúHail Soros‚Äù in perfect synchrony. He gestured for us to sit, and so we did. After some routine updates about the current climate change scam and a short briefing by Mueller on the status of our witch hunt against our greatest public enemy in the White house, George gestured towards the boss and I to make our report. Before I could open my mouth, the boss stood up and broke the news. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been unable to clone Ginsburg my lord. A mishap by one of our interns compromised the body before facial synthesis was complete. Furthermore, intelligence has detected that highly skilled INTERNET patriots are already on us‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor fucks sake, Hillary‚Äù, roared Soros, ‚ÄúThis was supposed to be an easy job. We‚Äôve been trying to avoid another Seth Rich‚Äù. Hillary looked down miserably, ‚ÄúMy apologies my lord, the accident wasn‚Äôt foreseen‚Äù. Soros whirled around to Obama. ‚ÄúDo you think you could become Ginsburg for a year or  two Hussein? You did an excellent job as Bin-Laden‚Äù. I sighed as Obama had to patiently explain yet again to Soros that he couldn‚Äôt just play anyone. Old age had taken its toll on the man‚Äôs mind, as it does when once reaches the age of 645. While the ongoing discussion continued in the background, I marveled at how young Soros still looked for a human. The consumption of human children was akin to pure magic when it came to slowing the aging process.

 It wasn‚Äôt until almost midnight that the meeting was adjourned. I did not leave the facility immediately like I used to. Instead, I made my way down the corridors, gazing in at the rows and rows of paid shills hard at work in IT, then at the child harvesting facility, and the flying saucer production plant. Over in the arts and crafts section, our homosexual propaganda posters were hanging to dry, hot and fresh from the press. I even took a peek in our FBI department, where elaborate false flags and extravagant arrests were being planned. When I‚Äôd had enough, I made my way to the boss‚Äôs office. She was packing her briefcase as I came in, and half clothed in a thick hazard suit. ‚ÄúWhere are you off to Hillary‚Äù, I asked, feeling that the occasion wasn‚Äôt so formal that I need user her full title. ‚ÄúEdge of the world‚Äù, she replied. ‚ÄúGot some problem with the sky-dome generator‚Äù. She let out a long and exasperated sigh as I toyed with her Uranium One deal award sitting at the corner of her desk. I just grinned, and set it back down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you around‚Äù, I said as I made for the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you will‚Äù, she muttered. ‚ÄúThe sun never sets over the Zionist Empire‚Äù. "
ao3l8j,1,2019-02-07,Lonely and Lost College Student,knickfan97,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ao3l8j/lonely_and_lost_college_student/,"Hello everyone! Not sure how to jump into this since I'm new to this but I have a lot I need to just get off my chest, as these feelings have been bottled up within me for a long time now. I am a 21 year old male studying at a university away from home and these past few years have been extremely taxing on my mental health. I often become overwhelmed about my lack of confidence, friendships, and direction in life. I have constant reinforcement from my family about how smart, good-looking, and kind I am. However, I often find myself thinking that I am the exact opposite of all these things, and even worse, that I am a complete fraud due to my lack of internships and career experience that my family is constantly asking me to build up. Im starting to reach the end of my college experience, and as a man, the lack of confidence and direction I'm feeling is starting to eat at my self-esteem a great deal. I have strong fantasies about running away to another state far away with a different name and a fresh start for a career, only to realize I am trapped at my university with little money.

There are some days I feel great, but other days, these negative thoughts I experience feel like a parasite in my brain that I literally try to shout out of my mind, only for them to persist. Perhaps my biggest problem is I stress about money, and I tell myself I am a leech to my family for wasting money on education that I wont take advantage of because I'm useless. I have asked for help from my parents, and even told them that I am depressed and need assistance, but they just deny it as just a stressful episode I am experiencing and that I will ""get over it"". I have quit smoking marijuana a few months ago to reduce my complacency in life.....only to find comfort in alcohol, which seems to worsen my depressive episodes when I'm sober. I plan on applying for internships to hopefully land one this summer or fall, but I do not feel I have a good enough work ethic, and my lack of confidence feels like I'm setting myself up for disappointment.

Sorry for the long post, but I REALLY needed to get this off my chest and just vent. As a man, I have been holding this in for a while and have put on the persona of confidence and hard work to my close friends and family that is completely fake, and it feels good to just write out my thoughts and struggles, it is therapeutic. If you've made it to the end of this, I just want to say thank you for reading, and I hope many can relate to this predicament I am currently in.

Have a great day!"
ao51j5,2,2019-02-07,Badly want to quit my job,CagierThree,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ao51j5/badly_want_to_quit_my_job/,"So let me quickly type this out as I have to finish some work.

Got my bachelors in may 2017. Found my first and current job September 2017 after months of depression. It was thanks to a friend that worked here and they needed someone badly. (Small firm around 10-12 staff professionals including the partners)

A month later he and another staff quit. I'm still an intern getting paid nothing and continue that way until March or April 2018 when I get promoted to staff.

I read often how public accounting is but my boss just cant keep her personal life and work life separated. If she's having personal stuff come up she will be in a horrible mood at work and treat us all like shit. The way she respond to me sometimes just makes me mad and my anxiety super high. All of this wouldn't be horrible in it's own but then she makes it a point to tell or call out my errors in front of the rest of the staff multiple times. Even after she had already done so 1 on 1 semi privately.

Anyways because we are understaffed and I'm I guess semi the manager with her and certain other staff that work closer with her than the other partners. I'm trying to get better at it but I end up being very unorganized and forgot to do some certain things once in a while. My boss calls me for every small little thing so I have to put my work aside many times a day. Which leads me to falling behind and either make up for it with overtime or just keep falling behind. 

In my office most people are gone by 5:30. A few of them work from home so I understand them. Other ones are getting their masters. I am usually the only one that stays at the office past 6 when there are deadlines I cant miss. 

I just cant keep doing this. I badly need to get out so I'm going to tidy up my resume this weekend and start looking elsewhere. I dont think many public tax places are currently hiring so maybe something in private. I want to still give public tax a try but I just dont have the motivation or energy to start studying for the CPA right now. Which also causes me a lot of stress since there is a bunch I actually dont know. 

Anyways I dont know where I'm going with this post but I just needed to type something out and have others read it. I also didnt obviously mention everything only what just came to my mind but theres a bunch more like another guy recently quiting mid last tax season and my work increasing 3 or 4 fold. Sometimes I don't even take a lunch because I dont have time for it. Ahh and a big one my boss keeps getting new clients that require a lot of work when we already have more than enough as it is and we are understaffed. And theres moments where my boss and I are super chill and everything is good in the world. But most times where I'm just home worried she will call me randomly at 9pm because of a small mistake that gets found by a client. Something that can easily be fixed tomorrow morning and she doesn't need to bother me with attitude while I'm trying to rest. Oh and the fact that I cant leave my office because she always needs me the second I go to the restroom and loses it at me that I'm never at the office. Or how I cant keep my phone on silent anymore because she calls me when she is with other staff.

Sorry my thoughts are very unorganized and probably filled with errors. I'll take any words of advise or of how to stop being a little b thank you.

Tldr: hate my life and want to quit job but have not started applying anywhere yet. Boss is high maintenance. Anxiety and stress are eating me."

ao5r2n,3,2019-02-07,Will die Ahmadiyya √ºber den Islam aufkl√§ren oder doch nur missionieren?,Desi_Dost,islam_ahmadiyya_de,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam_ahmadiyya_de/comments/ao5r2n/will_die_ahmadiyya_√ºber_den_islam_aufkl√§ren_oder/,"Gestern f√ºhlten wir uns **h√∂chst am√ºsiert** als wir [in einem Artikel im SauerlandKurier](https://www.sauerlandkurier.de/hochsauerlandkreis/meschede/ahmadiyya-muslim-jamaat-klaert-ueber-friedlichen-islam-11738916.html) lasen, die Ahmadiyya verfolge nicht die Missionierung von Menschen anderer Glaubensrichtungen. Darin behauptet der Ahmadiyya Imam Shahid: Als Imam lehre er Mitgliedern der Glaubensgemeinschaft die Lehren und die moralischen Wertvorstellungen des Korans. **Missionieren wolle seine Gemeinde Menschen anderer Glaubensrichtungen aber nicht**: *‚ÄûDer Glaube ist ein Gef√ºhl. Glauben muss man leben. Es bringt nichts Menschen dazu zu zwingen, Moslem zu werden. Das muss jeder Mensch selber f√ºr sich entscheiden‚Äú.* Die Ahmadiyya sei daher liberal - ihr sei es **allein** daran gelegen, sich in die deutsche Gesellschaft zu integrieren.¬†

Bei all den strategisch gut positionierten Narrativen und T√§uschungen der Ahmadiyya haben wir selten solch eine L√ºge gelesen. **""Aufkl√§ren ja, missionieren nein""?** Das widerspricht unserer Alltagserfahrung als (Ex-)Ahmadis. Von Kind auf lernen wir das die Ahmadiyya die **einzig wahre Stimme des Islam** sei. Mit dem Erscheinen des Ahmadiyya Gr√ºnders als Messias und Mahdi w√§ren alle anderen Glaubensrichtungen **veraltet** und damit **√ºberfl√ºssig** geworden. Die **einzige L√∂sung der Menschheit** k√∂nne nur noch der Ahmadiyya Islam sein. Missionierung ist daher ein Kernbestandteil des Glaubens. Der 2. Khalif der Ahmadiyya sagte hierzu:

*""****Jeder, der sich nicht am Tabligh \[arabisch f√ºr 'missionieren'/ 'predigen'\] beteiligt, h√§lt sich nicht vom Tabligh fern, sondern von Ahmadiyyat.*** ***Solch*** ***eine Person wird weder von Ahmadiyyat gebraucht, noch gibt es f√ºr ihn einen Grund, dass er in der Ahmadiyyat bleibt.*** ***Er betr√ºgt sein Gewissen durch die Behauptung, er sei ein Ahmadi.*** ***Wenn er nicht sein Gewissen betr√ºgt, so ist er aber sicherlich ein L√ºgner und verdient es nicht in der Jamaat der Gl√§ubigen zu weilen****.""* (Mash-ale-Rah Band I, Hadhrat Khalifat-ul-Masih II, Seite 206)

Diesem Verst√§ndnis folgend gibt es innerhalb der Gemeinde Strukturen, die diese Missionierungsarbeit organisieren sollen, die sogenannte **'Shoba (""Abteilung f√ºr"") Tabligh'**. Diese Abteilung gibt es auf allen Ebenen (lokal, √ºberregional, national) und in allen Gemeinden der Ahmadiyya in Deutschland. Der Gro√üteil der √∂ffentlichen Veranstaltungen in der Ahmadiyya wird von **diesen** Abteilungen organisiert.

Anders als es der Imam hier nach au√üen kommuniziert, ist die Konvertierung von Andersgl√§ubigen nicht etwa ein passiver Nebeneffekt, der bei der √ñffentlichkeitsarbeit mal vorkommen kann. Innerhalb der Gemeinde ist es ganz klar, dass all diese Arbeit das **erkl√§rte Ziel der Missionierung und Konvertierung** hat:

*""****Jedes Kind und jeder Jugendliche sollte verstehen****,* ***dass die Aufgabe, die uns Allah √ºbertragen hat - seine Herrschaft auf Erden zu errichten***\- ***die gr√∂√üte B√ºrgschaft ist, die es auf Erden gibt.*** ***Begebt euch mit Hingabe in der Verbreitung des Islams und Ahmadiyyat***."" (Mashale-Rah Band l, Hadhrat Khalifat-ul-Masih II, Seite 816)¬†

Anders als der Imam hier behauptet, ist es f√ºr die Mitglieder ganz klar, dass es mittel- bis langfristig nicht darum geht sich nur zu 'integrieren'. Der Anspruch ist, die Ahmadiyya durch die Missionierung zur Mehrheitsreligion auf der Welt und insbesondere in Deutschland zu machen. Innerhalb der Gemeinde wird dieser Anspruch immer und immer wieder formuliert. Der 3. Khalif der Ahmadiyya antwortete am 23. August 1973 in einem Interview zu einigen Fernsehreportern, dass das deutsche Volk Inshallah (arab. f√ºr 'so Allah will') die Ahmadiyyat annehmen wird:

‚Äû***Ich habe in einem Traum gesehen,*** ***dass auf den Herzen des deutschen Volkes das Kalima steht, daher bin ich fest davon √ºberzeugt, dass dieses Volk letztlich Ahmadi wird***.""

Am selben Tag sagte der 3. Khalif in einer Pressekonferenz: *‚Äû****ich bin √ºberzeugt,*** ***dass innerhalb von 50 Jahren die g√∂ttliche Revolution*** ***durch die Menschheit im Allgemeinen und*** ***durch das deutsche Volk im Besonderen anerkannt wird""****.*¬†

Imam Luqman Shahid kennt diese Dogmen und Positionen der Gemeinde. Wir fragen uns warum er es hier im Interview aber leugnet. In dem Leitfaden f√ºr die Absolventen der Imam Schule der Gemeinde in Deutschland hei√üt es ganz klar, dass die Missionierung zu einer seiner Hauptaufgaben geh√∂rt: *""Sie haben den Eid abgelegt, dass Sie Ihr ganzes Leben der* ***Verbreitung der Lehre Allahs***, ihrer Publikation und ***Verk√ºndung*** *widmen werden. Und dies ist weder ein kleiner noch ein gew√∂hnlicher Eid. \[...\] Ich habe bereits zuvor einige Male in verschiedenen JƒÅmi øƒÅt gesagt, wom√∂glich auch Ihnen, dass Ihnen in diesen sieben Jahren das Training dar√ºber gegeben wurde, was die Lernmethoden sind, wie Sie zu lernen haben, wie Sie Ihr Wissen zu erweitern haben, f√ºr welche Themengebiete Sie Ihr Interesse wecken sollen, welche Themen im p√§dagogischen (Tarbiyyat) Bereich und welche im* ***missionarischen (Tabligh) Bereich f√ºr Sie relevant sein k√∂nnen.""*** [\[1\]](http://jamia.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DER-BESTE-LEITFADEN-Deutsch.pdf)

Besonders erstaunlich an der Aussage ""**Missionieren wolle seine Gemeinde Menschen anderer Glaubensrichtungen aber nicht""** ist, dass die Gemeinde intern sehr viel Zeit und Energie aufwendet, um die Mitglieder von der Wichtigkeit eben dieser, angeblich nicht vorhandenen, Missionierungsarbeit zu √ºberzeugen. Neben der Organisation von missionarischen Veranstaltungen, ist es n√§mlich die Hauptaufgabe der 'Shoba Tabligh' die Kontrolle und Dokumentierung der missionarischen Aktivit√§ten jedes einzelnen Mitglieds. √úber all diese Aktivit√§ten wird peinlichst genau buchgef√ºhrt und ein Bericht monatlich an die Zentrale gemeldet. Hier ist ein Auszug aus dem monatliches Berichtsformular der Gemeinde, in dem die missionarischen Aktivit√§ten der lokalen Gemeinde erfasst werden. [\[2\]](https://imgur.com/a/sXH8U2y)¬†

F√ºr die Gemeinde werden sogenannte 'interreligi√∂se Dialoge', 'Tag der Religionsstifter', Flyer-Verteilungsaktionen und Buchverteilungen als Teil dieser Missionierungsarbeit angesehen. Die Personen, die sich im Besonderen um Missionierung bem√ºhen, werden als 'Daiyan e ilallah' (arab. f√ºr ""Jemand, der zu Allah aufruft"") erfasst. Jedes Gemeindemitglied wird **monatlich** gefragt, wie viele Personen er 'unter Tabligh' hat d.h. aktiv missioniert. Es werden auch die **monatlichen Baits** (arab. f√ºr 'Konvertierungen') dokumentiert. Meist gibt es von der Zentrale oder dem Khalifen Vorgaben, heruntergebrochen auf die einzelnen lokalen Gemeinden und Personen, wie viele Flyer in einem bestimmten Zeitraum zu verteilen sind, wie viele Personen 'unter Tabligh' man haben sollte, wie viele Konvertierungen erwartet werden usw.¬† Zu all diesen Dingen werden neben der Zusammenfassung auch ausf√ºhrliche und individualisierte Berichte verfasst.¬†

Einige von uns waren **jahrelang Teil des sehr komplexen missionarischen Systems der Ahmadiyya** und es macht uns fassungslos, wie sehr die Au√üendarstellung von den intern gepredigten Dogmen abweicht. Wir erkennen an, dass f√ºr die Ahmadiyya diese Missionsarbeit nur mit friedlichen Mitteln erfolgen soll. Der Kritikpunkt hier ist nicht, dass wir der Gemeinde Gewalt oder Zwangskonvertierungen unterstellen. Was wir aber als unzul√§ssig und kritikw√ºrdig erachten, ist die Verleugnung der intern klar formulierten Zielsetzungen. Vertrauensbildung und der Abbau von √Ñngsten kann nicht funktionieren, wenn man nicht ehrlich zueinander ist. Die bewusste Verschleierung der echten Motive, die Diskrepanz der t√§glichen Erfahrung in der Gemeinde und der Au√üendarstellung durch Falschbehauptungen, ist, was Misstrauen s√§t, und die Personen, die die Gemeinde nach au√üen hin vertreten, unglaubw√ºrdig macht. **Zu oft, finden wir, werden die real existierenden Probleme in der Gemeinde nur verschleiert und in der Au√üendarstellung besch√∂nigt. Die problematischen Aspekte sollten nicht nur mit PR-Parolen √ºberdeckt werden, sondern sich der √∂ffentlichen Kritik stellen und aufgearbeitet werden. Wir hoffen mit** [**diesem Forum**](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam_ahmadiyya_de/) **einen Beitrag dazu zu leisten**.

**Wir erlebt Ihr die Missionierungskultur in der Ahmadiyya? Kommentiert und postet gerne Eure Erfahrungen und Gedanken :)**

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to ask the community: how would you *manually* root a device? The reason I ask is I am looking to intern for a big N company and their push at the moment is android-based devices in the industrial world. My task specifically is based around the security of these devices. They extended me an offer to ""attack"" what they currently have and what they are planning on implementing. That being said, how would you go about this?

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have details on whether a direct adb connection can be used. I did mention to them that I have created malicious apps before (never handed out, only for learning) and they said they have signature verification so unknown apps could not be installed. Their focus is the integrity of the wireless communication. There will be a range of android versions used.

&amp;#x200B;

The challenge is as open and vague as that. Essentially attack these any way possible but their biggest concern is wireless. How would you guys go about this?"

Recently, I got my first full time job in IT and with it, I should be able to fix my debt and 2-month late payments. On the first day of being full time I made a thread asking for help about a piece of equipment. I had only one reply which was a guy telling me i'm wrong working for the company I do.

While there's nothing illegal or necessarily wrong with the company and it really isn't that bad compared to some larger conglomerates I can understand why he was upset. I tried explaining that I'm just a student intern who just started and i'm trying to get a fix for a problem while our head IT guy was busy with another problem, he started calling me incompetent and bashed our IT team, went through my post history to try and find my location, so naturally I deleted everything here I am. 

I've never been diagnosed with an anxiety order but my Fiance swears that I need to go see someone, I just found this subreddit while setting up my new account so I'll probably stick around.

ao6wx6,2,2019-02-07,AITA For Canceling Weekly Plans,LadyCashier,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ao6wx6/aita_for_canceling_weekly_plans/,"This post may have a bit of backstory Ill leave a TL:DR. 

My boyfriend(22M) well call J and I(21F) had weekly dungeons and dragons plans with 3 other people S(23f), P(21M), and M(19M).  They had been at M's house as hes the DM (Dungeon Master aka person who runs the game for the uninitiated). 

Our problem lies with S and P being late constantly or canceling. They are a couple and one of them always has a reason for being late. My boyfriend and I work difficult, early morning, shifts. Mine starts at 4am and his 6am. Dnd should start at 5pm Because of their lateness we either have to end it early or my boyfriend and I go to work very tired. 

They were made well aware of our schedule when they proposed d&amp;d to us and they agreed to accept it. S has no job but is in school, we changed the day of d&amp;d to fit her new schedule in an attempt to limit cancellations. 

Nothing helped, she continued to plan things for the new d&amp;d day and expect us and the dm to move our schedules and accommodate. 

One day it was going out to dinner with the parents she lives with, at 5pm and only telling us as we were pulling up to the Dms house. She didnt start heading over to his house untill 8:30 at which time we already had to leave because we only stick around till 10 or so at the latest and full sessions take longer than 2 hours. Other times her boyfriend was at the gym or she was doing ***extra*** credit for school.

 One time they left half way through to say goodbye to a friend that was graduating. We thought ""no big deal its right down the street itll take 5 minutes"" WRONG! They sat through an entire college graduation and hung out with their friend. They returned 3 hours later and we barely got anything done.

When she is there, shes too busy talking on her phone, texting, being on facebook, taking selfies. She hardly roleplays and doesnt seem to get anything thats going on.

We tried talking to her personally about her time wasting and we tried talking to the DM and her boyfriend but they look at us like were assholes for suggesting maybe shes not really that into d&amp;d.

After literally like 4 months of this my boyfriend and I had enough and I texted all of them. I told each person that I didnt think D&amp;D was working and we didnt want to continue I tried to remain as polite as possible stating my reasons. I told them it was no longer fun, it was becoming stressful and wearing on our sleep, we were tired of the constant cancellations ect. I made sure to relay that in no way did I mean anything mean by this and that we really wish to remain friends with them. Apparently that was a huge mistake.

S went apeshit on me. She sent me a 5 paragraph essay on how hurt she was and how I was being such a bitch for ""rage quitting"" she called me a colossal hypocrite and said I canceled d&amp;d almost as much.

 Spoiler alert, I have never called it off ever. I have told her when it would be impossible for us to fit into her new schedule when she switches things around. I have told her when her actions will mean no d&amp;d but I have never cancled because of my own life, neither has my boyfriend who showed up even though he had a massively painful double ear infection. She then tried to claim I was ay fault for almost, but not actually, canceling D&amp;D because my 10 year old cat was deathly ill and I needed the first available appointment, which ended up being the next day and not even on D&amp;D day.

She said I must be on my phone as much as her because I used her charger once to chsrge my phone, I arrived with my phone on 10% and needed it to not die. Yes I do use my phone occasionally but the difference is, I am paying attention to the game.  She doesnt even know its her turn till you scream at her and she plays two characters.

She made it clear her first intention was to not even respond at all to my text, very mature, but that she had too many issues with me. 

All in all it looks like we lost the DM, S and P as friends forever as they made sure to point out that their ""trust is broken"" and they ""are very dissappinted in me""

Honestly it feels like a relief to be done with it all but at the same time I cant help wondering if I was right so I leave myself at your mercy. 

TL:DR My ""friends"" were habitually late and had no real regard for my bf and I's schedule. We brought up our concerns and stated wed rather be friends than continue arguing about D&amp;D so we were pulling out of it. They intern ended our friendship and are ""very dissapointed""

&gt; I have submitted the wrong links to the right people and right links to the wrong people (My boss assumed I was giving him work that I should have given to my co-workers). I apologize and worked with my team to figure who should get to review the work before we send it to my boss

&gt; My Email are sometimes filled with incorrect into (Example: Saying that a link goes to Video X when it goes to Video Y). As result I've tried to slow down, read backwards, and other methods.

&gt; My biggest mess up yet was an assignment requiring that I post a few words and a link to a Company Announcement on Social Media, and Guess what? I included the words but failed to include the link to a Company Announcement and my boss caught it.  Even though I put the link back into our social media posts, I don‚Äôt even think I can talk to my boss and say sorry after this.  I feel like I have messed up so much already in this short period of time, saying sorry is really meaningless

I only assume this is happening because I have heard that after six months jobs feel like a grind - That and this month has been really hard for me in terms of emotional stability, family stability, and academics.  The problem is if I leave this internship now with a bad impression, this may mean I won‚Äôt be able to find a good job, even if I finish my master‚Äôs in policy studies and have to work in someplace like a warehouse or retail.

Though they don‚Äôt say it or show it, I keep worrying that my bosses are thinking about firing me, after seeing how much I‚Äôve messed up and been hasty. Thus, I have discretely signed up for job alerts on LinkedIn and elsewhere in hopes another good job comes my way should I be fired.  But I really need to know what I should do to leave a better impression on my bosses, weather I stay the company or choose to leave it.

Update: Thank you everyone for giving me some good advice;  I wish I could respond to all of you but I'm going to be busy with work and school for bit; I hope the advice given here also helps out others who need it

First of, let me just say , I love this game! It have given me sooo many hours good game play. Something I certainly didn't think would stretch as far, as me soon hitting lvl 20. Its really great! My plan is to keep playing and grinding, and contribute how ever I can with cards, helping players and discussing here on reddit.

With that said, I need to be honest. I have a lot om my plate right now with a tough study, and proving that my intern job should become a real employment in the end. I need to put that first, and cannot promise anything about pulling any weight with keeping count on active players, bottlecaps, votes ect. I would love to, but thats just how it is...

I will still keep being an active player, and try to come in here as often I can, and contribute to the team. It will, but at various paces, and if I someday cant make an event, war ect. I will write in the in game chat, and try to do the same here.

ao95sb,2,2019-02-07,I have to choose between my SO and a job...,HeartInOsaka,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ao95sb/i_have_to_choose_between_my_so_and_a_job/,"TL;DR: I was offered an internship in my country that pays a lot of money, but I was originally planning on doing one in his country, for no money. Help.

Since we parted last summer, I [F25] had been planning on coming back to Japan for an internship and to live with my SO [M25]. I'm a computer science major. I found a company that finds internships for international students. I pay them for the service, which includes a business training class on Japanese business customs. I'll work for 8 weeks, probably stay in Japan a little longer than that and travel, relax. 

The pros of going there are: spending almost 3 months with my SO is great to get to know each other better, and see how it is together for longer periods of time. Not only by being with him, but by being in Japan.  I'll get trained in business customs, make business connections, and 3 months of speaking practice while I'm there. I'll also have a tech job, so I'll be getting that learning experience as well. I've dreamt of leaving the US since like high school; I have many reasons not to like it here, and this feels like something I need to do to reach that goal.

The pros of staying here are: money. Like I could pay off all my loans (which aren't too bad). I'm also sure I'll have a great learning experience at this company. The position starts after my school ends, so I could even visit him for up to 4 weeks, but I'd just be chilling rather than living. This was my dream company before I went to Japan, fell in love with Japan, and met my SO. 

Neither option will have a significantly negative impact on my career, but I do have a feeling (and have read online) that interning at a Japanese company can greatly help my chances of getting a job there. 

My heart wants to say fuck it and just go to Japan as planned, but the amount of money is making me think it's a dumb mistake. But it's only a 3 month internship! It's not a long term thing. Ugh idk. 

My SO has been a little negative lately regarding me working in Japan. The working culture there is notoriously bad but I was hoping to find a more western-style tech company, but regardless there seem to suddenly be many obstacles to overcome despite nothing having changed. Last night we were talking about it and I feel like we almost broke up. We're so great together and he makes me so happy, and I feel like I doofus if I let money come between us.

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice you may have. "
ao96cd,1,2019-02-07,7 months of long distance?,alwayssunny26,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ao96cd/7_months_of_long_distance/,"So myself (21F) and my boyfriend (21M) are in a pickle.

Right now we are going through a rough patch and we considered breaking up, but we love each other a lot and wanna try to work it out. But I‚Äôm worried that with the 7 month stretch of long distance on top of existing problems will be too much. Plus I‚Äôll be starting a new job/basically a new life.

While working there I started working on my BS degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. If I continue going to college I will be able to graduate in a year but I was planning to continue my math studies by remaining at my university until I also completed a degree in Math, but now I'm not sure what to do. 

My problem is I want to at least finish my CS degree, but I need a job to continue paying for my living and college expenses. I have had really good job offers in the past but always turned them down because they did not have the flexible hours needed to attend college. I could get a job as a full time developer now and drop out of college. Or I could get a job as an intern that has flexible hours and doesn't pay as well and would likely cause me to need student loans but allow me to complete, at least, my CS degree.

I live in the US and It has been a dream of mine to one day complete a PHD in Mathematics which is why I was kind planning on remaining in college until I also completed a math degree. Also if moving to a country where education is cheaper is a valid option to peruse higher education then I would do it in a heartbeat.

I mostly want to know what my options are. Does anyone have any advice on what they think I should do? I will add that I wasn't just attending college for the degree to get a job. I was also attending because I genuinely love Math and CS and intend to study them regardless of whether or not it's in a formal setting such as a university."
ao9gve,1,2019-02-07,Me (27M) and my girlfriend (22F) thinking of ending semi-long distance relationship by moving in together.,ConflictGK,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ao9gve/me_27m_and_my_girlfriend_22f_thinking_of_ending/,"I've been into a quite satisfactory but also new relationship (5 months) with my girlfriend who lives in another city.  Yet it's been a wonderful relationship and we match like 80% in personalities, beliefs, values etc. Until now we've been visiting each other in turns when possible, like once in a month. Mostly she was the one visiting because I'm working while she's still in college and has more free time.

When we are apart I do miss her quite a lot and I think the feelings are mutual. The thing is she is about to start and internship for 6 months and she's willing to move in to my city to do it. Of course, the only chance for her to move to my city is if she moves in together with me. We haven't talked about it yet but indirectly she made her intentions clear to me. In few days she will be visiting again and the conversation will be on the table.

What scares me is letting her down in case I'm not willing to do it, and also the fact that we'll be seeing each other quite less since, due to her internship, she won't be having so much time off. I'm afraid this will eventually hurt the relationship. Personally, I haven't stayed together with any of my previous relationships and I'm not sure if I'm ready for something like this.  I value my space quite a lot and I don't want to feel overwhelmed by living together with someone else. However, I guess I will never know if it's the correct time without trying it. She's a wonderful person and I'm quite attached to her even if we are not together for very long. 

Last but not least, I've moved to this city recently, for work reasons, and I'm feeling quite lonely since I don't have many friends yet. So, I'm seeing this also as an opportunity for company and for investing my excitement to explore this place with someone I like.

I've been trying to act professional since I came from a start up that was very relaxed. I try not to talk a lot as most people aren't very social. I am an extremely social person so I've felt a little awkward at work sometimes. The other interns and I are all in the same room and don't talk a ton. One guy is very quiet and I felt like maybe he didn't feel comfortable around us since we are all girls. We finally we're all talking as a group today just about hobbies and what we do in our free time. I was finally relaxing a little around my coworkers. The guy was talking about how he loves hunting and guns and goes every summer hunting deer and elk. I said something along the lines of ""oh that's cool, I've never been hunting, but do you like to go shooting like do you have a concealed carry permit or anything?"" I got a look of discust from him and another girl said that I was really insensitive and it was really in appropriate to ask that. I said I was sorry and I didn't realize that was not okay. They then went off on how he could have a gun at work right now and that's like I was asking if he was carrying right now. I said I didn't mean it that way I was just trying to make conversation. He seemed really ticked off and the other girl was like yeah that's something super personal like asking someone's salary. You never share that info. I feel like an idiot and I really wasn't trying to pry into their personal lives. I was just trying to make friends. I've had people ask me if I have a permit and I've head people talk about that kind of stuff at other jobs before.  Was I an asshole?"

5'11"" short brown hair spiked up in front light brown eyes, average body build with mild-moderate muscle tone. 

Looking for long-term RP. My main style of RP is romance based erotica that has plot and build up, going right into it ruins the anticipation and tension behind the big scenes, I enjoy a lot of flirtatious vibes and a lot of close encounters that are either ultimately stopped due to either interruptions or other events in our characters world delaying the smut scenes. 

***Bonus for females who can switch to play Dom and Sub***

Ideas:

A romance of a young CEO who's inherited his fathers company early due to family death. You play the young female intern. The CEO falls for the young intern but wont say anything due to his current status, and she wont say anything due to her being the new intern.


A post-apocalyptic RP where the US has come under some sort of attack and we are forced to survive together to make ends meet on day to day life. How we meet and our backstories can he discussed later on.


The US is taken over by Russia, and we are forced into battle together as secret operatives on an assassination mission against the current Russian leader. 

You're a famous woman. For what we can discuss later. I'm your bodyguard and have been for about a year bow, weve talked on and off but only on base level. Alme sort of event happens and you end up taking an interest in my character. 


You've ran away from home and ended up in California. I'm a rookie Police Officer who finds you wandering a bad part of town, after a short discussion I offer to help you get on your feet. (Will elaborate the direction of story through kik) 



I'm very open to others ideas, so long as there are realistic rules. Not big into fantasy and Sci-Fi, etc.

I am having a very tough decision on which school I should go to.

Ryerson on the other hand I hate the location of the school and it‚Äôs commute, but I heard rye btm co-ops are amazing but the program itself does not dive deeply into are business or IT. 

Looking at Mac, I would take business 1 and take certain classes to receive the certificate in BTM. Rather than a coop, there is a 12-16 month internship. I have also heard that business 1 is very lacklustre as a business program, and the internships are very competitive. 

What school would you think would be better for BTM?

And as my mark stands, what are my chances of getting in?

ENG4U (English) - 75%

ICS4U (computer science) - 91%

BBM4M (international business) - 95%

IDC4U (interdisciplinary studies: Automotive Engineering) - 85%

MHF4U (Advanced Functions) - 76% (retaking in night school)

And courses I have this semester are:

BOH4M (Business Organizational Studies - predicted 90%

MCV4U (Calculus) - predicted 85

HZT4U (Philosophy) - predicted 85-90

aocje2,4,2019-02-07,Might be a repeat question... but what should I be on the lookout for/doing for my desired roles in career?,iProfessorDoom,SecurityCareerAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/aocje2/might_be_a_repeat_question_but_what_should_i_be/,"Hi everyone,

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Math just this Dec. 2018. Now, I am working on my Information Security and Assurance Master's program with an expected graduation date of Dec. 2020.

I got my Security+ certification in January 2019 and I am currently studying for my CySA+ (Cyber Security Analyst) certification. Hope to take the test by end of April.

Other than school, work, and studying for certifications, I have been actively applying for a wide range of InfoSec summer internships. I actually have a couple of interviews in the next two weeks (one of them is with Facebook as a Security Engineer but I am not too confident I will get it because the interviews are going to be coding heavy. I can code but its not something I enjoy. I always learned what I needed to and nothing more in my coding/algorithms classes. So, I am not very strong at solving coding challenges very quickly. But, I will try my best to prepare for it and give it my best.) 

My desired career roles after graduating with my master's is either Security Analyst, Cyber Risk Auditor, or Security Consultant. My hope is to move up to higher management in my security role (so I will definitely be preparing to take the CISSP test.)

So my questions are, what advice can you guys give so I can achieve my desired career goals? Is there anything particular I should be doing RIGHT NOW or in the future as I finish up my studies? and Any other tips I can get from current InfoSec. professionals that will help me achieve my career goals?

Oliver's internship was six weeks, and it seems like Elio and Oliver didn't have their midnight tryst until somewhat late -- like maybe after a month of Oliver being there. I'm wondering because it seems like they got together and the next thing you know Oliver had to leave. The ""we wasted so many days"" comment also sounds like Elio was lamenting the fact that they spent more time apart than together.

Also, I noticed that their midnight tryst and the peach scene occurred one day after the other. Then, they were in Bergamo and that was that. Thoughts on the timeline?"

**Teresa is a secret agent who plotted her own fake death to frame SA.**
&gt;A full year after graduating Summa Cum Laude from UWGB with the world at your feet, in 2003 you start a photography job taking pics of toddlers at Pearce Photography.
A year later, on 10/08/2004, you start a second job driving around neighboring counties taking pictures of cars, even unbeknownst meeting another Autotrader photographer who secretly was an undercover DoJ special agent and who was previously visiting your customers. 
3 years after graduation on 09/27/05, a month before your disappearance, you finally start your own website.
That website supported the narrative of you as an independent photographer and conveniently served as a memorial to your work, after you disappeared, to show what a talented photographer you were.
&gt;&gt;The whole job at AT smells of a set up... so here you've been living in GreenBay living on your own apartment things are going good so everyone, says on your own 3 years working in your own shared studio.What really bothers me is Tom P never mentioned details in this sharing space. Did Teresa pay Tom anything was he just doing this for her free of charge. He never spoke about this girl who worked with him at least 3 plus years because she was an intern while in college. So in essence she had people come in took cash and gave Tom what? No sheared expenses, I'd sure like a look at her check book and every credit card she had...something just doesn't fit. Where's the W2's
&gt;&gt;&gt;I know a lot of photographers, mostly just wedding photographers and not one of them has a 4 year uni degree. Years ago I did a photography course at Sydney Uni and several from my class became professional photographers. It was an 18 week course. Another friend became a pro photographer at 18 years of age. My point is, why was a 25yr old with a 4yr uni degree working for AT.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Had to google that 'W2'. Good question!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If anyone can't see she was more then the average student grad... you have blinders on...The opioid epidemic needed brave, smart people to infiltrate the network...Crime Investigation 101... there are no coincidences. Not to mention..she is a spittin image of Sheriff Pagel.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I still think it is possible that TH was a special agent. There, I said it!

**Teresa enlisted the help of her friends and family to frame SA. The Halbachs gave LE pieces of Teresa's dirty clothing to help lure search dogs to SA's trailer**
&gt;KZ asked ""what in the world was Teresa doing over their"" In MAM2
My bet is either Ryan or Mike were helping her because the dogs wouldn't know to track another person only Teresa but one was with her and exited on Q road. Just as the dogs show she did...
Remember all the Ryan dropped calls üòõ Teresa already gave up her phone to LE to plant. .
The little miss isn't dead just like I've said for years... let it catch up follow the map follow the dogs follow the call that was omitted from the CASO.
&gt;&gt;However this is after she is reported missing by Mom... very risky for her to be involved... and be seen.
Is it possible Mike and Ryan, are acting like Hansel and Gretel, and dragging a piece of TH dirty clothes to help searchers lead the scent to the SUV..on Avery Property.
It's also possible BoD did kill TH down at Kuss Rd and some item of clothing is being dragged by a coyote or racoon, in a hap hazard manner.. If the LE wasn't so hell bent on Marking a Murderer we would have the truth .
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm believing it was Carmen's bones just a little shell game with Sherry and boom LE had what the needed to appear to look like it was Teresa.
My question still remains who killed CB because I think it was to convenient.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Teresa's estate was taken over in Sept 05 by Tim, her brother, there's only 2 solutions, She was dying of an illness or planning to disappear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If TH is dead, God rest her soul with the truth of who did this to her...if she is alive she needs to save her soul and come forward and set two men free who deserve better.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Omg, if she is found alive, her and her family will be THE most hated people on face of the Earth. Time WILL tell.... I‚Äôm wit cha BOOTY!!

**Even the defense is in on the conspiracy...from the future**
&gt;Absolutely, they controlled the narrative. Every aspect of it. It just needed to appear that way. JB and Drizin are complicit. I have proof. Still working on DS and he isn't looking much better
&gt;&gt;If KZ knew she was alive and could produce TH it would be instant exoneration i would think

**Bobby Dassey is the son of Gregory Allen (still not sure what this means or proves)**
&gt;I put a post up recently about the obvious differences between SA description and GA and thought that GA had a distinctive look.
I thought that Gregory reminds me of someone, then when I have a looked at Bobby I realised it was him Gregory reminded me of,
There eyes slope down the way, and with both of them the right eye is is slightly more open than the left,

This is a bordering on unhealthy. The way that these people enable each other is truly bizarre. I can't get past how much time they spend romanticizing a guy who abuses people for recreation.. They couldn't champion a nobler cause? Criminal justice system reform maybe? Helping an actual wrongfully convicted person or at least someone who doesn't hurt everyone he comes into contact with? Someone who doesn't have more evidence against him than probably any other rightfully convicted person in history. Someone who has contributed something positive to society. They all sit around and moan about how Dolores and Allen won't get to see Steven get released before they die. So fuckin what? Steven treats his parents like shit anyway. The purpose in life now consist of trying to free a violent felon from prison. Their families must be so proud."

Mai exact, sunt unul din cei patru useristi (alƒÉturi de Dan Barna, Elek Levente si Cristian Seidler) care au participat la partea formalƒÉ »ôi oficialƒÉ a acestui proces √Æn integralitate pe parcursul celor circa zece luni c√¢t a durat. Proces care, √Æn ultima sa lunƒÉ, a devenit foarte intens »ôi a consumat o grƒÉmadƒÉ de timp, neuroni »ôi emo»õie. »òi fiindcƒÉ subiectul alian»õei a fost (»ôi e √ÆncƒÉ, »ôi probabil va mai fi) amplu dezbƒÉtut, »ôi fiindcƒÉ indiferent cƒÉ vƒÉ uita»õi la alian»õƒÉ ca o reu»ôitƒÉ sau un e»ôec de negociere (»ôi pƒÉrerile sunt larg √ÆmpƒÉr»õite) eu ca negociator port o responsabilitate directƒÉ pentru ce a ie»ôit, simt nevoia sƒÉ vƒÉ prezint »ôi perspectiva mea personalƒÉ pe subiect. Cu, sper eu, echilibrul cu care-mi place sƒÉ cred cƒÉ v-am obi»ônuit, dar »ôi o parte (at√¢t c√¢t e posibil) din insight-ul unuia care a fost parte directƒÉ din proces.

»òi vƒÉ voi spune din capul locului c√¢teva lucruri. Unu, cƒÉ alian»õa asta are poten»õialul de a fi startul celei mai ample transformƒÉri a peisajului politic rom√¢nesc din ultimii douƒÉzeci de ani »ôi de departe cea mai bunƒÉ »ôansƒÉ a Rom√¢niei de a ie»ôi din fundƒÉtura √Æn care ne gƒÉsim. Doi, cƒÉ acest poten»õial nu este nici pe departe garantat »ôi cƒÉ lupta pentru a-l realiza cu adevƒÉrat a √Ænceput de ceva vreme »ôi va dura. Trei, cƒÉ na»ôterea ei trebuie privita simultan at√¢t prin prisma contextului societal absolut special √Æn care s-a produs c√¢t »ôi prin prisma logicii unei negocieri pur politice. »òi cƒÉ orice tentativƒÉ de a privi povestea exclusiv prin una dintre cele douƒÉ lentile va produce o distorsiune semnificativƒÉ care nu ajutƒÉ cu adevƒÉrat pe nimeni √Æn afarƒÉ de cei care pescuiesc natural √Æn apele dezinformƒÉrii »ôi manipulƒÉrii.

Acestea fiind exprimate o sa trec direct la subiect. Contextul societal absolut special de care vorbesc are douƒÉ jumƒÉtƒÉ»õi egal de importante: pe de o parte starea de cangrena generalizatƒÉ √Æn care coali»õia PSD-ALDE sub conducerea lui Dragnea a adus cea mai mare parte a institu»õiilor statului rom√¢n. Si pe de altƒÉ parte nevoia disperatƒÉ a societƒÉ»õii rom√¢ne»ôti de a-»ôi gƒÉsi resurse de speran»õƒÉ »ôi motiva»õie de luptƒÉ √Æn fa»õa a ceea ce este cel mai brutal atac asupra ei de la mineriadele de ani ‚Äò90 √Æncoace. Acest context a creat o presiune semnificativƒÉ pe negocieri, preferin»õa unei largi pƒÉr»õi ale electoratului reformist fa»õƒÉ de alian»õƒÉ fiind o constantƒÉ legitimƒÉ a procesului. Peste aceste elemente s-a suprapus, spre sf√¢r»ôitul lui ianuarie, √ÆncƒÉ un element decisiv de context, de data asta pur politic: decizia pre»ôedintelui Iohannis de a nu promulga ci a trimite cƒÉtre CCR proiectul de lege 427/2018 privind legisla»õia electoralƒÉ a presurizat »ôi mai tare spa»õiul de negociere. Sesizarea cƒÉtre CCR a consfin»õit desfƒÉ»ôurarea europarlamentarelor pe legea veche, unde un om nu poate semna dec√¢t o singurƒÉ listƒÉ de sus»õinere »ôi unde doar partidele ce au deja europarlamentari vor fi automat reprezentate √Æn sec»õiile de vot.

LƒÉs√¢nd √ÆnsƒÉ detaliile de context la o parte, »ôi trec√¢nd la partea pur politicƒÉ, un lucru trebuie spus cinstit »ôi clar: oricum l-am √Ænv√¢rti, acordul final privind alian»õa nu poate fi considerat vreun mare »ôi grozav succes de negociere politicƒÉ din perspectiva USR-ului. Realizarea alian»õei este cu siguran»õƒÉ ceea ce o mare majoritate a electoratului nostru comun √Æ»ôi dorea iar nevoia unui front comun »ôi a unei alternative dƒÉtƒÉtoare de speran»õƒÉ este indiscutabilƒÉ. √énsƒÉ strict politic vorbind, un acord construit pe cvasi-paritate √Æntre douƒÉ organiza»õii care pe o majoritate a metricelor cuantificabile nu sunt nici pe departe egale, nu poate fi prezentat cinstit ca vreun mare succes de negociere. Pentru cƒÉ sƒÉ fim c√¢t se poate de sinceri: PLUS-ul este o t√¢nƒÉrƒÉ organiza»õie absolut remarcabilƒÉ, cu un leadership recunoscut »ôi apreciat »ôi care a atras o cantitate √ÆmbucurƒÉtoare de speciali»ôti rom√¢ni din »õarƒÉ »ôi strƒÉinƒÉtate. √énsƒÉ nu are nici experien»õa politicƒÉ »ôi parlamentarƒÉ a USR-ului, nici capacitatea noastrƒÉ organiza»õionalƒÉ »ôi logistica doveditƒÉ, nici rezilien»õa pe care noi ne-am c√¢»ôtigat-o √Æn numeroase bƒÉtƒÉlii interne »ôi externe, nici combina»õia noastrƒÉ de resurse umane, administrative »ôi financiare predictibile.

Pe scurt spus USR-ul este o for»õƒÉ politicƒÉ doveditƒÉ √Æn timp ce PLUS este o for»õƒÉ politicƒÉ de mare perspectiva dar √ÆncƒÉ nevalidata. Iar acest fapt este reflectat »ôi de diferen»õa actualƒÉ dintre ele √Æn majoritatea sondajelor privind inten»õia de vot. »òi pentru cƒÉ orice rela»õie pe termen lung are nevoie de o funda»õie de √Æncredere, »ôi pentru cƒÉ √Æncrederea nu se poate construi fƒÉrƒÉ obi»ônuin»õa de a spune adevƒÉruri, cred ca acest adevƒÉr trebuie spus »ôi asumat pentru a realiza poten»õialul de care vorbeam mai devreme.

A»ôa cƒÉ merg mai departe »ôi spun urmƒÉtoarele: useristii in buna mƒÉsura »ôi-au asumat importan»õa momentului »ôi au acceptat aceastƒÉ asimetrie √Æn virtutea binelui comun mai larg. Si ar fi fƒÉcut-o √Æn propor»õie √ÆncƒÉ »ôi mai mare dacƒÉ √Æntreg procesul de negociere »ôi coregrafia politicƒÉ din jurul unui astfel de moment ar fi respectat √Æn integralitate principiile »ôi valorile fondatoare ale USR-ului. √énsƒÉ acest lucru nu s-a √Ænt√¢mplat iar golul de √Æncredere lƒÉsat de aceste lipsuri riscƒÉ sƒÉ rƒÉm√¢nƒÉ acolo »ôi sƒÉ erodeze pe termen lung poten»õialul dacƒÉ nu este adresat corespunzƒÉtor √Æn lunile care vor urma.

Pentru cƒÉ, vede»õi dumneavoastrƒÉ, un alt adevƒÉr care trebuie spus »ôi asumat este urmƒÉtorul: cƒÉ de»ôi USR »ôi PLUS au cu siguran»õƒÉ un ADN comun, filozofiile noastre organiza»õionale »ôi modul de func»õionare sunt, deocamdatƒÉ, fundamental diferite. USR-ul este o democra»õie gƒÉlƒÉgioasƒÉ, cu toate dezavantajele de rigoare, dar ne√Ændoielnic rezilienta »ôi vibrantƒÉ. PLUS-ul pe de altƒÉ parte, »ôi p√¢nƒÉ la o realƒÉ probƒÉ contrarie, este o monarhie, rƒÉm√¢ne de vƒÉzut c√¢t de constitu»õionalƒÉ sau de absolutƒÉ. USR-ul rƒÉm√¢ne √ÆncƒÉ, √Æn mod fundamental, primul »ôi singurul partid rom√¢nesc post-decembrist controlat de jos √Æn sus de cƒÉtre membrii sƒÉi. PLUS-ul pe de altƒÉ parte, p√¢nƒÉ la o schimbare fundamentalƒÉ de statut, este un partid rom√¢nesc controlat de sus √Æn jos fƒÉrƒÉ echivoc de cƒÉtre liderul suprem. AceastƒÉ diferen»õƒÉ s-a vƒÉzut »ôi √Æn timpul negocierilor »ôi se va vedea »ôi √Æn continuare. Ea nu este insurmontabilƒÉ √ÆnsƒÉ conteazƒÉ mult pentru viitorul democra»õiei rom√¢ne»ôti dacƒÉ »ôi cum anume va fi reglatƒÉ.

√én plus, diferen»õa de mai sus are »ôi a avut »ôi alte implica»õii. Pe partea de masƒÉ a PLUS-ului √Æn aceastƒÉ negociere au stat lideri, mai mult sau mai pu»õin formali »ôi oficiali, datƒÉ fiind v√¢rsta extrem de fragedƒÉ a organiza»õiei. Pe partea de masƒÉ a USR-ului √ÆnsƒÉ, au stat nu doar lideri, ci totodatƒÉ institu»õii interne ale partidului. Mai exact trei institu»õii interne menite sƒÉ se completeze dar »ôi sƒÉ se balanseze: Pre»ôedin»õia, Biroul Na»õional »ôi Comitetul Politic. Ce a ie»ôit din jocul ƒÉsta e mai pu»õin relevant acum pentru public »ôi o chestiune care s-a discutat »ôi se va mai discuta intern. Ce este, cred eu, relevant e urmƒÉtorul lucru: a»ôa cum existƒÉ oameni √Æn PLUS care se uitƒÉ admirativ la democra»õia USR-ului, existƒÉ »ôi oameni la v√¢rful USR-ului care se uitƒÉ √ÆngrijorƒÉtor de admirativ la monarhia PLUS-ului.

»òi aceste aspecte mƒÉ duc de fapt la ultimele detalii pe care a»ô vrea sƒÉ le subliniez √Æn aceastƒÉ lungƒÉ postare. E c√¢t se poate de limpede cƒÉ succesul colaborƒÉrii pe termen lung dintre USR »ôi PLUS este absolut vital pentru scoaterea Rom√¢niei din actuala fundƒÉturƒÉ »ôi rea»ôezarea ei pe »ôina integrƒÉrii definitive »ôi irevocabile √Æn Occident. E de asemenea c√¢t se poate de limpede cƒÉ situa»õia curentƒÉ √Æn Romania e at√¢t de gravƒÉ √Ænc√¢t timpul pentru nuan»õe »ôi reglaje de fine»õe este foarte limitat. Si de aceea un succes electoral rapid »ôi de impact √Æmpotriva PSD-ului este necesar iar eu am convingerea cƒÉ alian»õa USR PLUS √Æl va ob»õine. Spun public »ôi aici cƒÉ din punctul meu de vedere 25% este scorul minim pe care aceasta alian»õƒÉ trebuie sƒÉ √Æl »õinteascƒÉ la europarlamentare »ôi am convingerea cƒÉ o sƒÉ o facƒÉ. Eram cota»õi cumulativ dar merg√¢nd separat la 20% √Æn multiple sondaje iar premiza de pornire a alian»õei a fost cƒÉ √ÆmpreunƒÉ putem ob»õine mai mult dec√¢t separat.

√énsƒÉ totodatƒÉ cred cƒÉ este poate chiar mai important de notat √ÆncƒÉ un lucru. Obiectivul principal al colaborƒÉrii pe termen lung dintre USR »ôi PLUS este nu doar na»ôterea for»õei care sƒÉ batƒÉ PSD-ul ci mai ales a for»õei care sƒÉ producƒÉ √Æn sf√¢r»ôit schimbarea aceea profundƒÉ »ôi irevocabilƒÉ pe care o a»ôteptƒÉm de aproape trei decenii. Iar o astfel de schimbare nu se va produce dec√¢t duc√¢nd bƒÉtƒÉlia √Æn mod fundamental diferit de cum am tot dus-o »ôi pierdut-o √Æn ultimii treizeci de ani. Schimbarea aceea nu se poate produce dec√¢t cu partide fundamental diferite de toate celelalte din ultimii treizeci de ani. Cu organiza»õii conduse de jos √Æn sus »ôi controlate direct de membri. Cu inteligen»õa »ôi energia colectivƒÉ a zeci de mii de oameni care cred √Æn rolul lor individual »ôi √Æ»ôi asumƒÉ drepturile »ôi obliga»õiile ce vin la pachet cu libertatea asumatƒÉ cu adevƒÉrat. Liderii sunt importan»õi, dar fƒÉrƒÉ institu»õii »ôi fƒÉrƒÉ control permanent de jos √Æn sus democra»õiile pierd tot timpul bƒÉtƒÉlia »ôi sf√¢r»ôesc dictaturi. Ca sƒÉ finalizam tranzi»õia va trebui sƒÉ √Ænvingem nu doar PSD-ul ci mai ales pesedismul, vorba unui foarte bun prieten. Pentru cƒÉ pesedismul este forma particularƒÉ de feudalism √Æn care suntem bloca»õi, dar pentru a ajunge √Æn modernitate va trebui sƒÉ abandonƒÉm feudalismul sub orice formƒÉ a sa.

√énchei mul»õumindu-vƒÉ cƒÉ a»õi avut rƒÉbdare sƒÉ citi»õi at√¢ta amar de text. E greu sƒÉ sintetizez luni de muncƒÉ √Æn c√¢teva paragrafe. Pentru mine unul aceastƒÉ experien»õƒÉ a fost una dintre cele mai bogate ale ultimilor doi ani jumate, ani oricum incredibil de inten»ôi. Am bucuria faptului cƒÉ prin alian»õa USR PLUS creƒÉm premizele for»õei unite care sƒÉ scape Rom√¢nia »ôi de PSD dar mai ales de pesedism. Am orgoliul faptului cƒÉ mi-am jucat rolul √Æncredin»õat mie de USR √Æn acest proces cu deplinƒÉ integritate fa»õƒÉ de organiza»õie »ôi √Æn linie cu valorile mele fundamentale de institu»õionalist convins »ôi democrat pur-s√¢nge.

I am currently doing my internship with the aim to set-up and eventually implement Customer Success. My starting point has been to do a lot of desk research on the topic as well as reading best practices from big corporations with effective Customer Success philosophies.

I have stumbled upon this group, and it seemed that the people here could give me a better idea on what i should focus on.

1. What are the things i should definitely know as someone who is new to CS?
2. Mistakes and pitfalls to avoid?
3. What are some tips i could use to include every department in the adaptation of CS?
4. Are there any specific CS metrics i should consider when the main product is aPaaS based?
5. Almost every piece of literature i‚Äôve found about CS focuses on SaaS. Are there any examples of successful CS implementation with a PaaS platform?

I would appreciate it if you could give me general tips, advice and maybe a nudge in the right direction as well."

I‚Äôve been working here a little less than a month. 

I moved across the country for this intern for 3 months.

I had a girlfriend back home, and that we are in this rocky area in our relationship. Some shit went on with her and she really needs me.

I decided that the potential consequences (of missing two days of work) is worth the relationship with her. 

So I bought a plane ticket to leave Wednesday night and be back Monday. Monday is a holiday so I would only miss Thursday-Friday.

All my managers and co workers seem very understanding and really nice.

I don‚Äôt think 2 days will have any real negative affect because I‚Äôm an intern, my project is going slow and this particular sprint of work is slow for me.

I don‚Äôt want to lie and say my grandpa died. But I don‚Äôt necessarily want to say I‚Äôm going back because my girlfriend needs me. 

I plan on putting 10 hour days prior to leaving to make up for said lack of work(even tho im an intern and there‚Äôs not much work to do anyway).

What‚Äôs something I can say that will make it seem justified that I should go home. But nothing that will later haunt me because I‚Äôm superstitious. "

I apologise for the wall or text.

My partner left me after nearly 4 years seemingly out of the blue. The first days were filled with anger and emotions I couldn't control, I failed to see the bigger picture. As time is going by though, I'm starting to realize what might be the cause of all this.

I'm afraid she burned out, not on our relationship specifically, but in general. You see we moved in with my parents pretty early in our relationship. We worked as hard as we could and bought a house a little over 1,5 years ago and started to build our life together. She desperately wanted to study and I fully supported that, though since there was little in the way of finances, we would have to rely on benefits from the government. In order to get these benefits she needed to work a minimum amount next to her studies since she is not a native to our current country of residence on paper.

This resulted in her working close to 60 or sometimes more hours without weekend days during internships which caused her a lot of stress. I grew up in an environment where everyone in my family continuously pushes themselves to the limit so I failed to see how hard the situation was on her. There is way more to this story but in order to keep it relatively short(ish) this should suffice the extend of the stress.

She left, at the time seemingly out of the blue, yes we were stressed and busy but our relationship always held up. As far as I know she quit school, is staying at friends and looking for another place to stay.

I want to support her, I really do. If this is what I think it might be then there is still hope for us in the long run. But I don't know how, I've never been close to someone who burned out, I don't want to come too close and end up pushing her away but I also don't want to stay away too much and lose her permanently.

Please help me."

Right out of college, I pretty much had to do all the work that no one else wanted to do. Working in a small office, this usually meant mailing letters, filing documents, and planning parties. This was all in addition to my daily tasks, meaning I often stayed late. It wasn't unusual for me to finally leave the office around 9pm. I always had to turn off the lights, and lock up. My social life took a hit,  but I was fine with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Time went by, and I got into the rhythm of these late nights. I'd been working there for about 6 months, when a batch of undergraduate interns got hired on.  I was understandably excited, especially because I wouldn't have to do the busy work I'd been doing. Little did I know, one of the interns was a HOT piece of ass. I couldn't help myself: I had to have them.

aoi43u,1,2019-02-08,I (29F) just found out my boyfriend (30M) has a history of cheating and I don't want to be paranoid.,patataslife,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aoi43u/i_29f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_30m_has_a/,"Sorry for the long post. TL;DR at the bottom.

Need your advice Reddit. Long time lurker and never thought I would post.

My boyfriend and I have been together for more than a year (friends with benefits turned into exclusively dating for a year, then officially in a relationship for 7 months thus far). My last relationship prior to him was an utter disaster, basically my ex cheated on me and I didn't handle it well and I vowed to never make the same mistakes again. My boyfriend knows all about what went down because we were friends when I was still with my ex. 

Months after the break up, when my current boyfriend and I started getting serious, I made him promise to never lie to me. I am a pretty trusting person, I usually never doubt the intentions of anyone unless they give me reason to. I also despise being controlling because my mother is that way with my dad and I always felt bad seeing that. I also am honest with my boyfriend. Told him all about my past, including the not so nice details. He wasn't comfortable doing the same but it didn't bother me because I figured I'd just know more about him as we go along. I always let him know where I am, whether I had plans with friends, etc. but never asked him to do the same. 

He knows about my past relationships. Not the nitty gritty details, just how many I've been in a relationship with. He also told me about his, how he had one serious girlfriend for 10 years (a high school sweetheart he dated till start of med school), then dated another girl during internship year. No serious relationships after that till I came along. I never asked him to tell me more than that because I didn't need to know more. 

We have keys to and stay at each other's place. Sometimes I stay at his place even when he's not around because it's close to my place of work, and want to save time and money from commuting. Our schedules also don't always align because we're both busy doctors. His place though, it's how you'd imagine a busy doctor's place would look like. Clothes everywhere, stuff that should've been thrown out 5 years ago still on his tables and cabinets. I asked his permission to clean up a bit, and he obliged since he never has the time and will to do it. 

This is where things go wrong and I admit to being wrong for snooping around. I was deciding where to put a bunch of his clothes and his old files, and opened up drawers to see which ones were available. That is where I found it. The drawer that contains mementos from his old relationships. At first I thought it just contained stuff I gave him since my letters were on top of the pile, so I started going through them and rereading some. However, at the bottom contained notebooks, scrapbooks, and letters obviously not from me. I didn't bother with the letters, but opened up the scrapbooks because I was hoping to see old pictures of him. 

Well, these scrapbooks were made by an ex he did not tell me about (let's call her secret ex). Secret ex wrote down notes about their relationship, how it formed, their conversations (she wrote down text messages word per word including date and time), and included pictures. However, the dates were from when he was just about to start med school, when he was still with his first girlfriend. At this point, I didn't want to stop reading because something was up. Secret ex knew about his relationship, but they both admitted to having feelings for each other. Even exchanged I love yous. So basically, he was cheating with this girl. This went on for more than a year, till he finally broke up with his girlfriend and started a relationship with secret ex right after. All of this documented by secret ex. 

There were other lies he's told me that these scrapbooks uncovered. When we first started fooling around, he told me he was inexperienced in bed (he was a virgin apparently) and have never went down on anyone but me. Welllll that was a lie because secret ex also documented their sexy times. I don't mind the fact that he's had sex or whatever, I wasn't virgin Mary either. It's just the fact that he lied about it, AND did it with this girl that truly bothers me. I was furious and decided to read the other letters and found out that he dumped this girl about a year after but got back with her again during his first year of residency then broke up again when she left for another country (again, he told me he did not have any relationships after internship year).

I also feel it's necessary to add that he's never introduced me to his family and friends. It used to bother me a lot but decided to just let him take his time till he's comfortable to do so. Now it's just making me doubt him more. I don't know anymore. 

I truly love him. Prior to this, I was so sure that he was the one. I don't think he's cheating on me now, but just the fact that I now know that he can lie like that has given me trust issues. He didn't come clean about his history of cheating when I asked for us to lay it all out in the beginning because I wanted to avoid stuff like this. He's currently out of the country and I haven't talked to him about it. I don't even know how I'll face him and talk to him about this whole thing when he gets back. I don't want to think about the possibility of being cheated on again in the future, but I can't stop worrying about it.  What do I do now? 

TL;DR Found out boyfriend lied about his relationship history and has a history of cheating. I have been cheated on before and now afraid of the possibility of it happening again in the future. "

aokasx,7,2019-02-08,My (31/f) partner (31/m) is ambivalent about our relationship (3.5 years),Tootsie27,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aokasx/my_31f_partner_31m_is_ambivalent_about_our/,"We've been together 3.5 years, and we have hypothetically mentioned in the past that we would expect to make definitive plans about marriage around this time, or at least by the 4-year mark. At this point, everything about our future is hypothetical. When we talk about marriage or kids in the future, we refer to them as ""your spouse"" or ""your kids,"" not ""you, my husband' or ""our kids."" We are at this point in our relationship where all of our friends are either getting divorced from early marriages, getting engaged, getting married, or even having babies, and we cannot even seem to discuss our future together in definitive language. I think we are both terrified of the future, specifically about making the wrong decision.

Where we differ, however, is what we want to do about it. I want to push through the discomfort and have a conversation around our ambivalence. If I want to do that, though, I have to be the one to initiate; my partner never will. I don't know if he's uncomfortable, scared, or something else. He won't actually share his thoughts and feelings with me regarding this topic. Our pattern is, I work up the courage to talk to him about the future every six months or so, and then after a bunch of prodding, he discloses something that activates my fear of abandonment, then I lash out, then he shuts down, and then I shut down.

Six months ago, he was hesitant because he felt like I did not accept him for who he is, like I want him to be someone other than who he is, which is not true. We had problems around cleanliness for the first couple years of our relationship, but that feels mostly resolved now, or resolved enough for me to feel comfortable proceeding.

As for the current example he gave me the other night, he said he is unsure about our relationship because he is not sure he can deal with my emotions. This is a stressful time for me. I am graduating from graduate school in four months, and my future is entirely unknown at the moment--not to mention I am studying for licensure exams and juggling classes and internship. That being said, I am not an emotional wreck in the slightest. I go to weekly therapy to attend to my emotions, and I am not relying on my partner to be my therapist in any way, shape, or form.

The other day, I was having a bad day. I told him I was frustrated that he was telling me to jump into private practice right after I graduate, rather than taking an agency job, while at the same time not acknowledging my financial situation. I told him in the moment that I was not mad at him, just pissed at my predicament and utter lack of financial resources, and he took it so personally. My partner makes a great salary and owns the house we live in. I think he wants me to feel supported, but at the same time expects me to keep paying rent once I graduate. Obviously, this is fair, seems he has a mortgage to pay, and I am legally his tenant, but it just frustrated me to hear ""follow your dreams"" and ""still pay rent"" in the same breath when he knows I'm stressed about money and my future in general. It does not help that I keep comparing myself to my cohort members who are all making these hard career and financial decisions with their partners. While my partner is supportive, it's in a ""You can do what you set your heart out to do"" way, not a ""Let's sit down and plan out our career goals to support our long-term life goals together"" kind of way.

So, now he has more ammunition for why he doesn't see a future with me, and I feel like I need to be perfect for an indefinite period of time so he can feel comfortable enough to plan a future with me. I am frustrated because I feel like there is always an excuse as to why he is not sure he wants to be with me in the legal sense. This time it's my emotions, last time it was him feeling like I did not think he was good enough for me because I insisted he clean the black mold from his bathroom walls before we moved in together.

I have been in one other long-term relationship (from 22 to 27 years old), and that relationship ended with this awful realization that I was the only one actually fully in the relationship. It was the worst feeling in the world, to realize my partner did not see himself with me for the long haul, and I am afraid I have found myself in exactly the same situation years later. I am really freaking frustrated, and I feel totally hopeless about the possibility of having to start over.

I want to connect with my partner, but I am not sure how. I thought for sure we would discuss things when we both got home last night, but he told me he needed time to himself. It was the anniversary of his father's death, and he wanted to sit with that alone rather than process it with me. We haven't spoken or slept in the same bed since. I feel so lonely and miserable, and I am not sure I can continue this pattern of pretending everything is okay for a few months and get comfortable with our routine, only to be reminded that he is harboring all these doubts the next time I badger him about the future. I want him to be excited about me and our future together, but I am worried that is not the case and won't ever be the case.

Is there a way for us to get past this? To learn from this pattern and grow? I feel like we are so stuck. Any advice on how to get unstuck would be helpful.

TLDR: I (31/f) feel disconnected from my partner (31/m) due to his ambivalence about our relationship, and I am unsure how to move forward."
aokprh,2,2019-02-08,Gossip at my school almost lead me to suicide.,PunchlineQueen,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/aokprh/gossip_at_my_school_almost_lead_me_to_suicide/,"I was an intern at my college. Yes, college. There were 8 of us and a supervisor. There was one person who was a bit older and being young and naive, I became infatuated. I loved talking to this person. Time went on and I guess this person was unable to communicate his lack of interest in a mature way, started being rude to me, I asked a question and he would reply angrily , one time he even cussed. We went out of town on a conference once and I believed we had a normal conversion but he went around telling people I was crazy, strange, or weird and that I had threatened him. Soon, people I didn't even know were harassing me, calling me names and my so called friends were telling me what people said. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, I get called in Our boss sided with him and made slick comments towards me, screams at me over the phone, claims I'm not a good intern and even laughs, I even tell her supervisor some of the things she's done and she makes a slick comment. I even walk out of the meeting and a friend tells me people are talking about me.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the worst time of my life. My parents were worried about me, I didn't even sleep. I had no friends, I considered suicide many times but ultimately my fear of death stopped me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later( I couldn't quit because I needed the money) this person/my boss/others try to be nice to me , I guess trying to clear their own conscience. I didn't end on good terms with any of these people and when I see them I don't speak and neither do they. They probably will never have any real remorse or care that they did this to a young person that was naive and quiet. My friends wonder why I don't speak to them anymore, some even see me and don't speak. I'm sure people still gossip about me or think I'm crazy but life is worth living and I learned to be happy on my own.

aolr79,14,2019-02-08,Politeia Proposal to Fund Marketing Ops for 2019,Dustorf,decred,https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/aolr79/politeia_proposal_to_fund_marketing_ops_for_2019/,"I would like to share and solicit feedback on a thought I have for a proposal in Politeia. The objective is to increase transparency, give stakeholders control of the allocation of funds, and incorporate their input into a marketing plan for Decred for the remainder of 2019. I‚Äôm also planning to make a specific plan to approve funds for events.

&amp;#x200B;

Much of this type of work has always taken place, but without the review, input or approval of the stakeholders. For example, Decred has a website and spent money to build it, paid for events, has community organizers across the world that organize meetups, promotional items, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I put forth these proposals with the purpose of moving towards a DAE where stakeholders have the power to authorize expenditures, but contributors have the autonomy to make decisions within an approved framework. The goal is to help establish sets of parameters to determine how this new type of organization will run. This is a rough plan, and all feedback on this concept and on the specifics of the plan is greatly valued.

&amp;#x200B;

There will be two types of budgetary buckets included in the proposal, and budgets attached to each item within the plan:

1. Planned Programming
2. Discretionary Spending

&amp;#x200B;

Planned Programming will include the following:

a. Decred Assembly (monthly high production video featuring news of the project, community members, and deep dives into specific subject areas of interest)

b. Monthly Email Newsletter (truncated Journal, easy to review and digest, less technical)

c. Website Updates (reflect the new messaging, improve navigation, better explain Decred)

d. Internship program (structure, package and promote a program to get college students to dev for Decred in Summer of 2020. Budgeting for the cost of devs would be additional and would fall in the devs budget)

e. Decred in Depth Podcast (hosted and produced by Anshawblack, deep dive with Decred community members on topics of interest)

f) Community organizing/meetups to build communities across the world. Attend meetups, organize quarterly Decred events, promote the project locally, exchange outreach, swag etc. Target markets include: Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, New York, San Francisco, Australia, London, Germany, Portugal, Poland, China, Russia, Italy, Toronto, Middle East/Arabic, Hong Kong, Chicago, Brazil.

&amp;#x200B;

Discretionary Spending

a) The planned programming will set forth a base around which other contributors can identify supplemental needs and make their own proposals to better round out Decred‚Äôsmarketing activities. Consensus within the marketing ops team could approve these additions so long as they fall within the approved budgeting in this area. Examples might include a gifted writer who launches a regular blog, a series of ‚ÄúHow to‚Äù instructional videos to make Decred easier to use for newbies, and so on.

b) New opportunities. When the Decred team is approached with new ideas or partnerships, the marketing ops team will have the autonomy to make additions to the plan so long as budget exists.

Tactic|	Number|	Cost Per|	Extended Cost

\---|---|---|---

Decred Assembly| 10|	$3,500.00|	$35,000.00

Monthly Newsletter|	10|	$500.00|	$5,000.00

Website Updates|	1|	$65000|	$65,000.00

Internship Programs|	1| $5,000.00|	$5,000.00

Decred in Depth Podcast|	10|	$1,000.00|	$10,000.00

Community Organizers|	20|	$5,000.00|	$100,000.00

Supplementary/New Opps|	1|	$70,000.00|	$70,000.00

&amp;#x200B;

Total	$290,000.00

&amp;#x200B;

Note-the existence of a budget in no way constitutes a desire to spend money, only the autonomy given to the marketing ops team who are required to act as fiduciaries of Decred. Please supply any input so I can put together a proposal that makes sense, satisfies the stakeholders, and accomplishes our marketing objectives. The expenses will be tracked and viewable in Github."

And the recent episode with JYP Super Intern where Twice spoke about their concerns. [[reddit topic here]](https://www.reddit.com/r/twice/comments/alqnwg/super_intern_e02/) It got me thinking about Twices perception in the kpop world. 

Twice themselves feels like, they are getting written off as the ""Cute Girl Group"" by the general audience and casual kpop listeners on the basis of their Title Tracks and members are worried about people getting bored at their current image.

I've watched videos of people listing their favorite Twice tracks and it only contains their Title Tracks. When it comes to why not including any b-sides, the general answer is 
""I don't listen to the albums"". 

Which imo is kinda a shame/disservice, since Twice b-sides more often have Gems that can even overshadow the Title Track (Sunset f.e.).
All the members hard work in writing songs for their albums gets unnoticed by supposed Twice fans and general audience.
I mean seriously you can type in Twice Album on YouTube to listen all of them. (Can't be that hard, right?)

When they comeback, you get a responses like ""Oh it's a typical catchy Twice Song"".  - Which then puts them back to the ""Cute Girl Group""- niche. 
It's not the girls fault. I would say it's JYPE ""fault"" on how they want to market Twice in the kpop world and yeah they are not wrong (Asia‚Äôs no.1 Girl Group).

Well after all this ramble (I'm sorry and hopefully it made sense), what do you guys and gals think?"

I feel like something like graphics programming could be my thing, but I don't really see any way for someone with my skill level to get into it. With things like mobile app development and even hip stuff like machine learning or data science there are a truckload of tutorials and courses online, a lot of which are made for absolute beginners or self-taught people. But with graphics programming there seems to be no easy way in because even the more accessible info begins with low level programming languages. Plus there's the fact that I could really use a job or internship right now, but I don't really see any entry-level job postings for anything related to graphics. 

So what's the deal? Do I just suck it up and get a junior python dev job until I'm more advanced in college? Is there *something* I can teach myself? Anyway, thanks for reading."

&amp;#x200B;

Currently working as a Human Resources intern at Air Academy Federal Credit Union. I have been here for two years now.

I ran JV cross country in 9th and 10th grade, and have been part of NHS, German HS, Tech HS, and Math HS. Also a 4 year Principal's Honor Roll Recipient. Led the Cyber Security Team at our school (we attended Capture the Flag events). Also part of the Rubik's Cube Team. Not sure how useful this is, but I mentioned in my interview that I am also a Certified Java Programmer.

&amp;#x200B;

Joined Student Council senior year so I was not even allowed to mention it in my interview (and this has been my greatest source of leadership, so that's unfortunate).

&amp;#x200B;

I interviewed with someone from USAFA. She mentioned how confident I was and said I would be a great fit in ROTC and that she hoped to see me receive the scholarship...

&amp;#x200B;

However, she is not on the admissions board. She was actually filling in for the lady that was supposed to interview me... I feel like I have displayed the characteristics of a leader, but without Student Council I start to fall flat.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the last board that is meeting for this upcoming school year (according to my interviewer). How likely do you think it is that I will receive the scholarship? I plan on joining ROTC regardless because my goal is to become an officer in the AF, but this scholarship is one of the few things that will help me afford university."

aonbv0,2,2019-02-08,My (21m) girlfriend (21f) just told me that she has no more feelings for me after I made the trip to visit her.,waxo16,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aonbv0/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_just_told_me_that_she_has/,"Context: we are in a long-distance relationship (7 hours by train) since August last year and have seen each other for about 2-3 days every month since then. Before the long-distance started, we had been together for about a month - so yeah really shitty to start a relationship with long distance..

Anyway, I got here yesterday (will be here until Tuesday) and have been feeling that something was off for the last few days. We had planned a trip together for a few days when she comes back to my city at the end of the month, but she was reluctant to talk about it and then eventually when I asked her about it she told me that she feels that I have fallen in love very quickly, while she has ‚Äúfallen out of love‚Äù over the last few weeks. She said that she had doubts for a while, which she addressed with me about 2 months ago (such as us oftentimes not having the most meaningful conversations). I then told her that it would hopefully eventually work out (not a smart move on my side).

Well now she said this and I am devastated and don‚Äôt know what to do.. she really is an amazing woman and I have really fallen in love with her (or at least I think so).

For context: she is doing a very stressful internship at the moment and has very little time for herself. We talk almost daily via FaceTime, but she says that she feels that I only do small talk and that we don‚Äôt really have meaningful conversations in between the times that we see each other in person.

I think it‚Äôs the distance that is fucking things up and am pretty sure that once we are back in the same city we can get back to where we were and actually get to know each other as we have spent a total of about 15 days together in the last 7 months. 

She says that she has to trust her feelings and she doesn‚Äôt think being back in the same city will change anything.

I don‚Äôt want to force her to anything, but I really really like her.

I‚Äôm really sorry about all the rambling, I need to make sense of it in my head somehow.

Any advice would be highly appreciated.
Thank you so much in advance Reddit!"
aonhtk,1,2019-02-08,I (21M) feel angry towards my ex (20F) and it's impacting a new relationship I'm trying to start.,royoyo424,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aonhtk/i_21m_feel_angry_towards_my_ex_20f_and_its/,"We've broken up a couple of months back in a not so chill manner after two years into the relationship. As of last summer she had been acting different than her usual self, getting into a sorority and being less interested in seeing each other. This seemed all fine to me at the time as she was getting a difficult internship and I was transitioning between universities. Then, during my exams she wants to meet up and tells me she doesn't feel like we are in a relationship anymore and that she needed more time alone (which I thought was odd, because we barely saw each other these last weeks anyway). I didn't see that coming and all I could bring out was stuff like: ""Do you just need some time?"" or  ""We can still make this work, I don't know how, but we'll get through this."". She agreed and told me she would be in contact. A week goes by and I start getting frustrated by her not reaching out and about how sudden this all came to be. At the end of the week I call her and tell her that we needed to talk. Being in that relationship in which I wouldn't see my girlfriend or be able to talk to her was not going to work for me. She said that she thought it wasn't a good thing either and we decided to break up, but to still be friends. 

I felt like a wreck the next few weeks and it was hard on me to not talk or see the person I had spent so many moments with before. It felt like an okay time to ask her how she was doing through a text. The reply was a short ""Yes I'm fine."" a few weeks later I got myself a new apartment and posted that on social media. She responded and asked me where I was living now, after a vague description of where I got my new room (it didn't feel right to disclose my new address) the convo fell silent again. Apparently she lost her wallet somewhere in the next couple of weeks and someone I know found it. After having relayed the message and her happy response and immediate call after receiving my text I thought that we might actually be OK and that a normal friendship could be a thing. In the next couple days it seemed like I could handle picking up my last few things at her place. The meetup went fine, I didn't feel too angry with her and I definitely didn't have any more feelings for her.

Fast forward to new years eve where I received a personal snapp from her saying that she was going on vacation somewhere in south America (due to complications with her health she never wanted to fly before, so I thought it was strange) . It seemed like an okay thing to ask her about her travels and if she was going to stay there for long. But I got some short and passive aggressive comments in return. I told her that if she didn't want to talk right now, that that was okay too. She replied saying she was just busy, but that she didn't like how I stayed in touch after she told me that she didn't want to converse as much anymore. This came to me as a shock, after all I thought things were going fine. That we were at least on speaking terms (now a few months after the breakup). I told her that I just missed talking to her. She replied saying that she understood, but that things just didn't work that way anymore. And after seeing a snapchat story of another guy she was going on the vacation with, I got angry and deleted her contacts from my phone.

Now a couple more months later I want to get into a relationship with someone new and she feels the same way. I however saw some mutual friends of me and my ex on one of our more recent dates. I didn't want to lie to her about who these people were and why they were acting so funny. We had a good conversation about how things ended and that I was over her, but that I still felt a little angry over how things ended. The day after I went to Uni to pic something up and I saw my ex sitting at the pickup point. After a cold greeting and getting the things I needed, I went home, but felt absolutely awful the rest of the day. 

I just don't know how to cope with the anger I feel every time I think of her. And the person I'm seeing now doesn't like it that I have talked about my ex two days in a row. I don't think it's an issue with venting the anger, I exercise to get rid of that. The problem is with getting over these feelings. It seems like I should be able to not care anymore, but I can't. The way that my ex has been so cold with me the last few times we spoke makes me feel like she doesn't even acknowledge my being anymore, that I have never been a part of her life at all. That feeling gnaws at me. 

Sorry for the long read and the bad writing. I appreciate any advice that you might have.

TL;DR: Me and my ex broke up during a stressful period. I thought we could still be friends but guess not. She has been cold and left me feeling like I haven't ever mattered. This feeling sucks. I want to start things up with another woman, but it feels like these feelings are still in the way of making this a fresh start."

Since I prefer to leave some things unsaid for later chats, I'd like to just say a few things I do just to break the ice and give you a basic idea of who I am.

- I work as a CS intern for a major consulting company
- I'm still studying CS (year 3.5) in Michigan
- I enjoy gaming and (social) drinking when I have time, but am just as happy practicing Taekwondo or soccer when I can
- I write both music and fantasy as hobbies
- I'm the best damn chef in my year

If I sound interesting and you'd like to see where things go, just shoot me a pm or a chat and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I don't mind Long Distance.

* Find work in the area of either Natural Resources, Environmental Science, Conservation, Geology, Forestry, or Hydrology

* Finish community college (Riverside City College) with an Associate Degree of Transfer in Math and Science

* Finish the remainder of my education at UCR with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science

* Explore internships, programs, volunteering that could help me gather experience.

**Lifestyle**

* Become a great cook

* Become an efficient fruit and vegetable gardener

**Physical**

* Deadlift 600 lbs, Squat 400 lbs, Bench Press 300 lbs, Overhead Press 200 lbs (minimum)

* Climb Mount Whitney and some of the other peaks on my list (hike regularly)

* Ease into running; run some 5ks and see where that leads

**Mental**

* Learn Spanish to C1 level at least

* Read voraciously (fit any time of the day I can for that)

* Write more (put aside some time each day and write: poems, short stories, build up to my novel in the works)

* Set some time for meditation each day

That's pretty much it. I understand some of the goals are more specific than others. I'm not really experienced in goal setting, or establishing life-long hobbies. I plan to ease into it. Start with what's most accessible and most likely to immediately stick. Maybe meditation, reading, and writing?

I will be taking a weight training course at college so that'll help a lot with the exercise aspect. And as long as my weekends are free, I can still dedicate time to hiking out in Nature and eventually build up to reaching some summits.

Will be starting full time college this Monday, so I know my time throughout the weekdays will be packed. On top of that, there is a chance I may have to look for a part-time job on the side; if I have to, I'll look into work study. You can tell me whether it's possible to fit all these habits/aspirations with full-time college. If it's impossible, I'll try to focus on what I can.

Wish I had more time to spare, that way I can fit more hobbies in such as amateur astronomy but the stars aren't going anywhere, so I guess that can wait. 

Wish me luck! I'm hoping I can adopt some good habits and reach some remarkable goals. Any guidance, support, and suggestions are much appreciated!"

However, due to a few circumstances, I didn't fulfill an internship in a corporate setting like most in my cohort have been able to do.

I have received a lot of applied experience in my program alone and had the opportunity to work alongside a few organizations on some projects, so I plan on highlighting those points when I'm applying for jobs. However, I'm still a little concerned about my lack of experience. I've been looking into learning and development positions as it ties more closely to what I've done as a GRA, but I'm open to many positions, even those outside the conventional realm of I-O and, if I can land any, paid internships.

In our last year i got asked out by my now girlfriend who was just so perfect. Life was so good.
And then college happened. She went away and i was just .... here. We decided to make it work long distance and initially it was good but then she got caught up in her work. My college was kinda far from my home so i rented out a place and stayed alone. The college i joined wasn't what i expected it to be like. My friends were great fun but as a whole i didn't feel like i fit in. Lots of teachers negatively throwing crap at me which i could take ...for a while. After a while i couldnt and i decided i have to drop out. I thought all the while that i was living alone i was living a dream eating what i want going where i want coming back whenever i want i was happy. I have always felt like i dont need people to ""survive""
But maybe if there was someone else things might have turned out differently who knows
So i dropped outta college and i preoccupied myself with different things.
Went to a couple of courses,internships, studying on my own. Me and my gf used to talk quite regularly but it obviously became  lesser and lesser and some days nothing. Standard LDR stuff. I used to feel so disconnected from her but w
e used to meet when she came back and 
Almost instantly or even after some time we would click and we have a fun time together. But deeper and deeper into the year we would talk lesser and lesser and when we did she would really busy doing something else and i always just found it difficult to talk about anything. I felt so disconnected with her. I have felt so demotivated just dont feel like doing anything. For the past month all i did was get up go for my class come back do whatever internship work was there or any class work game fir a while maybe if she was free talk to her and sleep really late. My eating habits also went for a toss i eat my first meal at 12 and my lunch at 4 and dinner at 8. 
One day i git a text from her that she took a drag from a cig ofc its only a drag but i coudnt handle it i was scared or something my body was just shaking the moment read the text. Then she drank and got tipsy. I guess me reacting would be jelousy of not being the one she was doing it with but i got over it pretty quick. We have also never had sex because she was scared of getting pregnant. Finally she said she was ready and so the next time she came to visit we were gonna do it. But it was kinda badly timed. The last time we net was about a month ago and we barely talked to each other so major disconnection. I picked her up and we went to a hotel just like always we didnt instantly connect and so we fooled around for a while but when we tried to do it i couldnt get hard i just couldn't and it was such a bt after a few tries we just left and went for lunch we talked about what happened she was understandably upset with what happened. And so we reached a point where we decided to take a break "

I find it hard to believe that you passed away almost 7 years ago. Well, 7 years exactly on April 20th, your birthday and the day you passed. Not that anyone's counting but still pretty ironic, huh? I've been on a bit of a nostalgia kick recently, and I keep thinking about you. Your legacy, history and all of that. I think you'll be happy to know that I picked up a new PS2 at a tag sale today, I know it was one of the few things that brought us together. Bonding over the riffs of Guitar Hero III and the space ship battles of Star Wars Battlefront 2. The little one seemed pretty excited about it, after all it's not every day you come home to see a 'new' PS2 all set up and in working condition. Speaking of the little one, he's a sophomore now and seems to be having a fine time in school. A lot better than I did, that's for damn sure. Bug is doing well too, trying to get decent people to work with him is a time and a half but Momma makes it work. That's been the one constant in this family, whatever the circumstances may be, we always seem to make it work. You probably wouldn't recognize me if you saw me. I've gotten a lot taller and I've gained a few pounds since the last time you saw my 10-year-old self. You know what's funny? I never knew the role you took until it was gone. Seriously, being the man of the house for this long definitely changes my outlook. Had to grow up real fast, and I think this nostalgia kick comes from me wanting some of that childhood back, I'm not ready to let go of it just yet. But when is anyone ready for anything? School's been, I don't know, mediocre. Lots of opportunities my way, one of them was even an internship at a construction company. I know you and Gpa tried to start something when I was about 5 or six, at least that's what Momma says. She recently gave me your old work jackets as a little something I can use when I start working in a couple of weeks. They fit perfectly by the way, I know my height comes from Ma's side but I have your shoulders. I wish you'd come back sometimes. I know now that you weren't always the greatest person and I know you two had your differences but we made it work, right? I know this letter has a lot of questions, and I don't expect you to know the answers to all of them. And that's fine. I know the little one and I don't talk about it a whole bunch but he still misses you too. And taps will never not make me burst into tears. But, boys don't cry as you said so I'll stick with that. I know you hated being sick. And trust me, we all hated watching it. Little glimpses of hope here and there but in the back of our mind we all knew what was going to happen. Whether we had a firm grasp on that concept or not. Maybe I'll visit your grave sometime, look again at that cross you never really believed in as I read your name along the marble headstone. Wherever you may be, I hope you're happy.

Your middle son. The little one. Bug. And Momma."

So many questions running through my mind right now, and as someone who has had this personal battle myself, it pains me that I was not able to save her.

I know everyone is going to ask me if I'm okay. I know everyone is going to tell me it's not my fault, I did what I could do. But there's still a part of me replaying every conversation we've had, wondering if I missed something.

If they are willing to pay me i dont mind at all(i will not go down that road for free tho - should i?), and for me is most important to start making money and gathering experience in the industry but i have some questions that i hope you guys can help me with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should i drop Java/Spring and start Rust? 
2. Does Rust have a future? 
3. How hard is it to learn?(i only worked with Java which has a garbage collector and auto memory allocation)
4. I am not thrilled by amount of resources i stumbled upon in my first 10 minutes of googling for them(Java/Spring seems to have infinite more), where would you recommend me to start(starting from zero)

I do understand that my questions are maybe bad and really hard to answer but they do represent my current level of understanding of whole Rust thing and answers to them would help me quite a bit.

Should I relocate?,RFfree1986,u_RFfree1986,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RFfree1986/comments/aotmca/please_help_should_i_relocate/,"To preface, I have never posted to this platform.  But I use reddit for basically everything... why not to help me make major life choices?  :)

My demographics.  32 (33 in May), single (complicated), masters level education, active, healthy... an epic ball of perpetual anxiety!  I live in one of the most economically depressed regions of the United States (and mentally... and physically... seriously, this has been well documented)... I am socially miserable but economically thriving.  

Out of college I got a job with a local company, small but growing.  I worked at this company from 2004, as an intern, to its closing in 2015 (they sold to a larger entity).  I then quickly bounced into a senior-level position with a regional company in the same area.  I adore it.  They have been wonderful to me.  I've just had my third promotion and it's looking like a fourth!  I'm good at what I do, and I'm proud of my accomplishments... but I'm also miserable outside of that.  And maybe miserable is too harsh a word?  about 6 months ago I took the plunge and started applying in major cities... and boom three offers!  So I gave my 45 day notice started packing up.... and then... the counter offer.  I accepted... and here I am... wondering if I made a terrible career decision.  

Little back story.  I am all alone.  I live in a place where everyone who can moves... and the people left are drug zombies or people who just couldn't make it elsewhere; or who were too afraid of the unknown (ME!).  Basically, all of my friends have moved on to bigger and better... but have they?  Is the place they live really driving their happiness?  Look, overall I consider myself a positive leaning person... I am empathetic to others, I try an make good decisions I know will have positive effects on others, I smile and laugh... but something is missing.  

I realize how blessed I am on a myriad of levels... good job.  I own my own home and a rental property... I am appreciated at work with a phenomenal boss and coworkers... I make more money than most... but even with all of those things I find myself increasingly dissatisfied.  Why?

I keep having this dream where I'm in my 40's looking for a job... seriously... it' a terrible dream.  I am the type of person who craves stability... I thrive on it... I seek it out.  I have seen too many people in my life fail... I've seen people struggle to buy groceries and medicine... and I just want to do everything I can to create a strong and stable long term.  On the flip side I am craving adventure... I love to travel and I find myself sad when I have to leave a great city.  Those lingering questions we have all asked are ever present... is this it?  Is there more out there?  Did I make the right choice?  Should I just run away!?

I know some of this is  saturday morning post coffee dramatics... but what isn't dramatic is how I feel at the end of the day.  searching for meaning while also trying to ignore my instincts.  'Stay here', I'll tell myself one day... 'you have so much going for you'... while my right brain is telling me to bolt... 'it's time to go', he'll say, 'you've done all you can here'.  I hate him sometimes.  But he also has a point.

I know I can make more money elsewhere... but will I have the same feeling of belonging at work?  If I moved would I miss out on even more professional growth?

I am tired of being alone.  Would moving fix that?  Would moving closer to friends satisfy me?  

I am torn between two great possibilities.  Staying here with a great job and financial stability but no social life... or leaving with the hope of both.  That uncertainty paralyzes me.

aotmw8,5,2019-02-09,Please help! Should I move!?,RFfree1986,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/aotmw8/please_help_should_i_move/,"To preface, I have never posted to this platform.  But I use reddit for basically everything... why not to help me make major life choices?  :)

My demographics.  32 (33 in May), single (complicated), masters level education, active, healthy... an epic ball of perpetual anxiety!  I live in one of the most economically depressed regions of the United States (and mentally... and physically... seriously, this has been well documented)... I am socially miserable but economically thriving.  

Out of college I got a job with a local company, small but growing.  I worked at this company from 2004, as an intern, to its closing in 2015 (they sold to a larger entity).  I then quickly bounced into a senior-level position with a regional company in the same area.  I adore it.  They have been wonderful to me.  I've just had my third promotion and it's looking like a fourth!  I'm good at what I do, and I'm proud of my accomplishments... but I'm also miserable outside of that.  And maybe miserable is too harsh a word?  about 6 months ago I took the plunge and started applying in major cities... and boom three offers!  So I gave my 45 day notice started packing up.... and then... the counter offer.  I accepted... and here I am... wondering if I made a terrible career decision.  

Little back story.  I am all alone.  I live in a place where everyone who can moves... and the people left are drug zombies or people who just couldn't make it elsewhere; or who were too afraid of the unknown (ME!).  Basically, all of my friends have moved on to bigger and better... but have they?  Is the place they live really driving their happiness?  Look, overall I consider myself a positive leaning person... I am empathetic to others, I try an make good decisions I know will have positive effects on others, I smile and laugh... but something is missing.  

I realize how blessed I am on a myriad of levels... good job.  I own my own home and a rental property... I am appreciated at work with a phenomenal boss and coworkers... I make more money than most... but even with all of those things I find myself increasingly dissatisfied.  Why?

I keep having this dream where I'm in my 40's looking for a job... seriously... it' a terrible dream.  I am the type of person who craves stability... I thrive on it... I seek it out.  I have seen too many people in my life fail... I've seen people struggle to buy groceries and medicine... and I just want to do everything I can to create a strong and stable long term.  On the flip side I am craving adventure... I love to travel and I find myself sad when I have to leave a great city.  Those lingering questions we have all asked are ever present... is this it?  Is there more out there?  Did I make the right choice?  Should I just run away!?

I know some of this is  saturday morning post coffee dramatics... but what isn't dramatic is how I feel at the end of the day.  searching for meaning while also trying to ignore my instincts.  'Stay here', I'll tell myself one day... 'you have so much going for you'... while my right brain is telling me to bolt... 'it's time to go', he'll say, 'you've done all you can here'.  I hate him sometimes.  But he also has a point.

aotr4y,2,2019-02-09,"[WP] Long ago a sorcerer anchored your life-force to that of a long-lived species of tree to save your life, which had the side-effect of slowing your ageing to an average of you both. Now, centuries later you sense some kind of threat to your tree and set out to visit a very old friend indeed.",tomoikari,AquaticRacoon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaticRacoon/comments/aotr4y/wp_long_ago_a_sorcerer_anchored_your_lifeforce_to/,"I lean against the rattling metal, the slow hum of the train trying to pull me to sleepy wonderland. But sleep remained elusive to me. I was worried and as you can imagine it takes a lot to worry a man who‚Äôs about 400 year old.

&amp;nbsp;
I know I might look like the gullible new intern joining the company but I‚Äôm actually much, much older than I look. I was a woodcutter back in the day. Felling the alpine firs in a remote place in northern parts of India. Work was hard and pay was quite literally a few pennies. One night I had stayed, trying to fell more wood and squeeze in a little bit more of those pennies.

&amp;nbsp;

Getting lost in the forest was bad, getting chased and mauled by a lioness was worse. But thankfully someone yelling loudly and a few loud bangs of his stick, an old man had saved me. Well saved was subjective. The lioness had ripped through the chest into the lungs and the oesophagus. As my vision grew blurry and my breath because longer and drawn. I closed my eyes accepting my fate, the face of the old sadhu the last thing I would see.

&amp;nbsp;

Or so I thought. I woke up next day, my chest burning with incredibly painful viciousness but my flesh was whole. I...I was somehow alive.

&amp;nbsp;

The old man looked at me and told me that in my dying moments he had bound my life to a young nearby fir. It took me a while but as I touched the bark of the young tree I could feel, its life and my own flowing through me. The same blood that ran through my veins was the same sap that nourished the tree. Ironic isn‚Äôt it? A woodcutter bound to a tree. A killer‚Äôs life bound to his victim. Nature is quite the irony sometimes.

&amp;nbsp;

An announcement over the bleary speakers told me that I would be arriving at my destination soon. I made a mental note and moved back to my thought of 400 years ago.

&amp;nbsp;

What the old man hadn‚Äôt told me that since my life was bound to the tree, our lifespan have been tied together too. I would live as long as the young fir stayed strong and growing.
You would ask why I was going back to the tree? I could sense, some dread, some sense of imminent threat and danger to it. Lives tied together remember?

&amp;nbsp;

At the cab station I asked them to take me the Jeevan Forest. The first few shook their heads. They didn‚Äôt know it. After a bit of questioning and a quick Google search would tell me that there was no longer a forest there.

&amp;nbsp;


I insisted and promised the incessant cab driver a bit of money to take me to it.

&amp;nbsp;


So here I am, watching with unfamiliarity as the cab window zoomed passed houses and buildings. Shopping districts, malls and bazaars. As someone who is a bit older than the average person it never ceased to amaze me; how fast humanity could spread, how easily we cleared our paths. We were not just the apex predators, we as humans were way above that. We destroyed and hunted and moulded nature to our will so very easily. It was almost cruel how we had brought the process of life itself to our heels.

&amp;nbsp;

The cab stops, I hand the smiling cab driver hit money, not bothering with the change I climb out.

&amp;nbsp;

A lone fir stands in the middle of the enclavement as construction workers and cranes mill about.
The scene from 400 years ago flashes before me. The lush dense forest was gone. There were no witnesses left, no birds to chirp, no animals to find comfort in the foliage anymore. The murder had been silent. Yet my fir had stood over it, watched it silently.

&amp;nbsp;

I fumble towards the last standing tree, I get stares from the nearby people but nobody stops me. As soon as I touch the rough, hewn bark I feel it. The same life that flowed through me, flowed through this now sturdy fir. A last of its kind.


Tears emerge and fall to its roots. The fir waved back to me, greeted me like you would an old brother. Maybe my tears could give a small hope to my fir.

&amp;nbsp;

They will fell it tomorrow to clear this site for a tennis court.

&amp;nbsp;

Ironic but fitting for me. Four hundred years were well enough. Life to life. Back to the earth. Back again.

aotza8,1,2019-02-09,Things to know before deciding a college/university,dwipshah,u_dwipshah,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dwipshah/comments/aotza8/things_to_know_before_deciding_a_collegeuniversity/,"**¬∑ Do you actually need to?**

Always decide your career path before and think how the added degree or education would help you further help you attain your goals.

Making a decision to study further is not only going to cost you money but more importantly time and it is always better to be sure of what you want.

**¬∑ Make sure you chose a college with a known Accreditation**

Accredited universities have been recognized by official local, state, and national agencies as providing a high-quality education .Accreditation is important as it helps standardize the education and makes sure that every course has the required bandwidth to give you the relevant knowledge.

If you intend to transfer credits from one university to another, accreditation can also be a factor. Your new school will only accept your previous coursework if it recognizes your old school‚Äôs accreditation.

**¬∑ Variants in Degrees**

A good college might be easy to decide upon but the degree and course must also be to your liking. Be sure to check the course content before enrolling.

**¬∑ Place of study/Location**

Location does matter depending on the course you are choosing. Different countries have many basic jobs but depending on the country many different variations do open up.

**¬∑ Cost of living and education**

Cost is one of the most important things to consider when choosing a college, and you will need to determine how much tuition you can afford to pay prior to selecting a school. The cost between public and private universities has risen considerably in recent years.

**¬∑ Financial Aid and Scholarships**

Although the cost of higher education has risen dramatically, so have financial aid opportunities. There are many organizations that provide financial aid. Applications for these scholarships should be done prior and all relevant documents are to be submitted.

**¬∑ Admissions Criteria**

Different colleges have different eligibility criteria. There are colleges that also demand for your countries entrance exams to evaluate you ever further. From work experience to work done in voluntary organizations, everything is important and can give you an edge over the others.

**¬∑ Flexible Scheduling Options**

Now-a-days many students are enrolling in part-time degree programs and have to balance work, family, and other obligations; flexible scheduling options may play a particularly important role. Many colleges also have a detailed course catalogue on their website so that students can have a clear understanding about the course.

**¬∑ Internships and Hands-on Opportunities**

Always make sure that the course you are choosing has many opportunities in the country/city. Make sure there are working students and internships available to give you a better insight to the kind of work you would be doing further on in your career. Also make sure if the internships have any special requirements as well like a Language skill etc.

**¬∑ Inside and outside Campus Facilities**

A campus that has many facilities not just for your course but other centers for sports and extracurricular activities is also very important. A motorsport car team or a philosophy group, things like this can prove to be very helpful. Check the university website for these groups and make plans of joining them when you start your studies. There might be many governmental organizations that also have many activities that can be done and enjoyed by individuals. This way you will meet new people and learn about different cultures.

**¬∑ Academic Support Resources**

The university must have good support for its students. Better contacts and partnerships with multiple companies of different domains to give you a better experience. Industrial visits and multiple guest lecturers will further broaden your mind and open up new though provoking ideas for you.

**¬∑ Career Services/Assistance**

Having an active and supportive career services office is essential. College can open your eyes to careers you never knew existed, and the career services center can be instrumental in preparing you for your professional life after graduation. Career services include interview preparation, counseling, resume reviews, job placement support, and much more.

**¬∑ Job Placement Opportunities**

Knowing about jobs in the country you are going to reside in is very important .A few routine checks on the local job portals is very useful and gives you information about the kind the jobs that are available in the country.

aoudvh,1,2019-02-09,Differing opinions between me and my mom have not been good for the family (advice needed),Murphster_1,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/aoudvh/differing_opinions_between_me_and_my_mom_have_not/,"Hello, I'm a 19 year old guy who is going to a community college while staying at my parents house. I currently pay my health insurance and do an activity during the summer that I pay for that costs roughly about $4,000 dollars a year. I'm making this post because of what has gone down this week. So I guess I'll start from the beginning (just fyi, this will be long.) So i'm driving to school on Monday and I get a text from my mom asking if I was looking for new work, because she had heard that I was talking to my uncle about possibly getting an internship with the federal government. To be honest I have been looking for new work ever since I started going to college (around mid January) just because I need to find a job that better fits my schedule, has set hours, and has a chance of helping me get a permanent job in the future. I currently have been working for my dad with his business as a plumber. Anyways, I texted her back and said that yes I was in fact looking for new work. Next thing I know we are arguing sending paragraphs of text to each other while i'm at school on how we are right. Basically, my mom sees it as if I don't help my dad out with his work, then I have to start paying all of my bills. I think it's important to say here that I try and not to escalate the situation as much as I can, I stay calm and just state my facts and opinions, while she on the other hand lets her emotions go and flings insults and threats at me. I really feel that i've tried my hardest to just state my opinion in the most non-confrontational way, but she just doesn't want to here my point of view at all. So when I get in my car to leave school, I decide to go to my grandma's house and stay there for a few days instead of going home and having her yell at me about how she is right, because nothing I said that day changed the way she thought at all. Basically, she doesn't want me to find a different job, she wants me to keep working with my dad because it saves them money. If they had to find someone else to do the kind of work I do, they would have to pay them almost double what I made while working with him. It's not like I hate plumbing or anything either, I actually think it's a very respectable job, I just don't want to be one, and the pay i'm getting for the kind of work I do is just unfair. Plus my father has no idea how to run a business, so it sucks for me because sometimes I don't get off work until 10 PM. Anyways, the people i've let get involved in this have agreed with me fully, and are saying that my mom needs to get on medication because they believe she is bipolar. But the people that agree with me my mom now despises, she called my grandma (her own mother) on multiple occasions and had yelling matches with her. My mom threatens daily to come over to her house and take my car and phone away from me unless I come home and do chores. The first night it was to clean my room and take my clean clothes down into my room and put them away, the next day I was told to clean out our pigsty of a garage (it looks like a hoarder's living room) when it was 10 degrees outside, the day after were multiple little things around the house. Just yesterday she froze my phone line and threatened to come to grandma's house with the police to pick up my car and phone if I didn't do what she asked. I've done everything she has asked, but I believe that doing these things really is just her way of showing her dominance over me, my grandparents have agreed to put me on their phone line and pay off the rest of the cost of my car and put it in my name if the worst comes to happen. With this argument at the forefront, there is also an underlying argument that's going on between me and my mom, it's that she really is impossible to talk to. Just last December I came to Reddit looking for help because my mom asked me to foot a $330 monthly health insurance bill, and was refusing to help me in finding a cheaper alternative. She insisted that she was right and that the $330 was the cheapest option. I even tried to talk to her about it in a very calm and civilized manner, but even though I wasn't getting aggressive, she was yelling at me about it. My grandparents helped me find a great alternative that only costs $90 monthly, and my mom just swept it under the rug like nothing happened and stopped talking about it entirely. I really don't know how I can get through to her, because all my life she has been like this, and she really just seems stuck in her ways. And just taking on all of my bills i'm a bit nervous about. I mean I already pay my health insurance and I save my money up for this activity I do during the summer that really costs a lot of money, and I don't want to give it up (it's drum corps if anyone knows what that is.) But I just want to know what you guys think, am I wrong for wanting to find new work while i'm in college that is better for me? Or is it my duty to help my father and his business regardless of what that means for my future? Should I even be worrying about my family and their well being right now when i'm in such a vulnerable state? The issue is a lot more complicated than even this, so I'm bound to miss some things. If you all need more info or clarification on anything here just let me know! Thanks in advance for your help!"
aouran,38,2019-02-09,My big problem with SR,Semencollector5000,Semenretention,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/aouran/my_big_problem_with_sr/,"I was looking forward to this weekend. 

Working 9 hours at my internship every weekday was pushing me to the limit and I was looking forward to playing videogames with my oldest internet friend, and working out in the gym without stress. I even planned to go out with someone I met on an app.


But I woke up on Saturday after 11 hours of undisturbed sleep and I felt a bitter emptiness inside me. I loaded up DotA with my friend and we lost. 

And lost. And lost. Every game was an inch away from victory and I did my absolute best, but it was not enough. I flamed him for his mistakes that lost us the matgches and after the third loss I told him he's too bad for us to be able to 
win. And that I'd rather play with complete strangers.

He's always been a bit of a doormat in our friendship, but this time I went too far. He asked what has happened to me and how I can think it's ok to treat him like that. Rightfully so. We were supposed to enjoy each others company, regardless of the outcome of our games. 

Why was I so upset?

It's 7 pm now and all my energy, confidence, positive vibes and courage was sucked out of my body into thin air. No, I didn't relapse. I also thankfully feel an immense shame and guilt for treating my oldest friend like that. The only one I had for 10+ years. I told the person from the app I'm not going anywhere and he was thoroughly dissapointed in me.

My life is at a complete standstill. I've  had a personality disorder since early childhood that blighted my life and deprived me of everything I wanted (friends, hobbies, girls). I've been fascinated by SR for many years and I've had many streaks - but the streaks that go past 40 days always end like this. In frustrating despair. Rage.

To me it's crystal clear that SR has many benefits. One of them is that your emotions become enhanced and genuine. Is this a good thing? No, not for me. Because I've always been in a mental-locked position where I can't change the things I don't like about myself.

I've done as much as I can physically. I have a bodybuilder physique at 10%~ bf and great clothes, haircut etc. But I can't change the important stuff that is lacking since my childhood (the social stuff, traumas, desire for acceptance, partnership, friends, feeling desired by someone).


I can't connect with anyone around me and I can't fool them and myself to think that I enjoy being around them when we have nothing in common with each other. So I sit where I am and always have been, alone. It's lonesome but it's the world I know and at least I feel I'm being genuine to myself and them (everyone else).

That's why I never managed to go on the year-streaks many of you have experienced. Because I'm the type of guy who can't do it because I can't handle the emotions. It's difficult enough when I'm not retaining. I can't do the right thing because I don't know what it is. Sometimes when I think I know exactly what I need to do to move forward, I lack the courage and energy to make it happen. Even trying is out of the question.

SR won't be a magic cure. I have to admit, as na√Øve as it sounds, that I was hoping it would be. 
But it's not what I wanted it to be. It only makes me more and more uncomfortable until I explode with rage (like I did with my friend today) or do something else. SR amplifies my problems and sorrows and gives me the ultimatum. 

And I always say no. I'll stay in the pit. And the time spent in the pit becomes more and more miserable until I ejaculate.

What I truly hope is that one day, perhaps 200 days of retention from now...I become so frustrated and heartbroken that I see what needs to be done and get it over with regardless of my low energy, self-hatred and confusion.

I'm not planning on breaking my retention any time soon. 

This post is a big clusterfuck and I wouldn't be surprised if I get a ban. But I had to write myself off. This is the only place where I feel understood and listened to and today pushed me beyond what I could keep internal.

aourj0,4,2019-02-09,Playstation Website woes..,roboticshrimp,sony,https://www.reddit.com/r/sony/comments/aourj0/playstation_website_woes/,"So i've had a playstation for a couple of months now (RDR2 on PC pls) and I've had -constant- issues with using the Playstation store through Firefox/Chrome and even on Android Firefox, Adblock browser, Chrome. I just thought this kind of thing wouldn't happen, as its Sony not some low budget company with an intern web dev.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just curious as to if there is anyone else who have experienced the same thing using the Playstation store/Account management pages..

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: For some reason they deducted 4.80 out of my account, I'm assuming its the monthly PSN but I can't check it as the Account management page doesn't work. I can change some things of my account page but I can't even see my transaction history..

&amp;#x200B;

Tech bit: Checking the console on each browser just returns the lovely error ""error: login\_required"" (errno 4165) even after I have logged in on each device using two-step. Purged my cache and cookies numerous times, which shouldn't be it as its across multiple platforms."

aowa33,2,2019-02-09,Don't know what I want to do with my life -- resorting to accounting [CAN],JustTell7,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/aowa33/dont_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life/,"Back in highschool, I enjoyed the idea of being an accountant and the little pamplets and talks they gave out about how I could work in different industries as an accountant which appeals to me (i.e. work in finance/accounting at RBC, BMV, Cineplex Movies, Children's Hospital). Now that I'm a year from graduating university, I'm not 100% sure on this idea once reality hit me in terms of the compensation and work environment.


I am a double major (earning a bachelors in math and a bachelors in business administration) and I really don't have a concrete ""interest"" in anything. Here's what I've done:

* I've hated math courses I have taken (pure math ugh) and haven't been good at it as others. i like the applicability of Statistics courses though.
* Computer science - though I don't have experience to be a dev (I don't know java, C+,..etc) I have done some SQL, Python HTML and thougght they were fun to use. but not sure what to do with them as a non-coder. 
* I've taken the human resource course (it was meh, wouldn't take it full time)
* business management classes (i'm very introverted/shy so meh),
* entrepreneruship (shitty experience so not what i'd do), 
* finance I and II (I've taken two but it's a bit harder for me to learn/understand and work with intangible things like stocks/bonds compared to others, and a life where money is everything and working in banks/capital markets sounds lifeless to me)
* marketing I and II surprisingly I was good at the content and enjoyed it, but i know as an introvert, i couldn't make it. it'd be nice to find something that combines marketing/ analysis/finance though?

* Supply chain management - i thought i'd enjoy it and thought it'd be a good fit after taking the first mandatory into class. Well i took a second class and feel like i won't excel in it bc of competing against engineers, plus if there's a lot of math and heirarchy issues. Still trying to see if this is a fit.

* Accounting - I'v done well in the basic accounting classes but taking Tax 1 right now makes it hard to keep my eyes open! I worry that my mental health could deteriorate if this would be my life forever :O Generally, i like how i could work as a financial analyst at tech company or something though, and I currently am thinking of the CPA route. I think a CPA is an excellent way to understand not only accounting, but business as a whole better. I enjoyed my industry accounting experience as a financial analyst, but think i would absolutely hate life in public accounting?


At the end of the day, I want to work somewhere where the work culture is great, not boring, and I am earning a good salary that's worth my educational and intern experience (I've worked as a business analyst, IT analyst and financial analyst at banks and insurance firms respective) adds value to my skills. I need advice. I've tried many things out and still don't know what I should do. Any advice?

 As some of you may know and some of you may wish not to know, I started a little experiment about 10 months ago and began eating a low-carb and high fat diet for the first time in my life. I have not been tracking macros specifically but I can say a few things: 

1) I have been in nutritional ketosis pretty much every day (as measured by countless ways) save a few days here and there where I accidentally or intentionally slipped  

2) I have eaten between 20 and 75g of carbs/day (estimated)

3) I have tried to keep my protein intake about the same  

4) Since, as I am fond of saying, nutrition is zero-sum, I increased my intake of fats. Here, I tried to keep SFA intake about the same as it was and tried to boost intake of MUFA

I have chronicled the effects on my wardrobe and belt before so why the update? Well, I finally decided to look at my lipids. But 1st, a refresher on what has happened to my body in 10 months. As an aside, I feel as good as I ever have but I can‚Äôt quantitatively prove that (yet)  Here are data from my ‚Äúsmart‚Äù scale. It‚Äôs an older Withings Body scale for those who care. Here is my weight over the past year. Since March, I am down about 18 pounds.

https://i.redd.it/kmgc28u03mf21.png

 Whatever you think about bioimpedance as a method, it is hard to argue that there has also been a change in my body composition. At one point, I think I calculated that I lost 15 pounds of fat.

https://i.redd.it/0c2rcfc43mf21.png

And finally, here is my BMI. I‚Äôll write more about this later, but I was not overweight when I started &amp; did not intend to lose weight. I was concerned about some metabolic red flags (my fasting glucose was 113 mg/dL). More later but suffice it to say that is not true today.  So what about my lipids? Well it may surprise some of you that as a preventive cardiologist, I don‚Äôt really pay much attention to them. In fact, the last time I had checked was when I did my Theranos experiment in 2015 and then it was just a plain fasting lipid profile (I had 3).  I‚Äôve never done advanced lipids before &amp; no, I‚Äôve never done a calcium scan. Here are my baseline lipids. For what they are, they were good. At this time, I was 46 &amp; my 10 year ASCVD risk was 1.4%. I did not then &amp; do not now take any medication or supplement. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/m2pmmj6c3mf21.png

Here is the update from a week or two ago. This time I did do advance lipids (the CardioIQ + inflammation from Quest). Here are just the basics. The changes are mostly what you‚Äôd expect. My TG went down and the HDLc went up and the LDLc is about the same

I'm doing this very far ahead of time but I can't help but desire to research what car I would need.

Currently, my parents pick and drop me off and that's frustrating. I'm hoping to get work or internships in the summer but they will likely not be able to drop me off. Overall, I just need a **reliable, simple, long lasting car, that's good on highways and suburban roads.**

I think I'll be able to get one the next 1-2 years. The range would probably be **6k-12k.**

I grew up with Toyotas and Suzuki, so I'd prefer Toyota and Honda being my cars of choice. I seem to get a little nauseous in bulkier or squarer cars. I don't think that issue is prevalent when I'm the driver however.

So far I've been looking at **Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit.**

Which of these would you recommend to suit me best?

My parents have a Rav4 which I adore, but is very expensive and not fuel efficient at all. I do love the height it gives me, and my parents want any car that I buy to not be close to the ground. I've also gotten very used to the rear camera and hatchback. I could go without a hatchback, but I very much desire a rear camera.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

* Used
* Long lasting
* Highways/Suburbs
* 6k-12k US
* Toyota/Honda
* Rear Camera
* Fuel Efficient (30s or higher)
* High/tall, bottom not too low to the ground. (Many very high speedbumps here)
* Hatchback (optional)"

I go by Addie here on Reddit! I have so much to say but I‚Äôm having a hard time getting my post to come up that way so I‚Äôm going to try and make this short and sweet. I‚Äôm recovering from pneumonia so please be patient!

I have been writing since I can remember, role playing for at least 10+ years. I prefer multi-paragraphs but also understand to get the story moving sometimes only a small amount of writing is necessary. I get very excited about plotting and hope to find a writing partner that can get just as into the story as me. I‚Äôm hoping to find a writing partner and friend. 

I live in the CST time zone and have a job that requires a couple 12 hour days a week but I‚Äôm always lurking on my phone. I love when we are plotting and my partner sends me a bunch of messages for me to either wake up to or see on my break!

I only write in third person and use face claims and while I do some fandom rp, I prefer original ideas which I have listed down below. 

Here I will list the fandoms I like and pairings to go along with them. I will make sure the character I would want to play are in bold font.

~Harry Potter: RemusX**Anna** (my OC which I would be more than happy to give details on if you are at all interested in this)
~Sherlock:SherlockX**Molly or OC**\
~Doctor Who: 10X**Rose**

Those are the three I have tried and would be most comfortable playing in though I am willing to try other fandoms and pairings as well!

NoneFandom ideas/plot bunnies:

\~A fantasy world with magic, dragons, all that fun stuff. We can create this world and even go as in depth as laws, days of the week, planet name. Etc. (In this one we could even play siblings that are obviously not romantically involved but maybe part of a royal family, and we could explore the dynamics of this. We could also go Royal/peasant/all sorts of possibilities here)  
\~BossX**subordinate**  
\~FBI internship: Very intelligent **high schooler** gets an internship opportunity with the FBI and one of the men on the force gets to know her and takes her along on some random missions he isn't supposed to since she is supposed to stay in the building working admin type duties at all times. (I have more on this so just let me know if you are interested at all)  
\~Mafia boss son/HeirX**News reporter** from another country:includes some super natural abilities. (another one I have more info, just message me.)  
\~Something where a female needs saving and even if they don't get along at first a male comes to the rescue. I am a sucker for the whole knight in shinning armor bit.  
\~anything rom-com (I saw someone mentioned the movie, 'While You Were Sleeping,' and I forgot how much I have been dying to play something like that but maybe with the roles being reversed! Please!!!)  
\~Having to pretend both muses are engaged to help one of them out of a sticky situation and then it eventually turns out they really do fall in love  
\~something with demons or vampires, exploring the dark sides of the universe could be super thrilling! 
\~possession 
\~anything having to do with anything supernatural. I have a particular craving for telekinesis and or telepathy right now.    \~someone famous/A fan or someone else end up together somehow  
\~two strangers trapped on an elevator (mostly because this is an actual fear of mine and maybe playing through the experience could help??)
\~I have an idea for a future world that a friend of mine and I tried to play but they lost interest so I could give you info I had on that idea. The world is semi built but does need some work still. 


Let me know if any of these ideas interest you, or if my post inspires you to want to connect and maybe discuss becoming potential writing partners with me! I'm not expecting you to be super in depth with your hello, but give me something? Looking forward to hearing from any and everyone! I don‚Äôt bite, I promise! "
aoxt1j,10,2019-02-09,Help with scumbag landlord,Quickstance,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/aoxt1j/help_with_scumbag_landlord/,"Hi:

Last term I attended UBC as an international student. After several days suffering to get a room, I found something near the campus (Acadia road to be specific).

The landlord at first looked kinda sketchy, but I was desperate to get a room. I signed the contract  and I recieved a security deposit voucher with the amount that I payed.

After months of weird things happening at the building (specially with one of my roommates that had to live with bedbugs), my internship was over and I left Vancouver. My fly was super early, so I couldn't met the landlord to get my deposit or to at least give him my forwarding address (as the law says). After talking with him, he told me that he will e Transfer my deposit.

The thing is that after 1 month and a half, I'm the only one that I haven't received his deposit. 2 of my roommates that stayed at Vancouver received their deposit and the last one waited for him to get his money when he move out.

I tried to call him several times, but he blocked my phone number. He is not responding my emails too.

Now I discovered that there are like 3-4 people that lived in the same building are in the same situation, and with no clue to what we can do.

We have an address to send the forwarding address and the RTB documents to start legal actions, but we are sure that the address is fake or that the letter is gonna bounce and return to Canada post. The address is written in the contract of my roommate.

Anyone knows what we should do to get our money back? . If we send all the documents to this address but he doesn't receive the documents, how RTB is gonna proceed? Who is gonna pay?

It's kinda sad that all my good memories and moments in the city are kinda gone just because the system and the housing market is completely fucked up...

**Gender** *: Female* 

**Age** *: 20*

**Code name***: Morrigan* 

**Affiliation** *: Talon* 

**Bio** *:   Franchesca ( four years old  ) was but a street urchin in paris during the fall of overwatch . she stole food , nicked wallets , and was a general nuisance to the nuns . Then came her adoptive mother, a woman with no morals , and even worse a fiery tongue to match her hair. her new mother never told her much , but required much of her . she began to learn all sorts of miracles of science ( her mother jokingly called witchcraft) and at her mothers strict ruling was taught ( a mastery of the biological sciences  as it were) so that she may help her in her work .* 

*"" Alanna, a name Franchesca came to cherish  , come help me with this patient"", her mother said while strapping  a thin black haired woman to her table , someone she dared not ask where the men in armor brought from( a mistake she'd made only once )  . All sorts of testing was done in the following months  , many things that ""used""  to make Alanna sick , and eventually the woman turned blue . This excited Alanna , though worried her as well. she asked her mother, "" is she ok?"" Her mother laughed , "" yes , of course she is . now help me move her to the recuperation pod  ."" After moving the patient to the pod  , and speaking with her godfather over the phone about the woman  , a man of great stature and able to fell a building her mother joked , she and her mother retired to the kitchen .* 

*"" Alanna , would you like to know why she turned blue?"" , asked her mother . Alanna quickly nodded surprised at this rare moment (though not at the question)   ,  and her mother said , "" she isn't human , at least not much anymore."" "" she's your aunt now , and she'll be your guard after her next mission . i  will be leaving for a few years for a long term program  . During that time she will teach you to defend yourself , and to move as she does . After that you will join me , and your godfather in ""our "" work . it will be difficult , but you are strong Alanna ."" Baffled by the sudden news , and sudden realization she had been working on her newest family member all along , Alanna was saddened but also reassured by her ""aunt's""  wellness  . many patients did not survive the table , something she had become desensitized to over the last 10 years .* 

*After her mother left , the woman returned , and colder in heart than her mother she was . This was something Alanna thought not possible . Amelia was her name , and for the next 6 years Amelia trained Alanna to be as cold as ice , and to move with purpose if not elegance . Alannas growing combative skill was a sight to be seen , as much as it was to be feared. Many of the skills she learned from Amelia were taught live , and gruesome as they were( or seductive , a skill much to Alanna's disdain came with difficulty , though more so to do with personality than anything with looks . just as blunt as her mother Amelia would joke ) , they all had efficiency and purpose in the end  .* 

   *Finally after years of training , and many perilous operations , Alanna joined Talon . Amelia , on that day , smiled . Alanna almost cried tears of joy , though in equal parts shivered. her aunt was not one to trust emotions to . She spoke with her mother and hugged her godfather , Akande , who  gifted her ""Omen "" tactical support weapon( a multi purpose biotic launcher)   , and her codename : Morrigan , chosen by none other than her mother . she was overjoyed , yet mute  . It was business time . Her next mission was to lead two other operatives named "" Sombra "" , and "" reaper "" ( a man  she knew much of as he constantly needed support from her mothers lab.) in obtaining the newest form of biotic technology from Angela Zieglers lab, the woman her mother loved to torment. This was her testing grounds , to show her ability .to show what she had pride in . she would show her mother she could best even her  greatest enemy .* 

*During the lab heist she learned three  things. One, her coworkers were tirelessly working  for the missions sake.Two , sombra was self centered , and reaper a temper-mental  man with little tact. Finally , this woman she was tasked to steal from was just as intelligent as her mother . Alanna was humbled .* 

*after having played the nervous  intern for two months  to get full access to the labs systems she thought it was clearly time to move . with everyone gone she prepared to begin moving the tech from the building , with reaper and sombra prepped outside , and  using her crow , Marrow,   for surveillance  .  Suddenly over the intercom Angelas voice rang ,""some people need to learn to be more patient it seems .""the exits locked  and Alanna sighed, "" it seems we're on the same page at least  , though some need to be quicker "" she said smiling as she and the equipment blinked out of thin air . Having disappeared  with the equipment, she had played ""Mrs Angel "" quite thoroughly , and as much of her time had been nothing but dealing with her overt sense of morality  , she was happy to be rid of her , or so she thought. the cargo exploded , and the truck it .  Angela stood outside waiting , looking exactly like her mother in disappointment. "" ill give you one chance "" , she said as the police began to swarm . ""tell me who sent you , and i might show mercy. "" Alanna stood and for the first time she felt not disdain for her mistake, but understanding. in that moment she knew what her mother sent her for , she sent her to learn where she stood . she looked at Dr Zeigler , and quietly said "" thank you "" as she  fired her weapon at the ground , blinding the squad surrounding her , knocking them and doctor zeigler unconcious from the blast .*  

*Reaper and Sombra  stood silently outside the office . Akande was displeased , her mother silent. finally her mother spoke , and Alanna listened . "" you failed. What did you learn ?"" Alanna , silently angry , stated"" i learned how impatient i was , and how i should not under estimate our foes"". "" just like a child , you  still have much to learn "" , her mother said . Alanna surprised as her mother showed her the equipment she stole. "" you shouldn't do things under the assumption you will always be a step ahead , but instead   be miles away before people notice you've  even been there.""her mother said amusingly. Akande silently agreed , then said "" Never again , my child "", and then to my mother ,"" and never toy with one of our assets like that again Moira "". With that it was over . Alanna in shock asked her mother ""what now?"". her mother said bluntly ,"" we get to work , i believe that was obvious. As scientists we push on , even through failure  ."" Alanna held it to heart , she would never be best in battle again , intellectually or otherwise.*

This excited Alanna , though worried her as well. she asked her mother, "" is she ok?"" Her mother laughed , "" yes , of course she is . now help me move her to the recuperation pod  ."" After moving the patient to the pod  , and speaking with her godfather over the phone about the woman  , a man of great stature and able to fell a building her mother joked , she and her mother retired to the kitchen .* 

*"" Alanna , would you like to know why she turned blue?"" , asked her mother . Alanna quickly nodded surprised at this rare moment (though not at the question)   ,  and her mother said , "" she isn't human , at least not much anymore."" "" she's your aunt now , and she'll be your guard after her next mission . i  will be leaving for a few years for a long term program  . During that time she will teach you to defend yourself , and to move as she does . After that you will join me , and your godfather in ""our "" work . it will be difficult , but you are strong Alanna ."" Baffled by the sudden news , and sudden realization she had been working on her newest family member all along , Alanna was saddened but also reassured by her ""aunt's""  wellness  . many patients did not survive the table , something she had become desensitized to over the last 10 years .* 

*After her mother left , the woman returned , and colder in heart than her mother she was . This was something Alanna thought not possible . Amelia was her name , and for the next 6 years Amelia trained Alanna to be as cold as ice , and to move with purpose if not elegance . Alannas growing combative skill was a sight to be seen , as much as it was to be feared. Many of the skills she learned from Amelia were taught live , and gruesome as they were( or seductive , a skill much to Alanna's disdain came with difficulty , though more so to do with personality than anything with looks . just as blunt as her mother Amelia would joke ) , they all had efficiency and purpose in the end  .* 

   *Finally after years of training , and many perilous operations , Alanna joined Talon . Amelia , on that day , smiled . Alanna almost cried tears of joy , though in equal parts shivered. her aunt was not one to trust emotions to . She spoke with her mother and hugged her godfather , Akande , who  gifted her ""Omen "" tactical support weapon( a multi purpose biotic launcher)   , and her codename : Morrigan , chosen by none other than her mother . she was overjoyed , yet mute  . It was business time . Her next mission was to lead two other operatives named "" Sombra "" , and "" reaper "" ( a man  she knew much of as he constantly needed support from her mothers lab.) in obtaining the newest form of biotic technology from Angela Zieglers lab, the woman her mother loved to torment. This was her testing grounds , to show her ability .to show what she had pride in . she would show her mother she could best even her  greatest enemy .* 

*During the lab heist she learned three  things. One, her coworkers were tirelessly working  for the missions sake.Two , sombra was self centered , and reaper a temper-mental  man with little tact. Finally , this woman she was tasked to steal from was just as intelligent as her mother . Alanna was humbled .* 

*after having played the nervous  intern for two months  to get full access to the labs systems she thought it was clearly time to move . with everyone gone she prepared to begin moving the tech from the building , with reaper and sombra prepped outside , and  using her crow , Marrow,   for surveillance  .  Suddenly over the intercom Angelas voice rang ,""some people need to learn to be more patient it seems .""the exits locked  and Alanna sighed, "" it seems we're on the same page at least  , though some need to be quicker "" she said smiling as she and the equipment blinked out of thin air . Having disappeared  with the equipment, she had played ""Mrs Angel "" quite thoroughly , and as much of her time had been nothing but dealing with her overt sense of morality  , she was happy to be rid of her , or so she thought. the cargo exploded , and the truck it .  Angela stood outside waiting , looking exactly like her mother in disappointment. "" ill give you one chance "" , she said as the police began to swarm . ""tell me who sent you , and i might show mercy. "" Alanna stood and for the first time she felt not disdain for her mistake, but understanding. in that moment she knew what her mother sent her for , she sent her to learn where she stood . she looked at Dr Zeigler , and quietly said "" thank you "" as she  fired her weapon at the ground , blinding the squad surrounding her , knocking them and doctor zeigler unconcious from the blast .*  

*Reaper and Sombra  stood silently outside the office . Akande was displeased , her mother silent. finally her mother spoke , and Alanna listened . "" you failed. What did you learn ?"" Alanna , silently angry , stated"" i learned how impatient i was , and how i should not under estimate our foes"". "" just like a child , you  still have much to learn "" , her mother said . Alanna surprised as her mother showed her the equipment she stole. "" you shouldn't do things under the assumption you will always be a step ahead , but instead   be miles away before people notice you've  even been there.""her mother said amusingly. Akande silently agreed , then said "" Never again , my child "", and then to my mother ,"" and never toy with one of our assets like that again Moira "". With that it was over . Alanna in shock asked her mother ""what now?"". her mother said bluntly ,"" we get to work , i believe that was obvious. As scientists we push on , even through failure  ."" Alanna held it to heart , she would never be best in battle again , intellectually or otherwise.*

I've scrolling through Reddit and in the past week I've seen multiple ""unpopular opinions"" that are against the mindset that college will equal a happy, well-paying job. Okay fine, find your bliss. If that's not college okay. But I'm tired of seeing them use the amount of debt college can cause as part of their argument.

News flash: college doesnt have to be expensive.

Yes, college can cause a lot of debt (can being the operative word). If you're going to college, then you probably are somewhat smart to begin with. So, use that brain, and apply for as many scholarships as you can. Not all scholarships are needs based so if your family is well off/middle class or higher, but aren't funding college for you, then you still have some options for scholarships.

My story: I am from a poorish family. Money has been tight some years and okay others. We do okay. I am 21F and I live at home. My parents did not have any money to put towards college for me as the youngest of four (we all went to a 4 year college and self-funded the experience). I always expected to pay for it myself. I was lucky to have a running start program at my high school so a week after I graduated high school, I got my arts and associate of science transfer degree. I then applied for as many scholarships and federal funding that I could. I chose an in-state college. I got a job while I was up there and graduated with my bachelor's degree and only $11k in loans three years later. Which, by the way, would have been only $4.7k if I had not decided on a semester long study abroad trip. I worked summers too and saved all I could from that to pay rent/tuition/books. Last summer, after graduation, I had 2 jobs to get ready for my first tuition payment for my online MBA program. I worked full time night shift and a part time morning job. 

Right now I have a paid internship and I am studying still for my masters degree. I have not taken any more loans out.

What I mean to say is that college does not inherently equal $50k+ loans by graduation. So don't say no to college because you don't want loans. Say no because you don't want to go.

Good luck doing what makes you happy!"

\*\*Backstory:\*\* -----   

John-Paul is the oldest of three grand children to the legendary gunslinger, Clint Eastwood. As a kid, JP would play Cowboy and Indians with all the kids in his neighborhood. Growing up he was an avid lacrosse player and wrestler. He was good enough to get a full ride to the University of Oregon to play both lacrosse, and wrestle, while studying Economics. There he met Adam Kidd, who was his roommate for all four-years, they even ended up rushing the same fraternity. JP became the President, and Adam was his VP.

During JP's last semester of college, he was able to acquire an internship with the UN to help develop and modernize the economy of a small mining village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At first, everything was going fine, until a local warlord decided to seize the mining village for his own nefarious purposes. For 1 month, JP was subject to inhumane conditions and forced to watch the warlord and his force commit atrocities on the local populace. The warlord quickly learned that JP's grandfather was Clint Eastwood, and used JP for extortion. During negotiations the Warlord grew impatient and decided to execute JP instead. The warlord decided to kill JP via firing squad. In that moment, JP didn't feel any amount of fear, instead there was a craving for the death of his captors. When the firing line shot, JP triggered and gained the ability to control bullets. He used bullets of the firing squad against themselves. He then got a couple of guns to some villagers who assisted him. Unfortunately, they had no training in firearms. JP was feeling that his fighting was only prolonging the inevitable, until he triggered again--&gt; allowed him to shoot ""magic bullets."" With his new powers, JP and the villagers were able to exterminate the warlord and his forces. 

JP graduated shortly after returning to the states, but his job search was fruitless. JP convinced his friend Adam Kidd, to apply to the Ashton Protectorate via Linkedn with him.

&amp;nbsp;

There was once a young man, very fierce, strong, bold and confident. Several inches over six feet, naturally strongly built, with a very significant endowment. From relatively humble beginnings, he rose high in the world, gaining power and gathering wealth.

He had many exploits, especially sexual ones. Fighting over women, seducing them. He reveled in his quest to make reluctant, or head strong women, to submit to him as his, total sluts. Gaining their trust, their affection and finally adulation, through his intensity and virility. 

Taking them away right from the arms of their loving husbands. Fucking many, many women, both single, and otherwise. Fathering several bastards. A true Alpha Male.

This lifestyle could not be sustained after he hit his mid-life. His trophy wife tolerated his dalliances and affairs, and remained distant, but his growing power and obligations meant he could not fuck anyone he wanted, or destroy marriages as he liked. The more he came into public and social limelight, the more it affected him.

So he started to establish long term relationships over the city. From college sluts, to 50 year professors, he quietly gathered a harem of women to meet his needs.

&amp;nbsp;

But one such college ""slut"", one who worked in one of his firms as an intern, had a fiery spirit and soul that matched his own. After a long while, he felt truly challenged in his quest to dominate women. And though each time he came out on the top, he loved his struggle with her. Soon, she became his confidant, and even a friend. Her bold spirit were outmatched only by her beauty and intelligence.

However, after she graduated, they started experiencing a distance creeping between them. They did loved each other, but their relationship was hardly conventional. He could never divorce his wife, or fully commit himself to a single woman, especially one who is several decades younger.

She confessed to him that she felt a hollowness that their relationship could not fill. Indeed, his drive to dominate her has left her feeling weak, tired and sometimes used and unloved. He tried to remedy that, but found he simply didn't had the time or energy, or even felt the motivation, to administer the care he should be, after fucking her and dominating her. Even her spirit had started breaking.

Moreover, her indian, hindu family had started pressuring her to get married, one her community, of their choosing. Defying them meant loosing many things, her family, social standing and support, her inheritance, and even the option of actually opting for arranged marriage as a fall back option.

Alpha did not wanted to lose his favorite slut. But somehow fate itself bends itself to cater to the strong.

&amp;nbsp;

In one of his surprise audits of his many start ups, he came across a young indian male, though he subconsciously deferred from calling him a ""man"". Too light skinned, slim, with slightly effeminate featured, he was a surprise find for the CTO of the firm, being surprisingly talented. However, his talent was largely masked by his nervous demeanor, and anxiety. He was too shy, and introverted. A Wimp, to be exact. 

The Alpha decided to take the Wimp under his ""mentor-ship"". Despite the Wimp's hesitation, he could not rebuff the Alpha's advances, and shared his number. And from their, through long chains of texts, the Wimp opened up to the Alpha. Not something that the Alpha had not done before, gaining the trust of someone, and gradually he got into the Wimp's head.

He would often share the details of his own exploits with many women, how they fawned over him, how easy it was for him. He would casually mention about how his own physique and allude to his significant endowment. He sowed and deepened each insecurity in the Wimp's mind. 

He casually kept dropping the term ""Cuck"" and ""Cuckold"" in his conversations. How brave they are. How such marriages are much more stable, as women are able to get most of both worlds.

If his plan works, then he would be able to get a Cuckold for his favorite slut. So that he can date her openly, fuck her and finally breed her with absolute impunity, while the Wimp provided for her in ways he could not find himself to.

&amp;nbsp;

Idea:

&amp;nbsp;

So the idea is that this ""Mentor"" sets up two people as a couple under him. He gains the trust of a much younger male, becomes a father figure to him, and cuckolds him fiercely, slowly breaking him with his lover. He soon becomes a chief of their household, fathering many children with his lover, and a grandpa to them.

And the woman is able to enjoy the best of both worlds, sating the exhilarating addiction of the Alpha, while having someone to love her and tend to her weary heart and soul after he takes off.

&amp;nbsp;

Storybuilding:

&amp;nbsp;

So! My apologies for the long description of the setting.

Essentially, I am looking for an indian, female partner, i am an indian guy myself. I am looking to play the role of ""the Wimp"", and building the story from our perspective as this powerful ""Mentor"" shapes our lives.

I have many kinks, but my hard limits are :blood, underage, any bodily waste/unsanitary stuff, incest and any kind of anal stuff.

I am also looking for storybuilding, rather than strictly roleplay. The difference, in my eyes, is that we will build our collective biography, together, spanning over many years, focusing on meaty parts closer to roleplay style, and a narrative style over the rest of it.

I am also open to playing other plots, or making changed to this one. This largely covers what kind of stuff i am into. 

I look forward to hearing from you."

The company I intern with offered me an internship working on RPA solutions.  This field seems like there's a lot of potential, but I'm still very naive when it comes to career planning.

They offer tuition assistance and I'm wondering if a masters degree in Systems engineering would be more useful than going the MBA route. I understand that this would be difficult with a finance background, but I think it would go well with the work that I'm performing?

I was also curious about the different jobs/opportunities that can arise for someone with RPA experience? Corporate vs. Consulting? I'm grateful just to have the opportunity I have but I'd like to hear what you guys think.

ap0sk0,56,2019-02-09,Coworker tried to get my bf arrested for sexual assault because he had a crush on me and I rejected him.,poe_land,niceguystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguystories/comments/ap0sk0/coworker_tried_to_get_my_bf_arrested_for_sexual/,"I sure hope y'all like wild gay nice guy stories because boy, oh boy, have I got a doozy for y'all today. 

I (25M) write copy for a relatively small advertising company, mostly creating slogans for print/web ads and scripts for radio jingles. In May 2018 the company took on a new employee who we'll call Ben (19M). Ben was a university student who was looking to go into advertising after graduation and wanted to get some work experience to go with his studies. It was basically a paid internship, and since he was more interested in the creative side of things he spent most of his time with me in the copy department and with our art director. 

At first, Ben seemed like a super sweet kid. He was a little shy and dorky but very enthusiastic and willing to learn. He and I got chatting when he noticed that I have a Jason Voorhees keychain and we kind of bonded over a shared love of horror movies. I kinda figured from the get go that he was gay (or at least bi) because he had pride flag and FCKH8 pins on his jacket, but I didn't really give much thought to it because why would I? There are like five other openly gay people at the company, including myself, so it's really not at all a big deal here. 

Anyway, fast forward a couple weeks and Ben and I are kinda pals. Like I said, we both had a shared love of horror movies and also discovered we had very similar music tastes. He was also seemingly very interested in learning more about my background: my dad is Polish and I was raised Jewish, neither of which were cultures he knew much about. Like I said earlier, this kid just loved to learn new things and honestly it was kinda nice to see someone have an earnest interest in my heritage, so I was more than happy to answer any of his questions. The only time he seemed to become disinterested in my life was when I'd talk about my boyfriend (24M) who, for the sake of this story, we'll call Sam. Retrospectively, I probably should have seen that as the first red flag but I can be kinda dumb sometimes and thought nothing of it. 

Things kinda started to escalate when he asked me one day if I wanted to go get coffee with him. In our office we take it in turns to do the full office coffee run each day and like I said, I can be kinda dumb and oblivious sometimes so I assumed it was his turn that day and he wanted me to help him carry stuff or whatever. I said sure and started to put my jacket on but he stopped me and we had a conversation a bit like this 

Ben: whoa whoa I didn't mean like *now* 

Me: oh. Okay well just give me a shout when you're going on the run and I'll come along with you. 

Ben: * laughs * no, dude. I mean like, let's go get coffee after work. Or at the weekend. Just you and I. 

Me: * finally realising what he's asking * oh! Um...thanks for the offer, Ben. I'm really flattered but well... you know I have a boyfriend. * Points at framed photo of Sam and I on my desk. * 

Ben: what and he doesn't let you go get coffee with a friend?!?! Jesus fucking Christ Szy, how controlling *is* he?!?!?!

He kinda stormed off in a huff before I could say anything else. Needless to say, I was totally taken aback by this but he apologised to me later and told me that he'd just been having a bad day that day and he didn't mean to take it out on me. I said it was okay and he asked if we really could get coffee just as friends some time and I said okay, though I was a little uncomfortable doing so. 

Another couple weeks pass without any real incident. I mentioned the exchange to Sam and since he's the most chilled, laid back person I've ever met he just laughed it off completely. I go to work on a Monday after Sam and I have had a weekend away and I have a bit of a bruise on my neck because we like to get a little freaky sometimes (sorry if tmi). Ben clocked the bruise as soon as I arrived at work and on our lunch break he pulled me aside. That exchange went a little bit like this: 

Ben: what the fuck did he do to you?!?

Me: what? Who? What are you talking about? 

Ben: Sam's clearly hurt you, look at this. * Strokes his finger over my neck in a move that's a bit too close to a caress for my liking *

Me: oh, that! No you don't understand it's not what it looks like we- 

Ben: you haven't got to make excuses for him, Szy. Not to me. 

Me: no, I know. It's honestly not anything bad. We just got a little...you know...carried away at the weekend.

He didn't believe me at all - I know this because his response was to hug me and remind me that I can tell him anything. I'll take this opportunity to highlight that I have been in abusive relationships in the past and am more than equipped to get myself out of them if needs be, but I did appreciate what seemed to be genuine concern. 

From this point on, however, Ben seemed to take every opportunity to highlight how much better for me he was than Sam. He drunk texted me on more than one occasion how he would never ""treat me like that"" (ridiculous, because Sam treats me like goddamn royalty) and how he was such a nice guy and Sam wasn't and how the only reason I didn't think Sam was abusive was because I'd been gaslit into thinking that. He also brought up the fact that Sam did kickboxing as proof that he's somehow violent and kept bringing up a previous incident where Sam had been involved in a bar fight. What actually happened that night was that some dude had started a fight with Sam's brother and he inserted himself to split them up. When the police looked into it they realised Sam never actually fought anybody and any charges he was facing were dropped. Ben ignored this fact and I'm honestly still not sure how he even found out about the fight in the first place. 

Things came to a head after I got stupid drunk one weekend and was convinced that I could still do handsprings like I used to be able to when I was like 9. Spoiler alert: I could not. A broken wrist and severely busted up face later and I had learned the hard way that tequila is the devil's juice and is not to be trusted under any circumstances. Of course, when I came to work with a swollen lip, broken wrist and one hell of a shiner, Ben immediately made his assumptions and confronted me after work. At this point I was really sick of his constant accusations towards Sam - like I mentioned, I've been in more than one abusive relationship in the past and Sam is the furthest possible thing from it. I lost my temper with him a little bit, told him that he needed to keep out of my goddamn relationship and mentioned that even if I was single I wouldn't date him because he was too young for me and just not my type. At this point Ben burst out crying and I worried that I'd gone to far - I told him that I was sorry I'd upset him but it hurts me when he constantly drags my lovely boyfriend like that. He didn't apologise and instead claimed he was doing it because he loved me. Reminder: we've known each other about a month and a half at this point. 

A couple of days later, I'm off work and I'm surprised when two cops show up at my house and tell me they're hear for a ""little chat"". I let them in and they tell me they're here about the call my ""brother"" made that morning. That just confused me further and I tell them as much, asking if this is some kind of wellness check. I suffer from mental illnesses that I won't go into because this isn't the place for it, but in the past I've had full-blown psychotic episodes where I was a potential danger to myself and others. On one such occasion my actual brother did call the police because he couldn't get to me and he wanted me to be safe, but I haven't had an episode like that in literally two years at this point and am managing my mental health with medication and therapy. The cops tell me no and when they explained what was going on my heart fucking sank. 

Apparently someone claiming to be my brother had called the cops and told them that my injuries came from being drugged, beaten and raped by Sam and that I had fabricated the whole drunk gymnastics story to cover for him. Of course they have to follow up on these things and Sam had been taken into custody for questioning. I told them that it was an out and out lie, that I knew exactly who had said it and gave them a list of witnesses who could corroborate that my drunken assholery actually happened. Sam was out of town the night it happened and thank God was able to prove it so he was released without charge. Naturally, Ben was arrested for filing a false report and wasting police time. He was also fired from our work. I don't know any other details about what happened because I promptly blocked him on all social media and blocked his number so I don't really have a clean ending for this. I honestly harbour no ill will towards Ben and I'm almost regretful of what happened because like I say, he was a very sweet kid in the beginning. It's a shame he's kinda messed up this way and I hope he gets the help he needs and can get his life on track and learn and grow from this experience.

ap0ykr,6,2019-02-10,Trying to come to terms with just how warped and manipulative my mom is.,nimaid,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/ap0ykr/trying_to_come_to_terms_with_just_how_warped_and/,"I think I am just posting this here to try and figure out what's real and what's a lie. I think I just need to get this out, I don't know. This is a drama that has been unfolding for 23 years and I want it to end. It's a very long story, but I'll keep it as breif as I can.

My mom and dad divorced when I was too young to remember. By all accounts (other than my moms, we'll get to that), they were both abysmal for each other. They both knew where the buttons were, and were both giddy to push them for each other. Well, my dad got weekdays and my mom got weekends. Eventually, my dad died when I was about 15, leaving me with my mother. I went through the grieving process and eventually moved on.

After a few years of that going well, we got in a brutal car accident. I had a broken arm that healed, but her foot was permenently damaged. She couldn't work, got depressed, had a one night stand with a dude who never came back, and became pregnant with twins. She asked me if I wanted to keep them or adopt them out, and being a kid who thought having siblings might be cool, I said yes. So I had agreed to help her 50% in raising them, apparently, while I was in middle school still.

Things got bad. She couldn't clean because of her foot, my brothers were chaos, and I cleaned as often as I wasn't dissociating in my room. How she would yell at me to ""GET OUT OF YOUR DAMN ROOM AND SPEND TIME WITH THE FAMILY"". Police were called often because we were so loud. There were cockroaches everywhere. Literally every person other than her says I reeked of cat piss, and so did the house. I was so depressed I did no homework and failed all my classes, even though I passed every test and teachers knew I was one of the brightest kids in the school. (The principal passed me without doing the ceremony due to this.) Eventually, CPS started taking my brothers away, then they would be back, then gone again. My mom fought them tooth and nail. Eventually I locked myself in my room during another fight, and called CPS to take me. She tried to break down the door, I climbed out the window. They got me out of there. Mom moved back across the country to be with family.

My friends parents, being amazingly kind and seeing what happened, became foster parents just to foster me. I finished high school, while trying to work through stuff with my therapist. By this point I had totally cut my mom out of my life. I went to college, and started struggling with mood and personality disorders. I was once diagnosed ADHD and Bi-Polar, but it hadn't bothered me again until now. I also started having personality issues. I had stopped seeing a therapist by this point, and eventually my grades slipped and I put college on hold. I had no money left and was trying to do my best to live off of the $10/hr paid internship I had gotten. I eventually started winding up in mental wards, and I lost my apartment due to not making any money.

Eventually I got some other jobs that supported me, and I was at least stable with the therapy and medication I had started. I was still in and out of mental wards, but I was only losing my housing every 6 months or so, and I recovered quickly. I got into some codependent relationships, those drained me for a bit, then in one big bust I had tons of realizations, dramatically broke all my existing friendships, and started finally actually recovering and overcoming the codependency and the whole mess that comes with it. That was December 2016.

After starting to build a mental resistance to manipulation, I tried to re-connect with my mom. It was slow and touchy, but I started warming up to her again. Eventually, she started being my main confidante, however her responses were always coddly very co-dependent-y. But I was so happy to finally be able to talk with someone like that again, someone safe, I turned that flag into quiet cognitive dissonance. Eventually, I deciced screw it, I'm flying out to see her. That was August 2018, not but a few months ago.

This is where I start to feel bile rise writing this. Mainly, I didn't even know what happened. She seemed so kind now, how could this be the mother I thought wronged me? Being there, having her hold me again... I was vulnerable again. It only took a day or so for her to have, somehow, genuinely convinced me of the following:

- There was a conspiracy within CPS to destroy oit family from the inside out.
- They corrupted my therapist to work against my family.
- The therapist was the one who 'tricked' me into believing the 'lies' about my mom's parenting.
- My father is the real reason I am so fucked up, and she only did her best to make it better
- That I hated my father

Okay, so I fly back to my life. I tell my therapist all these horrible things I 'remember' my father doing. These are fake memories caused by cognative dissonance. I say how perfect my mom is, I believe it. We start trying to unpack these things, we don't get far because it's like trying to grab air. I start feeling a longing for family, and realize that, technically,my grandma, her son (my dead dads brother) live in town. My mom said he was a rich asshole who bannished her for (bullshit reason here). I figure ""the truth is somewhere between"" and go try and get his side of the story. We reconnect on facebook, and make plans to meet.

So I have a very touching reunion with my grandma and them all. I catch them up with all of the above (CPS and forward is when they lost contact). They listen, I ask sincerely and honestly what his side of the story was. I am good at being neutral, and he saw it. He told me that after my dad died, my mom wouldn't stop talkingnabout what an asshole he was, in front of his brother. He asked her to stop many times, she got louder. When he told her it hurt him to hear such hatred about his dead brother, she laughed in his face. I hate to say it, but yeah, that's my mom, I knew his version was pretty much the truth right then. He also detailed how she always guilted my gradma into giving her money, they said that I was ""pay to play"", as in my mom used me to get money from them. Well, the night ends and we make plans for a week or so out.

Yesterday, I get an email from him. It has only a title, no body text, and a 6 page document in 11 point font attached. Not a good sign. It started out nice, but started detailing all the ways he sww me being manipulated. Mainly, he was infuriated that I was belittling his dead brothers name, just like my mom. He couldn't let what I thought of him sit because he knew it was a digusting lie. However, he also said he simply cannot allow that whole mess of my mothers into their life.

I'll be honest, I am struggling to figure out what to do. I know now, for certain, I will never be able to trust my mother again. I have been fighting viciously these past few days to seperate her bullshit from reality, and that's the damage she did when I knew what to expect AND only saw me for a week. I cannot put myself through this again, and I have been forced to the conclusion she does not want to change and will not change. I have to disown my mother.

What makes this even more complicated is the fact I have been trying to re-connect with my brothers. They are in foster care, but they have been talking with my mom and have formed a relationship with her. If I disown mom, I honeslty don't know if having a relationship with my brothers will be feasible. 

The complications keep going and they just don't stop. Up until today I was wishing I would just dissapear and stop bringing pain into this world, but now I see that this would not have happened if my mom didn't continually make decisions that were selfish and self-satisfying. I'm very lost and confused, my heart is in agony, and I am exausted. I don't even know if I'm looking for advice, I just... It needed to be out of my head tonight. If you've read this far, wow, and also thank you.

tldr: My family life is complicated and painful."
ap0zv3,8,2019-02-10,I feel like I‚Äôm regressing.,makdaddy5,ptsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/ap0zv3/i_feel_like_im_regressing/,"I‚Äôve never posted on here before. Actually, I‚Äôve never posted anywhere on reddit before; I mainly just read and empathize with others. But I need help. 

I was stalked. My ex boyfriend, who I only dated for a few months, stalked me for 18 months after I broke up with him. I was a senior RA at my college at the time so I lived on campus (free housing and meal plan!), and he would sit in the dining halls, lobbies, and wait for people to leave  my hall and catch the door to shove letters and jewelry under my door. He tried to pick my lock with a bobby pin at 2am. He would show up unexpectedly, everywhere. When I escaped to my parents‚Äô house for the summer, he drove 8 hours, across state lines, and sat outside my house until I got home from work. Refused to leave until I threatened to call the police. I DIDNT CALL THE POLICE. That is one of my biggest regrets. 

When I came back to campus in the fall, I was having panic attacks almost daily. Couldn‚Äôt be in my room without the door locked and furniture pushed in front of it. Saw the free campus therapist, wasn‚Äôt helping, ran out of sessions. Jumpy, hypervigilant, exhausted all the time, numb. Dazed. Paralyzed. I think a part of me has been paralyzed since two years ago when it all started. 

Flash forward six months. He showed up to my best friend‚Äôs birthday party (she wanted to go bar hopping). He pretended not to see me, but he was there. Within 10 feet. My skin was crawling. He was wearing a pink patterned shirt; it looked awful. How come I can remember exactly what shirt he was wearing that night, but I can‚Äôt remember the order things happened the day he showed up at my parents‚Äô house?

He graduated college, moved back to his hometown a couple hours away. I felt like I could breathe again. Breathe with a weight on my chest, but breathe at least a little. I could go study at coffee shops again. I could go out to my favorite bar once every couple months, wearing all black, keeping my blonde hair hidden, staying in the shadows. A nice man, a genuinely nice man who loves his mom and has the most positive energy and treats me better than any male has ever treated me before, fell in love with me. I opened myself up to the possibility of falling in love with him too. 

This past summer. July 2018. He somehow left a voicemail on my phone, at first it could have been ‚Äúmistaken‚Äùas a butt dial when I heard him introducing himself to someone, but then there was over a minute of footsteps and heavy breathing‚Äîeven though his number is blocked, even though there were no missed calls on my phone. I finally called the police, filed a police report, detailed everything that had happened over the past 18 months. Police couldn‚Äôt figure out how the voicemail got on my phone. I decided to file for a restraining order. Got the temporary one. Got to court, saw him for not even 3 seconds through a window. He stared right at me. It was all he wanted, to be near me again. I froze. I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt do it, couldn‚Äôt sit in the same room with him while a judge deliberated whether all the emotional and sexual and spacial abuse was true, was valid, was enough. I backed out. He walked. 

I found out five weeks ago that he had moved back to the city I will be living in until at least August. He‚Äôs working for the Democratic Party of (state we live in)‚Äîapparently they hired him even with the record of having a restraining order filed against him. 

Since then it‚Äôs been, what, 6 months since I saw him in court? When I knew he wasn‚Äôt here, I felt better. Not okay, because he still knows what city I live in, but at least I knew he had a job in another city that he was probably at, so I could leave the security of my locked apartment without gripping my bottle of Xanax in one hand and my individually-dyed canister of pepper spray in the other (I‚Äôm doing that again). Since I found out he moved back, I feel like I‚Äôve regressed back to almost two years ago when he had dropped out of school to stalk me full time. I‚Äôve been consistently hypervigilant, needing to sit both where I can see everyone who comes into a building and be close to an exit, terrified by every single white man with blond buzzcuts and/or khakis. Locking my bedroom door and pushing furniture in front of it. I can‚Äôt focus on hospital applications for shit. (they‚Äôre due in 5 weeks and I‚Äôve barely started). A knock on the door or unknown number on my phone sends me to the verge of a panic attack. I almost wish that he would show up again and do something, so that I would have a legit, concrete reason to call the police.

I finally made the leap to see a psychiatrist last week. I was officially diagnosed with PTSD, had meds switched and added, and am maybe 30% of the person I was before all this happened. The adderall helps me focus on internship applications, prazosin helps me sleep without the nightmares and cold sweats, antidepressants switched and increased. I‚Äôm hopeful that, in time, they will help, or my psychiatrist will find the right combo. Until then, what the FUCK do I do? How do I cope with this regression of symptoms? These next five weeks are literally the most important of my life. These applications determine whether or not I get an internship, which is required for me to pass my certification exam and officially receive those coveted letters after my name. I do not have TIME for PTSD. I do not have time to feel re-traumatized by various triggers every day. 

Please help me?"

On Tuesday morning my 57-year-old father had a heart attack and unfortunately passed away.  I'm still in shock and I know the hardest times are ahead, due to the fact that I at 23 years old, cannot wrap my head around what happened.  None of it feels real, and my house has been quiet as it's just my mom and I now.  

The sadness and pain comes in waves.  One moment I feel motivated to continue what I was in progress of accomplishing, notably my degree and my search for an internship.  Other moments I'm overcome by feelings of grief, sadness, guilt, nostalgia and pure pain.  I second guess how I feel because I don't know if it's the ""right"" way to feel.  Am I crying too much? Too little?  Am I wrong for even being on reddit right now? Who the fuck knows. 

I've been sleeping like shit.  A couple glasses of Canadian Club help me relax at night, in combination with a strong dose of nicotine.  My father was a smoker, and I should know better, but I'm a fucking mess. 

My father was never a big deadhead, not anywhere close to the fan that I have become anyway.  I think at first when I became interested in the dead he was worried I would go off and smoke a bunch of pot and dose and become a degenerate.  After a while, he would talk to me about the dead, share news stories via email about Dead &amp; Co and even bought me tickets for one of the shows I was going to.  I look back and wish we had gone to one together but I know it wasn't totally up his alley.  If he had to pick a favorite song by the dead it would be Box of Rain.  I'm not even totally sure if he knew Phil sang it, rather than Jerry or someone else.  He just wasn't super into them.  He preferred Springsteen, The Kinks, Aerosmith, Zeppelin &amp; the christmas music of Glen Campbell. 

I just hope a box of rain will ease my pain and love will see me through. Thank you for reading and I love this community. "

ap2u8f,1,2019-02-10,[M4F] The Kindly Mentor (Cuckolding in Indian cultural context),lookingforagoddess,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ap2u8f/m4f_the_kindly_mentor_cuckolding_in_indian/,"Setting:

&amp;nbsp;

There was once a young man, very fierce, strong, bold and confident. Several inches over six feet, naturally strongly built, with a very significant endowment. From relatively humble beginnings, he rose high in the world, gaining power and gathering wealth.

He had many exploits, especially sexual ones. Fighting over women, seducing them. He reveled in his quest to make reluctant, or head strong women, to submit to him as his, total sluts. Gaining their trust, their affection and finally adulation, through his intensity and virility. 

Taking them away right from the arms of their loving husbands. Fucking many, many women, both single, and otherwise. Fathering several bastards. A true Alpha Male.

This lifestyle could not be sustained after he hit his mid-life. His trophy wife tolerated his dalliances and affairs, and remained distant, but his growing power and obligations meant he could not fuck anyone he wanted, or destroy marriages as he liked. The more he came into public and social limelight, the more it affected him.

So he started to establish long term relationships over the city. From college sluts, to 50 year professors, he quietly gathered a harem of women to meet his needs.

&amp;nbsp;

But one such college ""slut"", one who worked in one of his firms as an intern, had a fiery spirit and soul that matched his own. After a long while, he felt truly challenged in his quest to dominate women. And though each time he came out on the top, he loved his struggle with her. Soon, she became his confidant, and even a friend. Her bold spirit were outmatched only by her beauty and intelligence.

However, after she graduated, they started experiencing a distance creeping between them. They did loved each other, but their relationship was hardly conventional. He could never divorce his wife, or fully commit himself to a single woman, especially one who is several decades younger.

She confessed to him that she felt a hollowness that their relationship could not fill. Indeed, his drive to dominate her has left her feeling weak, tired and sometimes used and unloved. He tried to remedy that, but found he simply didn't had the time or energy, or even felt the motivation, to administer the care he should be, after fucking her and dominating her. Even her spirit had started breaking.

Moreover, her indian, hindu family had started pressuring her to get married, one her community, of their choosing. Defying them meant loosing many things, her family, social standing and support, her inheritance, and even the option of actually opting for arranged marriage as a fall back option.

Alpha did not wanted to lose his favorite slut. But somehow fate itself bends itself to cater to the strong.

&amp;nbsp;

In one of his surprise audits of his many start ups, he came across a young indian male, though he subconsciously deferred from calling him a ""man"". Too light skinned, slim, with slightly effeminate featured, he was a surprise find for the CTO of the firm, being surprisingly talented. However, his talent was largely masked by his nervous demeanor, and anxiety. He was too shy, and introverted. A Wimp, to be exact. 

The Alpha decided to take the Wimp under his ""mentor-ship"". Despite the Wimp's hesitation, he could not rebuff the Alpha's advances, and shared his number. And from their, through long chains of texts, the Wimp opened up to the Alpha. Not something that the Alpha had not done before, gaining the trust of someone, and gradually he got into the Wimp's head.

He would often share the details of his own exploits with many women, how they fawned over him, how easy it was for him. He would casually mention about how his own physique and allude to his significant endowment. He sowed and deepened each insecurity in the Wimp's mind. 

He casually kept dropping the term ""Cuck"" and ""Cuckold"" in his conversations. How brave they are. How such marriages are much more stable, as women are able to get most of both worlds.

If his plan works, then he would be able to get a Cuckold for his favorite slut. So that he can date her openly, fuck her and finally breed her with absolute impunity, while the Wimp provided for her in ways he could not find himself to.

&amp;nbsp;

Idea:

&amp;nbsp;

So the idea is that this ""Mentor"" sets up two people as a couple under him. He gains the trust of a much younger male, becomes a father figure to him, and cuckolds him fiercely, slowly breaking him with his lover. He soon becomes a chief of their household, fathering many children with his lover, and a grandpa to them.

And the woman is able to enjoy the best of both worlds, sating the exhilarating addiction of the Alpha, while having someone to love her and tend to her weary heart and soul after he takes off.

&amp;nbsp;

Storybuilding:

&amp;nbsp;

So! My apologies for the long description of the setting.

Essentially, I am looking for an indian, female partner, i am an indian guy myself. I am looking to play the role of ""the Wimp"", and building the story from our perspective as this powerful ""Mentor"" shapes our lives.

I have many kinks, but my hard limits are :blood, underage, any bodily waste/unsanitary stuff, incest and any kind of anal stuff.

I am also looking for storybuilding, rather than strictly roleplay. The difference, in my eyes, is that we will build our collective biography, together, spanning over many years, focusing on meaty parts closer to roleplay style, and a narrative style over the rest of it.

I am also open to playing other plots, or making changed to this one. This largely covers what kind of stuff i am into. 

I look forward to hearing from you."

Suburban estate with manicured estate, [Gorgeous and classy](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xfPxJ0ASy9U/V3cBzlKFM0I/AAAAAAAAaFI/J1t3Jk8OJGgwVuu7ogxCXb5SfV0Kzt7qQCLcB/s1600/Brunette25.jpg)  wife that I've been happily married to for 8 years. She seemingly has not aged a day. And then, not only did I win the lottery with Sofia, a half-Mexican half-white, god-fearing, church-going sweetheart with a bit of a thick accent due to her father's State Department service through her formative years. Even more of a blessing, I suppose, lies in the fact that she has had only 3 sexual partners prior to our nuptials to my knowledge. Yet, she's drop dead gorgeous and a motivated, loving partner.

Despite my overt attempts to spoil her and persuade her to become a stay at home mom, her passion for teaching Spanish at the local public High School in our fairly well-known college town exceeds her materialistic pursuits. I've adorned her in designer clothes, custom Range Rovers, and a myriad of romantic wine and dine nights.

Yet, we've been trying for kids for the past few years with no luck.

And this is where I confess my, well, sins, poor thoughts or what have you. We met when I was younger, handsome and in shape. I played tennis daily and swam laps nightly. The weight of the world encumbered my shoulders. A nice part time job transformed into an internship and transformed into a stress inducing, managerial position at a prominent acquisitions firm. The responsibilities piled up; as did my belt size. My boyish good looks gave way to stress lines, and my once present 6 packs dissipated into a beer gut. My 5"" cock that, perpetually self conscious about but masked by looks, body, and charm morphed into an unfuckable middle manager type with a large paycheck. Our sex life probably has suffered as my confidence dissipated.

&amp;#x200B;

As I go through the motions of another day of figuring out how to capitalize on our next merge, an old colleague calls me up. His nephew is coming to start college in my town in a few months. Cool. Whatever. Congrats.

""He needs a place to stay, can he crash in your poolhouse until the dorm situation crystallizes? You'd be doing me a favor. He's a good kid, I vouch for him, he'll do your pool and yard work for you while there...""

""No problem. Here's the address"" as I cut off my old pal.

My eyes shot wide as I answered the door. Standing there was a chiseled, classically handsome man with tight shorts and a tank top on. Looking at him at eye level, he was everything I once was and no longer was as my beer gut and thinning hair contrasted by his washboard abs, broad, thick muscles, and golden blond hold styled like a movie star. We shook his hands, his firm grip almost bruised my hand. As he walked in, I noticed a huge sway in his step, it was no secret that this cocky bastard wasn't wearing boxers and he was packing an enormous cock. I glanced down and noticed the outline, big, thick, veiny, and pointing towards his left knee cap, with a large bend in the mid-shaft, he had to be about 9"" soft. I gulped in intimidation as this stronger, more handsome, hung stud was about to move in.

I offered him a beer as we made our way into the house and casually talked about house rules. Polite. He kept thanking me for the hospitality and swearing he'd help out anyway he could.  It didn't take less than an hour for him and his cavalcade of acquaintances to move into the pool house. Gorgeous, nubile, pert women parading in and out of the guest estate.

The first few nights of having company were christened with moans and groans of pleasuring from the pool house, bouncing and emanating off my walls. I could almost swear that one night Sofia was up, laying next to me,touching herself to the sounds collapsing off the walls....

Maybe you are one of the women I am working under and I am not pulling my weight [So you see what I am good for](https://gfycat.com/WarmNextDegu).

There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

Maybe I am interviewing for the position and you're asing what attributes I have, I can't help but stare and get hard and you want to utilize my biggest attribute.

Or even I walk into your office and catch you masturbating. You chase after me and suck me for my silence.

Maybe you have your own idea.

Below are my kinks.....

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

So for the context, my boyfriend and I (19F) have been dating for 2 years. Prior to that, he and his friend (21F, let‚Äôs call her Sara) were kinda into each other, but I had a crush on him so I asked him out and we started dating. 

When we started being a couple, one of his friend asked him ‚ÄúHow can you do that to Sara? It‚Äôs not fair to her, yada yada.‚Äù 

Now, 2 years into the relationship, I know they‚Äôre still friends and it doesn‚Äôt bother me. But, he always chats with her (by text or messenger) when I‚Äôm not there. If I am, he‚Äôll try to hide it. Recently, my boyfriend is trying to find an internship and his friend is helping him way more than she should (always texting him LinkedIn links, even when he told her that LinkedIn wasn‚Äôt adequate for what he searches). She always sends him paragraphs, tries to chat with him whenever she can... she had a boyfriend but broke up recently. 

When I try to speak with my bf about the fact that he hides the messages (you know the messenger bubble? When she pops he hides it as quick as he can), he tries to change the subject or laughs and dismisses it as if it‚Äôs nothing. He never replies to her when I‚Äôm next to him, and just seems really secretive when it comes to her. 

So I don‚Äôt know what to do, it seems weird to me because I never hide my texts with my boy friends, so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal and how I should react. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend is always texting this girl and hides it but he always dismisses it when i approach the subject. What can I do ?

I had a 3.6 GPA, about a 3.3 science GPA (hard to tell as some of my advanced psych classes count while others don't). I never know how important it is I mention my strange living circumstances in relation to my grades as I feel they should have been higher, but... I was sexually abused as a child for around a decade, grew up in poverty and sometimes homelessness, with a drug addict mother and explosively abusive stepfather. But I kept my head and made it through high-school with over a 4.0 GPA. I went to college. During my sophomore college year I was coerced into sex work for a time by my abusive (first) boyfriend, raped twice in different incidents unrelated to the sex work (both people I'd been on a first date with trying to move on from my abusive boyfriend), then my junior year my house was condemned after a drunk driver drove into it and left me homeless and couch-surfing that semester. My only C (Advanced Molecular Biology) and cluster of Bs (Ochem and Physics) were during this very difficult time period for me. The trauma I endured in college so neatly reflected my previous experiences as a child that it opened floodgates I didn't even know existed; I was broken. I went from a bright, vibrant, sweet-hearted woman to an anxious, mistrustful, blah of a husk. I was dealing with major suicidality and an inability to leave my home due to fear (meaning I missed a lot of class which tanked my grades--those Cs and Bs I was referring to, I never failed a class). I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder my junior year but had likely had it for quite some time before this, perhaps even as a child.

&amp;nbsp;

After I graduated, I was planning on med school, studied 6 months for my MCAT, then right before I took it, I learned a lot about med school I didn't like (lack of geographic flexibility when job hunting, how the STEP results play into your Match results, how some doctors have less direct patient contact than I'd like). I began looking into PA school. Only problem is this is clearly not how I structured my college career--not enough pre-reqs and not enough experience in the field.

&amp;nbsp;

2017-2018 I studied for my MCAT, worked as a stock clerk to repay my loans (quickest job I could find), tutored my 50 years old non-traditional student aunt to an MBA (I have never taken a business class, had to learn it to teach it--she went from knowing only basic arithmetic to passing with straight As), helped raise my new sibling and his caretaker (my grandmother) when she was diagnosed with cancer, took time to exercise more and lose weight, and began seeing a therapist more intensely for treatment of PTSD. I took time to tend my loans, tend my family, and tend my own well-being.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently taking the pre-reqs I did not during my BA (Human ANP 1--I took Comparative cause for med school it was more competitive--and Medical Terminology+ANP 2 next semester). I should have all of my pre-reqs done by this December (so long as my Advanced Molecular Bio counts as Microbio--otherwise I need to take Microbio).

&amp;nbsp;

I have only 150 hours of clinical experience working as a psychometric intern (someone who administers psychological exams) and they were documented by someone who has moved to another country that I have no way to contact. I am looking into a summer phlebotomy program so that I can get a job that's more clinical. I'm also planning on volunteering at the hospital in a direct care role for their psych department.

&amp;nbsp;

I need advice:  

1. Is it even practical for me to consider PA school after having such a long gap?  

2. Should I mention my mental health anywhere or the traumatic experiences that shaped college life for me in my application--seeing as it was the major reason for my gap and was an extenuating circumstance considering my grades? Would mentioning this disqualify me or make me seem like less of a candidate? I worry I will seem less capable and weak. I feel my use of these three years has been good for me,--learning to care better for myself I think will make me a better clinician and less likely to burn-out than my peers--but do other people see it the same or do they see me as a slouchy stock-clerk who fucked off and didn't live up to their potential? Before school it was personally important to me to get my mental, physical, and financial health into better shape lest I crumble in PA (at the time med) school.  

3. How much clinical experience should I realistically be looking to get?  

4. What steps should I be taking now to get into PA school?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi:

Last term I attended UBC as an international student. After several days suffering to get a room, I found something near the campus (Acadia road to be specific).

The landlord at first looked kinda sketchy, but I was desperate to get a room. I signed the contract and I received a security deposit voucher with the amount that I paid.

After months of weird things happening at the building (especially with one of my roommates that had to live with bedbugs), my internship was over and I left Vancouver. My fly was super early, so I couldn't meet the landlord to get my deposit or to at least give him my forwarding address (as the law says). After talking with him, he told me that he will e Transfer my deposit.

The thing is that after 1 month and a half, I'm the only one that I haven't received his deposit. 2 of my roommates that stayed at Vancouver received their deposit and the last one waited for him to get his money when he moves out.

I tried to call him several times, but he blocked my phone number. He is not responding to my emails too.

Now I discovered that there are like 3-4 people that lived in the same building are in the same situation, and with no clue to what we can do.

We have an address to send the forwarding address and the RTB documents to start legal actions, but we are sure that the address is fake or that the letter is gonna bounce and return to Canada post. The address is written in the contract of my roommate.

Anyone knows what we should do to get our money back? . If we send all the documents to this address but he doesn't receive the documents, how RTB is gonna proceed? Who is gonna pay?

It's kinda sad that all my good memories and moments in the city are kinda gone just because the system and the housing market is completely fucked up...

How can I immerse myself in the material i'm studying?",Slipstreamslumber,studying,https://www.reddit.com/r/studying/comments/ap76wn/love_the_program_im_in_but_easily_distracted_no/,"Hi all,  


This is my second semester returning to college after a hiatus of nearly a decade. I have always struggled with paying attention, especially when it comes to studying. I had an IEP in grade and highschool, but haven't been diagnosed with anything since (nearly 20 years). I don't have health insurance to get a proper diagnosis these days, but if I had to guess, ADD would once again at least be part of the issue.  


I love the program i'm in now. The medical sciences have always been my passion. As a matter of fact, I want to do nothing more than study and immerse myself into the material. My problem isn't that I don't like it, but partially that I have a hard time starting to study and staying focused. First, the way I perceive time is a little strange. I feel like it either passes too fast or too slow (usually too fast). I know it's important to take breaks, but I don't quite know when it's okay to take a break. I love learning and I feel that I work best when fully immersed regardless of however long a period of time. Also, admittedly I'm working through a lifetime of insecurities and I think i'm also kind of lazy about small, petty stuff like writing and even often catch myself skipping paragraphs in the reading because my brain automatically discredits it as too much or too boring. Even writing this post, I automatically keep switching to check for new messages on my phone if I feel my brain is ever so slightly taxed, or if I feel my grammar isn't perfect. I have friends but none of them share my interest for the medical sciences and I don't really make new friends. I feel absolutely blessed to live and work in NYC, and although not in my ideal position, getting here was quite the journey.  


I'd like to reach out to the Reddit community in hopes of anyone offering genuine advice (preferably backed by some sort of empirical data) that can help me stay immersed in the material i'm studying. One of the solutions I've thought about is to frequent the tutoring lab at my university. The problem I have is not knowing how to approach a tutor or the staff at the lab about basically reteaching me everything they know.. and having some sort of routine. For example, if I walked into the tutoring lab between classes and wanted to review or recap the chapters we were studying in class, what would I ask a Biology or a Chemistry tutor on duty when I don't know how to get started?   


Other solutions I had in mind were to find a person or group that share my passion for the subject.  I have thought about joining groups perhaps joining a medical science club or group in NYC, but I've always had trouble with this one, imo due to many of my insecurities. I'm kind of a big guy and people have always told me that I can be rather intimidating, which (full disclosure) doesn't help that i've also been quiet and shy for most of my life. Finally, I've thought about getting a job/internship in the field (which would probably be ideal), but my credentials are lacking.  


TL;DR  
\-Have trouble with time perception (usually goes by too fast)  
\-Have problems getting started and staying focused on study material that I LOVE  
\-Insecurities.. affect many aspects of my life &amp; discourage  
\-Laziness  
\-How to ask tutoring lab at university for help getting started and recapping and/or relearning material  
\-How to find medical science groups or clubs with like-minded people in NYC  
\-How to find an internship or job in field i'm pursuing to help learn

All interns for Lockheed Martin are required to be tested for drug use. The imperfect test gives positive results (indicating drug use) for 80% of all interns who actually use drugs but also (incorrectly) for 3% of those who do not use drugs. Suppose that only 10% of all of these interns actually use drugs. If an intern is tested negative, what is the probability that he/she uses drugs?

I wanna say that the probability would be equal to P(uses drugs|tested negative), so:

P(uses drugs)\*P(negative test result) / P(Negative test result)  =  .10 \* .20 / .20  =  .10 = 10%

This is my first post in this community and on reddit. I felt compelled to contribute something and hopefully receive help. I am 22/M and I am in my senior year at a Pennsylvania university. 

Recently I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 after a period of mood alterations that really took a toll on my life. I felt great coming out of this past summer and just went on an awesome solo vacation to NYC (I‚Äôm very independent, struggle with relationships)... anyway, I began to get depressed again and the low hit hard and for a long time. This really hurt my school performance initially and basically canceled out my social life for the fall semester. I didn‚Äôt go to the bar once (which is sad for a college town full of fun bars).

Eventually I began to come out of it as 2018 came to a close, and I started to feel better than I have in my entire life. I didn‚Äôt consider it as mania but as ‚Äúthings coming together‚Äù as I get ready to graduate in May. During this short period, I talked my way into an internship, started working in a different department at my work, almost seemed to reignite my social life, and managed to rekindle a relationship with my parents whom I don‚Äôt normally have the best history with. 

With this came classic symptoms like drug use (let me say I enjoy drugs from time to time, but during this period I was enabling several addictions), no sleep/no need for sleep, extreme grandiosity, being over-confident, and being highly social as well as highly-energetic. 

This had to end eventually, and it did last week. I woke up and just felt ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù Nothing had changed, I was just waking up for my morning shift at work after an early night aka no partying/drinking. 

I wanted to stay in bed. It took me forever to get ready. I was pissed I had to make the drive. I was pissed at whoever made the schedule. &amp; most of all...the thoughts. They ran through my head all day and I couldn‚Äôt put on a happy face. This continued as it always does, into a spiral of sorts. 

Fast forward to this week. School has started back and things are incredibly hectic. I‚Äôm depressed and irritable as hell. I hate going to class. I‚Äôm gaining weight. Normally, I would sleep constantly and spend much less money during depression, but I‚Äôm blowing all this cash on books/university BS and I‚Äôm all over the place at events (I‚Äôm very involved in clubs; VP of a prominent campus club). So I am overcoming some things. The main problem is, I absolutely cannot keep my head on straight and the crying spells that I get randomly are killing me. I don‚Äôt want to get together with my college friends, as I‚Äôve turned down most of their offers. I don‚Äôt want to leave my room and I haven‚Äôt been able to resist self-harm. I also have a problem with skin-picking, which seems to be awful when I‚Äôm deeply depressed. This leads to anxiety and me thinking I need to stay at home because I have scars. 

How can I ever hold down a job or relationship in life if I don‚Äôt have the same goals/energy from week to week, month to month? Can I stop feeling like a ping pong ball? 

I‚Äôm seriously frustrated and just need some advice to keep going strong. I‚Äôve been dealing with depression since I was in my early teens and have been in and out of group homes/institutions. I want to have some normalcy and I feel like I have a lot to contribute to society if it weren‚Äôt for so many hurdles. It‚Äôs killing my will to keep pushing forward with things. 

To add I‚Äôm on Lamictal at 100mg via my psychiatrist and it does help with the highs. It won‚Äôt let me get too angry or revved up, like how beta blockers make a fight/flight response nearly impossible. However, it does nothing for the lows. I‚Äôve never had good body chemistry with a lot of typical ADs but it looks like I need to add something else in. 

Idk, feel free to share advice "

That might be a scratch but hear me out. 

So first of all my hero season 1 ended in June¬†26,¬†2016 and season 2 stared in March¬†25,¬†2017. (which is around 8-9 mouths break) than season 3 started 6 mouths later. Now with season 4 Studio bone had over a year to start working on it and which they started to work on season 4, even before season 3 ended (Which damn Studio Bone, you're too amazing) So Im sure they have least started or now thinking of a season 5 of the series. But you made being asking there isn't enough contact for a season 5 right now (With there 25 episode thing Studio Bones has been doing per season) , but there is a enough contact for a season 5 RIGHT NOW! (If Bones stay with their 25 episodes per season thing)

&amp;#x200B;

**Now if you are a anime-only and don't want to be spoiled on what the seasons are going to be about, than I suggest to back way now because I don't want to ruin you anime experience with my hero, with the anime-onlys**

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen People saying they (Studio Bones) with put the Internship Arc, The Remedial Course Arc, and ended it off with the U.A. Cultural Festival Arc in season 4. But think about it there is NO WAY that they can cramp The internship arc which is like 40 chapters long into a 12 episode arc. So what I'm think is they will ONLY put the Internship Arc (Which can be like 20-21 episodes long), The Remedial Course Arc (Which can be like 2-3 episodes), and had 2 filler episode (which are the best filler I've seen from a anime). That how I see season 4 being if Studio Bones stay with their 25 episode pre season thing.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW WITH SEASON 5!!! They can start with the U.A. Cultural Festival Arc (15 Chapter) Which can be 7 - 8 episodes long, The Pro hero arc (10 chapter) Which can be 4 - 6 Episodes long. (Maybe 3 episodes, This is where the chapters get shorts) And then ended season 5 with the Joint Training Arc (Around 25 chapters. Might not have ended yet officially) But this could be a 12 episode arc easy with the 13 pages that has been happening with my hero's manga and with the arc being mostly fights I can this the 12 episode arc thing happening.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I may be wrong. Who knows they might announce that season 4 might be long like 32 eps or 50 (I know that 50 eps is not possible for a season 4)  but I'm saying WHAT IF here OH OK.  They can announce anything here, beside season 4 of course. Maybe a new movie or my hero academia vigilantes anime (That would be nice) Who knows. I may be right I may be wrong.

My  girlfriend and I have been discussing getting married recently, but  yesterday we had an argument about college funds for our future  child/children.

I  grew up middle class, while she was very much upper class. She had  significantly more financial support from her family. My parents made me  pay my own way through college (tutition, housing, food, etc) while her  parents paid for everything, including multiple vacations throughout  the year. My parents did contribute about 5k towards my loans once I  graduated, which I was very thankful for. I worked a part time job  through college and applied for every scholarship possible, while she  just took classes and had fun.

Now,  I am the primary breadwinner in our relationship (more than 2x what she  earns). She said if we get married, we should setup a college fund to  pay for our future child's education. I disagreed, I said we should  setup a small fund for help them, but that they should pay for the bulk  of their own education. My position was that knowing I had to pay for my  own loans was a huge motivator to apply for every scholarship, get  internships, and in general work hard through school. Her argument is  that she would want 'what is best for our kids'... I believe what is  best is that they don't get carried through life on their parents  coat-tails, but work hard and build discipline.

We  got into a big argument, and I suggested maybe she should pay for their  education then, since she had hers paid for, basically to 'pass-it-on'.  She got very upset at this.

Realistically  we can afford to pay for their education. At worst it would put our  retirement back a few years. We just fundamentally disagree about  whether doing that is what is best for the child.

How can we compromise on this?

tldr;

She had her college paid for, and wants to do the same for our children. I paid my own way and want my children to do the same."
ap9c05,2,2019-02-10,Need advice.!!! Very long I know but anything helps!!!,McGlone17,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ap9c05/need_advice_very_long_i_know_but_anything_helps/,"So this girl(22) and I (23) started working together in the summer when she had a boyfriend. We kind of flirted but never anything too serious as i knew she had a boyfriend. Later in summer they break up because he cheated on her. They had gone out for 2 years and she was heartbroken as she has told me he was her first love. Nothing really happens as we finish summer working together and she goes back to school. We Snapchat a little bit but nothing major but she comes back to work at same place in October because her school is only 30 mins away and she needs money of course like every college student so we see each other more often. Around the beginning of November after working a shift together she tells me she wants to go to a local bar so I agree and meet her there. We have a great time and it is very flirtatious on both parts. I leave the bar and she FaceTimes me for 2 hours when she goes back to her friends house to sleep. After this we started talking everyday morning to night to which she initiated I would say 80% of the time. We learn about each other, and really start actually liking each other I would say. To me this is great because she is an attractive girl and I‚Äôm thinking great let‚Äôs just see how this plays out and she agrees to that. She opens up early and has a very rough past such as abandonment from father and drug addict mother so she has bounced around different family member houses her whole life and she opened up to me very early because she said she trusted me to which I answered I‚Äôm happy to hear that and she absolutely could. She also tells me stories of her past trying to kill her self by overdosing on sleeping pills, cutting herself, possibly having BPD, just ALOT of crazy things.

Our first date I guess you can was Black Friday where I took her to the mall and we shopped, this is also the first time we hooked up. The talking and everything continues, we hangout 2-3 times a week and she slept over many times meeting my family to which again she initiated wanting to do.We also had sex pretty often, almost every time she came over. But we still talk everyday, work together, hangout 2-3 times a week, all signs a relationship is on the horizon. Anyway a couple weeks later she finds out the girl she got cheated on with is pregnant and she tells me it‚Äôs hard to process to which I say I understand but that she deserves so much better and I‚Äôm here for her now and will prove that to her. A couple days later however she starts acting hot and cold and saying how she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants right now because she is stressing from school and life and doesn‚Äôt know if she wants a relationship and we should slow things down. I agree to just say yea but we keep talking everyday and nothing really changes at this point.She telks me says a couple days later she knows what she is getting me for Christmas another initiated thing because I had no plans to get her anything but now I feel obliged too so I go all out for her, getting her tickets to a cowboys game because she never been to one and she‚Äôs a huge fan, a jacket she wanted and makeup to which this comes out to about 600$. She says she wants me to spend time with her on Christmas Eve so I go to her house, have a good time and at the end of the night. I say I love you. Mistake I know but it slipped out honestly and while I can say I do love her I didn‚Äôt mean to say it. She was freaked out I could tell and we didn‚Äôt really talk about it till the next day when she asked why I said that and I say it slipped out but it was more of an I love you thanks for having me as you would say to a friend really. She says ok and nothing really else about that. A couple days later we go to NYC to a restaurant she wanted to go to and have a good time, her putting up a picture on Instagram and Facebook. We‚Äôre holding hands, she‚Äôs kissing me, saying she was my girlfriend a couple times, all good things. 

She is still hot and cold though saying how she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants and if she wants a relationship but how she likes me and doesn‚Äôt want to stop talking to me or lose me. So I keep on and we keep going she comes to a family party, we hangout with friends both mine and hers, we hangout on New Years with her friends, but I still get the vibe of her being hot and cold with me. But this time around idk if she had been doing it the whole time she is snap-chatting and texting other guys, I don‚Äôt say anything but it bothers me like no other. We talk everyday too but she interns during the day and sometimes work at night so us hanging out is mainly on weekends now. One day she goes out to dinner with her friend and we have plans to meet at a bar afterwards. We didn‚Äôt talk for 2-3 hours and then she texts me saying their coming with some random guys that brought them drinks. I get pissed off and meet her at the bar saying we need to talk. I tell her I‚Äôm pissed and that I can‚Äôt keep doing what we‚Äôre doing. I tell her she knows how I feel and what I want but I just get a gut feeling she doesn‚Äôt like me and that she is playing me. She says she really likes me but still doesn‚Äôt know what she wants but she got scared when I said we have to talk and she was nervous I might break it off. This calms me down sorta as I think ok, maybe she really does care and we are going slow enough so we keep going but she is still hot and cold, not there everyday but some days she 100% and it just makes me feel so bad. She rarely puts me on her Snapchat or social media now, only sometimes, again the hot and cold tendencies. Anyway her birthday comes around 2 weeks later and we had plans to go out, she goes out to dinner with her friends and me and my friends meet them at a bar and I guess have a good time. She sleeps over no sex and we wake up in morning, I got her gift cards to her favorite places, another 200$ and a card in which I write how no matter what happens, I‚Äôll always be there for her, she doesn‚Äôt read it in front of me and idk if she even read it at all being completely honest. 

That night we go to a bar and watch the cowboys game that they lose but she gets very drunk and I see her texting and snapping other guys so when we leave I call her out on it. She gets seriously mad starts hitting me, my car, saying how can I say something like that and how I know how she feels and then starts talking bout how she feels like a burden and wants to kill herself. I instantly shift from mad to ok something is happening now mode and we go to my house where she breaks down in front of me, my mom, and her best friend. We call her family and take her to hospital for evaluation where she stays from Sunday until Tuesday. I tell her friends how idk how everything will turn out and it might be over but it was great meeting them and I had a good time. She finds out about this and says and asks why would it be over and she didn‚Äôt want it to be. We talk once a day the next couple days until she gets home and we hangout that night, just enjoying each other‚Äôs company. The next week we are great, I go to her house for a family party. Great night I text her when I get home and she says love you for the first time. The next day I go to another family party for playoff games and then she had to move into school that Monday so I help her. At school however it was just weird so I ask her if we‚Äôre good and she says what do you mean to which I answer it just seems like she doesn‚Äôt want me there or that I‚Äôm a burden to her. We have a heart to heart again and this time she says the same thing about how she doesn‚Äôt know what she wants, how sometimes she sees me more as a friend and she sometimes just wants to be single but other times she sees something with me and how maybe she just needs a week to see how everything is. I tell her again about the snapping and texting people because she is still doing it and she says yea because she is technically single and I was like well you can‚Äôt have it both ways, acting like your single sometimes and then not. I leave her college, we kiss a few times then I drive home. We don‚Äôt really talk that week until Friday when I called her asking what was up are we done. She says she doesn‚Äôt know and is focusing on her. We don‚Äôt talk that weekend and then she texts me on Monday saying how she is failing out of her major and needs to change it and how she right now just needs to focus on her. I say I understand maybe the timing was just off and that I‚Äôm here for her if she needs anything. 

We barely have talked the past couple weeks but when we do it‚Äôs her contacting me, she snapchats me like once a day and texted me twice, first asking if I was over her already to which I answered wtf does that even mean and why did she ask that. she says never mind she doesn‚Äôt know why she asked that. And then this past week just to talk about work and how she wants a new job and how guys are trying to pursue her now and she doesn‚Äôt want anything like she told me. I tell her yea I‚Äôm taking a break from everything too. I‚Äôm very quiet on social media and don‚Äôt post too much, but now even though she has kinda always done it, she is posting more just random stuff like her drinking, going out, sayings about being single or stupid things about treating girls right or finding the right guy or questionnaires on Instagram, etc all attention seeking behavior. All in all it‚Äôs been a few weeks and I‚Äôm getting better everyday but for all the things I did for her while we were together and I think truly falling for her I constantly find myself thinking about her and looking at her social media a lot. Like I said I did so much for her from giving her money, to watching her cat for a few weeks because she had no where else to bring it, small gestures just to show how much I cared for her and wanted to be with her. It bothers me to think she maybe talking to other guys because she was with me I have no reason to think she isn‚Äôt now. It‚Äôs just I know I shouldn‚Äôt want her and I should move on and while I think I am I kinda do love her and fell for her even though it was only a couple months and I just don‚Äôt know what to do right now. 

Will she come back realizing what she had? Does she miss me at all? Does she even care anymore? Did she lie to me at all? We will ever get past all this and pursue something together? All these thoughts just keep running through my head and anything would help. Thanks so much and sorry for this being so long, just makes me feel better to talk about it and vent then hold everything in!!!

Edit: also we still have each other on every social  media and I noticed I put up some stories and she views them fast as I do look at hers too. Also we have each other‚Äôs iPhone location that still is on and I sometimes catch myself looking at that too. We also still work together and we haven‚Äôt seen each other in about 4 weeks but are scheduled for a shift this week on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Just help me plz with any word of advice lol. 

Edit 2: also forgot to mention she is bisexual and while I think she may have had experiences, it wasn‚Äôt too many. Just a mess honestly but you can‚Äôt help who you fall for I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
ap9hjv,2,2019-02-10,32M4A: You reap what you sow. My descent into cuckold.,fuzzywhitaker,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ap9hjv/32m4a_you_reap_what_you_sow_my_descent_into/," 

Standing at a broad 6'4"" with a  short, styled blond hair, defined jaw line and piercing green eyes I appear on paper as the suburban millennial that figured it out and has a cushy lifestyle. Suburban 6/5 mansion with pool house, plush lawns, gated driveway, with manicured estate, [Gorgeous and classy](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xfPxJ0ASy9U/V3cBzlKFM0I/AAAAAAAAaFI/J1t3Jk8OJGgwVuu7ogxCXb5SfV0Kzt7qQCLcB/s1600/Brunette25.jpg) wife that I've been happily married to for 8 years. She seemingly has not aged a day, often confused for a college girl at the local university. Not only did I win the lottery with Sofia, a half-Mexican half-white, god-fearing, church-going sweetheart with a bit of a thick accent due to her father's State Department service through her formative years. Even more of a blessing, I suppose, lies in the fact that she has had only 3 sexual partners prior to our nuptials to my knowledge. Yet, she's drop dead gorgeous and a motivated, loving partner.

Despite my overt attempts to spoil her and persuade her to become a stay at home mom, her passion for teaching Spanish at the local public High School in our fairly well-known college town exceeds her materialistic pursuits. I've adorned her in designer clothes, custom 6 figure cars, and a myriad of romantic wine and dine nights.

Yet, we've been trying for kids for the past few years with no luck.

And this is where I confess my, well, sins, poor thoughts or what have you. We met when I was younger, handsome and in shape. I played tennis daily and swam laps nightly. The weight of the world encumbered my shoulders. A nice part time job transformed into an internship and transformed into a stress inducing, managerial position at a prominent acquisitions firm. The responsibilities piled up; as did my belt size. My boyish good looks gave way to stress lines, and my once present 6 packs dissipated into a beer gut. My 5"" cock that, when attached to a statuesque figure never posed an issue, but now, with a gut it lingers as the source of perpetually self conscious thoughts about how I couldn't pull a hot girl if not for my 7 figure paycheck. Our sex life probably has suffered as my confidence dissipated.

As I go through the motions of another day of figuring out how to capitalize on our next merge, an old colleague calls me up. His nephew is coming to start college in my town in a few months. 

""He needs a place to stay, can he crash in your pool house until the dorm situation crystallizes? You'd be doing me a favor. He's a good kid, I vouch for him, he'll do your pool and yard work for you while there...""

""No problem. Here's the address"" as I cut off my old pal.

My eyes shot wide as I answered the door. Standing there was a chiseled, classically handsome man with tight shorts and a tank top on. Looking at him at eye level, he was everything I once was and no longer was as my beer gut and thinning hair contrasted by his washboard abs, broad, thick muscles, and golden blond hold styled like a movie star. We shook his hands, his firm grip almost bruised my hand. As he walked in, I noticed a huge sway in his step, it was no secret that this cocky bastard wasn't wearing boxers and he was packing an enormous cock. I glanced down and noticed the outline, big, thick, veiny, and pointing towards his left knee cap, with a large bend in the mid-shaft, he had to be about 9"" soft.  His hefty balls swung with each step, barely contained in his shorts. His shorts held no secrets. I gulped in intimidation as this stronger, more handsome, hung stud was about to move in. Everything I'm not.

I offered him a beer as we made our way into the house and casually talked about house rules. We sat at the posh glass dining room table and discussed things as we swigged beers.He kept thanking me for the hospitality and swearing he'd help out anyway he could. I gave him a set of keys and assured him to make himself feel at home.

It didn't take less than an hour for him and his cavalcade of acquaintances to move into the pool house. Gorgeous, nubile, pert women parading in and out of the guest estate.

The first few nights of having company were christened with moans and groans of pleasuring from the pool house, bouncing and emanating off my walls. I could almost swear that one night Sofia was up, laying next to me,touching herself to the sounds collapsing off the walls....

One day I came home from work early, only to see Tommy sun bathing in the nude. His golden locks perfectly manicured. His strong frame, and tight washboard abs soaking up the son. The 8 pack with adonis belt, this asshole was basically every women's fuck dream. His huge cut cock, soft, laying on his belly button, the large purple head, soft, bobbing up and down on his stomach as he breathed. Fucking christ, I'd lie if i wasn't envious. His cock soft was triple the size of mine hard. Thankfully, I thought, Sofia is so demure and innocent, she wouldn't. But it turned me on to think of it. I cleared my throat.

I prefer literate, well written responses to truly explore this dynamic and how my wife will ultimately succumb from being a sweet, loving, dedicated wife to a lustful, wanton, plaything for more dominant, well hung men.

ap9hsd,169,2019-02-10,I (20M) had an affair with a married mother (38). I ruined her life and I feel absolutely awful. Is there anything I can do to fix this mess?,upset9876,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ap9hsd/i_20m_had_an_affair_with_a_married_mother_38_i/,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

This is a very long story, so I will try my best to condense it.  

So about a year ago I met Amy (not her real name) while interning at a large law firm. She worked as a paralegal and it seemed like she was an integral part of the firm. Everyone liked and respected her. On the first day, she was tasked to show me around and get me acquainted with the staff, departments, etc.. At first, we were really good friends, then things got really personal. Amy began to mention how unhappy and unsatisfied she was with her marriage. Her husband is a lawyer (works at a different firm) who put his job over his family. According to her, there were some nights where he was so embroiled in work that he slept in his office (I was skeptical. I believed he was cheating on her). I tried my best to console her, but I really didn't know what to say. 

The weekend before my internship was set to end, Amy called me. We never really conversed outside of work, it was a work type of relationship, so I was surprised she calles. Full disclosure, I kinda had a crush on her. She was very attractive and smart. We spoke for about an hour about random shit, and then she asked if I wanted to come over. She told me that her husband took the kids (she had 2 children) to his parents who lived out of state and that  they will be gone for the rest of the weekend.  I went to her house and to make a long story short we had sex. I'm going to omit the explicit details, but I really enjoyed it. She told me straight up that she didn't want this to be a one time thing. Again, she told me how terrible her husband was and that I shouldn't feel bad for this. I was making her feel happy while her husband didn't. I explicitly told her that if she was unhappy, then she should divorce him. She gave me some good reasons as to why she can't.

This sexcapede lasted for about a year. Until Amy's husband found out. Her husband informed the law firm that she worked for, that she had sex with an intern. They conducted an investigation and ultimately  fired her. He filed for divorce and based on what she told me it looks like she can potentially lose custody of her two children.

I know I screwed up. I know I shouldn't have done what I did, but my hormones overtook me. I feel awful. Is there anything I could do to remedy this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I just recieved a call from a good friend of my Girlfriend that she has tried to commit suicide.Maybe one or two of you have seen my most recent post on here asking, how to act around someone suffering from depression but I have the feeling that I failed her. You see she is in a very difficult situation regarding her job and she decided to skip work tomorrow to stay at home since she didnt like going there. I can see from my standpoint how exactly she hated her current work and how she didnt want anything more but to leave. She has told me that her only two options (the way she sees it) were: finish the internship she hated, or [die.As](https://die.As) someone who has never dealt himself with depression, but had my father suffer from it, I know how to act around someone who doesnt feel like they are any good for society and just want to die. But this time its different. I dont know why, but when I left today I felt that something was off... she suddenly decided to stay at home instead of travelling back with me so she could continue her internship the next day. She just suddenly (after crying) said she wanted to stay at home, which I was fine with. Afterall its her decision if she wants to stay at home or go to work. Like I stated above... I know that depression is a disease (from my father) and I know there is no easy cure for it.

&amp;#x200B;

well 10mins ago I recieved a call from a  friend of hers, continuing me on to a social worker for mental health, who told me that my lovely GF tried to commit suicide... right now Im drunk and I simply dont know how to act. I already informed my workplace that I wont be coming in tomorrow but I simply dont know what to do. I dont want this post to be about me but... I am seriously... conflicted... I am worried for her, but at the same time Im happy that \*it\* didnt work out for her and that shes getting help now, something that I have been telling her to get for the last whole week... I feel like I failed her... I feel like I shouldve been there for her, but on the other side I know that the partners of depression sufferes are supposed to be there for their partners but at the same time not ruin their own lives--- I dont know... Im just confused right now... scared and just... messed up... I knew she was going to do something like that, but I was too afraid to mention it to anyone.... Im breaking back into tears as Im typing this.... I feel terrible...

&amp;#x200B;

Please, to anyone suffering from this crippling illness: There is help! Please go contact someone before you do something stupid... PLEASE!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I knew she wasnt feeling well and I didnt do anything but went home due to work instead... I feel fucking terrible....

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: Right now I feel like I let it happen... I knew she wasnt feeling well but I went home and got drunk as to be ready tomorrow for my evening shift at work... I feel like I failed her, and I feel terrible... Im sorry..."

#THE INTRODUCTION


Series 2, although deeply flawed, had some really terrific stories, and cemented David Tennant's incarnation as a fan favourite for years to come. However, one story in particular stood out amongst the rest to me. In the eyes of the fandom, this two-part story is already rather recognised anyway, with a 8.7 and 8.8 on IMDb respectively. Nevertheless, I feel in the wake of a whole year without Doctor Who on our screens, it is important to look back, observe and deconstruct how some of the shows greatest episodes achieved their excellence.

So... lets start with the basics.

-----------------------------------------------

#THE PLOT

I'm assuming most of the people reading this have already watched the episode but it think its worth refreshing everyone memory of the story as a whole.

So Spoilers... I guess.

In Part One, The Doctor and Rose land on an unmarked space base. They wander around a bit. Find some humans and weird alien slave... things. Explain that the planet they are situated on is impossibly orbiting a black hole. Badda bing badda boom Tardis is lost and the gang are trapped. Weird demony things begin to happen across the base, taking particular interest with one of the humans. Everyone attention is directed however, to a suspicious chasm inside the planet. The Doctor and older girl elects to go down into the cave and find out whats jolly well going on, with the episode ending on the 'alien slave metaphors' trapping Rose and the rest of the humans along with a seal opening up underneath the planet.

BWwWaAAaAOoOoOOMMmm

Part Two, humans shoot the attacking 'alien slave metaphors', The Doctor and older girl decide to go back up and help. Mr Demon has a little chat and separates the two teams off. Doctor decides to go down into the sealed pit to see whats down there. The rest of the humans find out a way to incapacitate the rest of the invading 'alien slave metaphors' and opt to get the fuck out of dodge, much to Rose's dismay. The Doctor faces off against a literal fucking demon and decides to sacrifice himself, Rose, the 'alien slave metaphors' and the rest of the humans to stop the evil from escaping. Rose helps suck the evil possessed human out into the vacuum, at which point, The Doctor deus ex machina's his way to finding the Tardis, saving the humans and flying off into the black sunset.

What a neat little premise. Much like a lot of two-parters the first part is used as a vehicle to carry the bulk of the mystery into the next part which carries a lot of the emotional weight and thematic payoff. Having this story be allowed to take place over and hour and a half allows the plot to breath and the thematic elements to be explored. Lets dive a little deeper into the nitty gritty themes of the story.

But before we get any further...

-----------------------------------------------

#THE TECHNICAL STUFF

This is a lot of the stuff that most people don't see if its done well. Film and television are a product of hundreds of talented people all working together to achieve something awesome. Doctor Who has always been a little bit stunted in terms of its production values. It simply doesn't have the budget to fully pull off the high concept work needed for a show of this ilk. It's no secret that the BBC's budgets have been slashed considerably over the years. In 2006 though, this is where the show probably had the most amount of money to work with, and for a 2006 show, I believe it still holds up (except some of the effects, more on this later).

Visually this story is a treat, working with a fully controllable set allows precise camera framing and movements leading to some brilliant shots. The wides of the base and the planet surface as well as tight, claustrophobic shots inside the maintenance tunnels. Incidentally, the director of this story James Strong had worked within British TV for a long time before this gig and went on to direct episodes of Broadchurch and Vanity Fair. 

The aesthetic of this episode really grabs the viewers attention and makes it something distinct from every other story in the shows history. There's a distinct dichotomy between the metal repeating structures of the human compound against the more chaotic and naturally arid sections of the planet surface. The lighting follows a similar theme, with the cool, harsh, stark, flashing lights from the human light sources opposed to the warm, eerie glow from the jaws of 'Kroptor'.

I mean... there's a reason they keep on reusing Tennant's bright orange space suit in future episodes.

All the props and sets inside the sanctuary base look dirty, grimy, used and abused, making everything feel tactile and lived-in. You could believe that a group of people were living and working there.

Speaking of which...

-----------------------------------------------

#THE CHARACTERS

I'm just gonna go one by one and explain why I fell in love with everyone of these beautiful people so here we go...

* ***The Doctor*** - I mean c'mon... do I even need to say anything here. Tennant's firing on all cylinders, able to hold his own against the physical embodiment of evil, the twisted machinations of humanity, whilst also delivering some beautifully quiet, somber moments of introspection like when he abseils into the pit. Brilliant. 

* ***The Beast*** - Gabriel fucking Woolf. Sutekh was amazing but in my mind this is Gabriel's definitive performance in Doctor Who. He is able to hang on each word with venom and gleeful intensity. This performance is one of the main reasons I became so invested in voice acting as a child, breathing life into a beautifully terrifying villain.

* ***Zachary Cross Flane*** - Shaun Parkes gives a really sympathetic performance. Immediately killing off the captain and putting him in charge puts him in an interesting position. He doesn't want to be the leader, he doesn't know what hes doing, so it makes those moments where he steps up and takes charge all the more invigorating to watch.

* ***Ida Scott*** - Played by Claire Rushbrook, she probably gets the most to work with here. The scenes with her and The Doctor are some of the best in the story. It gives her some nice context and backstory, nothing so important that it bogs down the pacing but just nice icing on the cake for her character. I enjoy the fact that even though Ida is a scientist first and foremost, she has no problem talking about faith and religion and how her family brought her up.

* ***Jefferson*** - Authoritative, brash, commanding but also feels like someone you could have a drink with. He can be blunt and unkind in parts, but ultimately you understand that he genuinely wants to protect everyone and every action he takes is for the betterment of the base and its workforce. Danny Webb gives a nice sincere performance leading to a powerful exit when he meets his bitter end.

* ***Toby Zed*** - Toby is a little shit... but I love him. Will Thorp's performance is often overlooked in the grand scheme of things, but he does some great work here, shifting from aberrant arsehole to scared victim to angry force-of-nature with great precision.

* ***Scooti Manista*** - Her last moments with Toby/Beast will forever be in my top moments of Doctor Who ever. MyAnna Buring sells the hell out of an energetic young intern just coming along for the ride... which makes her fate even more horrible.

* ***Danny Bartock*** - I don't really have a lot to say about this one. He's mainly there for some expository dialogue, but Ronny Jhutti does a good enough job and does some solid fearful acting.

* ***Rose*** - Spoilers for the Poo Poo Section.


Its a great ensemble cast. Probably the best until the 'Under The Lake/Before The Flood' two-parter. They all work off each other in interesting ways making the dialogue feel kinetic and energetic. The emphasis here is on everyone feeling like a real person, these are the kind of people you could meet at work or have coffee with. You feel like you've just been dropped in the middle of a office workers 9 to 5. 

However, there's one character that requires its own section...

#THE MUSIC

Its bizarre how much I relate my earliest memories of Doctor Who with Murry Gold's amazing score. During the first few years of the shows infancy the music for each episode was distinct and beautiful. Whenever I think about this episode, the cello starts to play in my head, my memory and the music are one and the same. This story's along with 'Girl in the Fireplace' music always manage to blast me back to watching Saturday night TV when I was 10. Haunting, ambient and so unique. Bloody love it. 

Now other things I bloody love...

-----------------------------------------------

#THE THINGS I BLOODY LOVE

Yeah... this is where i'm just gonna gush about things that I like about these episodes in order of how they appear...

* *Welcome To Hell.* - Such a cool way of opening an episode and establishing something weird to hook the audience within the first few moments of the episode.

* *...that's one hell of a storm.* - Another little detail that makes it all tie together, having the winds of the 'storm' whip against the base constantly reminding the viewer of the looming presence of the black hole.

* *The sight of it sends some people mad.* - That first reveal. So good.

* *The Beast and his Armies shall rise from the Pit to make war against God.* - So well timed, this story has some great comedy too.

* *Don't turn around.* - The palpable fear from this scene is perfect, genuinely scary stuff. So many great Doctor Who moments come from the show being scary, I kinda want that feeling to come back.

* *The Scarlet System.* - A heavy dialogue scene that really illustrates the relationship that's grown between Rose and The Doctor. Its a sweet reflective moment as an entire star system is crushed into nothing above their heads.

* *He bathes in the Black Sun.* - Talked about before but it never fails to send shivers down my spine... so perfect. [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TImXWYGGpDg)

* *This is the darkness. This is my domain.* - Face to face with the devil, a clashing of minds and ideologies. Probing each of them for their deepest darkest secrets. Brilliantly paced and executed. [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBQih6e68E)

* *The Chasm* - Again, talked about before but the conversation of faith with Ida inside the chasm is just amazing. The way it genuinely stumps The Doctor for a few moments after she asks him the same question. [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdS-jYcQAfw)

* *The Beast* - The final reveal was so well done. The scale!!

But its not all black sunshine and roses... (yes i will keep running this joke into the ground)

-----------------------------------------------

#THE POO POO THINGS

It's not perfect though. Rose generally acts in her peak obnoxious state throughout the episode, but she probably does more here than in most episodes in Series 2. It definitely feels like Russel T Davies is keeping Rose on more due to his love of the character, rather than finding something interesting to do with her. Oh well... she'd be dead soon. 

Some of the special effects look a bit shite. This episode was the one shot closest to the air date, meaning time spent on finishing special effects was much lower than other episodes.

The maintenance duct scene also goes on for a bit too long, but other than these little things 
the episodes continue to stay at a good quality throughout.

Okay... here we go.

-----------------------------------------------

#THE SERIOUS STUFF

&gt; This one knows me, as I know him: the killer of his own kind.

My reason for doing this post comes from a few different places. Recently catching up on old movies like 'The Exorcist' and 'The Green Mile' has gotten me thinking about a few specific themes. There were a bunch of episodes I could of done deep dives on and maybe I'd do those at some point but something drew me to this story. I'm gonna try and throw down some GCSE level thematic deconstruction now so bare with me.

Doctor Who has always taken a more stoic stance when talking about religion. The science fiction/fantasy show rarely discusses about the major monotheistic faiths and when it does, usually gives a message of unifying inclusivity to all audiences to stay as approachable and watchable as possible. This is a great thing. The Doctor never dismisses a persons faith, like in 'The God Complex' or 'The Rings of Akhaten'. The show teaches people to look at something logically and to not be scared of the things that go bump in the night. But to also let people have their faith... to be just kind. Whether the devil in this episode was real or not, is not the point. Evil takes many forms and everyone's faith is tested from time to time.

Zach's self-doubt.

&gt; The captain, so scared of command.

Jefferson's regret.

&gt; The soldier, haunted by the eyes of his wife.
 
Ida's trauma.

&gt; The scientist, still running from daddy.

The Doctor has more skeletons in his closet than anyone else and in this story, we get a deeper understanding of who he is and how he thinks, when he finally proclaims to the physical embodiment of evil itself. 

&gt; Cause if I believe in one thing... I believe in her.

The Doctor has and always will believe in people. And I think that's a beautiful message.

Or maybe everything I've said is bollocks... this is reddit after all."
apalu4,2,2019-02-10,I (M22) am feeling a little self-conscious on my phone calls with the girl (F26) I'm dating (and about LDR in general).,The-MERTEGER,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/apalu4/i_m22_am_feeling_a_little_selfconscious_on_my/,"So this girl and I were interns in the same department during Fall semester and we became best friends.. Near the end of the internship, she finally realized she liked me after a little bit of jealousy. We went on vacation together and had a blast. anyways to get to the point.. The past few months, I talked with this girl in person for at least 45 minutes - 2 hours that included coffee breaks and lunch at work.. We talked about everything there is to talk about that you can talk about for everyday for 5 months. Now I've went back to school (7 hours away by car) to start my senior year and my life has become boring again. Whenever we're on the phone now, I feel like I have nothing to talk about.. I say the same thing each time, ""Oh I was just studying today."" So I have to ask her a bunch of questions about what went down at work or if there's any drama with the interns this week, etc. I'm worried I'm going to start boring her..

&amp;#x200B;

In person the vibe is great and strong. We're best friends practically. We like each other. We've banged multiple times. Went on 2 dates. I'm actually going down there again this next weekend to spend valentines day weekend with her. This weekend however, was the first weekend that we haven't seen each other for the past 3 weekends; it's definitely hard. she and I miss each other so much (I can't imagine.. yet.. how some of you go months without seeing each other). It will get much harder in late August when she moves back to Germany. I hope to get an internship at the company again for the summer so I can be with her for a couple months before the internship ends for her and I. (I'm also super worried about this.. what if I don't get an internship there again.. I'd be super upset..)

&amp;#x200B;

Her and I are at different points right now since I got back to school. She's making decent money while i'm making no money. I don't even know what i'm trying to ask, i'm just blabbing and nervous about all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize: This is all new to me. I feel like i'm boring at the moment and have nothing to talk about except the past. Any advice

apaujl,29,2019-02-10,What does it mean to Learn Linux?,theborderhopper1,linux,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/apaujl/what_does_it_mean_to_learn_linux/,"I'm a first year Computer Science student.  I probably have far more linux experience than your average random person on the street, but basically no linux experience compared to most of you.  Ubuntu was an OS in my home growing up from 2004 to when I moved out in 2010 and I used it a few times since, and have recently gone back to the OS full time.

I can do basic things like copy stuff into the Terminal and follow instructions and get by pretty well in Ubuntu.  I don't really consider that ""knowing linux"", as I know that's just one GUI for the underlying linux code.  I rarely understand what I'm typing into the command land, except sudo apt-get blah blah.

On internships and jobs here in Belfast, I occasionally see requirements of people ""knowing Linux"" or ""experience with Linux"".  What does that actually look like and how can I ""learn Linux"" as a job skill?"
apbk14,2,2019-02-10,I was already depressed and then I got sick and now I can't even enjoy eating anymore (life-long problem). I can't stop crying at emotional posts or at nothing,ManyPen,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/apbk14/i_was_already_depressed_and_then_i_got_sick_and/,"**tl;dr at bottom, if you actually read this whole thing, you're a trooper**

So about 10 months ago or so, I stopped being able to swallow food. Turns out I have a pretty fucking obscure disease (my doctor at school had no fucking clue what was wrong with me until I saw a specialist). The problem was the nerves in my esophagus stopped working, so food was getting stuck in my throat until I would eventually regurgitate it back up, because what choice did I really have?

During that semester before I was diagnosed, it was fucking awful. I was literally spitting up my food (no stomach acid luckily because it wasn't reaching my stomach...) at least 5 times every day, for about 2 - 2.5 months. That whole time of my life is so blurry I barely remember it. I lost 20 lbs in a few months, and I'm a skinny guy to begin with. I looked absolutely dead and my cheek bones were jutting out because I had no fat on my face. I got through that semester with okay grades and doing an internship somehow, I honestly have no clue how I pulled it off. I spent that entire semester oversleeping all my classes because I was so depressed and had no energy, and I was smoking weed every day to cope.

Summer hits after that semester, I see a specialist and I finally get properly diagnosed. I drink Ensure for an entire month almost exclusively because I sure as hell can't keep down solid food. Drinking food for a month was bad enough, but I was drinking food, and still spitting up food at least once a day, usually twice (morning and night).

I was told the surgery would not 100% fix me as there is no true solution, but it's the best solution anyone knows of. I'm grateful they didn't lie to me, so I've known since before surgery it's going to be very noticeable. They were right. Like night and fucking day. The muscles in my fucking esophagus don't work, I don't do peristalsis (massaging food down your throat pretty much), so the only thing that even lets me fucking eat on a day to day basis, is gravity bringing food down, cause my muscles don't function anymore. No one even knows what causes the disease, it's a mystery.

Now it's 7 months after surgery, and it's certainly better than before, but Jesus Christ I cannot enjoy eating food anymore. I was already depressed for years before, coming and going, but ever since this happened to me I feel like I can't recover. Even when I'm not eating, i feel a lot of discomfort in my chest. I still sometimes feel the need to spit because my shit is broken. I can't lay down horizontally because I could spit up in my sleep because I will inevitably have food sitting in my esophagus because gravity only does so much. Sometimes I get esophageal spasms (usually when waking up) and it is so painful, it genuinely feels like I am having a heart attack. It usually passes within minutes if I drink water, but it has lasted an hour twice I think. It's actually really fucking painful, I've heard of people thinking it's a spasm, and then it lasts too long and turns out it actually was a heart attack. I'm young so I'm probably not getting a heart attack yet luckily. 

The medical problem was really just icing on the cake though. I was depressed for years before that, just less really. I have always had constant anxiety and it's getting worse because I'm in my last semester and I'm so scared about finding a job even though I'm sure I'll be fine. 

The biggest thing that is constantly weighing me down is my family (dad) situation though, I think that's what is usually making me cry so often. If I see a comment about a father, or some wholesome thing about helping people, I start tearing up. I don't want to go too into it because honestly this whole thing got so long and it's so specific my friends could easily identify this is me... My dad is sick with a neurological disease, but the biggest problem is that I don't think most people are going to miss him. We're all waiting on him to die already, my mom has said it to me more than twice. 

He was always a stubborn/bitter/proud man, but especially because he's lost his independence, he has progressed so much worse. I've lost most of my sympathy for him because it's not like he was particularly a good father before he got sick, he was always kind of an asshole, but now he's a bigger piece of shit. He's emotionally abusive plain and simple, I can't sugar coat it. I was talking to my father's brother about him (after a big argument with my dad), and he agreed; he's emotionally abusive. My siblings, his siblings, my mom, we all have the same opinion of him and it's not a high one.

I'm finally back in college for my final semester and I just want college to end so I can live on my own and not worry about these things. I try to push it out of my mind, because I've talked about it with my mom and there's nothing I can do, but it just weighs me down constantly knowing that my mom is in a shitty fucking marriage because she feels she can't leave her disabled husband of 30 years or whatever it is. She's not happy, he's not happy, I'm not happy, no one is fucking happy and she's ruining her life for him. I get why she can't leave him, but I really think she just wants him to pass already so she can guilt free ""divorce"" him in that way. It's not her fault if the disease takes him you know, it's her fault if she divorces him though.

I feel like I'm drowning and I keep crying all the time. I cried twice in my hour long shower today, two separate starting and stopping of crying in one shower. I feel so empty I don't want to do anything, everything I do is because I have to or I'm killing time.

I'm going to keep on keeping on because what else do I do, I gotta ride this out until it gets better, but I am so tired of waiting and feeling awful every day. I've been seeing a therapist since I got diagnosed and it occurred to me that I actually lived for 2.5 months spitting up my food legitimately 5+ times a day. I was just going through the motions that whole semester, it didn't really hit me until I realized wtf was even happening.



**tl;dr:** I've been depressed for years, mostly from family issues and just general anxiety that I've always had, and I peaked around 10 months ago when I went for over 2 months regurgitating food multiple times a day, and lost all my muscle mass I might have had before. I can eat again after surgery, but it's just ruined it for me. Eating used to be the best part of the day really, it doesn't get much more hedonistic than eating good food right? I can't enjoy that anymore. I don't feel normal even when I'm not eating. My body is actually mangled as hell, but it was the best option we have so I'm glad they did what had to get done. I pretty much got hit back to back for 4 years straight at college with a lot of unlucky bullshit (some of it being my fault of course, but really a lot of bad luck) and I'm just so tired of it I want to leave college already and just start my career and make some money so I can be independent from my family and not feel like a burden.

I was fortunate enough to be offered an internship in Redmond, Washington as a software engineer intern this summer. I‚Äôm going with corporate housing and would love to get to know other incoming/current interns! Is there any fb/slack/GroupMe etc group that I can join? 

Thank you all so much!"
apdesj,1,2019-02-11,My girlfriend [22/f] and I [23/m] conflicted towards continuing our rocky high school relationship,CE_TAway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apdesj/my_girlfriend_22f_and_i_23m_conflicted_towards/,"Our long-tangled relationship is at a crossroads with where we are in life. Counting this time, it‚Äôll be the 3rd time we have broken up and tried again. We started dating in high school. This went on and off for most of three years, with all the hurdles and challenges that one would associate with a relationship in this period. Based on our differences in university choices (which boiled down to a program which forced me to move every 4 months), and the seemingly overwhelming opinion of reddit, I decided it would be best for us to see other people. Looking back at this decision, I still think it was the right decision. However, this choice, along with several other actions that I made, conflicted sharply with her internal beliefs/core values. It would be several years before I would know this.


During the second half of our degrees, she contacted me again. At this point in my life, I had effectively committed myself to pursuing my profession, and from a lack of success in finding another relationship, stopped trying until after university. She contacted me when I was half way across the globe from her. But like we used to, we talked and talked, more and more frequently. Before we knew it we had developed a long distance relationship. After seeing each other on a bi-weekly basis for the remainder of the term, I had to complete another internship as a part of my program. Not to blow my own horn, but this internship was at a highly sought-after company in my field. Knowing this, I was fully prepared to take the offer for full time. She then conveyed to me that after graduation, she will move to pursue a career in another city, far from where I will be for full time. This was the second time we broke up.


After my internship ended, I received and signed the return offer. She contacted me again. This time she fully grew out of her shell in high school and made me aware of the times that I hurt her. Hearing these things made me feel an immense sense of regret and sadness. How could I have been so incompetent to not see that my actions conflicted with her core values? The thought of hurting her that severely brings about a great sense of failure and shame. For example, I missed a scheduled call that we were supposed to have because I was working on a project. As soon as I realized the next day, I apologized and rescheduled for the night after. What I didn‚Äôt realize was that this act broke all expectations that she had of me in terms of dependability. She opted to not have any further expectations for me in this front so that she won‚Äôt be hurt again. She concluded, that this action was an active act of malice against her instead of my negligence. Due to a lack of trust, I cannot convince her otherwise. This one example generalizes to so many more. Including the act of our initial breakup after high school. What I thought was a rational choice/excusable temporary lapse in memory turned into a seemingly irreparable scar between us to this day.


Now as it stands, she is looking into further education after her initial career choice did not align with what she wanted in life. Me, I have a well-paying job and bright career prospects. We have the option to continue dating long distance with periodic visits until she is done her degree. Is the friction that arises from our now divergent lives and jagged prior experiences too great for us to overcome? Should we still continue?


This is the first time I‚Äôve sought personal advice like this from reddit. I've tried to include only what relevant information is necessary, but still apologize for the overall lengthy post. Thanks in advance.

apdk32,31,2019-02-11,My aunt tries to make 13 year old me hand my kindle fire to her demon child.,RetroRemzi,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/apdk32/my_aunt_tries_to_make_13_year_old_me_hand_my/,"Hello, my name is Remzi, and I'm 13. Sorry for the lack of much detail, but I'm a bit impatient since the browser died on me and i had to reload the page, throwing over 2K+ words to waste. Anyway, I have an aunt with two children, one of which is an entitled brat. I will try to keep this short and sweet, because once again, I'm not the most patient. EBC: Entitled brat cousin, 5 year old demon. EA: my (abnormally) entitled aunt. 

Now, I know my cousin is five and all, but he is literally lucious in the making. He gets away with anything and everything, throws fits about the littlest things, and seems to generally hate life, so he makes it miserable for others as well. To give some context about what he gets in trouble for, the only time he has gotten in trouble that I've witnessed, (And I am around them a LOT) Is when he threw 1.5 ft tall action figures into our dry wall relentlessly, eventually punching a 4-inch diameter hole into our wall. That is the ONLY time I have seen him ACTUALLY get into trouble. And for the matter, I have seen him to a LOT of different things.

On to the drama.

I was at my grandmother's, watching TV and using my kindle, whilst my EBC is throwing 3-inch metal cars off the second story banister of my grandmother's house, like he does often. Now, mind you, I have 5 siblings, 2 of which are stepsiblings, and when we have to get to the kitchen, we typically walk under there and for about every one in thirty cars he throws down, we get nailed in the top of the head. My aunt doesn't care though, and when we bring ANY complaints about my EBC to her, she looks at us as if we're crazy, saying things like; ""Well, what do you want me to do, [REDACTED]? He's only five!"" My aunt is not typically that entitled, and is normally a very patient and kind person, along with her 8-year-old daughter, which is why recounting these events in my mind still surprise me. Anyway, my grandmother is walking around with my aunt, and walk under the balcony, where my cousin readily cocks his arm back as if to land a haymaker right in between the eyes, and lofts a especially heavy car over the banister and directly into the top of my poor grandmother's head, making her yelp in pain. My horrified aunt was right behind her, and, bearing witness, immediately told my cousin to get down.

Realizing that he had to stop throwing his heavy metal toys a story down onto my grandmother's WOODEN floor, may I add, he immediately plopped down on the hollow ground with a loud *THUD* that shook the house and started screeching louder than I thought humanely possible. Instead of discouraging this behavior, my aunt immediately started pampering EBC, both now immediately forgetting the drama he caused, EBC bounding back to the first floor as my aunt and grandmother headed back to the patio. EBC patiently watched TV until my aunt was out of sight, then walked up to 13 year old me, calmly and quietly playing on his kindle, with a ""Don't give me any bull****"" look on his face, as he opened his mouth to talk. The exchange went a little like this:

EBC: Can I pway?

Me: On this? *Points to my kindle fire, still in my hands*

EBC: Yeah.

Me: Not right now, I'm using it.

EBC: Pwease?

By now, he was puffing himself up in an attempt to use some 5 year old intimidation on me. Using all my strength to restrain my laughter, I politely respond.

Me: No, sorry, but this is mine and I'm using it right now. you cannot just take it.

EBC: But I want to pway on it.

Me: You cannot, I am using it right now.

EBC: Give it.

Me, shocked: Um, excuse me?

EBC: GIVE IT!!!!

He tried to grab the kindle and pull it away from me with his grubby little hands, but me having eight years of age on him, I easily resisted. By now, though, I could see his lip quivering, and I braced myself for the blood-curling scream that ripped from his throat as he threw himself on the ground and sang F****ing Phantom of the Opera. 

Of course, his aunt enters the house immediately and sees him bawling at my feet, and this is what happened:

EA: WHAT DID YOU DO?!??!!?!?

Me, taken aback: Umm, you can ask him.

My aunt was glaring daggers at me as she kneeled down and carried EBC out of the room. When she came back in, I almost lost my s*** at what i heard.

EA: Did you take his kindle!?

Me: No, this is my kindle.

She obviously didn't believe me, so I showed her it was, in fact my kindle, by showing her my wallpaper and lock screen. Instead of shaming EBC for lying, which I didn't expect to be honest, she just stared at me like I was a man that she just held the door open for, and I walked past without thanking her.

Me:...What?

EA: So are you going to let him use it?

At hearing these words, my anger went from 2-9 in a matter of milliseconds. I won't give any status updates on my feelings anymore, but I will type the rest of the dialogue below.

Me: Use... my kindle?

EA: Yes.

Me: Umm, well he literally just tried to steal it from me...

EA: EBC, did you try to take his kindle?

EBC: No!

EA, obviously not buying it but still looking expectantly towards me: You heard him, he didn't try to take it. Now just let him have it.

Me: What?! He LITERALLY just tried to snatch MY kindle out of MY hands. Also, I'm using it right now! I've told him this!

(EA kneels down to EBC and whispers into his ear, to which EBC sheepishly nods.)

EBC: Pwease, can I have it?

Me: Sorry, but I'm still using it, you're going to have to wait until I'm done.

EBC threw himself on the ground again to EA's dismay, and she glares at me like I've just single handedly shoved EBC onto the ground myself.

EA, practically barking at this point: Excuse me? He asked nicely

Me: I'm sorry, EA, but I'm still using it, and that doesn't change the fact that he just tried to snatch my kindle away and lied to you about it as well. I'm not being greedy, I'm just telling him to wait his turn.

I was literally speaking to my aunt like she was a 7 year old just learning that santa claus wasn't real at this point, with the softest voice i could muster with andrenaline almost sending me over the edge.

EA: It doesn't matter, he's five! GIVE IT TO HIM!

Me, Actually raising my voice towards my aunt: NO. IF HE WANTS TO PLAY SO BAD, YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM SOMETHING TO USE.

At this point, I was literally speaking to my aunt like a boss speaks to a intern that was screwing everything up in all the wrong ways. I was using a deep, sincere, and stern voice that I didn't know I was capable of. EA just glared at me and walked off towards the patio, with nothing to say to my reply. Of course, she took EBC with her, saying that I wouldn't let him play because I ""Didn't learn how to share,"" or something like that. Needless to say, I didn't use my devices in front of EBC since.

Thanks to anyone who read my story to this point. Please leave a review on how I can keep my personal experiences shorter and sweeter in the future. Also, YES, this is VERY true. I feel like I shouldn't have to say that, before realizing that I'm a major skeptic myself. Thanks for reading, and bye.

apervb,3,2019-02-11,M4A (A playing F) The Ultimate multiple prompt list. Hopefully something for everyone! (Fairly long) (open/multiple prompts) (light or dark) (chat or rp) (sub or dom),Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/apervb/m4a_a_playing_f_the_ultimate_multiple_prompt_list/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

*(In no particular order, and feel free to mix and match!)*

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Living with HyperSpermia:** This is a prompt that is a little more far fetched. The premise is that I have a 'condition' called HyperSpermia that causes my balls to produce semen at a faster rate than most people which means I have to empty them a lot more often. Side effects include no refractory period and very large loads.

We can have a concerned sibling, doctor or friend that finds out about my condition and 'helps' me. But there's a lot that could happen so go nuts.

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Futa Fun:** (I play Futa you play Female)
Pretty self explanatory, wanna fuck a chick with a dick? Wanna see a pair of bouncing tits while your holes get filled with warm cum?

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**Pornstar encounters:** Similar to the celebrity prompt above, this one includes famous pornstars instead. If you interested I can tell you a few of my favorites over PM (Or you can send yours) I don't tend to enjoy asian, black or indian though, just to clarify.

This prompt can be explored in a cheesy porno styled scenario or maybe i'm a fan that 'wins' a day with you or maybe just a fan that comes across you in everyday life.

**The threesome with the two sisters:** (Major bonus points for this one) It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

Others: Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff, raceplay. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary and BONUS points if you let me choose your character)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes.."

I am currently looking for a job as a software engineer in N. America. (I am from Romania)

After taking in account the cost of living and the problems with the visa, I've decided to forget about Seattle and focus only on Canada.

I've done a lot of research on various websites regarding the pay in Toronto and Vancouver but the results seem to be all over the place. The most professional source I could find was the Robert Half salary guide which states a 73k-140k range for all level (Vancouver).

I was wondering if you guys could give me more info about the salary ranges (excluding Amazon, Microsoft etc.) and which city is the best pick. According to Numbeo Vancouver seems to me more affordable.

About myself (to give you a better idea):

\- Graduated from an engineering university summer 2018 ( computer science major/ 4 years).

\- Starting the end of my 3rd year I've done a 3 month internship and continued to work as a Junior software engineer for the same Global company during my 4th year.

\- After graduation I've changed the company for a mid level position which I still have right now.

\- In June I'll have 2 years of work experience excluding projects done during Uni.

Hope this gives you a better idea and I can't wait to hear from you :D"

Currently I have a great job that I do really enjoy - the benefits are great and the maternity leave is generous for the US (16-18 weeks). However, DH is applying for a new job that eventually would require us to move about an hour away so I just started looking at new jobs to see what was out there for me. Turns out a company I‚Äôve always wanted to work at is hiring a position I think I would be great for, and my old boss from when I was an intern there 8 years ago is the hiring manager! She is fantastic and I would love working for her (not to mention I would love to have a female boss as I am in the STEM field and there aren‚Äôt many!), and she has 2 little ones at home so totally understands the working mom life. I think I would have a great shot at this new job, and it could set our family up for success in the future.

My dilemma is, am I really in a position where I want to be getting a new job when I am newly pregnant? I am very happy at my current job, but also don‚Äôt want to miss out on a great opportunity. 

Does anyone have any experience starting a new job while newly pregnant? Any thoughts are welcome!! "

api2sy,6,2019-02-11,I regret having a kid. I wish everyday I wasn‚Äôt a mom.,Klaybae11,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/api2sy/i_regret_having_a_kid_i_wish_everyday_i_wasnt_a/,"I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and I‚Äôm a single mom of one. I had her in high school and my life isn‚Äôt where I want it to be right now. I was a good student and was able to get into a top 20 US school. It was an opportunity to turn my life around I had thought. But in reality I really struggled and graduated with my 3rd choice major with a sad 3.0. All in all, it took me 6 years to finish my bachelors after needing to switch majors so many times. I never had enough time to study for exams or do things like internships to prepare me for life after graduation. Not to mention I didn‚Äôt even have a social life which affected my confidence immensely. All my time outside of going to classes was spent caring for my child. After I graduated, it was hard to find a decent paying job. I didn‚Äôt find one until 8 months after graduation when I finally settled for a $12/hr office job. I‚Äôve been there 7 months now and was able to get it raised to $15/hr. 

The only reason I was able to get these raises was because my boss is a cheapskate and doesn‚Äôt want to hire different people to do different positions. She keeps on piling more and more responsibilities on me and gives me raises every few months to keep me around. I‚Äôm overworked and would have quit a long time ago but it‚Äôs tough to find anything better. These other jobs are still in the $15-17 range and I would hate to start all over again for mediocre pay and still be longing for something better. 

I have considered going back to school or a boot camp to learn more marketable skills but it‚Äôs impossible to do even part time with my daughter around. I thought it would be easier as she gets older but she is still as clingy as ever. I feel guilty not spending enough time with her as is. If I were to commit myself to more school and continue working full time, she would just be on her iPad playing games and watching YouTube to pass the time. 

I see my old classmates‚Äô lives on social media and I can‚Äôt be more jealous. Even the ones that did badly in high school found their way around and ended up with good jobs. They have awesome social lives, lots of friends, and have time and money to travel. 

I can‚Äôt even think of travel right now. I pay $300 a month in after school care for my daughter and not to mention many other expenses for her. But let‚Äôs just use this $300 after school expense as an example. If I didn‚Äôt have her, that would be $300 going into my travel funds every month and after a few months, that would be enough for a small vacation somewhere. As a young adult, I think exploring the world is very important. When I try to make friends, everyone talks about places they‚Äôve recently traveled to but I can‚Äôt relate because I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to or even dream of saving up for travel because I live paycheck to paycheck.

I feel broke, socially stunted, and not living up to my professional potential. I hate being a mom and especially a single one. I regret having her. I never have time for anything. All my time outside of work is spent trying to figure out how to better my life and learning new skills to add to my resume, but I can never commit to anything because I‚Äôm always balancing taking care of her, making sure she‚Äôs okay emotionally, and my own time to relax. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned my dating life yet but everything is horrible because I made stupid choices in high school. I don‚Äôt plan on having any more kids. They make life a living hell. I‚Äôm crying so hard typing this all out. I hate my life so damn much. I wish I can go back to not have her or fast forward into the future when she‚Äôs all grown and I can finally have my life back. But I‚Äôll be old and past my prime. I hate that I have to be pc when I mention how I feel to others. I want to travel whenever and wherever I want to, be out all night, drink all night, have a bunch of friends, have a fancy job, date whoever I want, go to all the clubs and music festivals, learn whatever I want to, get wasted all weekend, and blow my money on all the things I want to."
api4iy,14,2019-02-11,Had my first wedding-related meltdown over the weekend. How do you all keep from getting overwhelmed and just saying what you do and don't want?,billy_the_buffalo,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/api4iy/had_my_first_weddingrelated_meltdown_over_the/,"TL:DR - I'm new to wedding planning and getting overwhelmed with all the decisions you have to make.  I cried in a restaurant over wedding dress shopping because I couldn't control my emotions and I need help speaking up and saying what I want.

&amp;#x200B;

So FH (30) and I (25) got engaged in December after 5 years together (YAY!)   The two of us have family and friends who have been getting married, but neither of us has ever been a big part of the planning part of things, so we are pretty much brand new to this whole process.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a bridal show in January and immediately got hit with the reality that weddings are crazy expensive.  It was kind of a bummer, but that's okay!  We don't want to spend a ton of money on a wedding, so we'll make something work with what we have.  I've been browsing around on Pinterest and trying to get some ideas.  I've done a lot of research and made a list of venues that were reasonably priced.  We made a guest list and it came out to somewhere around 50-60 people.  We came up with a general date range of September/October 2020.  I felt like we were pretty on top of things.

&amp;#x200B;

This past Saturday we toured our first venue and brought my mom along.  It was an absolutely lovely place and had pretty much everything we were looking for.  The venue offered a lot of services that I liked and I would definitely want to consider.  But when we sat down to talk to the wedding coordinator, we realized there was a lot we hadn't talked about or made a decision on yet.  She was asking us a ton of questions we hadn't even thought about.  Do we want to do a ceremony or just a reception?  We really aren't a family of dancers, do we want to hire a DJ?  We parted ways with a lot of our friends last year, will it be weird that there's no bridal party?

&amp;#x200B;

We all went to lunch afterwards and were just talking about the venue and what we thought about it.  Then my FH and mom start talking and this is the part where my emotions got the best of me.  My mom eloped in Vegas when she was my age and suggested we just do that and that way I won't have to go through all the hassle of trying to find a dress.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have a really hard time saying what I want.  I've got this idea in my head that it will make me sound selfish and I'd rather make the other person happy and just do whatever they want instead.  I'm a full-grown woman and I know that's not good and I'm actively working on that.  Even though I don't have a perfect picture in my head of what I want our wedding to look like, I do know that the only thing I truly wanted out of this process (besides getting to marry my best friend :) ) is the pretty dress.  I've always looked forward to that part of wedding planning.  After we got engaged I started getting really excited to go to the bridal shops with my mom and try on dresses and eventually find that perfect one.  So hearing my mom suggest we go to Vegas and just skip the dress part all together just really got to me and all my feelings just came out.  I start crying right there in the middle of lunch in a crowded restaurant which I know was not only embarrassing for me, but for my FH and mom.  

&amp;#x200B;

I had never vocalized how important that part was to me, so I want to clarify I'm in no way upset with the fact my mom suggested going to Vegas.  Both my mom and FH didn't know I felt that way and that's not their fault.  I'm working full-time right now, going to school full-time, and doing an internship on the weekends.  I've been a little stressed out and doing a little wedding planning here and there (especially dress shopping online) has been a fun part of my day.  So hearing someone suggest that I should forgo the one thing that I've truly been looking forward to opened up the flood gates.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so embarrassed that I got so worked up and emotional over a dress that I'm just going to wear once.  It seems so trivial, but at the same time it's still really important to me.  Now they know what it means to me, but I wish I could have just vocalized how I felt like an adult instead of crying like a little baby in front of a room full of people.  

&amp;#x200B;

So how do you all keep you emotions in check without getting overwhelmed?  How do you speak up and say ""No, this is important to me""?  I really appreciate any advice you lovely people can give me!

apjpo9,2,2019-02-11,[M4F] The Intern,mjd931,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/apjpo9/m4f_the_intern/,"Hey I am Michael 25 (IRL) from London, England. I am an adult looking for an adult for fantasy fun.

I am looking to play the office intern around the 13+ age. I want to get a job in an office with some sexy office workers. Maybe I am the bosses son and that's how I got the job. Maybe you are one of the women I am working under and I am not pulling my weight [So you see what I am good for](https://gfycat.com/WarmNextDegu).

Or I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

Maybe I am interviewing for the position and you're asing what attributes I have, I can't help but stare and get hard and you want to utilize my biggest attribute.

Or even I walk into your office and catch you masturbating. You chase after me and suck me for my silence.

Maybe you have your own idea.

Below are my kinks.....

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me.

Being tied up, Love the idea of being tied up and unable to move as you do stuff to me."
apjrc6,60,2019-02-11,Sober for 235 days and I just got a job!,ReaWroud,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/apjrc6/sober_for_235_days_and_i_just_got_a_job/,"Daily smoker for 10 years and on sick leave for two. Before I quit, I spent my days rolling and smoking, watching TV and playing games, feeling like absolute shit because my apartment was a pig sty and I couldn't gather the energy to do much of anything. For the past 235 days, I've been working to better my life, to get back out there and do things, to be able to feel like I'm doing something with my life. I've been through two internships where I slowly increased the amount of hours I could work after sitting on my ass for two years.

I'm almost on full time now and today I got my first full time job! I can't tell you how amazing it feels to have this opportunity and to not feel terrified by it. I feel like I can handle it and like I'll actually be worth the money they'll pay me. In under 8 months, I've gone from high to sober, from lazy to productive, from having a shitty, dirty apartment to keeping my current apartment clean and tidy. I honestly didn't think I'd be able to get this far in this amount of time. I'm insanely proud of myself and I hope that someone out there reads this and thinks ""That's what I want! I feel like everything is hopeless, but if this girl can do it, so can I!"" Because I felt hopeless. I felt like even if I managed to quit smoking, my life would still be in shambles. And it might have been, if I didn't work at it. But let me tell you, making an effort and getting results gets so much easier when you aren't constantly thinking of getting high. 

Here's the things that helped me quit:
1) I moved and didn't allow myself to smoke in the new place.
2) My family knew about my weed abuse and were there to support me.
3) I distracted the fuck out of myself for the first month - organized thought can come later. Luckily moving keeps you busy for a while and in a really good way.
4) I spent the last month before quitting/moving planning all of this out. Thinking about what kind of emotions and sensations I would experience and preparing for that. I had a plan for what to do if the cravings got too bad (Go talk to family, distract myself, do busy work)
5) I sought out support from this subreddit, a local, free addiction center and from various other sources.
6) I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't be able to afford my apartment.
7) I really, really wanted it. I had realized how much of my life weed had robbed and I was sick of it. I desperately wanted a way out. Not like the other times where I mostly felt like I ""should"". This time it was ""I will"".

TL;DR: Slob on sick leave quits smoking, becomes contributing member of society."
apjs4b,1,2019-02-11,M4A (A playing F) The Ultimate multiple prompt list. Edging all day gets a guy flustered so.. Hopefully something for everyone! (Fairly long) (open/multiple prompts) (light or dark) (chat or rp) (Short or long term),Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/apjs4b/m4a_a_playing_f_the_ultimate_multiple_prompt_list/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

*(In no particular order, and feel free to mix and match!)*

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Living with HyperSpermia:** This is a prompt that is a little more far fetched. The premise is that I have a 'condition' called HyperSpermia that causes my balls to produce semen at a faster rate than most people which means I have to empty them a lot more often. Side effects include no refractory period and very large loads.

We can have a concerned sibling, doctor or friend that finds out about my condition and 'helps' me. But there's a lot that could happen so go nuts.

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Futa Fun:** (I play Futa you play Female) Pretty self explanatory, wanna fuck a chick with a dick? Wanna see a pair of bouncing tits while your holes get filled with warm cum?

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**Pornstar encounters:** Similar to the celebrity prompt above, this one includes famous pornstars instead. If you interested I can tell you a few of my favorites over PM (Or you can send yours) I don't tend to enjoy asian, black or indian though, just to clarify.

This prompt can be explored in a cheesy porno styled scenario or maybe i'm a fan that 'wins' a day with you or maybe just a fan that comes across you in everyday life.

**The threesome with the two sisters:** (Major bonus points for this one) It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

**Others:** Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff, rape, cumplay, raceplay. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary and BONUS points if you let me choose your character)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes.."

Anyways, I am a finance major and this is for a mostly psychology and behavioral science majors so I made it less formal.  Here it is.

Hello Mrs....,

&amp;#x200B;

I've yet to have the pleasure of meeting you. My name is (me), and am very interested in working with Coalition Pathways. I'm a believer in your mission and really want to be part of bettering our city and helping people through drug-use prevention and awareness.

I am currently a student at Penn State, pursuing a finance major with an interest in non-profits, with a minoring in psychological behavior. I've always had a deep calling to using my skills and connections to helping others, I am fluent in English, Spanish, and some Mandarin. I want to change our community, and I have some good ideas to share with Coalition Pathways.

I am keen to join your program as an intern, I heard about Coalition Pathways from a previous intern, (friend) She told me about what an astonishing experience it was with the work she did during her time with you. The effects of addiction have had a strong influence in my life, with a close family member struggling with abuse.

You will find my resume attached if you'd care to review it, I would very much like to arrange a meeting with you, I can be reached at xxx-xxx-xxxx or @gmail.com

Sincerely,

me"
apk2sc,5,2019-02-11,What are my rights? Or am I doing something wrong?,alexanderkovalev,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/apk2sc/what_are_my_rights_or_am_i_doing_something_wrong/,"Preface: I am 3 years removed from graduating college, in that span, I have been working internships and had a steady job, although 6 months ago I was forced to quit said job.

&amp;#x200B;

It was at a startup and I was first promised full-time employment after 6 months and start full-time after the new year (I was their only employee). When the new year hit I was not offered full-time and continued working then I received my 1099, not knowing what I was doing. Long story short, working there for two years I was suddenly not being paid. After 2 months of this I was given one check and told I was working for a start up and there would be times I would not be paid, I quit. 6 months later I have been unemployed without receiving any type of unemployment. Is this company at fault for any of this, or just chalk this up as a lesson learned for my naivety?

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward.. In a completely different situation. I have interviewed for a temporary position, I did not receive the position. 

3 months later at the new year, the position opened up again (full-time/permanent with benefits) the interviewer reached out to me and said they would love to interview me again since the last person did not work out. I took the interview, then proceeded to go on four more interviews with this person, brought in to meet the team and view the office. I then took a test to prove I am capable of the job and asked for references. I took the test and provided references, days later I was rejected from the same job a second time without test results and all that time wasted while also being embarrassed of my references when asked how the job went since they did not receive a call from the employer... What are my rights in this situation? Or am again just at fault on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear thoughts on this... best of luck in your job hunts...

apl4hr,0,2019-02-11,Internship - Buy a car in-state or out-of-state?,halcyonalcyone,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/apl4hr/internship_buy_a_car_instate_or_outofstate/,"Hello, I'm from Seattle and I'll be interning over the summer in Santa Clara. I'll be buying a car (new or CPO) that I'll use there (and will continue to use for at least a few years after graduating in December 2019). 

I was wondering if it would be better to buy a car here in Washington and have it shipped down and up (the company will reimburse most of this) or to buy a car in California and then ship it up (the company will fully reimburse this) after I finish the internship. It would be easier finding and purchasing a car in Washington since I live here.

I believe that if I do the latter I'll have to register the car in Washington when I return and pay for that and possibly for use tax so that may end up costing more. 
If I buy the car in Washington, will I have to register the car in California if I'm just there for 3 months?

I'm not sure if I'll be working in Seattle or in the bay area after graduating.

I appreciate the help. Thanks!

Edit: Forgot to add, my parents will be covering the costs for the car/insurance for at least the first year. I'll be looking into a reliable sedan (Honda, Toyota, etc.)"
aples5,10,2019-02-11,Just Diagnosed and Have a Lot To Process,thenoesis89,hivaids,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivaids/comments/aples5/just_diagnosed_and_have_a_lot_to_process/,"Hey,

So I was recently diagnosed and I just have a lot of mixed feelings and emotions. I have an idea how it happen: Late/Mid December I had gone out drinking, gotten so drunk I ended up waking up in another person's bed. I remembered vague flashes of that night and it all seemed consensual but he didn't use a condom. It's not something I usually do and I've never had so much alcohol where I basically blacked out. I have been going through a lot of issues concerning self-esteem/image etc. and what not and had been slowly getting more and more reckless, with NYE I completely blacked out where my friends found me passed out, outside a bar I knew I had to start curbing my alcohol consumption. Flash forward to a few weeks ago. I had a week where I just felt terrible. Extremely tired, my entire body hurt, loss of appetite, and high temperature. At first I thought it had to do with my schedule, having two internships and a weekend job, part of me thought I was exhausted from overworking but something told me to get an STD/HIV test. I went to get tested and all my test came back negative. I was treated for early syphilis for a small sore but aside from that I was extremely happy. I was going to take control of my life, see about getting on PreP, and be more responsible with my decisions. Then I got the call for a follow up last Friday and I knew what that meant and found out that I had tested reactive for HIV.

&amp;#x200B;

The news was a surprised, but at the same time it wasn't. Going into my first testing I had prepared myself to accept an HIV diagnoses and when it came back Negative it was like I was given another chance to get things right. When the case worker talked to me and explain why the swap test was negative and my blood test was positive, I started to cry. I felt like my second chance was ripped away from me, all my plans were null and void, and I had to face the fact that I did this to myself. I called my aunt and told her and cried hard on the phone with her, she reassured me how much she loves me and will help me in anyway that I need it from financial to emotional support. After work I told my mother who was reassuring and said I will get through this and will come out stronger from it.  I spent the time I could in bed this last weekend until I had to get up for work. A part of me feels lost and angry at myself, another part feels relieved from the constant fear of getting HIV, another part wants to do anything and everything I can to get this virus under control, and one more part just wants to hide under the covers and just stay there.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that since this is a very early infection that it will be a lot easier to get me to get to undetectable levels. I have an appointment with the LA LGBT Center on Thursday for Financial Screening and then a Doctors appointment right after. I'm told I can even start treatment that day. Then there is a series of more appointments, one with the nursing staff that will be working with my primary doctor, then another with the doctor that will be my primary and over see my treatment. Then after that I just have to have regular check up every 3-6 month depending on how I respond to treatment. I am at least extremely grateful for the LGBT Center for getting me on a routine fast, and I might even qualified for program that will assist with payments of doctor visits and medication. My mother has been doing a ton of research on insurances and between her, my aunt+uncle, they all will help me in anyway they can in finding programs or assistance for me.  I know I have this amazing support but at time I just feel like crying, or I just feel numb and lost... how did you all adjust to news and how was your first reaction when you found out?"
aplj3n,0,2019-02-11,Chances of Admission,EashanPrabhu,duke,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/aplj3n/chances_of_admission/,"I know a lot of people probably post stuff like this, but I was wondering about my chances of getting into Duke next year, I am currently a junior. I will most likely be majoring in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology - so applying to the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences.

So, here are my stats:

GPA (weighted): 3.53

SAT: 1500 (I am going to be taking it again, so fingers crossed)

SAT2: Chem-730 (I will be taking Biology and Math 2 which I‚Äôm fairly confident that I can get above a 750 on)

I would also most likely be applying Early Decision since my dad went to Duke for his Masters and PhD, I‚Äôm hoping his legacy can boost my application.

As for extra curricular, I do Robotics, Business Club, I volunteer and coach middle schools kids over the summer and through the fall for FLL, and I will be doing an internship this summer. I have also been selected by my school and attended leadership conferences.

So, with all this said, what are my chances? I‚Äôm mostly concerned about my GPA being low, but I have had a GPA of 3.8 average over my sophomore and junior year, with my freshman GPA being a 3.1 (so would I be able to explain to them that I was an idiot freshman year?)

We get along very well, but I can't help this nagging feeling that we may not work out in the future.

First of all, I am an extremely ambitious person. I didn't start in the best place in life and the example my parents set for me is to constantly work hard and aim higher. They started life penniless and my mom never got to go and work because she was a stay-at-home mom in order to care for me and my three siblings. I worked my ass off to get a scholarship to attend college. I succeeded and went to college tuition free. I became a national scholar to foreign countries twice and went abroad three times, becoming fluent in two languages. I worked through school and did internships through using all the connections I had. I pursued two degrees and a minor. Now, I am applying to top graduate schools in my chosen field. I want to have a certain lifestyle and find fulfilling and interesting work in the government, and one day hopefully get a PhD. I have many goals and I pursue them relentlessly even if I am not 100% certain of what I want to do in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend, on the other hand, doesn't really have goals. He sees no purpose in trying to aim for something he isn't sure he will achieve. His only real hobby is video games and he needs pushing to do any small thing, even getting his hair cut. I've tried to help him learn how to dress or learn how to engage in proper self-care, but it feels futile when he never takes the initiative to do those things himself. I feel like I always need to nag him about getting things done that he's said he will do because he forgets or just doesn't feel like doing it. I know for a fact he isn't depressed. I am afraid he may just be lazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, he has always consistently underperformed in school and doesn't do much to really improve. He decides not to do homework because ""it isn't graded anyways"" despite that being his only responsibility. Even when I've tried to help him learn how to study he always says ""well it doesn't work for me that way,"" which is a load of BS because he basically says all effective means of studying don't work for him. He says he really just doesn't ""like"" school, but he has gained no skills through school and chose a degree he knew would require graduate school if he wanted to work in that field. I feel helpless to help him aim for goals when he aims so low and won't help himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, we aren't really able to talk about much beyond surface level things because I am not a fan of online games, however, I can still carry on a conversation about it in a minor way. My boyfriend isn't able to hold a conversation about things I like at all ‚Äì such as politics, history, or science ‚Äì so we end up having this issue where we get along very well, but really don't talk about much. I don't mind silence, but my needs for conversation and debate are completely unmet. It's difficult for friends to fulfill these needs because I can't be with my friends each day. It really bothers me and I find myself being less and less able to do things he likes more than I do because he spends all day playing video games in his PJs when he's done with classes. I don't want to be bitter, but it's hard not to be when it feels like I'm doing more for a future I want to share with him than he is for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to talk to him about these things more than once and he makes a change for about a day, but then abandons it or he says that I'm attacking him and he never responds whenever I try to have a serious conversation. He says he doesn't want to talk about these things. It's just like I am scolding a child when I just want to have a serious conversation because he just kind of sits there without speaking and takes forever to respond. I am worried that this will cause big issues in our future. I love him so much and I don't want to leave him. He needs to make a change regardless of me and I feel really helpless.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think I should do? What can I do to help him? "
apm03q,6,2019-02-11,"#GEIX [Derbyshire] - Cenarchos launches his campaign in the constituency of Derbyshire, but more specifically in the City of Derby itself.",Cenarchos,MHoCCampaigning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHoCCampaigning/comments/apm03q/geix_derbyshire_cenarchos_launches_his_campaign/,"*Deputy Leader of Labour and Member of Parliament for the London-at-Large List Seat /u/Cenarchos has launched his campaign in the City of Derby. The focus of Labour has been in Derbyshire as of recent, and many people were drawn here due to the speech that the Labour Leader had made.*

*Just by Derby Cathedral, /u/Cenarchos and his small team of four interns set up an area to deliver their speech. It wasn‚Äôt that great, an average podium. After coming from the National Party launch, /u/Cenarchos was a little tired and a little drunk.*

‚ÄúThank you for coming out to my campaign launch. I promise that I will try to make it worthwhile. Derbyshire has elected a Conservative Member of Parliament for sometime, and I believe that it is time for some change for our constituency.‚Äù

‚ÄúLabour is dedicated to the working class, as we have always been. Our radical policies on vacation time and sick pay will be implemented if we win this election. We will implement (in addition to the five weeks paid), four weeks non-mandatory non-paid Vacation Time that can be taken by the employee. If the employee decides not to take the non-mandatory non-paid Vacation Time, the business will have to ‚Äúbuy out‚Äù their weeks at 2% annual income per week.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis means that if you decide to not take all four weeks, you will receive 8% of your annual income at the end of the year. The vacation time pay is going to greatly help families who struggle to get by, as well as helping those families get more time off when required. In addition to this, we will have giving workers 12 paid personal days a year to be used.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe believe that family comes first, not work. We remain dedicated to supporting the growth of families, as well as the healthy family model that ensures people are looked after and supported - both financially and emotionally.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Tories are running on maintaining the status-quo. My opponent believes that lower welfare is good for society - I disagree. Welfare, when utilized properly, is a source of good. I have also not seen the Tories raise wages, instead they have focused on deregulating businesses. I don‚Äôt see how that raises the wages of the average man and woman in Derbyshire, instead it raises the salaries of those earning a lot more money than the average worker.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am glad to accept endorsements from so many parties - all representing something which makes Derbyshire so unique. I promise that if elected, I will do my best to try to represent all of us. It doesn't matter who we vote for, it only matters that the people of this constituency are represented in Westminster properly.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you examine my opponent‚Äôs history in the House of Commons you will notice a pattern. Much like the majority of Tories this election, we can see a pure hatred of our armed forces and helping them. He launched a vicious attack on B683 - which would have seen Veterans get the support they deserve. I voted to help out Veterans - our current Member of Parliament did not. If he wants to discuss his record, I wonder how he will discuss his record to the men and women who serve in our military?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn addition, the Former Prime Minister voted against giving you all an extra day off work. It seems his record screams of corporate cronyism at the expense of the community and the worker. I reject the lazy and tired Tory-isms that discuss their record. They have no plan for the future - and only will discuss their tired old record.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do commend the Member for his commitment to Brexit. At this point the deal has been made, and I stand beside what has been done. I believe that it would be an affront to our democracy if we overturned the referendum. This simply will not happen, and any attempts to do it will be met with a No from me. Even though I campaigned to remain in the single market (and I am proud of my campaign), I believe that now we cannot look to change the democratic will of the people.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is what Labour will do. We will increase the amount of days off workers get, increase wages, and support our families in Derbyshire. Thank you for listening to me drone on. I‚Äôm going to the pub if anyone would like to join me.‚Äù

*/u/Cenarchos and his team cleaned up the area and left to go get drinks. VERY NICE!*

I will list them below, and if you have any experience with these internship programs I would GREATLY appreciate it, as I am having a hard time deciding and Im on a time crunch. 

My first offer is from a Boeing Supplier (Spirit Aerosystems). 
Pros: I am more comfortable with the job requirements, and I think the work would be easier because of my familiarity with the subject matter. 
Cons: The location (Wichita, KS) is not ideal, as I was hoping to land an internship in a location with more recreation options like hiking, camping etc. 

My second offer is from Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson, AZ. I will leave out the department name for anonymity. 
Pros: The location is better suited for my lifestyle, although I wouldn't want to live there long term. Also comes with a security clearance. 
Cons: I might get the security clearance late in the internship, which means there won't be much work for me to do in the mean-time. I am also much less familiar with the job requirements (mostly programming), which means I will have to do more learning but it will benefit me longterm. 

Thank you for any advice!

apo60t,90,2019-02-11,"Something I don't get about the whole ""it doesn't matter what games they play"" argument...",Patronizes_Idiots,rantgrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/apo60t/something_i_dont_get_about_the_whole_it_doesnt/,"With the recent sharp increase of the Grumps playing shovelware and doing things like the jigsaw puzzle episode, map quizzes, reading Wikipedia articles, etc. I've noticed the mainsub fans rolling out one of their most used excuses more and more;

**""It doesn't matter what game they play, I watch for the conversation, not the gameplay""**

And OK, fair enough, I don't think any of us have ever watched GG to see Arin speedrun or for his precise, awe-inspiring mastery of videogames. But this argument is washing over and brushing aside a *HUGE* element of what made Game Grumps memorable or special in the past. 

If you think back across nearly every big funny and memorable moment in GG, a massive amount of them have come from the situations they were put in **by the games they were playing.** The famous ""WHAT IS THIS"" rant, the Battle Kid ""Jennifer dumped me"" improv rage fit, all of Devil's Third, the Wind Waker selfie with Ganondorf, The Mr. Wilson rap, The great Nickelodeon Guts debate, the House Party playthrough, Mad Dog McCree, and many, many more. 

My point here is, (and I am loathe to even put it in these terms, but it's true) but if you think of each of these moments as an improv scene, the framing device or setup was really what gave them the material to come up with these bits. If your improv coach says to you; ""Ok, here's the scene, you are an apathetic Russian mercenary who has ended up in a huge firefight. Ok go"". There's a lot to work with in that scenario. 

Now imagine your improv coach says; ""Ok, here's the scene, you're sitting on a couch with a friend. That's it"". Essentially that's the improv situation they're finding themselves in when they're doing shit like jigsaw puzzles. It's a totally blank slate, there is *very* little to work with. Now if you're a comedic improv genius I'm sure you could still dig deep and come up with something clever, but with all due respect, they have their moments but I would not classify Dan and Arin as comedic geniuses...

Now the other route they seem to try and go is finding games that in and of themselves are the joke. Things like Kitty Love where they're going into it to milk the humor of ""Oh this is a wacky premise and a horribly mistranslated dating sim"", but beyond that surface level humor and the opportunity to just do goofy voices the whole time there isn't a whole lot more to glean from it. I think this is why they're going through heaps of shovelware these days, they're hoping to find games so bad that they can just coast of how dumb and weird they are without having to put in the effort of really playing something. And this worked much better in the past when they came into it with more energy, like how funny the Mary-Kate and Ashley games from the Jon era were. So there is some potential in weird shovelware games, but you can't just pick them because they look bad, you still need to come into it with some comedic energy beyond your base level.

I get that they're focusing more on the Power Hour and on streams now, and it's fine that they're refocusing and expanding. But I hate to think that they're just going to settle into easy games or things that seem like easy content just because it's a stupid game. I doubt you'd see even the most hardcore obsessive fans say they'd rather see them play Barbie Horse Adventure and Jeopardy for the umpteenth over something like Devil's Third or Dead Rising. It still is very much in their best interest to find good games for the daily uploads.

I don't know if they even pick the games they play themselves anymore or if Brent or one of their interns does it based on what seems like easy content, but I just really wish they'd put in more effort to find those type of games that really work well with their comedy. I don't really watch anymore, but every once in a blue moon even in recent years there will be a game that still is a great fit and makes for a funny series, House Party being the most recent one I remember. And I get they're moving away from doing long form series as their daily uploads and instead saving them for streams, but I just hope they don't settle into this lazy pattern. But I'm not holding out much hope.

Essentially this is what I'm trying to say. If you're the type of fan that will watch anything Game Grumps puts out because you just like Dan and Arin, fair enough, I'm not going to tell you you're wrong for doing that. *BUT*, don't try and deny that what games they play make a difference. Because they really do. And sure, there have definitely been times where they play something simple and still end up having fun or cool conversations (the OG Katamari series springs to mind), but when they play games that give them a lot to work with, it usually ends up being a lot more entertaining.

I first met him when he was studying aboard, started hanging out for 4 months, and he was my first of everything.

After he left, a month later I asked him out if we wanted anything serious in this relationship or cutting a contact from each other, he said yes to me although we did not really know if we would meet each other again soon.

Another long distance 4 months went by, it was the sweetest time, he was the most caring person I could possibly ask for. We are active in texting, calling, and sex calling every week and we never felt like it was an obligation to do so. I completely fell for him, I was fulfilled and never one felt lonely despite the fact that we did not have any physical acts. I genuinely saw many potentials in us.

Fast forwards, He got internship and made it back to where I live. I was being supportive, researching and being hopeful/helpful as possibly as I could for him if not for us and we had a good news. We were lucky to live and spend another 6 months together. It was a dream came true that we were sharing out journeys everyday for 6 months straight, might sound too exaggerating, it was magical after all struggle we had. Towards almost the end of his internship, we had confrontation, broken down several times, and decided we wanted to keep on going.

After he left again, it has been 4 and half months, but this time he was wrapped up with school, I was too wrapped up with full-time school and jobs saving to see him again. I was in the process of sending out my internship application where he lives, hoping to spend 4 -6 months together.  I told him, deeply I felt like he was not as excited as he should be.

I would send him a morning text everyday since he left from day one and being consistence in texting and calling. At some point I noticed how things weren't the same, I started arguments and called him out since I felt unsatisfied. However, I had come to conclusion that I should be more understanding and being supportive of him. Which means  only he could decide when we wanted to make a call, the only time he could make a call was around 4 -5 in the morning where I live since he was 6 hours behind. I expressed to him how thankful I felt when he made effort to call, although I was the one who had to encourage in conversations.  Until 4 days ago he said he wasn't sure if his feeling towards me or that he doesn't love me the way he did anymore. He gave me  reasons that he couldn't see us together in the the future and said that I seemed like I was expecting a lifetime commitment from him when he never made plan or mentioned about our next step. We gave each other closures and broke up after.

As much as I never wanted this to happen, my heart is shattered and my spirit has been destroyed. This is a fresh wounded first time I have ever gotten my heart break at the age of 24. I cried to the point when I finally realize that he doesn't deserve my tears, but I can't get over him somehow.

Thank you anyone who have made this to the end of the reading despite all the errors in grammar and showing your kindness.

Thank you

I write for my university monthly magazine and also post stories on [Medium.org](https://Medium.org) every now and then. I plan on honing my writing and filmmaking skills alongside my engineering academics, until I complete the degree ( I am due to complete the course in mid-2021).

I feel very inspired by media outlets like Vox, Vice where journalists like Joss Fong, Hanood Hassan, Johnny Harris get to work doing the things which I would love to do myself. The things they get to experience exploring the corners of the world, bringing people's plight to the attention of the international audience is something I feel truly passionate about.

However, I have no contacts or anyone who has any experience regarding this field who might be able to help me understand what this sphere is all about. In the coming summer, I plan on applying to a media company for an internship, so I would like to know what to expect.

I have a few concerns about my years to come and some daily struggles I face:

1) What does a media company look for in an employee or intern as a whole? (Qualities, Skills, Work Ethic, Personality Traits, anything you might deem appropriate).

2) Is it better to have a separate blog website or should I keep posting on Medium as I already do?

3) I mainly do geopolitics, but always struggle to finalise on a topic, How can I fixate quickly on a topic, so I can devote more time to writing?

4) Should I pursue a journalism-related degree in the future? Is it worth the time, money and effort, when I could be journalism in a more practical scenario? If, so which are some of the best universities for this?

2) I have been reading a lot of news lately where I see a lot of journalists are being laid off implying no future for journalism, digital media can never work etc. (comments on such posts).

Any and all help is very much appreciated. I would love to hear from you guys. Thanks a ton :)"

apq2b6,26,2019-02-12,I just finished trade school,ElsasQueen,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/apq2b6/i_just_finished_trade_school/,"I dropped out of college way back in 2014 because, at the time, I was not ready for it and only went because my family wouldn't shut up about it. I've since learned to never take life advice from them (some of them didn't even realize you have to pay for college!). I'm not a first generation, but I am the only one (so far) of *my* generation to graduate. Before me, it was my mother, and before her, my grandmother on my father's side. We're the only family members of our respective generations to finish any kind of higher education.

I went back to school last year, and I chose trade/vocational school, partially because I did not want to spend half a decade in university. My program was for nine months, though the last month is for internship, which is where I'm at now.

Now, I know it is possible to attend school, hold a job, and raise a kid (or more than one) at the same time... but, holy hell, I'm glad I don't have a kid! I'm nearly $12,000 in student loan debt, and that's tame compared to some of my peers (one of my co-workers is $40K in debt from four years of university; he's only a year older than me). Sometimes, I could barely stay on top of the expenses because I did not have enough hours at my job (retail), and I had to rely on my family's help. The holidays were the worst. One week of winter break, so I was running on 2 to 4 hours of sleep between school, studying, and retail's crazy holiday hours. I won't lie. Over the past eight months, I said to myself more times than I could count ""When will it end?!"" Eight *months*! And people do this for three, four, and five years? You're warriors.

My point is when people say ""you can still do [whatever] with a kid"", I understand their point, but I see it as chaining an anchor to your ankles to run a race. You can still finish the race, but it's a lot harder than it needs to be and it's not necessary. I don't know how I would've afforded a kid's expenses on top of my school ones (""god will provide"" is crap; I have a SIL who's living proof of that) if I was a parent. One of my classmates is a parent. To her credit, she was an awsome student, but the stories she sometimes told about her kids, mostly getting vomited on all night because they've got the flu (and she once came to school with the flu), were enough to make my tubes do a double knot.

Why make life harder than it needs to be?

Thank you for reading my nighttime thoughts."

Edit: I could accept a loan for $500 instead if that would be easier to work with for lenders - would be willing to pay back \~$600 on 06/01/2019 if that is the case (repayment date is negotiable).

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: I could borrow from a friend to repay the loan sometime the weekend of 02/15/2018 - I would wait until then and just borrow from him directly but I need to pay my rent before then to avoid eviction. I can provide proof of everything I have stated in this post.

\---

Hi all, I am in need of a loan to cover living expenses for this month. I have been struggling to find a job after leaving a summer internship to return to university. I finally found a job and I start on Tuesday (02/12/2019), of which I can provide proof of. However, I am behind on bills and thus am in need of money to pay for rent and utilities for this month or else I will be evicted within the next couple of days (of which I can also provide proof of).

&amp;#x200B;

I will be making anywhere from $170-270 per week depending on how many hours they can give me in any given week (varies with the weather/sales patterns). My only expenses each month are rent and utilities, as well as car insurance. It is likely that I will be able to pay back the amount before the date of 06/01/2019), but since I am a student and most of my wages will go back towards future rent/utility payments I wanted to give myself a realistic buffer to make repayment. This date is negotiable as I also have a $500 tax return coming my way (which I may be able to provide proof of as well, my mother filed my taxes for me as my forms were all sent to my home address rather than my school address).

&amp;#x200B;

Repayment, date(s) and lump sum repayment vs weekly/monthly payments are all negotiable. \*I picked the date of June first as I will be out of university for the semester the first week of May and that would provide nearly a month of working full time before having to make payment back to the lender.\*

&amp;#x200B;

I hope to hear back from y'all soon. I've heard this is a fantastic community. Thank you for your consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: grammar and clarification on repayment date

apq93m,1,2019-02-12,Incoming Computer Science Major,osburhino,FIU,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIU/comments/apq93m/incoming_computer_science_major/,"I'll be attending FIU for computer science this upcoming year and I thought it'd be a good idea to come to the FIU reddit to ask for some general tips about the program. 

Those of you in CS;

1. BA or BS? I'm aware of the fact that most software engineering jobs don't use most of the math courses in the real world making them time consuming, useless, and overall something stopping you from focusing on actual CS courses (my opinion. Did those of you with a BA find hardship in looking for internships or jobs in relation to having a BA instead of a BS?
2. Professors or classes to avoid or look out for? Which professors should I take and which should I avoid? Were there any classes or professors that were notoriously bad but still required?
3. Any helpful or general tips from people who've experienced success or failure because of specific habits, etc

All comments, tips, and such welcome! I want to enjoy my time here and I'm looking for those who've had some experience to guide me

Thank you!"

apqfsv,2,2019-02-12,AITA for giving up on my friendship even though they didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong?,coldasice18,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/apqfsv/aita_for_giving_up_on_my_friendship_even_though/,"Sorry if this ends up being a long post, I‚Äôll try to condense it as much as possible.

Also this is a throw away account since other ppl follow my actual one.

so I‚Äôm friends with this girl and we‚Äôve been friends for about three years now. we met in college bc we were roommates as freshmen, then sophomore year we got our separate apartments, and now we are juniors and roommates again. 

During freshman year, we had some struggles with our friendship, but it was nothing more than just some dorm-sharing girl drama (easily annoyed by one another, feeling left out, not liking each other‚Äôs friends, etc.) which is mainly why we didn‚Äôt live together sophomore year. but then we became closer again and decided to live together junior year again in an apartment.

She has a boyfriend who is super overly possessive and doesn‚Äôt like when she goes out to parties or basically does anything (i‚Äôve tried to have nights of just hanging out in the living room with her but she always ends up going back to her room by midnight bc he wants to facetime her). I‚Äôve constantly tried to get her to come out to parties with me or do other things, but she always either blames her boyfriend or last minute says she doesn‚Äôt feel good or is ‚Äútired‚Äù and wants to stay in instead. Thankfully, I‚Äôm bar-age so I can go out to the bars with other friends if she bails.

Her bf also comes down to visit her every. single. weekend. (I wish i was exaggerating, but i‚Äôm not.. and the weekends he didn‚Äôt visit, she went home) and when they visit, they never want to do anything. They usually just sit in her room for hours only to leave occasionally to make food or go out to eat.

I told her that I kind of considered living on my own for senior year bc her boyfriend was always here and even when he wasn‚Äôt she didn‚Äôt want to ever do anything with me. She explained she was kind of hurt by me saying this and it was a wake up call to her to try and change her patterns and make the most of her college experience. Bc she agreed to this, i agreed to resign our lease with her for next year.

things were relatively okay up until about a week ago when I felt I was being very helpful and generous to her; offering her rides to go get groceries (she doesn‚Äôt have a car), driving her to her internship so she didn‚Äôt have to deal with the bus, giving advice on things with family, helping her with resume stuff, etc. So when I asked if she‚Äôd maybe want to go to a party with me that following weekend I figured she‚Äôd maybe say yes since I was pretty generous to her and this was something I wanted to do, right? Nope.

I was pretty annoyed that she gave the same ‚Äúmy bf wouldn‚Äôt be happy if I went‚Äù excuse when I asked but I just eventually shrugged it off and decided maybe we can just do something the next night instead. I suggested it, she said maybe, and then her boyfriend announces he‚Äôs coming to visit her (even though she saw him last weekend and will see him again next weekend for valentine‚Äôs day). And, yup, you guessed it, they were in her room the whole weekend. Oh, and they also smoked weed to the point where I could smell it through the whole apartment (i don‚Äôt mind the smell, it‚Äôs just a little distracting and annoying to smell it at 1am the night before Monday classes). 

I basically decided that I‚Äôve given up. I‚Äôm done offering rides, suggesting to do things together, trying to be a friend, etc. bc i feel like i‚Äôm just being used or taken for granted. I‚Äôm literally her only girl friend she has, and i‚Äôm kind of starting to maybe see why. 

Bc I‚Äôve given up, I didn‚Äôt text her this morning about walking to classes together (we have the exact same schedule since were in the same major) and she didn‚Äôt end up even coming to class. Why? bc her boyfriend stayed at the apartment until 3pm Monday. 

TL;DR: AITA for basically giving up on a friendship that started off my freshman year of college, bc my friend has basically chosen her boyfriend over me and let‚Äôs him control her life despite me offering lots of assistance and help for her?"

How is the weather? I've lived in San Jose California all my life, how does college station weather compare?

How is life in college station? Are there things to do and plenty of food/entertainment in the city? How easy is it to get to Dallas or any other major city in case I miss the hustle and bustle of the city life?

Are students super competitive or are they very collaborative?

Is there plenty of time for fun and extracurricular clubs as an engineering major?

Are there plenty of research opportunities, or do very few students get to take part in it?

How is social life on campus? Is it hard to make friends or are there plenty of opportunities?

Is the place crowded? Will I be able to find opportunities in internships and clubs, or are there too many kids for me to get any opportunities?

I've also heard TAMU is a conservative, racist campus( these are rumors circulating around my high school). How true is that? I don't believe the rumors, I just want to make sure they're not true. 

Sorry, I know its a lot of questions, but I appreciate anyone answering them for me:) thank you!

So, long story short I just came back to ID after getting my BS from a university abroad. Atm, I'm waiting for the results of my graduate admission for the Fall 2019 semester and was thinking to do a 2-3 month internship so I can improve my skills while at the same time learning about Indonesia startup scene. I tried to apply for some, mostly those which are posted on Te\*hInAs\*a, but unfortunately no luck. So;

1. How impossible is it to land an internship (both voluntary or paid are ok) for fresh graduate &lt;with no network&gt; in Indonesia?/How common is it for a fresh graduate to do an internship in Indonesia?
2. How impossible is it to land data science/software engineering internship if you don't hold a CS degree in Indonesia? (I majored Genetics/Bioinformatics and had the chance to do a combination of DS and WebDev for my graduation project also I had 3 dry-lab (mostly computational) internships during my ug)
3. also not related to this post, but how do you foresee the future of biotech in Indonesia? Knowing that nowadays, genomics and genetic testing (23andMe etc) are pretty popular in the West

I am currently doing my final internship at a large Dutch company (I'm Dutch myself) for my Bachelor in IT. The company has a policy that all new employees, including interns, must follow a mandatory security training. 

I met the girl in question at this training. She studies Industrial Engineering and Management and works in a different department which is located in another building than mine. She is also doing her final internship here.

After the training was done we chatted for a bit about where we live (she moved in from across the country) and what we want to do after our study is done (she want to study at a nearby university).

She also mentioned that she has bought a season pass for the local soccer club, but that she has no special interest in the sport.

That's about everything that I know of her. I haven't even introduced myself to her and I only know her name because the guard who gave the training asked our names.

I have no idea why I feel like this. We might have nothing in common at all for all I know. She just seems like a cute and funny girl, and I would like to get to know her better. I just don't know how, as the company has flexible working hours. You can start between 7 and 9 A.M. and leave as early as 15:30, as long as you worked 8.5 hours (half hour lunch break included).

I don't want to come off as a creep, or even worse a stalker, but I just don't want to fall back in my normal behavior, which is to completely ignore my feelings and cower out. 

I have no idea what to do, but I rather shoot my shot and fail than do nothing, but I don't want to fail because I come off as a creep and ruin my chances.

TL;DR. Can't stop thinking about a girl but I know almost nothing about her and would like to get to know her better, but I have no idea how."

apteyg,15,2019-02-12,Internship ruined dietetics for me,intern_throwaway__,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/apteyg/internship_ruined_dietetics_for_me/,"Hi all,

I'm about 3 months out from finishing my dietetic internship and I hate it so much that I don't even want to be a dietitian anymore. I LOVED my undergrad program and couldn't wait to get started in my career, but this internship has taken every ounce of joy out of it. I have had exactly ONE day that I can recall that I had fun. First semester was especially rough. I cried literally every day of the semester and fell into a very deep depression, because I have been so devastated that I dislike this so much.

I understand that there are a plethora of jobs for dietitians out there, but none of them sound appealing and I have become so down on the profession and am so uninspired (I used to be a very creative and talented baker/cook. Now I haven't cooked a thing since probably October, and my notebook of ideas hasn't been touched since before that) that I can't even believe that I once loved this. I've discussed this with my advisor and one preceptor that I was kind of close to, but they haven't been terribly supportive.

Has anyone else felt this way? How can I make this fun again? Am I doomed?"

aptot6,1,2019-02-12,22 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/aptot6/22_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

‚≠ê‚≠ê Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

5. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

6. When you message me, please write more than ""hi"" or ""saw your post"". Tell me which post you are coming from and any ideas you have. You do not need to write me a book, just give me more than two words. Poor introductions will be ignored.

7. I am looking for my character to be tfed, NOT tfing other characters. If that is a deal breaker, you have been warned.

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+. 

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or:

Kik: N1njastar28

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon!"

If you can drop items off in person or ship the items to their downtown Chicago office, PM me so that I can provide the address and details.

Edit:  The reason for the deadline is because they have a big Clothing Day event at the end of April where they lay out all the donations for the students to take. They spend a few weeks organizing the donations into categories.

It's an annual event that typically occurs in April, so they accept donations at the beginning of the year until the event instead of all year due to very limited storage space.

Also, if you prefer to drop off donations at their workshop locations instead of downtown office, PM me for details. They usually alternate between DePaul and UIC locations and are typically held on certain Saturdays."

I have some extra info for what kind of stuff I‚Äôm into along with a few sample prompts and/or ideas for you down here. I also have plenty more in my profile ranging from simple MF pairings to threesomes and group scenes even up to a prompt roulette and CYOAs both for you and me. I'm always open to suggestions of themes and ideas we could work forward with.

***

##Writing Style

I play long-term and prefer shorter replies, that allow better interaction, usually one or two paragraphs, except for when longer descriptions are needed. I also only do written character descriptions and expect the same. I like introductions, building the dynamic and flirtatious interaction between the characters along with the obvious smut to make things feel more enjoyable and relatable. I don‚Äôt tend to play extremely dominant nor extremely submissive characters but usually on the flirtier and more active side, though I do like the corrupted cute &amp; innocent girl aspect a well.

I also like to write the introductions, so I can set the mood. Some change of pace for the guys of DPP.

***

##Prompts

**Friend‚Äôs brothers** [F4MM]

My friend Laura had abandoned me in her room and would be gone for at least two hours with her parents with her. I could hear her brothers, both of whom were certainly lookers, playing something downstairs. Since she had done this to me I felt no pity for her for what I was going to do next.

My name is Emily, I was wearing black low-cut t-shirt showing my C-cup cleavage. With that I had paired white sports shorts with long athletic socks in my feet. I had my brown hair tied to a ponytail with some hair hanging loose on my cheeks. I was 5'7' tall. My eyes are blue, and my nose is slightly up tilted.

I stood up from her bed and walked downstairs where the guys were playing. With determination I walked between them and the living room table, bent over to pick up the remote, exposing my firm ass to them in progress, and sat down on an armchair with it.

**Girls betting on your bulge** [FF4M]

Your life had always been defined by your enormous endowment both off and on duty.

It‚Äôs was a late summer night. You were at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive though it seemed like the last one had skipped it‚Äôs turn. Eventually you two girls, just a tiny bit tipsy appeared to the stop and started snickering while trying to covertly stare at you. You had quite a good idea about what.

One of them was about 5‚Äô8‚Äù with her heels on. Her red hair was loose and cut to around shoulder length. She was wearing a black dress down to her thighs and up to her breasts leaving shoulders bare. The other had brown hair in a ponytail along with a long-sleeved black crop top and ripped skin-tight jeans. She had just canvas shoes on but was still almost as high as her friend with heels.

After about 3 minutes of them trying to peak and snickering the one black haired one approached you.

‚ÄúHey sorry to bother and for sorry for advance for being impolite but‚Ä¶‚Äù she stopped for a moment. ‚ÄúMy friend here says you‚Äôve stuffed your pants full of socks, but I think it‚Äôs real. Please, we have 20 bucks riding on this‚Äù

**Joining a sexual dare app** [F4GM]

After my messy breakup, my friends suggested joining FUCKR. Application where you make a profile and people offer you dares, with a time limit and a cash price, to complete. After running a bit late in rent after I‚Äôd kicked my boyfriend out I decided to give it a go.

I downloaded the app and got soon greeted by the instructions. The app works by people leaving tasks to users‚Äô profiles with a cash price, then the user needs to provide image or video proof of the task and after completion is verified the money is donated.

I made a username, snapped a face and body pick. 

The first pick was of a slightly freckled brunette with a cutesy face, more on the average side than hot. The second showed my body, about 5‚Äô7‚Äù and with a decent d-cup chest. In the picture I was wearing a red hoodie with a white shirt underneath and a black skirt, legs only partially visible so you couldn‚Äôt tell if I had thigh highs or dark stockings on.

I browsed a bit of the stuff others had published giggling and gasping at times before closing the app and putting the phone in my pocket and continued my shift in the clothes store I worked at.

##Ideas

**Blackmailed threesome**

For this I'm looking to play a cheating woman in a high position with you playing both the man I'm cheating with and the person who catches us. Two basic ideas are you being a high school student (18+) who catches his two teachers going at it. Or an intern in my company who catches me with a rival ceo etc.

**Picking up chick around the town**

You might have seen those clickbait videos where the guy goes around picking up chick with an expensive car. I'd like to try out building a prompt based around that without it being acted and much more smuttier.

**Fucking someone on shift**

A prompt based around not really caring a bout my job and just having fun while taking in the cash, can range from anything from me being a clerk at a secluded gas station or a late night security guard.

##Kinks

My [full kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/HANO9Si.png) but the main kinks are Clothed sex, flirting/seduction, Interracial, BBC, big/huge dicks, public places, cheating, threesomes, group sex, oral, anal, cumplay 

And main limits are Non-con (including groping), misogyny, incest, watersports, scat. Never control my character or post images of real people for reference

**Message me with your kinks, limits and ideas. Don't start anything outright.**

**I only RP in reddit PMs. Chats will be ignored.**

Looking forward to your orange envelopes."

apw0kb,1,2019-02-12,I‚Äôve lost all passion for my job and I‚Äôm too scared to go elsewhere.,sibandaud,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/apw0kb/ive_lost_all_passion_for_my_job_and_im_too_scared/,"I posted this to another sub but I could also just use some willing ears.

3 years ago I started working at a large water/wastewater treatment company in the Community Outreach Department. My position was a new one, and I was meant to assist the Community Outreach Manager in a number of events, mostly centered around kids, as well as presenting STEM-focused lesson plans in classrooms, along with some other small tasks.

I‚Äôm not one to brag about my accomplishments, but I have done a damn good job in my position. When I started, we were going out and teaching about 1600 students a year, in 2017 we taught around 6,000, last year we taught 9,000, and this year we‚Äôre on par to hit around the same amount (9,000). This is due to my idea of reaching out directly to the teachers via email campaigns to promote our free lesson plans, as well as coming up with a full range of lesson plans tailored to each grade, whereas previously we had one lesson plan for elementary students and one for high school students, and both were difficult to execute. I have a passion for teaching kids and coming up with new programming, but not necessarily in a formal classroom setting, which is why I haven‚Äôt become a teacher.

Part of my job is also executing events. Previously, when I started, there were 3 major events ‚Äî an event for Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day, an art competition for high school students, and a science fair that we provided judges and prize money for. For the first couple years I worked at this job, I was heavily involved in TYDASTWD and the art competition. Last fiscal year (2017), I also championed a new event for middle school students ‚Äî a STEM based engineering event where the students design and build functional model water towers. The event went really well, we had more competitors than similar other, more established events across the state, and I even got a public thank-you speech from the father of the students who won, and it felt great. It felt fucking great to be able to provide resources and competitions to students who otherwise might not have been exposed to STEM in such a way. Even though my job was exhausting and really stressful sometimes, I felt a lot of passion for it. 

However, over the past couple years, our departmental structure and leadership has changed, to the detriment of my position. I‚Äôve had three separate managers, and there were times when I was the only one in our department and took over the position of ‚Äúmanager‚Äù accordingly. As such, I inherited some new projects which I wasn‚Äôt fond of, but thought it was temporary. These include an ‚Äúacademy‚Äù for adults to learn more about the water industry and our business, and an ‚ÄúInnovation Awards‚Äù to award employees for their innovative ideas throughout the year. The Water Academy is okay, but I absolutely despise the Innovation Awards. It has nothing to do with my degree/original position, it‚Äôs extremely stressful as our General Manager is directly involved and constantly makes last minute changes, there‚Äôs no guidance, it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a task our department should be charged with and feels like an HR thing, and mostly, it‚Äôs just not FUN like the other events. The first year I did it it sucked it up because I was the only one in the department at the time, and i figured it would be temporary.

However, after my new-ish supervisor came in in 2017, we hired an intern to take off some of the strain (yay!). The intern eventually got hired permanently as a member of our department. In the summer, though, we divvied up events, and didn‚Äôt get much say in what we were in charge of. I was put in charge of the Academy and Innovation Awards, and she was put in charge of the Science Fair, Kids@Work, and Model Water Tower events. At first I was okay but disappointed, but over time I‚Äôve become resentful, bitter, and disinterested in my job. My passion project, the Model Water Tower event, went to someone else while I was left with an irrelevant and extremely difficult event which I feel nothing but hatred for. While I have a passion for teaching and planning events for kids, I was stuck with a lackluster Water Academy.

The salt in the wound is that this year‚Äôs theme for Kids@Work is ‚ÄúMad Science,‚Äù something that I‚Äôve dreamed of doing for years. I‚Äôm kind of a mad scientist of a person, I love wow-ing kids with cool experiments, I love researching experiments, I love looking up scientists, I love combining science and art into activities. We just had a committee meeting about this event and it was all I could do to keep from sobbing, seeing my friend get all the applause for something that I‚Äôve dreamed about doing since I got here.

I‚Äôm basically in the midst of a breakdown right now because I‚Äôm thinking about how much I used to love and get excited about planning these events and I feel like they got ripped away from me and replaced with things that I have no passion or interest for. I dread waking up and going to work every day. I feel like I had no choice in what I was assigned and got the short end of the stick even though I‚Äôve been here for two years longer than my coworker, and have garnered respect as a competent and capable employee. I also feel guilty because our newer hiree has become one of my best friends and I should feel happy that she gets to plan these events that she gets excited about. However, the Model Water Tower Competition was supposed to be my legacy, and it was my baby, and I feel like it was just taken away from me. I feel ashamed because I know that this is ‚Äújust life‚Äù and I should be happy to have a job with benefits and decent pay, period.

As for applying to other jobs, I‚Äôve done it a fair amount but with no luck. I also share a close and unique relationship with many of my coworkers...I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt find anything like it elsewhere. 


Tl;dr I got the short end of the stick when it came to divvying up job responsibilities. I got my passion project taken away from me and got stuck with other things that I hate, and don‚Äôt know where to go from here.

There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

Maybe I am interviewing for the position and you're asing what attributes I have, I can't help but stare and get hard and you want to utilize my biggest attribute.

Or even I walk into your office and catch you masturbating. You chase after me and suck me for my silence.

Maybe you have your own idea.

Below are my kinks.....

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me.

Being tied up, Love the idea of being tied up and unable to move as you do stuff to me."

apwxpd,12,2019-02-12,"People are always talking about how lazy millennials are for not learning trades, but no one addresses how many barriers to entry have been raised or reinforced in blue collar industries since boomers entered the job market.",SignificantPerson,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/apwxpd/people_are_always_talking_about_how_lazy/," 

## 

When boomers entered the job market, you simply picked a career and tried to get a job or apprenticeship. Since then, they‚Äôve raised barriers to entry. The same disparities like unpaid internships and the ballooning price of schooling are mirrored in blue collar fields. This manifests itself in several different ways.

Racism- In my experience minorities always seem to be placed in the lowest paying jobs no one else wants to do like flagging. Some manage to move up, some don‚Äôt. Either way, they start a rung lower on the ladder.

Nepotism- This is especially prevalent in unions, but I‚Äôve seen it elsewhere. A layman might have to obtain a CDL license (2-3k) to enter a trade, whereas someone‚Äôs son might be allowed to get theirs on the job.

Regulation- More strict requirements for licensing demand people to invest a significant amount of time and money upfront for schooling and qualifications before they‚Äôll be allowed to work in some industries. Boomers use this to leverage apprentices and greenhorns into doing the harder aspects of the job, for less pay.

Sexism: One of the only women I‚Äôve seen in the trades had to get a college degree to do a job that would hire any man off the street to learn in the field, when in reality she was qualified to supervise the work we were doing.

Summation: It‚Äôs usually the guy making three figures sitting in a backhoe all day at a job his dad got him complaining about the black flaggers work ethic when he needs a bathroom break.

These are some of the things I‚Äôve seen first hand."

Owl said that it couldnt be truth, otherwise they all would be Subjects of Ymir.

Marley defeated them by subjecting &lt;how?&gt; 7 titans. I think it was Founding Titan that helped them all along. IT is said that only Founding can control other titans. Otherwise it would make no sense that those ""warriors"" didnt rebel!

Which titans were subjected?collosal, beast, armored, yaw, cart, female, warharmer.

So they were bound by Founding pact with King too. Before that each titan belonged to royal family. But because royals ""could summon"" ( tranform into a titan?)  founder that ""order was maintained"".  So it was common to rewrite memories.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When Grisha met Restorationists he accepted marleyan propaganda version of history and came to conclusion that it was right for them to commit ostracities because humankind is horrible. BUT when he got his hands on documents and book that Owl provided them then he decided that Eldians brought only prosperity to the world, this version he choosed to believe in and lead this movment to restore it.

&amp;#x200B;

When King Fritz made a vow with Founding he abandoned part of his ppl in Marley ( in many intern zones around marley) , but there was a dispute among royal family and one part hided among commoners. Their descendant was Dina. When Grisha married her, he didnt plan to have a baby, but that baby came naturally and then he envision him leading the movement to victory.

Suddenly Marleyans announced that they got PROCLAMAITON OF WAR from Fritz and started warrior program for children 5-7. So if Marleyans were ruling for around 80 years so far how they were mainting possesions of those titans? Were there more families like Tybur that were working with them and allowing their war conquests?  In fact Marleyans were struggling for resources because of their advances in miliary and they wanted fuels ressources that were under PAradis.  So the aim of MArleyans was to retake founding titan.  After receiving that info Grisha decided to sacrifice his son.

BUT YOU CANT BEAT THE MONSTER BY BECOMING ONE.

Owl also rated Grisha plan as realistic as it could be. And in fact it was, born from desperation and a cry for help. But he and the other revolutionists putted all of their lifes and hopes on the shoulders of one small boy. This was insanely wicked plan. The only reason Grisha was so sure that it will succeed was because Zeke was his son. But you dont inherit experiences of your predecesors, consequences and belief of their actions. Zeke was just one more caged bird that never knew what freedom and desire to be free was in the first place. He was just one representative of new generation created by propaganda. So when he was shamed by Marleyans he felt first and utmost fear. Grisha felt hatred ""for the state, for his fatherand for himself"". It was Grisha who went outside the wall of Ghetto not Zeke.

When Owl was giving his powers to Grisha he entrusted him with last  mision: ""you, and not anyone else"" to retake Founding Titan. So its impossible that Eren is bound by Owls believes and there was more to his plan. Owls parents were also part of revolutionary movement that was discovered and all memebers and their families were burnt.  Maybe that is why Marleyans created that Warrior program? Because there were no more royal families that transfered titan powers to their members and served them as weapons? ( What about Tybur then?) They didnt announce the 13 years curse to the public either at first. So Grisha didnt know that he would shorten his son life.

So Grisha took the vow to fight, went to Eldia and had another son. Eren didnt have fear inside of him, he was never exposed to titans before they attacked walls, he never saw them. So he embraced his father ideology and seeked freedom since he was small. Did Grisha was a bad father to him? I actually believe that he deeply loved both of his sons, part of what he was doing was also a desire to open their eyes and hearts.  But then  the attack happened. Grisha gave Eren mission to avenge his mother. And again he was so sure that he will accomplish it, because he was his son. Father of the year &lt;snort&gt; Mr Blouse would smack some sense into him for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Now about Zeke.

Grisha told Zeke that if he cant stand the world, he should change it and that he should save everyone. Sure, from his and his fellow revolutionists perspective it was truly desperate move to entrust their and their families lifes into hands of one kid, but they saw this as an opportunity one in a milion chance that wont come again in their lifetime. They entrusted Zeke with the vision of freeing the nation. But Grisha as most parents, didnt want to acknowledge weaknes of his own son. Zeke was acting like a good boy, but his heart didnt share his father beliefs, he wanted to be a good eldian marleyan. So he rejected this resposibility.   In the reality Zeke lived in, children his age were facing those dilemas and propaganda was part of their lifes ( so they knew what they need to think and say, that there are rules they needed to operate within, also that the world is not a safe place and they could be killed anyday). We had in rl so many examples that children were announcing their parents. So did Zeke, but he had a knowledge, a choice ( he knew that what he was told by marleyans was a bullshit, but it was easier to live without that knowledge, not to stick nose behind bars of cage, because he didnt kow what freedom is his heart didnt have a desire to seek it).

He choosed to be a traitor, he knew that his parents will die and so many others too. He choosed to kill so many ppl at such a young age just because (sarcasm here)  he was butthurted that he didnt get enough attention from his parents ( and that was not true, he received a lot of love from them but also a lot of expectations and the second was probably one of  the reasons that he did what he did among other things , but I choose to focus on that) and he lived under pressure. That could be some  argument, but seriously they all lived under pressure, not knowing if they will survive another day. Even if his family was more ""normal"", he would still live within rules of that twisted world.  There is this saying: Follow your heart and be proud of your life.  This all makes me think that Zeke was in fact very weak child emotionally and also very twisted. No matter what in times like this he chosed not to tell his own parents about awaiting them prosecution, instead he entrusted the biggest secret of them all to stranger like Xavier, that he met only few times. Maybe it was because of the fact, that their parents made him feel so special, so above everyone else. They spoiled his ego. And so he started to rot from inside. This was not a bravery, this was a terrible, terrible thing to do.  And what stroke me the most, he was conscious of consequences of his own action.

Zeke grand plan is just the echo of [marley propaganda](http://prntscr.com/mk7blv). I dont even know if he realises that he is not the author of this idea that he dedicated his whole life to.  IT also means that he is so more twisted. What that plan would mean to Paradisans? Survivors joining Eldians in ghetto and being slowly torture to death.

Zeke was also the first person to use titan beast in combat. Noone told him to do so. But he chosed to use fellow Eldians as weapons to conquer other lands.  And again: he repeated marleyan propaganda. He used them the same way as he was told in history books. ( Yelena and Co will have a hudge surprise  soon)

We know now that Marleyans were interested in resources that Paradis had and thus they declared  propaganda idea of them trying to rebel. Although Paradis was secluded from the world Zeke as warlord decided to attack them. I also think this was not only because of above, but every Eldian left in Marley was abandoned.  And they were not only jealous of that peace but also truly hated PAradisans for all the suffering they had to endure. I also think that this was the main reason why warriors didnt chose to side with SC.

Then when Zeke was throwing rocks at scouts in Paradis he was mumbling that they will repeat the same mistakes. Maybe it bothered him that in fact they werent and even after they got to know about outside they only wanted to establish political connections.  And when he discovered his brother? He promised him salvation. What he meant by that? In short Death. Then he went to rescure his brother by destroying Paradis from inside ( by what? recreating Restoration Movement BASED ON IDEAS FROM MARLEY PROPAGANDA!!!), now all that island is his hostage ( as his parents were). Just because it was not Grisha but Xaveir that  throw that fracking ball with him. (&lt;- another sarcasm).

IDEAS AND EREN

Now Grisha and Zeke are tottal oppositions and they all represents old ideas and systems.  I truly think that this chapter of trylogy will end on Eren, but not in the way we think.  Eren chosed retailation and war ( so in a way he chosed to be part of the past). I think he will try to establish Eldia as a country and truly punish Marley for their sins. I think Eren took this role on his shoulders but he wont be the one to lead Eldia in time of peace, because rebuilding this country will be entrusted to the next generation.

Zeke plan

I think Zeke will always be a marleyan, no matter what and thus he not only is working with them, but he wants to inflict much more cruelty on Eldians. Thats why I call him a coward. The only one who so far harmed him physically was Levi. Till that moment his leash was fear for his own life and twisted conviction of him being a special case. Eren has this conviction too. And its so false. Yep, ones life is a miracle, but the worth of it and if its making you special or not depends on ones choices, actions, beliefs and ones work. I think that Zeke wants to meet Eren on one of the walls, then eat him, recontruct dna, awake titans and let them eat the rest of PAradis population. He also secured the audience as Willy did by Hizuru plane.

I will add my thoughts about ackermans later this week.

apxery,35,2019-02-12,She's home. [Wholesome story of Monika wearing the pants in our relationship.],Daenk_Miems,DDLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/apxery/shes_home_wholesome_story_of_monika_wearing_the/,"It is a friday night, I finished cleaning and I'm preparing dinner now. It's
about 4 o' clock, she must arrive any minute now. I try to guess what
she'll do when she's here. Will she be so tired that she just heads to
bed? Or will she hug me from behind and snuggle me while I cook?
Maybe she'll offer to help me cook, only to be informed that it's almost
done anyway?

The dinner's done and like on cue, the door opens and shoes hit the
floor. I step out the kitchen to great my sweetheart.

""Welcome home, my love! Say, would you like dinner, a bath or...
me?""

It took a lot out of me not to stutter or back out. She's usually the flirty
one. And I was probably red all over.

""Ahaha, that's so cheesy, dear.""

I pout at the lack of effect my flirt had.

""I thought I'd make you blush by catching you off guard. I even put on
this appron I didn't need.""

She approaches.

""Aww, sorry my sweet. You did almost give me diabettes, though.""

She puts a hand on my cheek and kisses me. I'll never get tired of her
kisses. I wrap my arms around and sink into the kiss. She does the
same. Again, time ceases to exist, we are in our own world.

Reality catches up with me, as I realize that I oughta put out the
stove, lest my wife start her afternoon with burned veggies. I slowly
move of her face and give the same loving look she has on.

""Dinner's gonna burn if I don't turn off the heat. If only I turned it off
before. We could've stayed like this. I love you, Monika.""

I nuzzle her.

""I love you too, Daenk. I look forward to dinner with you.""

I break off the embrace and head to the stove. I turn it off and prepare
two plates of cooked veggies, beans and potatos. I set the table and
we get seated.

""I'll never tire of this. Cooking for you and greeting you with love and a
meal. It makes me happy to be able to reward your hard work so soon
every day. Speaking of which. How was your day?""

""First, I'm glad this makes you happy. Most guys wouldn't be
comfortable with letting the woman be the career-person.""

""I said before: I have no interest in any field, at least not in working in
any field. While you studied so well in school, striving to make it high.
It's only logical. Although, I do feel guilty. All I do is take care of the
apartment and cook. You are even the one who does most of the
papers, since I'm so awful at managing those.""

""Don't be so hard on yourself. After all that time you waited for me, it's
the least I can do. Besides, you just need to keep learning and
practising on that last one. And then you can do the buerocratics on
your own, to calm your concience.""

I sigh, lovestruck, holding my head with my hand resting on the table.

""All these books we read, and yet I know no other word for you than
'perfect'.""

""I'm not perfect.""

""I know, I just keep forgetting. What was your day like?""

""Not much, just the usual. Though, our new intern did ironically spill
and slip on her coffee because she was tired. Poor girl, society
expects so much time of young people that they can't even sleep.
Nothing else to mention. Sorry I can't bring much new things to
discuss.""

""It's alright. Are you bored at work?""

The casual conversation goes on. Eventually the topic shifts from her
job to my favorite topic. Politics, once I get into it, I can rant for ages.
She's not into it, but it's important I keep her informed, lest the MSM
do it for me. We finish the meal and I bring the dishes to the kitchen.
I'd wash them now, but I don't want to make my girlfriend wait before
she can spend some time with me. We were just talking about
chinese dept traps when I changed the subject.

""Speaking of horrific totalitarian regimes. Wanna continue reading
1984 together? Or maybe you'd like a bath first?""

""Or... you?""

Smooth reference to before. I still can't hide my flusterdness well.

""Oh, hehe. That too, if you'd like.""

""Ahaha~ you're still so easy. Come here, sweety~""

We kiss again, I foolishly try to resist her tongue's power, but it's
futile. I love her dominance so much. We spent time kissing, cuddling,
talking, reading, playing. Another wonderful day in our own little
paradise. I have her to thank for so much.

""Thank you for everything you do for and bring me, I love you over all
in the world, Monika."""

For reference, I'm a 20-year-old college student. Over the summer, I worked at a company who matched 401k contributions for interns (vested immediately). So, I put in $200 and they put in $200, giving me a total of $400 in my 401k. The 401k is through Fidelity.

Today I checked my account and I noticed that I'm being charged a $6/quarter fee for ""recordkeeping."" Considering my principal is $400, this means I'm paying an annual 6% fee (!). I called Fidelity and they told me that the fee comes from their agreement with the company, and there's nothing they can do.

What are my options in avoiding this fee? Do I just need to eat it until there's more in my 401K so the earnings can outweigh the fee..?

For what it's worth, I'm probably going to add another ~$300 (so $600 with the company's contribution) into the 401k over the course of this upcoming summer. 

**Q:** Is it worth continuing to contribute to the 401K this upcoming summer? I kinda want to spend the money instead of saving it. Especially since I already have a 401k setup. 

Thanks!"

They didnt announce the 13 years curse to the public either at first. So Grisha didnt know that he would shorten his son life.

So Grisha took the vow to fight, went to Eldia and had another son. Eren didnt have fear inside of him, he was never exposed to titans before they attacked walls, he never saw them. So he embraced his father ideology and seeked freedom since he was small. Did Grisha was a bad father to him? I actually believe that he deeply loved both of his sons, part of what he was doing was also a desire to open their eyes and hearts. But then the attack happened. Grisha gave Eren mission to avenge his mother. And again he was so sure that he will accomplish it, because he was his son. Father of the year &lt;snort&gt; Mr Blouse would smack some sense into him for sure.

Now about Zeke.

Grisha told Zeke that if he cant stand the world, he should change it and that he should save everyone. Sure, from his and his fellow revolutionists perspective it was truly desperate move to entrust their and their families lifes into hands of one kid, but they saw this as an opportunity one in a milion chance that wont come again in their lifetime. They entrusted Zeke with the vision of freeing the nation. But Grisha as most parents, didnt want to acknowledge weaknes of his own son. Zeke was acting like a good boy, but his heart didnt share his father beliefs, he wanted to be a good eldian marleyan. So he rejected this resposibility. In the reality Zeke lived in, children his age were facing those dilemas and propaganda was part of their lifes ( so they knew what they need to think and say, that there are rules they needed to operate within, also that the world is not a safe place and they could be killed anyday). We had in rl so many examples that children were announcing their parents. So did Zeke, but he had a knowledge, a choice ( he knew that what he was told by marleyans was a bullshit, but it was easier to live without that knowledge, not to stick nose behind bars of cage, because he didnt kow what freedom is his heart didnt have a desire to seek it).

He choosed to be a traitor, he knew that his parents will die and so many others too. He choosed to kill so many ppl at such a young age just because (sarcasm here) he was butthurted that he didnt get enough attention from his parents ( and that was not true, he received a lot of love from them but also a lot of expectations and the second was probably one of the reasons that he did what he did among other things , but I choose to focus on that) and he lived under pressure. That could be some argument, but seriously they all lived under pressure, not knowing if they will survive another day. Even if his family was more ""normal"", he would still live within rules of that twisted world. There is this saying: Follow your heart and be proud of your life. This all makes me think that Zeke was in fact very weak child emotionally and also very twisted. No matter what in times like this he chosed not to tell his own parents about awaiting them prosecution, instead he entrusted the biggest secret of them all to stranger like Xavier, that he met only few times. Maybe it was because of the fact, that their parents made him feel so special, so above everyone else. They spoiled his ego. And so he started to rot from inside. This was not a bravery, this was a terrible, terrible thing to do. And what stroke me the most, he was conscious of consequences of his own action.

Zeke grand plan is just the echo of [marley propaganda](http://prntscr.com/mk7blv). I dont even know if he realise that he is not the author of this idea that he dedicated his whole life to. IT also means that he is so more twisted. What that plan would mean to Paradisans? Survivors joining Eldians in ghetto and being slowly torture to death.

Zeke was also the first person to use titan beast in combat. Noone told him to do so. But he chosed to use fellow Eldians as weapons to conquer other lands. And again: he repeated marleyan propaganda. He used them the same way as he was told in history books. ( Yelena and Co will have a hudge surprise soon)

We know now that Marleyans were interested in resources that Paradis had and thus they declared propaganda idea of them trying to rebel. Although Paradis was secluded from the world Zeke as warlord decided to attack them. I also think this was not only because of above, but every Eldian left in Marley was abandoned. And they were not only jealous of that peace but also truly hated PAradisans for all the suffering they had to endure. I also think that this was the main reason why warriors didnt chose to side with SC.

Then when Zeke was throwing rocks at scouts in Paradis he was mumbling that they will repeat the same mistakes. Maybe it bothered him that in fact they werent and even after they got to know about outside they only wanted to establish political connections. And when he discovered his brother? He promised him salvation. What he meant by that? In short Death. Then he went to rescure his brother by destroying Paradis from inside ( by what? recreating Restoration Movement BASED ON IDEAS FROM MARLEY PROPAGANDA!!!), now all that island is his hostage ( as his parents were). Just because it was not Grisha but Xaveir that throw that fracking ball with him. (&lt;- another sarcasm).

IDEAS AND EREN

Now Grisha and Zeke are tottal oppositions and they all represents old ideas and systems. I truly think that this chapter of trylogy will end on Eren, but not in the way we think. Eren chosed retailation and war ( so in a way he chosed to be past of past). I think he will try to establish Eldia as a country and truly punish Marley for their sins. I think Eren took this role on his shoulders but he wont be the one to lead Eldia in time of peace, because rebuilding this country will be entrusted to the next generation.

Zeke plan

I think Zeke will always be a marleyan, no matter what and thus he not only is working with them, but he wants to inflict much more cruelty on Eldians. Thats why I call him a coward. The only one who so far harmed him physically was Levi. Till that moment his leash was fear for his life and twisted conviction of him being a special case. Eren has this conviction too. And its so false. Yep, ones life is a miracle, but the worth of it and if its making you special or not depends on ones choices, actions, belief and ones work. I think that Zeke wants to meet Eren on one of the wall, then eat him, recontruct dna, awake titans and let them eat the rest of PAradis population. He also secured the audience as Willy did by Hizuru plane.

I will add my thoughts about ackermans later this week."

I recently graduated college and currently live in an apartment complex. Now part of the graduating is to complete a 2 month internship and usually the company the you interned at will hire you once you are done. Unfortunately during your internship you can't live on campus. At the time I thought that was fine. A buddy of mine and I moved into an apartment close to the city and split the rent. It really was a good idea at the time since I thought my savings would last past a 2 and a half internship. and being close to the city means close commute 

But a month after I graduated and 3 months in living in an apartment, my company never called me back. So I called my supervisor and he said thought I was too young and needed more experience. Which I didn't understand. This was the only internship I worked. I showed up early every day. I asked to work and did work on so many projects. So I then called my career adviser at the college and they said if the company believes you aren't a fit  there is nothing they can do. I took it in stride. I applied for jobs on indeed and I hopefully will have a decent programming job by the end of this month or the next. But my savings dried faster than I thought and my  roommate cant make up the rent. So I need money to get me by this month until I get hired.   

If you decide you loan me the money I will give you any information you want like Social media or anything else everything is fair game. We will communicate over anything you feel comfortable with and there will be at least one conversation about payment weekly even if there are no updates. 

Thank you  for reading my post. 

TLDR: My sob story on why I need money."

I'll be moving to Stuttgart in a couple of weeks and trying to figure out where to live, as I would like to bike to work. According to Google Maps, my commute would probably go over some big hills: my company is located in Sch√∂naich and I will be following my internship by another one in Esslingen. I was looking at places in Stuttgart S√ºd and Vaihingen.

While looking for a place, I think it could be smart to be near public transportation hubs if I can't cycle for come reason or if I'm going out in Stuttgart. 

Do any of you have experience cycling around? How is cycling in these areas? I am an experienced cyclist, I used to compete, and have no trouble with traffic, bad weather and hills. However my commutes so far have always been 7-15km with around 100m D+ and I'm not sure I want to climb a mountain every day if I can avoid it. 

Cheers."

Engineering students live and die by their internships, trying to get a full time position without one can be terribly difficult. I have prepared and have been fortunate enough to accept an internship for summer 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

During my time as a student I came into contact with a smaller company's CEO. After I explained my desire to land an internship he tried to help me by giving me notices of various openings at his company. For a variety of reasons, things never aligned and I never worked for his company.

&amp;#x200B;

Our university career fair was this past week and my CEO friend was there. I said hello and told him of my success of landing an internship with another company for the summer. He was happy for me and said, ""too bad, because we have a problem that a mechanical engineer could help us with."" He asked for a recommendation and I gave him the resumee of one of my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

After speaking with said friend, it is a part time position that they are looking to fill right now. Maybe I misunderstood and thought it was a position for the coming summer. Maybe I'm just an idiot for not grabbing the opportunity while it was in front of me. It has occurred to me that maybe they wanted someone to work from now until the end of summer or any other time.

&amp;#x200B;

WIBTA if I emailed/called and said I was interested in the position, even after I recommended my friend for it?

AITA for even considering doing it?

I looked for and saw similar posts in this sub, so I'm thinking it's ok to post this here? I'm starting an internship at JPL in March (just offered and accepted). I'm coming from the east coast, and female, and am looking for housing. I don't have a car, so some place with public transportation or bike access to JPL would be ideal. I'm not sure where to best look for roommates, especially since I'm not starting with other interns that I know of. Non-roommate housing seems way too expensive, and I'm not sure where to look for roommates. I did see some Air BnB options that might work, but they're also by the room, and I'm not sure what everyone's experience with that sort of rental has been. 

I did look through some of the housing resources on the JPL internship guidance page but didn't really come up with a whole lot of options that way. 

Any advice, pointers and directions would be helpful. 

Thanks in advance for your help!

* Named Rusty McKinney defensive assistant coach. McKinney joins the team after spending the past 3 seasons as Miami`s defensive quality control coach. Before that he spent 2 seasons as an intern for Cleveland and 5 years coaching at Bentley University.

**Buffalo Bills**

* Signed OL Spencer Long to a three year contract. After being released the Jets last week, Long signed with Buffalo in what hopefully will be an upgrade for Buffalo`s offensive Line. He has played 53 games, starting 44 in his 5 year career, mostly at center. Last year he had a PFF grade of 45.4, 37th in the NFL. 

* Re-signed CB Lafayette Pitts to a one year contract. Pitts signed the contract as he was set to become a restricted free-agent this off season. He has been a pivotal part of the special teams unit for Buffalo the past two seasons and served as a reserve cornerback. This is the third free agent Buffalo has re-signed this year. 

**Carolina Panthers**

* Hired Ben Jacobs as an Assistant Special Teams Coach. Jacobs will be replacing Heath Farwell, who left to become the special teams coach with the Buffalo Bills. This comes a day after the team released him as a linebacker, a position he held with the team since the 2013 season. This will be his first coaching gig but he should serve well as he has plenty of experience with the team from playing with them, especially on special teams. 

**Chicago Bears**

* Named Chris Jackson defensive assistant coach. Former AFL Rookie of the Year award recepiant Chris Jackson will join the team`s coaching staff after working with the team last summer during training camp. He played 3 games in the NFL but became an AFL star, helping the Philadelphia Soul with the 2008 title with 140 catches for 1,692 yards, and 49 TDs. Most recently, he served as the receivers coach at Liberty High School in Peoria, Arizona. 

**Houston Texans**


* Released WR Demaryius Thomas. After being acquired in a trade from Denver last season, Thomas caught 23 passes for 275 yards and 2 TDs in 7 games. A key thing to focus on for Thomas is to see how he recovers from a torn Achilles he suffered in December. As of now, Thomas has no plans on retiring and wants to recover to play next season. Look for a team that needs a 3rd/4th receiver to pick him up.

**Kansas City Chiefs**

* Announced the retirement of Defensive Backs Coach Emmitt Thomas. Thomas retires after coaching for 38 years, playing for 13, and 22 total years with the Chiefs. He spent his whole playing career with Kansas City and is the team`s all time leader in interceptions with 58, which also puts him 9th all time in the NFL. This coming after he was an undrafted free agent from the now defunct Bishop College. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2008. 

**New Orleans Saints**

* Signed OLB Vince Biegel. Biegel was signed to the practice squad last September and promoted to the active roster a few weeks later, recording 4 total tackles. Biegel was a fourth round draft pick out of Wisconsin by the Packers in the 2017 NFL draft. 

* Signed G Cameron Tom. Tom has been with the Saints since being an Undrafted Free Agent out of Southern Mississippi in the 2017 NFL Draft. He made his NFL debut in 2018, appearing in 11 games and starting 1.

* Signed LS Zach Wood. Wood has been with the team since being signed in the 2017 NFL season. Previously he spent 2 years with Dallas after being undrafted out of SMU.

* Signed CB Justin Hardee. Hardee has been with the team since the 2017 season, after being cut by Houston who took him as an Undrafted Free Agent out of Illinois. Since then, Hardee has recorded 17 total tackles, 2 pass defenses, 1 Interception, 1 TD, and a blocked punt. 

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**

* Released DE Vinny Curry, clearing $8 Million in cap space. Curry played just one season with Tampa Bay, playing in 12 games, starting 7. He earned 12 total tackles and 2.5 sacks. Curry once showed great potential as a pash rusher, earning 9 sacks in 2014 with the Eagles without starting a single game. He has a PFF grade of 58.4, #85th for edge rushers. Someone will be bound to give him a chance, but dont expect much.

This is mainly because they want a concept that fits the sassier voices of members Jeongyeon, Tzuyu and Chaeyoung. Most of the members actually have naturally deeper voices like Momo. Onces also say that since everyone in the group is now older, that it would be refreshing to see something other than the cute concept. Now Twice themselves have addressed the growing interest in a concept change. Recently on JYPs Super Intern, Jihyo said they were worried about people getting tired of their bright and cute concept.

I landed my first interview for an internship today. A college recruiter from a company I applied for called me for a phone screening. (The position is just an IT internship.) That part went very well, it ended off with the lady telling me she will ""certainly be recommending"" me to HR. A few hours later, I got another phone call from the company where I scheduled a phone interview with them for tomorrow. They told me a bit more about the position. I asked what kind of phone interview it will be and what I should expect. They told me I will probably be asked some technical questions, previous projects I have worked on, as well as a few behavioral questions as well. 


I have never done any personal projects. The only coding I have done is in class assignments, homework problems that required it, and a couple projects I've had in some classes. How can I approach this question since I don't have any personal projects under my belt?


I'm also very worried about any other technical questions that could be asked. I'm not the brightest person in CS. I'm nervous I'm going to choke on this part. How can I prepare myself for any technical questions? Or how can I just approach the technical side of the interview in general if this is a weakness of mine? I can't answer complicated questions off the top of my head, I'm a person who needs to take some time to solve a problem and do research either online or in a textbook when I approach problems.

# Fitpics ([https://imgur.com/a/FvSeCAy](https://imgur.com/a/FvSeCAy))

I didn't take pics of everything I got but pretty much all the hoodies fit exactly like that and the Tech fleece fit the same just the color is different.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion/Takeaways:

1. Shipping Method? EMS GANGGGGGGGGGGGG
2. Rehearsal shipping used? Yes | Total savings? \~$40
3. Total time took to receive haul? About a month (From ordering to opening)
4. Should I wash my stuff when i get it? Hell yeah you should. Cold wash/Air dry (They have a weird smell on them)
5. Should I wear my reps in public? Most is uncalloutable unless you know about each piece. WEAR WITH CONFIDENCE!
6. Do white girls really attract to Patagonia? All the compliments I have had about the Patagonia hoodie have been from white girls so far the answer is YES.
7. How much did I declare for shipping? $51 Superbuy recommended

Overall, this is probably the last clothes I'll ever buy since this was actually a lot of stuff I can fit into my daily rotation. We'll be set until like 2020 basically. During the summer I'll definitely get some more shit since I'll have that 1:1 FAT INTERNSHIP PAYCHECK. Any questions just put them in the comments I'll try to answer as soon as possible. ENJOY!!!!

I know trail conditions are variable as is weather.. I'm preparing to hike Moosilauke at the end of the month. I have microspikes and am borrowing better snowshoes from a friend for this hike. I am newer to winter hiking, but a pretty confident hiker in general. I have my WAFA and worked as an intern at MWO, so I try my best to be informed before my hikes while still challenging myself. 

I'm getting a ton of mixed opinions on what traction I need for the Moose. I though snowshoes with televators/traction and microspikes would suffice, but I'm hearing a few voices say I'll need crampons. Do any of you agree? Should I get Hillsound Trail Crampon Pros? I currently have Katoohla microspikes and have been happy with them on thick, yet not too highly graded, ice in the Catskills, on ice in the Adirondacks, and packed snow in the Whites.

Also any route opinions would be nice.. Planning on Glencliff for the time being but open to opinions. "

aq1zyy,3,2019-02-12,"Never thought I would quit, but here we are!",madzbelafonte,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/aq1zyy/never_thought_i_would_quit_but_here_we_are/,"Hello! I quit 12 days ago (longest streak so far with six years of heavy, religious daily use) and referenced this sub a lot in that time, so thought I‚Äôd jump in because dammit if has been fucking hard and I‚Äôm proud of myself. 

Things that worked for me....

1. Knowing the first week will be hell. I took off work just so I didn‚Äôt have to be around people. Lots of bickering with SO, just be prepared. 

2. Telling your family/friends 

3. Keeping track on some sort of app, I know there are abstinence trackers, but I use Today bc I track other goals on there.

4. Get books, start a hobby, meditate (I invested in a Headspace subscription), journal, do yoga, walk, listen to podcast, organize your house, deep clean everything... literally anything and everything that will occupy your mind that isn‚Äôt substance related. 

5. WATERRRRRRRR

6. Sleep will not feel easy or restful and you will start to remember your dreams and it‚Äôs jarring. I used Headspace sleep cast to help fall asleep, but it will just suck for a little while. 

7. It‚Äôs worth it and things are so much clearer! And just remember your mind is a powerful tool and you have to train it every day with intention! It will want what it has always known, but you can turn it around, you have control! 

Some background...my dad smoked daily (and what he thought was ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù) so I‚Äôve been around it my whole life and that definitely normalized it so I never thought smoking everyday was unhealthy, I just didn‚Äôt think about it. I loved smoking and I still love it/miss it (literally getting emotional rn) idk how to explain it because it sounds silly to type it out. Like it is just a plant. But the feeling is so powerful and I love it. I just always felt welcome around my ‚Äústoner‚Äù friends and it was always more enjoyable than social outings involving alcohol.

But over the years going from flower, to dabs, to obsessively hitting the vape pen, it just became too much. It got to the point where I was crazy paranoid, avoided going out in public bc I was worried about people judging me for being high and just an overall lack of confidence in my ability. 

I do regret the college years (I started smoking daily my sophomore year), sometimes I think ‚ÄúI could have gotten an internship and be working for X right now‚Äù but I know that this experience made me who I am and I can still do whatever I want with my life, well in terms of reason. But sometimes I feel guilty for holding myself back from things bc I wanted to get high instead. Trying to let that go and look forward. 

I didn‚Äôt want to quit for a lot of reasons at first (I love the way it makes me feel, my friends do it, fuck the man, it‚Äôs part of my identity, other bs I was telling myself.) But the more I played around with the idea the more I realized that deep down I didn‚Äôt want to be dependent on this thing. I wanted control back and to be confident in myself as I am naturally. I really thought I needed it to make me feel better or to help with my depression and it‚Äôs just not true, I was lying to myself and doing a disservice. 

I can‚Äôt act like this was 100% willpower though, I was in-between jobs a few months ago and my options were so limited bc of drug test but I was adamant on not letting corporate America decide my life. But then I started a job, where I am currently underpaid all bc of my ego I now realize. So it initially started as a way to get a better paying job than my current, but I‚Äôve come to so many realizations since going through the process of quitting and just wanted to share. 

Cravings still come, but this feeling of clarity and being myself again and in my body and present in life far surpasses the short-lived enjoyment of getting high. I could NEVER imagine me saying this, but here we are and I‚Äôm fucking happy and I fucking deserve it, everyone does.

aq2irh,196,2019-02-12,Is anyone else reading cop forums to see how they do their sting operations?,cat-gun,SexWorkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexWorkers/comments/aq2irh/is_anyone_else_reading_cop_forums_to_see_how_they/,"I've recently started reading cop forums to see how they plan and carry out their sting operations.  Nothing too surprising so far, but it's interesting to see how they think about sex work and plan their busts.  

For example, here's a [description of a bust against an escort advertising on Backpage](https://forum.officer.com/forum/officers-and-law-enforcement-professionals-only/the-squad-room/211494-backpage-stings).  

&gt; ""We actually did an op against a woman who was doing ads on BP a few years ago. She was living and operating, of all places, in the Chief of Police's neighborhood. 
&gt; 
&gt; I did some research online into some review sites and other things to see how she might try to smoke us out. Her only countermeasure was that she required a reference from another escort before making an appointment. 
&gt; 
&gt; I live in a military town, so my solution was to make up a fake escort from a different state on a site that was, at the time, known for hosting free pages that a lot of other escorts were using. Then I had to make some fake reviews of the fake escort just in case our suspect decided to check out our UC guy's background story. I set up a Google Voice number for our female officer to play the role of our fake escort so she could ""verify"" our UC was ""the perfect gentleman"". 
&gt; 
&gt; It was a pretty involved process and it took some time to put together. Our UC was a guy who just retired from the Marine Corps and came aboard about a week prior to the operation. His story was that he visited this ""escort"" in this other state, which was his home of record, before he got stationed in our town. 
&gt; 
&gt; It went off without a hitch, suspect called our female officer on the GV number, who vouched for our UC. The suspect then set up an appointment an gave the UC her address, which of course we already knew. 
&gt; 
&gt; The whole case came about because her neighbors were tired of the constant traffic and they had somehow sniffed out her ads, put it all together and dimed her out to us. Our command at the time was very risk averse and did not want to do a full-blown op in which the UC went in to a location we did not control, so we used an obscure city ordinance to gig her with operating a sexually oriented business and operating without a business license. 
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as she came to the door she was arrested. Turns out she was an intern for a local defense attorney. The story hit the paper and everybody knew what the deal was, she was publicly shamed and moved out of state... where she promptly resumed the same activity. But the important thing was we got her out of the Chief's neighborhood and all involved got an attaboy from him. I guess the difference here in what I'm trying to accomplish is bringing the suspect to us instead of doing it the other way around. 
&gt; 
&gt; As an aside, for as long as my fake escort page was up, I was getting text messages to the GV number from guys in this other state trying to set up dates. I would run their phone numbers and find out who they were, it was amazing how much some of them stood to lose if they were caught. ""


##Lessons

* Try to keep good relations with your neighbors.  Direct clients to park well away from your incall, so that they don't block or take up your neighbor's parking spaces.  Ask clients to be quiet when visiting you, and not talk on the cell phone outside your door.  Reduce sound transfer by hanging rugs and tapestries on the wall.  

* Maybe invite your neighbors over for dinner sometimes, bring them milk and cookies, offer to watch their dogs.  If someone sees you as a person and a friend, they may be less likely to rat you out because they're annoyed by the noise of frequent callers. 

* Setting up a fake persona is a lot of work for police.  In this case, they were able to get through her screening because they had a new guy on the force who wasn't previously involved in law enforcement.   If she had required two referrals, they might have decided it was too much work.  

* No matter how many precautions you take, you might still be busted.  "

I recently got a job at a consulting firm that is a bit better, but it is still a customer service/sales role that I really do not care for. It is a very relaxed environment and the pay is decent considering I don't have to do much, but I simply cannot see myself working my way up the ladder to something greater here. I can't bare the thought of working more shitty customer service jobs making pennies for the rest of my life, but I have literally nothing else to show for besides my undergrad thesis and a short internship from 4 years ago. I feel like at this age I have to have some sort of career path planned out, but I do not know what I want to do. I am afraid of being stuck in a perpetual slog of entry level work. Most of my friends and family are working more professional jobs, going back to school, and graduating from masters programs while I feel like I am doing nothing. My days are becoming unbearable (I almost cried at work today for no reason), and I wake up during the night with fits of anxiety I haven't felt since school. Everything feels increasingly hopeless, like I am destined to be lonely and poor. I am ashamed to admit it, but I contemplate suicide pretty often. I am scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist to address how this is affecting my mental health, but I have no idea how to attack the root cause. Is this a common feeling at this age? Has anyone else been in this situation and found a way out? I could really use some advice."

I‚Äôm really not a big fan of Link either, his joking carefree attitude seems polar opposite of Meredith and everything she looks for/went for. (But maybe opposites attract?) 

I really wish  they would bring in someone new that is more similar to Meredith. Someone on her level that has experienced  love and loss. Someone she can connect with not just physically but mentally too. 
(Or maybe someone from her past. Medical school?)

I'm naturally shy so working in an office where I had to meet new people every day, I tried to step out of my comfort zone as much as I could, so I'd always be the overachiever, doing more than what I was asked and trying to look good and more than what I felt I was. I was ""social"" for the first time in my life. 
She was -in a sense- more popular. Probably people liked her more. She had friends and acted cool and always looked so interesting. Since we worked in different departments, I only got to meet her in one big event everyone went to, which happened in a bar. I saw her. She probably didn't see me. She was beyond gorgeous. It was like those corny Hollywood movies where the main character finally sees the romantic interest and all the place is dark and there's this halo around her because of that spotlight no one fucking else seems to notice... I simply couldn't talk to her. I could barely spit a word or two to a few coworkers while she was there. All those new social skills I had learned over months suddenly disappeared. 
I tried so many times afterwards on social media... A few weeks later, gladly, it was her that started the conversation, congratulating me for some stuff I had done at work that got me some recognition. And we kept talking, and talking a lot. Turns out she was introverted, and felt totally happy when I told her I thought she was so interesting and fun and such a shining star. And we only talked over messages until after it was over and we all went back to college.
I love that she's brilliant. We study the same thing and I could hear her talk all day. I wish I could. She's got issues and I got some, too. We opened up to each other, got really deep conversations, and I probably ended up falling for her even more every single time. I have never felt as comfortable talking to someone. 
But then, she just gradually started answering less frequently. Once she stopped answering for months and then talked to me again as if nothing had happened even when I was totally freaking out. But she had issues. And I can't blame her. I don't control her and can't order her to do something she doesn't want. 
Now, after Christmas, after another 2 months of her not answering at all, I decided to send her a message finally telling her how I felt, and apologizing over something I cannot control, just to get it out. I couldn't take it any longer. I just tried to write as clearly as possible I didn't think she owed me something nor was I demanding or complaining about anything. I just wanted her to know. I just wanted to get that off my chest. 
I saw the movie 500 days of Summer and I understand that just because she likes the same bizzaro crap I do doesn't make her my soulmate, but after so long... I think I love her. And now it seems like she won't talk to me again. I feel empty. I saw a therapist but everytime I tried to approach this issue, it seemed so ridiculous to even talk about it. I felt embarrassed. I ended up dropping after a few sessions. This all seems like a high school drama. But I'm stuck. And after two months of her not seeing that message either, even after seeing her using her social media every once in a while, I don't know what to do. "

&amp;#x200B;

I was 6 years old when my older brother got home one day with a brand new video game called 'World of Warcraft'. I will never forget it. He installed it. Booted it up. And my mind was blown from the get-go. We shared a computer and, being the younger brother, my brother hogged the computer away for himself. So, I'd only play for maybe an hour - two, if I'm lucky, but one things for sure: I cherished that time like it was the last meal on earth.

 It was during this time that my uncontrollable passion for game design was ignited.

&amp;#x200B;

All through my life this passion never changed. I have gone through middle school and high school loving Blizzard and loving their video games. I'd love every time we get a creative writing class because I'd use World of Warcraft as inspiration and write a story that would have my teacher highly impressed. At this point I was learning to write better stories and think about coding, because I wanted to be a writer or a developer. Things were looking so great for me, because I knew that with the morals Blizzard boasted back then, they would see my tenacity and passion and admire that I would do anything to be on the team. Call me naive, but I felt my dream was so so close and I was in gear.

&amp;#x200B;

And now here we are, closer to my dream than I have ever been: I am currently a third year Game Developer, Screenwriter and Visual Effects Artist... And my dream that I have pursued for 15 years is being ripped to shreds in front of my eyes more and more each day and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. I was going to apply for an internship at Blizzard next year whilst doing my fourth year, but in light of everything that is happening, I must admit I don't know what to do anymore. 

Passionate employees abused or being liquidated entirely with no remorse or warning. People who have the same level of passion as me, if not more, being told that if they don't like being underpaid and mistreated, they can leave. They have hundreds more lining up behind them. My favourite video games being turned into money making machines to be squeezed out until they shrivel up and get left to die.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to ask: What do you do when the one and only thing you are passionate about in life is spat on and defiled?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you do when your dream that you've worked towards for so long gets ruthlessly crushed all because of corporate greed?

&amp;#x200B;

To Activision-Blizzard and all those who are responsible for turning it into what it is now: I hope that one day you'll look past the money and actually see what you've done to what was once a massive, healthy family with a mutual passion for making great video games. I hope you sit down one day on your golden throne and feel the despair you've caused across the thousands of tired passionate workers you abused, as well as the fans who wanted to take on the next generation, and I hope you feel it hard. Just as we have.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you, Activision-Blizzard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I wrote this out. I guess I'm just angry and have finally realised that there is no turning back for the company I once idolized. Looks like I need to broaden my horizon and see where I can put my skills to use elsewhere. If there's anyone else out there in a similar situation, I wish you the best of luck. :)"

You aren‚Äôt alone as thousands of youngsters in India dream of creating a name for themselves in this glamorous and rewarding industry. If you can reach the top you would have the world at your feet. A career in fashion designing in India would open a world of opportunities as the fashion market in India is growing at a brisk pace. With more than 65% of the population under the age of 35 and highly fashion conscious you would have a bag full of opportunities to explore. However to reach the top you would need to measure each step and take them in the right direction. Here we shall discuss a few important things that you need for a successful [career in fashion designing](https://medium.com/@anwar_45010/what-do-you-need-to-do-for-successful-career-in-fashion-designing-792a03cb1ecb).

&amp;#x200B;

Choose Your Role Wisely Often we associate the fashion industry with designing and feel there is no place for people who don‚Äôt have a great sense of creativity. Though designing is the core of the industry there are a number of other roles that you can explore. These include marketing, branding, fashion event management and even writing on the fashion designing industry. All these open up new career opportunities for you in this vibrant industry. Very early in your career, you would need to choose a role for yourself. Choose a segment that you are passionate about. If you aren‚Äôt very creative with your design but have a knack for marketing it would be wise for you to choose this role.

&amp;#x200B;

**Join Good fashion design schools**  
This is the prerequisite for a successful career in fashion designing. Like all other course programs, the reputation of the institute plays a very vital role in your career. A well-established [fashion design schools](https://www.icf.edu.in/) would lay the perfect platform for your career. Here you would learn under the guidance of experienced faculty members who would impart lessons in the fundamentals as well as the advanced skills that are required in the fashion design industry. These institutes have a very hands-on approach to teaching and focus on developing your skills rather than just taking you through classroom lectures. You would get great opportunities to intern with some of the leading brands and labels in the country and this allows you to showcase your design and marketing skills and open up employment opportunities for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Make Maximum Out of Exposure**  
When you enroll in a well-established fashion institute it would offer you great exposure into the industry. You would regularly participate in fashion shows, trade shows, and other events. These are great opportunities for you to showcase your creativity and other skills to people who matter in the industry. You should never sit back and relax during these events and put in all your hard work and soul into them. If you can catch the attention of the top designers and fashion houses in the country you would have the perfect launch for your career. In an industry as competitive as the fashion designing industry you need to maximize any opportunity that comes your way."

For context, I am Syrian...this will make some things clearer later.

So I met my ex approximately 6 years ago when she moved to my school. We were both living in a fairly conservative country in the Middle East. For me it was love at first sight, she had the most beautiful eyes and dimples and the cutest laugh I've ever heard, she was smart, artsy and just really nice all around. I told her very soon that I had a crush on her but she rightfully rejected.

Fast forward a year and a half later we started dating towards the end of our Junior year. During that year also my family had to move to Sweden because it wasn't a stable place for us in the long term (This will make more sense later) but I managed to live alone for my senior year because my education would have been significantly delayed had I moved. We pretty much saw each other almost every day during that time and since my family wasn't around it made us get a lot closer it was an amazing time, we had amazing chemistry, similar enough to where we had good enough common ground yet we were different enough to where we could learn a lot from each other. 

During that time we were applying for college, for us, students typically went abroad because universities sucked in our country. I wanted to go to a university in the USA because it was the best education I could obtain but her parents wouldn't let her go too far and she ended up going to another country near our home. We realized we would be forced into long distance and we felt that it was the best option then, It was worth the wait for me and I am assuming. I was able to visit during the long holidays then so that was a great opportunity to catch up. 

However, during my sophomore year in college Trump was elected and he imposed the travel ban. For me, that meant that I could not leave the country anymore because I wouldn't be allowed to return and continue my education. It fucking sucked, I was unable to visit her or my family. My grandfather was even diagnosed with late-stage cancer during that time and died months later. When the travel ban happened my girlfriend cried, I cried but she said she wanted to wait it out until I finished my education, I would have never been able to break up with her, I loved her too much and she was very emotional and I just never saw my self doing anything that would upset her like that.

Towards my junior year, I decided that I would take summer classes and take on extra classes next fall so that I can graduate early, be able to see her, my family and just end the isolation I was in. The travel can lead to so much stress for me, facing my grandfather's death and being unable to see her, gave me depression, I gained weight and I was just unable to do as well as I did before (It was equally as hard for her, unfortunately). Her mother made it very hard for her to visit me during that time because she was too scared for her to travel so far and she was too conservative to give her alone time with me. 

Things started taking a turn to the worse during my senior year, the situation took a significant toll on us in addition to the stress of the senior year. We both had so much work to do, time difference didn't help. We didn't have as much time to watch movies together over Skype, play video games and other bonding activities that we used to do, it got so much harder. This is my fault but we both started getting into more arguments and being on edge more often. We still texted and a voice called a lot but not to the level it used to be. I realized that it was because of our busy lifestyles and the stress. Which really made me panic and want to graduate ASAP, I knew I had to see her for any truly constructive mending to happen and to rejuvenate the relationship. I know by many many people's standards this relationship should have ended a lot earlier because of how impossible the circumstances were but it didn't.  

However there was a light at the end of the tunnel then, she managed to convince her mum to come to my graduation. She would have been the only person I was close to that would have had some sort of chance to come because my family was not allowed in the US. She drove 2 hours to the visa interview where she lived and had everything prepared, the bombshell then was she ended up being denied a visa. The interviewer asked her where I was from and she said Syria. He assumed that she was going to overstay the visa and be with me even though that was honestly not our intention it was just hard to prove. I felt deep down in my heart then, that this pretty much was the death sentence to the relationship. It wasn't her fault, it wasn't mine. There was nothing that we could do.

&amp;#x200B;

Following my graduation, I had to go back to Sweden because of long story short I was unable to get a visa anywhere else, plus I had to live there to get a Swedish citizenship. I thought I would be able to visit her then or she would be able to visit but for more reasons, it just continued to seem impossible. She previously said that she didn't mind moving to Sweden and it would have been in a way easier for her than me because her field of work is in good demand. But she wasn't having an easier life for her either and she had to stick closer to her mum. I felt that I couldn't nag on her to come either because I that Sweden would have not been the option she should have taken. I never liked being in her way of success she had some sort of choice between visiting me and taking an internship in one summer but I encouraged her to take the internship. I did not want to be the reason she didn't reach her goals even though I probably failed at that. 

So with no hope to be seen for the next 1-3 years, she called the relationship off during a video call, even with all the things that happened before I was still somehow in shock. We both cried a lot but she said she still wanted to be friends and that she wanted to keep all the gifts we gave each other (she gave the best and most thoughtful gifts in the world, seriously...I also tried my best but I have to admit she outdoes me) and not block each other on social media, although shes barely present anyways. 

I am still sad, very sad obviously. I don't have friends in Sweden, I have no choice but to live with my family in a fairly small city where there isn't much for me to do. And I can't really move on until I learn the language which is going to take some time and go to university for masters degree here. Many good business jobs here are very competitive and need a masters degree even if it was an entry-level position. I had to also pass on a consulting job offer in the same country my ex-girlfriend was living in that would have paid me very very well because I couldn't get a visa there and even if I was, being Syrian I am very prone to be deported or not have my passport renewed or be forced to conscription which I can never do because I oppose the government. 

I am really torn, it sucks so much that everything went against us and that this was just not possible to happen for the foreseeable future. I was never half as close to anyone as I was to her, for the short time things went right everything felt perfect. She was amazing in every way. I feel thankful for her standing by me in ways no one has ever done for me, for truly caring about me and I am amazed that she was willing to stay for that long even though she had no obligation to and even though all of this trouble was because of me. Because I don't have much of a social life, for now, I've been finding it very difficult to move-on/distract myself. We still talk but very infrequently and I know I should give her distance so I am going to abstain from any sort of contact for a while even though I know she will respond if I did but that's not what I should do. I am also very jealous and that's yet another flaw I find myself having difficulty coping with. But what can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I am sorry for writing so much, I am just frustrated with how my life is going and how little control I feel like I have on it. I wish I can find love again, if luck is on my side hopefully her again but oh well. I am also sorry if my writing isn't too good, English is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : We dated for a year. Everything was perfect. We move to college and start LDR. I am Syrian. I can't travel outside the USA because of Trump's travel ban. She's unable to visit. A lot of things out of control went wrong. I am stuck because I can't get a visa anywhere. No security in sight. Had to break to break up

I'm currently doing an internship in a software company that does automation testing with C#. Part of my job here is to untangle a very old  automation testing script. Ideally what I'd like to do is cut out any old code blocks that aren't actually used, recreate an old Nuget package that nobody has the source code for and document the changes properly. 

I'm not very familiar with C# but I've done a few other languages. I'm reading the docs [here for XML documentation comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments) and wondering if there's a way to export these to something like vuepress or a pdf?

aq72sh,2,2019-02-13,Would two deities fight over who worshipped them?,socialfoxes,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/aq72sh/would_two_deities_fight_over_who_worshipped_them/,"**TL:DR:**  I have a character; who by her bloodline, should be a worshiper of Mystra - but instead has become an acolyte of Sune.  Would this cause any friction between the two deities as they each played a tug of war with the characters soul and how would this affect the character?

\----

For a couple of weeks now, I have been looking for a way to link my character a *legendary hero of old.*  Essentially, I was looking for a legendary hero from past D&amp;D editions, whose bloodline I could insert my character into.

It was suggested that I check out the Knights of Myth Drannor and so, I have been doing some research and I quite like¬†Illistyl Elventree.¬† Her story of how she joined the Knights as a replacement for her teacher and then became babysitter to her teachers child - later taking over where¬†Sylune had left off, fits really well with this character I think.

Having her be distantly related to¬†Illistyl Elventree, would be interesting.¬† Her ancestor has been part of a legendary band of knights and has taken part of things that would; at the time have made her a legend in her own right, but ultimately forsook her position as a knight and an adventurer, to take up more family and community orientated roles.¬†¬†

Certainly, I can see her descendants becoming the traders and merchants of Shadowdale and some of them becoming quite wealthy - branching of and marrying other more prosperous merchants and so on from other parts of Faerun - whose descendants branched off and married others; some becoming adventurers and knights, while others settled down to starting families of their own, who intern started their own families, down through the generations until we get to the characters family - now only distantly related to Illistyl.

So now we have the character related to a once legendary and powerful Mage.

The only last issue that I had is that Illistyl Elventree had Mystra as a patron deity and it seems most likely that she would have passed down the worship of Mystra to her children; however, I have the character¬†becoming¬†an acolyte of Sune as part of her backstory - so, her patron deity is obviously Sune.¬† It seems that Mystra has in the past had a working relationship with Sune.¬†¬†

Would this not make things difficult?¬† Having a character; who by her bloodline, should be a worshiper of Mystra, becoming an acolyte of Sune?

I am just trying to get a handle on what might be going on in the background because of decisions that this character makes and whether or not she would be aware of it.

I want this character to feel real and lived in.  Like she has really experienced the events of her past and continues to experience the events of her present.  She is not a character that I intend to just throw away, but I intend to play her in multiples games across multiple campaigns and so I am really trying to get into her skin and absolutely get to know who she is because in doing that, in figuring out who this character is, what she knows and doesn't know, what she wants out of life and how she plans to get it and how she would deal with any obstacles along the way - I can really delve into roleplaying her.

So I am basically doing what some actors do (I am essentially an actor when I take on her persona) and exploring her world and how she interacts with it and using that to inform and help me build her character, rather than making a character and then going - ""okay, so how does she react to this.""

Ideas, thoughts and opinions and constructive criticisms will be most gladly and appreciatively accepted."

Hey Reddit! This has been eating me for a while recently as I am approaching my last semester of College as this is also probably a last chance to try and repair a friendship with someone. Granted this had occurred in 2017, and most haven‚Äôt been acted upon since Early 2018, however, I still want some outside input on the situation (whether it‚Äôs because I want to know that this was a messed up situation or whether I did something wrong). Also sorry in advance for this long thing.

First, The Players, ie the people involved

Myself (Fix): was 21F. I am the type of person to have a low social battery due to myself being introverted. I also can get easily emotional and apologize for a lot of things, meaning a lot of them (I rarely say sorry and not mean it). My hearing is also not the best and sometimes mishear stuff and have to ask for a repeat, while also being a bit daft as a board and thus needing someone to explain it plainly to me. Despite this, I try to be a good person and be treated how I would like to be treated. 

Friend A: Was a 22M. Was a much calmer personality and liked to see and do different things, and pretty much never seemed tired, as well as seeming to be a tech wizard. However, in some events, he did rely heavily on others to agree to last-minute plans or have others work out times in short windows of time. Seemed to always have a problem that was worse than others.

Friend B: Won‚Äôt talk too much on this fella as he is literally important to the event and the effects afterward. I thank this person so much, along with all my friends that stuck around with me through this! We are still really good friends to this date

Second, The Situation/Story

To start this off, I should explain that Friend A and myself met in a College class when I first started going to college (2014) and during this period, I was worried about not making friends so tried to puff my chest up with confidence and make the first impression (this died out after the first week of class; I also meet more friends including Friend B during this period). So, we built up a three-year friendship of meeting up with each other and hanging out in between classes or catching a movie and lunch during weekends, sometimes with other people. Along with this, we also did games on some weekends and this is also where I was asked to buy Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army so we could play together. Granted I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the game due to me being pretty scared of Horror games (even tame ones) and not a giant fan of Zombie games (also my aim is terrible). However, I took the plunge and bought the game, which we then found out it was buggy and didn‚Äôt even work (cause it to be shelved). I also caught a lot of different movies with Friend A, and some of which I wasn‚Äôt fond of but still went because I believed that is what friends do; You do stuff that may make the other person happy because, at one point or another, they will do the same for you. I also was getting to know people online and becoming friends with them, while growing in a Discord server. I also tried to talk to Friend A about maybe joining in on some stuff (one of which was an online DnD session, though he turned it down due to it being online and not physical). Along with this, it sometimes seemed that Friend A‚Äôs problems were deemed worse than my own problems when we discussed them (ie we both were bullied in Grade School; Friend A was bullied by this one kid and it resulted in him quitting something he loved due to this but would later ‚Äúbe redeemed‚Äù (my words) as he would be having a good High School life, I, on the other hand, was bullied and unfortunately let it dictate my life which might have led to me being quieter and not having a very social able life \[I was probably a lone wolf type in High School\]. Both are bad in their own right, but I always felt like my bullying wasn‚Äôt as bad as his bullying). Again, everything seemed to be going fine till Spring Semester 2017. 

Before Spring Break, Friend A and I were both looking for places to intern at and it was mentioned by Friend A that he was planning to hear about something over Spring Break (he NEVER told me or hinted at what this was, it was just ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to jinx myself so I won‚Äôt tell you anything about it‚Äù). Friend A also mentioned that if he also wanted to go see a movie over Spring Break, to which I told him specifically that seeing a movie was fine, but HE NEEDS TO TELL ME. I don‚Äôt know if he blew it off or expected me to text him over Spring Break despite what I had said, but I didn‚Äôt text him, thinking to myself that he was busy with his important thing that I knew next to nothing about as well as during Spring Break, I got word from my mother that my grandmother (her mother) had an incident that caused great worry in the family (my grandmother is currently my only living grandparent as I lost my grandfather \[my dad‚Äôs father\] a year prior in October and it seemed to be leading toward a funeral). With all this stated, I got back from Spring Break, unnerved on the whole situation and worrying about an impending funeral. I meet up with Friend A a day or two after Spring Break and was greet with conceded anger over the fact he never received word from me over Spring Break to make plans. I apologized and told him that I had asked for him to text me when he was available and mentioned I was concerned about my grandmother due to her scaring my family over Spring Break. He blew it off, or it felt like he did as he still seemed quite mad at me over the situation and telling me throughout the day that he told me to text him over Spring Break for plans (AGAIN, He made a big fuss over this unknown important call he might have gotten, so I didn‚Äôt want to bother him and make plans with this unknown thing). This resulted in the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back situation. We were sitting in a quiet space (no loud talking) and I was sitting on my computer checking in on some of my online friends as well as working on a Discord server (I think I also was trying to cheer myself up and I didn‚Äôt feel like talking to Friend A would be good at that point). I need to quickly explain something hear which is the fact that I do try and hide certain events from my friends, online and in person, unless I deem it necessary for the person to know. This is kinda-of where that second best thing comes into play, where I think someone else is suffering more than me and I don‚Äôt need to vent my problems to them. Along with this, I also use a sona to hide myself on the internet which is considered to mainly be fire based but I am usually water-based (this will be important later). Anyways, I was distracted on my computer, working on the Discord server and communicating with friends, when Friend A told me he was heading to the loo. Or so I thought that‚Äôs what he said. I told him that was fine and I would head off to class as I had one in a few hours. Some time passed and I texted him, telling him that I was heading to class and would meet him afterward, and packed my stuff up and headed to class. I got there early and was waiting for the next class to get out when I noticed Friend A text me back. This message basically said that I had left him, a depressed person, alone on the garden roof in which he could have committed suicide. This leads to the fact I misheard roof as loo. I was so upset and that‚Äôs when the class prior was getting out and in walks in Friend B (I had talked with Friend B so little during the time due to most of my time hanging out with Friend A however we maintained good contact), who noticed something was up and went over to me asking if I was alright. I don‚Äôt recall very much of what happened except handing my phone over to Friend B and having him walk me away from class because I believe I couldn‚Äôt think straight. After that, it was a blur which ended with me driving home and crying in bed. Looking back on what memories I have of the event, I can vaguely recall seeing Friend A walking up to Friend B and me just walking away. 

I don‚Äôt recall very much else during that week and had to rely on screenshots I had taken during that period when I was relaying this to a few of my closest friends when I had asked for their opinion on everything (granted I don‚Äôt know if they were biased because I was their friend and the situation was fresh). I remember inviting Friend A to see Beauty and the Beast with me and another person, however, it resulted in him complaining about the theater location and me not wanting to make plans after that (I was invited by my other friend and this was not my plan). 

So following this event, Friend A texted me something (don‚Äôt have that) with me responding to it with a ‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù (genuine sorry, though confused as I didn‚Äôt fully know what to apologize for at the time. Do I say sorry for being a bad friend? For not being a smart person and going like ‚ÄúWhy did he say loo?‚Äù? For not being a mind reader?). 

Friend A: Why does it matter to you?

Me: Because you are my friend and I worry about my friends

Friend A: Why do I believe this is truly the first time for me, in all of the recent event?

Me: I am terrible at social interaction (At this point, revisiting these, I don‚Äôt EVEN RECALL being fake to Friend A. Truly I do care about all my friends, and I will openly admit I don‚Äôt pick up on social queues and really do require my friends to flat out tell me of stuff. I never did tell Friend A this information, as this is just what I pick up on)

Friend A: My wounds are still bleeding out

Me: I am sorry to hear that and am hoping they get better

Friend A: I can hear the irritation in your tone. Just do something for me, don‚Äôt start getting irritated over someone‚Äôs plea for help, and if it so happens, don‚Äôt cry either. If you TRULY want to know and help, I can re-explain later, just not today. 

Me: I am not irritated with you. I am sorry for crying, but I was in a rough patch and honestly I am in the mindset that people don‚Äôt want to dump their problems on others. Very well, I guess I will talk with you tomorrow. 

Friend A: There‚Äôs more to it than that. You just don‚Äôt realize it yourself yet (I have EXPLAINED to Friend A to explain things to me as I am ‚ÄúDaft as a Board‚Äù \[exact words I used too\]). 

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt recall what we discussed exactly but I do recall him laughing at me for choosing a Water Sona when it should be fire and won‚Äôt live as water (ie basically saying that this sona I had was ‚Äústupid‚Äù and kinda of made a joke out of it) and this resulted in me getting mad and telling him off. Needless to say, it ended badly. However, I do recall trying to reach out after a month times and repair stuff during June (mainly with Hope you are having a great day and doing well and trying to get a response back. It resulted in nothing except how I was giving him the cold shoulder (which I admit I was due to me trying to protect my feelings as well as giving up on the situation). I ended this conversation off with ‚ÄúIF you see me around you can bug me and good luck on your semester. Also good luck with finding that internship‚Äù. This resulted in him sending me a Discord message later that just ends with Friend A claiming I was the ""victim"" and leaving him abandoned, even though he claimed he sincerely apologized for making me cry, with nothing but the cold shoulder, to be ‚Äúonce again forgotten and avoided‚Äù. I have no clue where he got this from and this is something that bothers me to this day. 

After all of this, I have only talked to him once outside of the phone, caught a movie with him (though I invited another friend as I didn't want to be alone with this person at the current time, though he got mad that I invited someone, even though I told him when we were pre-ordering the ticket (because regular tickets were not an option and he wanted to see it in IMAX, and I wanted to be nice)), and a few texts via Steam or phone to just ask if it was fine to use me as a contact (which I agreed to). The last contact I had was Dec 2017, when he contacts two friends and myself to make a lunch/dinner celebration during finals week with only three days to spare. Needless to say, it didn't happen as all of us were busy and we really didn't have time to figure out something in three days. Friend A seemed annoyed about this, though replies were done via text messages. To date, we haven't said a word to each other yet.

TL;DR: Friend A and I were friends for three years (went to see movies and hang out at school) but it all came to an end when I misheard roof as loo (as the building had a garden roof) and resulted in a text containing thoughts of suicide. This would lead to a very rocky repair that fell through due to me going into a cold shoulder and Friend A blaming me for not trying and never ‚Äútruly apologizing‚Äù.

So Reddit, Am I the Asshole? And should I try and repair anything left? "
aq8bc2,337,2019-02-13,I took one for the team and now DH owes me BIG TIME (Bar Villa),XcentrkTnKs,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/aq8bc2/i_took_one_for_the_team_and_now_dh_owes_me_big/,"Hi everybody!!!

Long time no see!!! For the most part we have had our pair JNs wrangled so there hasn‚Äôt been much to post. 

This one will be hopefully short and sweet.

To update on our happenings; Yes we got a dog, he‚Äôs a puppy and he‚Äôs already rotten (German Shepard golden retriever mix rescue), DS adores him and they love to adventure outside together. 

OB is back from his internship abroad. Unfortunately his wife did decide she really was done and started divorce proceedings but he is doing okay all things considering. Bar Villa is having a field day about re-doing all her divorces through him in a most maniacal fashion, but he is staying sober and he just got a new job that keeps him busy and traveling. He crashes here between assignments until he he saves up for a place of his own. I‚Äôm proud of him by leaps and bounds considering how low he was.

Now that we are caught up, onto the story:

I had an appointment that took me months to get. We have new and better insurance but switching psychiatrists (yes I am no longer seeing the same one as BV, can I get an amen that witch can‚Äôt sweet talk her way around anymore) took some time. 

I knew about my appointment months in advance and so did DH. 

Now DH has been really bad as of late about not listening to me when I tell him ‚Äúyou have plenty of time to work (x) out so I suggest you get started just in case‚Äù. He waited until the last minute to work out how he would get to work since I needed the car so DS and I could go to my appointment. He didn‚Äôt tell me his one and only plan failed and he had zero back up ideas until I got up. Cue us calling everyone acceptable under the sun to try and work it out. I even thought of canceling my appointment but realized it would be yet again months before I could be seen. 

Why didn‚Äôt he use a ride share? Well to start he is anxious about them when it comes to navigating to the job site as it isn‚Äôt exactly listed and he didn‚Äôt budget his personal money wisely enough to afford it. 

So we go back and fourth for an hour or two with the clock ticking for both of us to need to leave the house. X person can drop him off but no ride back, Y person can pick him up but can‚Äôt bring him home. I can‚Äôt pick him up because that would mean waking my toddler up at 10pm and fighting to get him back to sleep. 

Finally I realize there is only one option. An option that I hate and at the sheer thought I want to nail DHs nutsack to my wall as a trophy of his stupidity and lack of planning. 

I have to take one for the team and call Bar Villa. Now most of you know why Bar Villa and doctors appointments are shit on a hot tin roof with me. If you don‚Äôt, bitchbot has the scoop way back when I was preggers and BV took me to prenatal exams. 

So while DH got the easy way out, got the car and as many cigarettes as he could smoke and music of his choice on his way to and from work. I was stuck in hell for nearly 6 hours. 

So here is the list of all the reasons why he is paying me back for this over the course of 2019 and you better believe I *will* be cashing in. I am also open to suggestions on how best to milk this shit because lovelies it was a fucking day.

*  I didn‚Äôt need to be at the office until 1:30, I couldn‚Äôt check in even until that time because my appointment was at 2:30. BV and step dad show up at noon and want to leave ASAP. 

*  I am in a scramble to get my shit together. BV and Sdad are stupid when it comes to car seats and apparently so is DH at this point so I have to drop everything I am doing to get out the door to install the damn thing in their bigger than fuck truck. They have a smaller car but god forbid they use it. 

*  While I am doing all of this with my attention split in a million directions, and DH has deer in the headlights stupidity BV gives DS his ‚Äúvalentines‚Äù present which is literally nothing but a big ass bag of fucking candy which she helps him open and start eating. I am unaware and DH just stands there. 

*  They are in such a fucking rush that I am still trying to buckle DS into his seat while they start fucking moving. They don‚Äôt even know where we are going so they have to pull over one house down from mine to set the gps and are aggravated that I don‚Äôt have the address already because I literally just buckeled myself in. 

*  We get there at (surprise) 1:00. I can‚Äôt even check in yet. So I stand outside their truck and try to smoke my anger down while tossing some decongestants in there because I am also sick with a cold DH brought home. BV is playing with DS which I don‚Äôt care about, but now they want to play 150 questions about gossipy shit I also don‚Äôt care about. 

*  1:30 rolls around and they decide they don‚Äôt want to go into the building because it houses all of the medical facilities associated with my insurance group, and they don‚Äôt want DS to get sick or bring home a bug to JNGM. Fine whatever, I can be baby free for a little bit, they hyped him up on sugar between my house and the facility so they can deal with the fall out. (DS is more communicative these days and will actually tell me if something is or goes wrong)

*  I get checked in, go to the proper part of the building and get settled to wait. BV calls instead of just texting me to inform me it‚Äôs raining like I can‚Äôt see out the massive glass window that overlooks exactly where they are parked. 

*  After waiting and hour I am finally seen and when my new psychiatrist remarks that I am also seeing (x) therapist as well, so I don‚Äôt need any additional paperwork, and asks me how I‚Äôm doing I say ‚ÄúWell my stupid ass DH didn‚Äôt plan ahead again so I‚Äôm stuck with my biological mother who is crazier than a shit house rat,‚Äù he stares in awe and responds ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs a new one for me,‚Äù to which I just smile and say ‚Äúyea, she is why I am seeing (x) as well as you.‚Äù

*  I get a new script because the old combo was apparently building in my system too much according to previous blood work, so they want to put me on something a generation newer to prevent serotonin syndrome. I also have to have new labs done to have a base line done for white blood cells which could be affected by the new med. So I call BV to let her know I‚Äôm heading to drop off my script and while it‚Äôs filling head to the lab (pharmacy and all is in one building). Who answers BVs phone you may ask? My toddler. I hear their antsy asses already starting the louder than shit truck before I have to halfway yell that I‚Äôm not done yet and just have two more things to do. 

*  Finally I leave and call them from the carport. It‚Äôs not raining anymore and I can see DS is in BVs lap in the front seat and not in his car seat so I offer to just walk to the car instead of them driving around. They insist it‚Äôs fine, so I settle in and pull out my smokes thinking I have a minute because it will take BV and hour to figure out his car seat. *NOPE* they drive around the parking lot to the car port with DS happily sitting in BVs lap and I wanted to scream. Thankfully it‚Äôs a mostly empty parking lot but 1) do I even need to say how unsafe that is, and 2) Now DS is not going to want to sit in his car seat because fucking BV just gave him what he now thinks is another ducking option. 

*  So I get to sit in the back with DS now strapped in like he should be, but he‚Äôs fussing and stretching wanting back up front with BV. 

*  They argue about traffic and then get us lost for 45min. DS is still fussing wanting up front and I am about to bust out the back windshield wanting a cigarette and a bottle of wine and the fuck out of this god damn circus act.

*  They finally find the expressway to head home and get off two exits down from where we got on to spend another 30mins looking for a religious chicken. When they find it, the drive through is backed out into the street but hey, let‚Äôs stop and wait. 

*  I have to get out of the car, in the cold rain to smoke because Sdad doesn‚Äôt like how my cigarettes smell despite the fact that they smell just like the cigars he himself smokes when BV isn‚Äôt looking. (Smoking is bad, and judge away at this point it was a matter of fucking survival before I launched myself into oncoming traffic just to get away).  At this point I am just praying I don‚Äôt end up with pneumonia because I don‚Äôt want to mother my child from and icu bed with one hand while I beat BV away with my Iv drip stand because she wants to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù but shoving mountains of candy down DSs throat.

*  After another 45min wait and two god given cigarettes later they pull around, food in hand and I get back in the car. BV has moved to my spot in the back seat to help DS eat his holy chicken nuggets and fries while I slink upfront and force myself to eat the damn sandwich from hell. I‚Äôm thinking okay, we are good. No more stops, we are headed home and this nightmare can end... But then I hear ‚ÄúDo you want some drink sweetie?‚Äù And I brace myself as I turn around to see BV sharing her drink with DS, praying to God it‚Äôs *just* lemonade. I ask if that‚Äôs what it is and she informs me it‚Äôs Dr. Fucking Pepper!!! She is pretty much giving my toddler free reign to drink her medium adult sized soda. 

*  We FINALLY make it home with the only positive note in my day being that I don‚Äôt have to feed DS dinner. He looses him mind that BV leaves because she has bought his affection with rule breaking, candy and caffeinated soda. I am hanging by a thread, and ready to pass out from exhaustion, psychological break down, and cold medication. 

Bedtime came as early as I fucking pleased and I have been 100% up DHs ass about how he is going to pay me back and how that that the very **last** time I *take one for the team*. 

Baby tax: https://imgur.com/a/arbyMt1

DS wanted a big boy haircut like daddy‚Äôs and after we were done I cried into a bottle of wine of how fast that haircut made him grow up. 

P.s. 
DH is not a bad dude. He is still a keeper, but yes he owes me fucking big time after yesterday. All suggestions welcome, just don‚Äôt bash him too hard. I actually think at one point I told him I hated him yesterday while I was in the trenches. He‚Äôs being held accountable and next time he gets to be the one who spends all day with BV and the hyped up toddler. 



Edit: as I have been informed I am late on the puppy tax,

aq8sq7,10,2019-02-13,My (23F) roommate (22M) is really getting under my skin,RedJim19,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/aq8sq7/my_23f_roommate_22m_is_really_getting_under_my/,"I live with my boyfriend and his brother. We all go to the same college, and moved in together about a year and a half ago. Things have mostly been okay with a few blow ups here and there. 

Last summer I had an internship that required me to be up and out of the house by 9, nothing too crazy just needed sleep. My boyfriend- Alex was also working and having to get up early-ish. My boyfriends brother/my roommate- Andrew did not work at all that summer until the last month of the three month break. My issue then was that he would always have people over at night and he‚Äôs not the most considerate when it comes to letting us know people were coming over or finishing up at a decent time for us to get to bed. Before this he never had people over, it was kind of nice because he made some friends; but also very annoying because he decided to hang with them late at night and making a lot of noise when none of them had jobs and could just as easily have spent the day together. We discussed it and suggested he let us know when people were coming, we didn‚Äôt make him ask because he pays rent and I didn‚Äôt think that it would be fair to govern him, and that the people he had over leave by 11. He agreed and mostly we were okay after that. There was an incident where he told us they were coming over and it was already ten and they aren‚Äôt the type of people who would just swing by and go and Alex asked him to have them over at a later date. Another problem is that I don‚Äôt feel that Andrew listens to what I have to say or cares about my opinion, so I thought since his brother had asked he may listen. Andrew didn‚Äôt respond, which we knew meant he was going to pretend he didn‚Äôt see the message. When we got home his car was there and so was one of his friend‚Äôs but they weren‚Äôt home. We thought maybe they‚Äôd decided to go out and took another friend‚Äôs car, like that‚Äôs cool maybe he listened. Instead, he waited until we were in our room getting ready for bed and snuck them in. I probably looked like a crazy person, out in my robe asking them to leave because they were being loud and it was around midnight already, which they did and it didn‚Äôt happen again. Once the summer was over Andrew stopped telling us when people were coming over and we still make sure he knows when our friends are coming and it‚Äôs very irritating to me. 

More recently we‚Äôve had other issues, Andrew and Alex‚Äôs mom will sometimes send food back for everyone and Andrew never goes grocery shopping so he‚Äôll literally live off of the snacks she sends back whenever he‚Äôs at home. He does have a good amount of money coming in from his job, but won‚Äôt buy groceries regularly. Alex says he leaves food that their mom brings mostly for Andrew, but I don‚Äôt think that that‚Äôs really fair to him because his mother sends it back for everyone and has told us this multiple times. When Andrew didn‚Äôt have a job their mom was supplementing his part of the rent and has never helped out Alex like that because he‚Äôs never needed it. She‚Äôs bought Andrew multiple meal plans so he can eat on campus and when I discussed that with Alex he agreed that Andrew has everything he needs and he shouldn‚Äôt have to let him have everything their mom sends back. 

We‚Äôve also offered on multiple occasions if Andrew will give us $30 when we go grocery shopping he can have some of whatever we buy. I feel like the only reason he hasn‚Äôt is because he‚Äôs being petty and doesn‚Äôt want to give us money. He has the money and is always just surviving off of snacks his mom sends back, every so often he‚Äôll buy himself some eggs or cereal or rice and he‚Äôll eat that in addition to the snacks. He uses our stuff like the nonstick spray and our paper towels and Alex and I usually always say yes when he asks if he can have something. We‚Äôve felt bad about him not having food and offered some of ours in the past when he didn‚Äôt have any money and he would just pick at it like it wasn‚Äôt good, which is also so fucking rude. He‚Äôs made stuff and snuck some of our stuff into it, he made some fried rice when his gf was over and took one of our eggs for it. He‚Äôs taken toilet paper that we‚Äôve bought without asking, out of our bathroom. He always borrows my bf‚Äôs hats without asking or mentioning it and then when we ask he acts like he didn‚Äôt do it. We got a new vacuum and unpacked it and he used it before we ever got the chance and then when we were home later that week he asked us to use it like he hadn‚Äôt before, but he didn‚Äôt clean out the dust part and moved the hose, so we knew it was used?? I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs like this. 

Last week we made something after we‚Äôd gone to the gym together, we don‚Äôt hang as a group often because he usually isn‚Äôt home nowadays, he stays out all night with his friends- which I definitely prefer to them being here all the time. When we got home Alex and I both told him he should eat something and he goes and helps himself to some of what we made. We both thought maybe he‚Äôd misunderstood us saying he should eat as an offer, so we didn‚Äôt say anything. He also eats a lot of the stuff I bake and only asks when I‚Äôm in the kitchen when he wants one, otherwise he just takes it and has given them to his gf when she‚Äôs over without mentioning it too. 

He doesn‚Äôt usually clean his dishes- like the actual pans for the eggs and rice until he wants to cook again which is oftentimes like two weeks later; but otherwise we sometimes have to remind him to put plates in the dishwasher. Their mom will send back dish detergent and washing detergent, but not often enough for us to just use that and when we run out he still uses our laundry detergent and we always run the dishwasher, obviously using ours or any their mom has sent back. 

Last week we‚Äôd told him we were having friends over for like a double date and would be cooking, he invited his gf over, again with no warning. We just came home to both of them in the living room, she then moved to dining room table, which only sits four people, to do hw. We obviously had planned to use the table given that we were making dinner and we‚Äôd told him they day before and as they were sitting there with no change. We ended up just going out to eat because everyone thought they were being weird. 

I feel like he is just really inconsiderate of us and Alex let‚Äôs a lot slide because it‚Äôs his brother. 

tl;dr my boyfriend and I live with his brother-my roommate, who uses our stuff without asking and doesn‚Äôt clean up. Is generally not the most considerate. I‚Äôve asked him to chip in and he won‚Äôt 

Am I being petty for expecting him to chip in now that he‚Äôs got some money or is he being petty for taking advantage?

Also sorry for so many tangents and the length of the post "
aq8v2m,2,2019-02-13,[M4A Playing F] The Multiple prompt list. Something for everyone! I hope.. (Multiple prompts) (Open prompts) (Light or dark) (Very long!),Soapydopey69,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/aq8v2m/m4a_playing_f_the_multiple_prompt_list_something/,"Disclaimer: I am 18+ looking for someone 18+ for fictional roleplay!

Hey people of APP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

I have left the ages ambiguous on purpose, if you read this properly, you would have read this portion and you would know that I tend to play with our characters between the ages of 14-25, depending on the scenario.

(In no particular order!)

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs..

You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**The threesome with the two sisters:** It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister.

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D and C [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with Demi over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night in. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy: (I'm unsure what ageplay we could use for this one, but if you have an idea please shoot it my way)** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me.

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes;)"

I enjoy playing Futa but only if your character is female. This is important! If you're curious, I tend to play a more 'realistic' character and by that I mean one that isn't HH cup breasts, an ass as big as the earth and a cock the size of the empire state!

My preference of character is one that looks like Jenna Mcdougall (I'm aware she's a celeb, but I'm only using her looks not her status). If you don't know what she looks like, I recommend you google her, she's a petite blonde that should be okay for our RP. If you have a suggestion yourself about a 'natural' looking girl, let me know!

And if you're after a 'Surprise I'm futa!' Scene aswell, this can be incorporated if necessary.

I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

aq9cvt,11,2019-02-13,Anyone ever failed technical interview due to poor communication skills?,xuhu55,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/aq9cvt/anyone_ever_failed_technical_interview_due_to/,"I'm a junior computer science major at UMD. Academically, I'm slightly above average and I tried very hard this year to land internships. I studied significant amounts of Leetcode questions over the summer to try to land a decent internship this summer. There was a repeated pattern to my failure. I would always pass the online assessment like hackerrank and surprisingly the behavioral interview. Then I would fail my technical interviews. Some interviews I would fail for not passing the technical portion as in not getting the correct answer. However some I would fail despite getting the correct answer and I honestly think it's due to my asperber tendencies. My interview class professor says I need to sound more excited so I tried faking but it's worse because it comes off as fake.

&amp;#x200B;

The only internships offers I got were at places that didn't do technical interviews like Liberty Mutual and Fannie Mae. I ended up accepting Fannie Mae.

The only technical interview I passed was facebook's first interview. I failed their 2nd technical.

I passed Amazon hackerrank assessments only to fail the final round interview.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty upset considering how much money I spent buying technical interview preparation material and literally didn't get any internships by passing technical interviews. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that this paints a bleak ceiling to my potential full time job prospects due to my poor communication skills."

&amp;#x200B;

The Slide iOS project has been a huge undertaking for the last year, and now that I am nearing completion with the base feature set and thousands of users are enjoying Slide on their Apple devices, it is soon time to take a deeper dive into the Android app and give it some much needed attention.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many features that exist in the iOS app that I plan on bringing to the Android version, namely

* Autoplaying videos/gifs in the main feed (autoplay on tap, always, or wifi-only)
* The ability to theme every aspect of the app, including custom colors
* Ability to share themes with other users through a Slide link
* A Read Later system that saves articles for future reading
* Live sorting in comment threads
* Better user tag management system
* Alphabetical subreddit list with a scrubber, and a ""Pinned"" section at the top
* Native multireddit support in the main feed (automatically updates)
* Better profile management separate from the sidebar
* Swipe gestures on submissions and comments
* Custom font selection
* Native support for new Reddit image flairs (to replace the current CSS parsing implementation)
* A more reactive approach to Slide's app architecture

The current Slide codebase works, but there are a lot of areas for improvement that may result in a lot of changes in the backend code of Slide. Some major areas of development are needed in

* Using the new Kotlin JRAW library, which has some newer Reddit features implemented. Will require many changes to add in Slide-specific API features that the current JRAW fork contains and rewrites of large portions of the app to support the new Kotlin code
* Switching away from AsyncTasks to a Reactive framework
* Totally re-implementing the theme system to allow for customization of more UI aspects
* Re-engineering the display layouts to support live videos
* Re-engineering video code to be more extendable to more areas (like Shadowbox and link views)

Many of these things will take a lot of work to implement, so for the time being we are going to start pushing Alpha builds at least once a month, with a production build every 1-2 months assuming all goes well with the alphas. Huge thank you to u/timawesomeness for his recent additions to Slide, and u/tensouder54 for taking on organization of Slide issues on the GitHub page.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently undertaking a lot of projects in my personal life (a great internship at T-Mobile, event planning and marketing for local concerts around my university, and a year long senior design project for my undergrad degree), along with the iOS app taking up a lot of my free time, but once I get Slide iOS v3.0 out, I will have more free time to start implementing these things on Android. I will be discussing a more finite timeline with other contributors on our [Discord group](https://discord.gg/JXkDArg), if you would like to be updated on that progress!

&amp;#x200B;

The Slide iOS project has gone through four major updates in the last six months, and v3.0 is currently in beta testing over at r/slide_ios_beta (for anyone who maybe uses an iPad or other Apple device and wants to help test). In addition to this, I will be creating a new alpha-testing subreddit for Slide Android where those updates will be released and discussed!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for your amazing support of the Slide project, and I'm certain 2019 will bring lots of amazing things to both platforms :)

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers,

Like the title says, I graduated school in May 2018 and have been really struggling to get any footing with agencies since then. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt aware of how important internships were so as a result I don‚Äôt have much experience outside of on campus opportunities and in class projects. Initially I was applying to graduate internships and general internships in the hope of filling that experience gap before moving back to Chicago, but I was unsuccessful with those applications. As time went on I just moved to applying for normal entry level jobs in account services and media roles, but most of the entry level positions usually say 1-3 or 3-5 years experience. Which is a bit wild if you ask me. 

I have sent cover letters, tailored my resume to jobs, and also done a couple pretty big resume revamps throughout my search, and I feel like it looks really good for my current lack of experience, but I still barely get any calls back for interviews and most of my applications go unanswered. 

I have done a lot to get my name out there as well, like messaging recruiters on linked and asking friends and family to introduce me to people they know. Unfortunately these interactions tend to go nowhere and most of the messages and emails I send out are ignored. 

I have been reading a lot on here as well as /r/jobs and have been more proactive with applying early and often to jobs and companies I am passionate about with little success. 

In addition the only jobs I‚Äôm being contacted for is sales and direct marketing which ends up translating to an entrepreneurial door to door role that honestly sounds miserable. 

I guess my questions at this point are what else can I do to get my name out there and potentially get noticed? Is it time to just give up and say this industry isn‚Äôt for me? I really want to be in account services and I know I‚Äôd do a great job, it‚Äôs just so hard to get in the door at most places. Thanks in advance for reading and any advice you guys can give. "

University was 6 years ago for me. I got out of high school brimming with confidence that I would be a doctor one day. I  had a great resume with internships in hospitals,volunteer experiences and decent grades. I was shooting for the stars. 

Came university, i didnt let anything distract me. No games, no social life. I was focused on that dream no matter what. 

Then some bad shit crazy bitch came into my life. Let her in and ruined my focus. I got emotionally damaged and became vulnerable to anything. 

A friend got me into dota. 

It made me smile again, met new people etc. But in return, my university marks suffered. I lost all confidence in myself and just drowned all my worries in Dota. 

I was still able to graduate.. but med school  is a long shot now. All i wanted to do was to help people. Turns out im not  strong enough emotionally to do that. 

Now I just have a call center day job to help me pay my 60k student loan.

Gl to me I guess.

aqaqv4,6,2019-02-13,AITA for forgetting to bring our garbage cans back from the curb?,HappyRatRain,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aqaqv4/aita_for_forgetting_to_bring_our_garbage_cans/,"   For context: I [18m] live with my girlfriend [18f] and her step-mother and her father. 

This morning I woke up and there was a big text from my girlfriends step mom (Who we will call S for now) in a nutshell shell it says ‚ÄúHey good morning I need you to do something for me can you turn on the dryer, it was beeping all night.. and can you also pour our the water in the garbage cans and bring them down oh and by the way I have s package for you‚Äù the text is was longer than that but that was it. 

Now I had just woke up when I read that so I kept going on with my morning and don‚Äôt really think much of it at the moment. Later she gets back and texts me she has a package for me, naturally I go upstairs and get it (she doesn‚Äôt mention the trash cans to me at this point which I‚Äôm not sure why she didn‚Äôt) fast forward a few minutes and I have to take my girlfriend to her internship.

On the way out we see her shop-vacuuming our garage because it floods when it rains. She says ‚ÄúDo you remember me asking you last night if there was a lot of water and you said not too much, well a lot of stuff got wet down here. Also You forgot to bring down the garbage cans if the city sees us leave them out after 12 I could‚Äôve been fined (she had never told me this by the way) ,it‚Äôs pretty shitty that you come running up for a package but won‚Äôt help me, I need you to step up I have to go teach for 3 hours‚Äù again not exactly what she said but along those lines 

Now I know as an 18 year old living in their house that I should do pretty much any chore they ask. I just didn‚Äôt realize that you could get a fine for leaving a garbage can past 12 (which if hats what she started her text with I likely would‚Äôve done it as soon as I woke up). Also I feel like it wasn‚Äôt exactly a big deal. In case you‚Äôre wondering I did go shop-vac as much water as I could (no one has ever showed me how) when I got back because I kind of feel bad. 

So who is the asshole here. Am I an asshole? Are we both assholes? "
aqas0q,4,2019-02-13,"An Open letter to EA, Zaro, Corey, Yahsir, and anyone who will listen.",arlu3827,FIFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/aqas0q/an_open_letter_to_ea_zaro_corey_yahsir_and_anyone/,"I absolutely love this GAME SERIES, I love FIFA and I have bought this game every year since I could remember having a console to play it on. Football is the most influential cornerstone in my life, I've played it for 16 out of 19 years and it is still a major factor in my life having just accepted a D1 scholarship in the U.S. to play football while still being able to attain an education while dragging my ""career"" out 'till the very end. I would not be the same person today if football was not a gigantic part of my life. I love everything about football, what I don't love about football, is FIFA 19.

Fifa 19 in its current state is shambolic, glitchy, laggy, frustrating, disappointing and so many other adjectives I don't even know where to end. While it does have its highlights and definitive positives this edition, it has tons more negatives and parts of the game that hold it back from being the game that everyone is looking forward to. Lets start with the things that make FIFA 19 fantastic game.

**Card** **Content**

The card content in FIFA 19 has been fantastic, from the beginning of the game with the (then brand new) UCL cards and the brand new icons and everything else that has since been introduced (UCL/EL Live card, TOTGS, FUTMAS, FFS, HEADLINERS) has been great, period. These cards have added diversity into the game which allows you to make almost any squad out of the top 5-6 leagues in the world and allow you to compete at a high level. The cards allow this, the gameplay not so much. This part of FIFA is so integral and important to the idea of an ""Ultimate team"", its a video game, and to create an ""ultimate team"", YOUR ultimate team, is the most important part of the fantasy, in my eyes, EA's card design and content team have done a amazing job of this.

Now as with everything EA and FIFA, the greedy, money hungry side of both the studio and the publisher has to rear its ugly head. There has been a point this FIFA where people stop going ""ooooooooo"" and start going, ""oh...ok"", the magic has now seized in this iteration of FIFA for the time being. Community interaction is so important when it comes to content creation. EVERY OTHER MAJOR GAME STUDIO COMMUNICATES WITH ITS PLAYER-BASE. They take ideas from the player-base, they take feedback from the player-base, they take user created content and run with it as it PLEASES the community. Something that EA refuses to do. We know that EA ""listens"" to what people post on twitter and such, as seen with the new ""Optimus Prime Icons Promo"" that we all know was taken from @TheGreatFutsby. This was seen by Corey, Zaro, or whichever intern monitors the channels and sprinted it, full speed into the conference room screaming, ""We're gonna make so much money."" The eyes of the EA publishers and game heads turned into dollar signs as they realized they could make ""prime icons"", MORE ""prime."" And sure, we might be blessed with an SBC version of one of these cards, like Nakata or another lower-tier icon, and have to spend 700k to complete it as per usual.  Otherwise as history has shown it will be another, ""new team in packs, buy your points now before they're gone"" promo. This is not CONTENT, this is not something people can participate in as to play the game. CONTENT is what you get when you play the game, participate in the gameplay, enjoy the game you're playing. THE COMMUNITY WOULD RATHER SIT IN THE MENUS OF THE GAME THAN PLAY THE GAME ITSELF. This is a problem. This shows that the game is that bad, but the player-base is that hooked on the idea of a football game as to sit in the menus and wait until EA make the game good. I'll admit, I also do this most of the time, as with me and so many other people, we want this game to be good and playable, and we're willing to wait for it. EA just aren't willing to give it to us.

Now, as we know that EA does monitor the channels, we understand that they will only listen to those ideas which add onto their massive 1 Billion Dollar profit margin at the end of the year. We know that they will shrug aside any idea that adds content, a reason to play the game, a reason to grind out a game-mode. This was seen with FUT-stars. People gave them everything that they needed, the idea, the implementation, the progression, all that was needed was approval and a ""lets do it"" attitude. (maybe not just that, but it for sure could have been done through a triple-A multi-billion dollar gaming studio and publisher.) Instead we got THAT tweet from @YahsirQureshi, yea you know the one, the one where he sits us down, treats us like children and EXPLAINS how EA, EA OF ALL PEOPLE, does not have the coffers to finance such an undertaking, in the most condescending way possible, treating us like idiots who do not understand how much time, effort, dollars and approvals go into something like this. I guess it costs more than a billion dollars to implement a progression system into a sports game. If EA wanted to do it, they would do it. They know it wont make them money, so, they wont be doing it anytime soon. I wish that were false, if EA wish to prove me and 100,000 others wrong, be my guest, make my day. Content is so integral to FIFA 19, and EA was on a good path, but we know this new promo with the new ""dynamic images"" WHICH ONLY APPEAR 30% OF THE TIME, is a pure and utter cash grab. We know it, they know it.

**Gameplay**

""oh god, here we go."" I mutter to myself as I now have to relive everything that is not o.k. with FIFA 19 in terms of gameplay...Gameplay in FIFA 19 is awful, not going to sugarcoat it here, its bad. Malo. mal. Slecht. mau. It's not good. Frankly it's all over the place. From servers and connection to the way players interact with one another and the ball itself, it's barely a football game. This is the reason people would rather sit in the menus, trade low rated informs, theoretically invest for future SBC's or downright play other games. The problems with gameplay are vast and numerous, shooting, passing, and AI defending seem to take the cake in this new version of what is now FIFA 19.2, we have major problems with tuning and balancing of sliders with AI defending and the role that the AI plays when not being controlled by the player. Basic elements and properties of the game are not applied to the AI, things such as stamina which do not apply to AI making constant pressure great even in the 89th minute with the AI controlling the player, as the AI controls the player with 100% stamina all the time. AI blocking has become the bane of FIFA 19.2 now, its nigh impossible to get a shot off without 3/10 opposition players on the field laying their lives on the line to block the shot. Im not saying this is unrealistic, i'm saying that the AI controlled defender should not do more than the defender that the player is controlling.  Controlling your CDM's and running them back to the player who has broken their line should not be the way to play football while the AI controlled defense sit back on -1 depth and stay back while attacking blocking every shot that comes their way. Shooting is in the same boat, simply put, your shots do not go where you want them to go. Animations take too long to execute, and some inputs are downright ignored by the servers. If we could analyze the source in FIFA like in Rust or Counter Strike, i'm sure many inputs would be labeled as invalid or just not transmitted to the server. EA has successfully taken timed finesse shots out of the game, much to what their patch suggested, but they've done so in such a way as to screw up the whole game itself, there was 0 thought put into the decision to remove the effectiveness of timed finesses shots, while they were way too overpowered and tuned horribly, at-least it gave people a chance to score goals, now there is no constant, rewarding way to score goals without either the AI or bad mechanics screwing the player over, making people not want to play the game anymore.

People will say that ""EA did right"" or something along those lines and that the game is, ""better than its ever been, rewards good play, I score banging passing goals now, I feel fantastic."" 99% of these players are in the ""lower"" tiers of the game, div 4/5 and up. Rivals ranks 3+ in FUT are no longer fun, they're identical to the dreaded, cancerous Weekend League now with people playing on drop-back, counterattack, with 1 depth, as EA apparently intended, being the only way to play. Every time we as a community clip, screenshot, record, or show any evidence of this horrid gameplay, players missing the ball completely, players going out of their way to avoid the ball, or anything like that it is eventually swept under the rug by those channels we send the clips. Every tweet of bad gameplay is met with the dreaded and eventual, ""I'll show the gameplay dev team about this."" Or ""we are aware this is happening and are doing everything to solve it."" I.E. the one developer who has been tasked with remaining on FIFA 19 and ""correcting it"" instead of moving onto FIFA 20 in October like the 98% of the other developers for FIFA.

Gameplay is the most important thing for FIFA and EA to fix immediately, listen to the people who play the game as it is clear as day that none of your people do. Even the ""GaMe ChAnGErs"" that EA have appointed are being ignored and are essentially nothing more than content pushers as seen with the new ""Optimus Prime Icons promo."" Listen to the people who play the game, if we all agree that AI defending is op, from the streamers, to the Elite 1/top 100 players, the pros, the casuals, the gold 3 dad who plays twice a week, trust us, it's not a lie. It's not all in our head, it's broken, fix it.

The servers EA have allocated to FIFA are embarrassing, and they keep getting worse each year leading to speculation that they haven't increased their server space since FUT's inception back in 2010. This leads to many of the problems we have in game, from rubber banding, speedup lag, ball collision going all over the place, its not acceptable for a triple-A gaming franchise to consistently have server issues while knowing about them for years. This is one of the most important factors going into the second half of FIFA 19 and into FIFA 20, no one wants to play a game that feels slow, laggy, and overall sluggish. We've seen evidence this might be due to the transfer server and not generally the dedicated server itself, but as other companies have done in the past, i.e DOTA, RIOT, EPIC games, spend some of the 2 billion+ dollars you make every game cycle and purchase proxy servers for your servers to connect to, not the servers of the local internet company in Bulgaria or wherever the player is based. 

**Closing**

EA, we know this is your cash cow, your golden goose, the game that finances everything else that EA does as a publisher, from Anthem to parts of Apex legends (a fantastic example of what happens when EA backs off and allows a independent studio to develop a game.) You know that loot boxes are coming to an end with proposed legislation now in 5 different European countries, we know that wont stop you guys from implementing a battle pass every month to milk us out of more than the money we paid for a 60+$ game every year. Spending money for more ""content"" is not content, its a blatant cash grab, and you know it. We as a community deserve some respect, we deserve acknowledgment, an open forum to speak to developers and publisher alike. We're not asking for the wold here, were asking for a game that we all love to play, from the hardcore gamers to the casuals, the fanatics and the part time supporters, the plastic fans of City and Chelsea to the lifelong fans of ports mouth and Wimbledon, the Rangers and Celtic fans who hate each other to death but both love FIFA. We want to spend money on a good game, I have no problem giving money in FIFA points to a game that cares about its community and its player-base, I would love to support a studio and publisher who listen, but I refuse to until that starts happening. We deserve more than to be shrugged off, swept under the rug, condescendingly spoken to from your devs and content people. Thought of like obvious morons because we stick around and suffer the pain of playing an EA sports studios game year after year. ""Why not play another game?"" Those on the outside ask and plead to us as were smashing controllers and screaming at pixels at a screen, its because there's no other game like Football on earth, no other game like FIFA, and we're in it for the long haul, the question is are you?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR-The closing begging and pleading for EA and their communication channels to wake up and start talking to us, before it's all a bit too late. "

# Being better than who you were yesterday should be the bare minimum you strive for, because it doesn‚Äôt allow you to achieve what you‚Äôre fully capable¬†of.

And it doesn‚Äôt confirm you‚Äôre on the right path to begin with. On its own, ‚Äúcompare yourself to who you were yesterday‚Äù is only feel-good advice that has very little practical usefulness.

And that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs some rationality behind why we tend to compare ourselves to others. You can see in your physical or digital circle who the low achievers are and who the high achievers are‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägiving you the missing benchmark of effort and success. But in the end, it‚Äôs a terrible benchmark that will have devastating effects on your life.

# Comparing Yourself to Others Leads You to False¬†Paths

In 2009, I was introduced to and befriended a very successful guy who day traded for a living. I didn‚Äôt know anything about the world of finance, but seeing the success he had and hearing how much he would make in any given day was exhilarating. **As time went on, my benchmark for effort and success expanded to include his. I began to compare what I had achieved to him. ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù now meant nothing short of what he had achieved.**

I told myself I needed to do everything I could to achieve that level of success. I decided to learn how to be a day trader and I went so far as to sell my dream car to get the cash to do it. With studying and his mentorship, I started to make a few hundred dollars per week. As my confidence and greed grew, I became less risk-averse. **Half a year later, my losses totaled close to $10k.** I closed my account and threw my dreams of riches and day trading out the window.

When I started to compare myself to him, and what I had to what he had, it led me to abandon my path and join the path that made him successful. I never had any prior interest in stocks or studied the financial markets. I was just chasing the money and that led to disaster.

# Using others as a benchmark for success can lead to conformity‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit can take you away from what you‚Äôre happy and good at doing and put you on a false path‚Ää‚Äî‚Äächasing money, status, or attention.

This is a never ending trap. There will always be someone to compare yourself to with more money, more status, and more fame that will lead you off your path.

&gt;*‚ÄúEveryone gets one life. Yours is almost used up, and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls of¬†others.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚Äî* *Marcus Aurelius, Meditations*

# Understand Fate and Luck Always Play a Significant Role in Someone‚Äôs Success

Each one of us is a completely unique individual with a unique genetic makeup. We‚Äôre all raised by different people, with different values, and in different environments‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of which significantly impact our character and what we do in life.

People will shout, ‚Äúyou can do anything you set your mind to‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just need to work harder‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not sacrificing enough.‚Äù Nat Eliason made some noise when he called out Gary Vaynerchuk as an example of someone who does this in a piece he wrote titled [*No More ‚ÄúStruggle Porn.‚Äù*](https://medium.com/@nateliason/no-more-struggle-porn-202153a01108)

# While we do need to have ruthless discipline to reach our greatest potential, we cannot ignore the limits imposed on us by the cards we‚Äôre dealt or we will forever be dissatisfied with who we are and what we‚Äôve accomplished.

Here‚Äôs another reason why it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare ourselves to others: luck. **No one‚Äôs success is ever only down to luck, but we can‚Äôt ignore the role luck plays in success as an ‚Äú*****x*****‚Äù factor‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs unmanageable and unpredictable.** The only thing in your control is to continually put yourself in positions to catch lucky breaks. And remember: luck is not distributed evenly.

In a Q&amp;A with White House interns, President Obama gave advice on the subject luck has with success and what to focus on instead:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=516&amp;v=5IDQDoxXHm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=516&amp;v=5IDQDoxXHm0)

&gt;*‚ÄúA lot of times, it‚Äôs just happenstance. Or things work out. But being useful? And having a satisfying life? And making a contribution? That is entirely within your control. Orient yourself towards having an impact and making a difference. And you will and you‚Äôll be happy doing¬†it.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚Äî President Barack¬†Obama*

# Instead of Comparing Yourself to Others Or Who You Were Yesterday, Find Your True¬†Path

Productivity is worthless if you‚Äôre on a false path. Your goal and motivation shouldn‚Äôt be about just being the best or better than the people in your circles, but creating something useful that can make a difference in peoples‚Äô lives and your community. This is the truest benchmark for success and effort.

&gt;*‚ÄúPeople who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven when hard at¬†work.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚Äî* *Marcus Aurelius, Meditations*

Your true path is doing what you were made for‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat you feel you have an inclination and natural ability for. This inclination is a reflection of your unique genetic code, deep underlying preferences for particular activities or forms of expression. When you find your true path, you‚Äôll be less inclined to compare your success with someone else. **You will quickly realize their path isn‚Äôt a good fit for you.** And you won‚Äôt be as inclined to envy their money, attention, or whatever, because craving those things is a false path.

&gt;*‚ÄúIn the end, the money and success that truly last come not to those who focus on such things as goals, but rather to those who focus on mastery and fulfilling their Life‚Äôs¬†Task.‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚Äî* *Robert Greene,¬†Mastery*

The need to compare yourself to others is restrained when you‚Äôre happy and comfortable with who you are, which comes from being on your true path and working on your Life‚Äôs Task. You will no longer envy other peoples‚Äô success and happiness, and you will instead be laser-focused on your own work.

&gt;*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt aim at success‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one‚Äôs dedication to a cause greater than oneself‚Ä¶‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚Äî Viktor Frankl, Man‚Äôs Search for¬†Meaning*

But you can‚Äôt be disciplined, happy, and confident all the time. I‚Äôve made journaling a daily habit of mine to give myself the opportunity to reflect on and ground my thoughts. It‚Äôs an exercise that has helped me live a more level-headed and purposeful life.

Comparing yourself to others is a recipe for disaster. Comparing yourself to who you were yesterday is a recipe for passivity. Life is not about being better than other people. It‚Äôs not about achieving more than people in our circles. **Life is about being useful to others.**

&gt;*‚ÄúIgnoring what goes on in other people‚Äôs souls‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno one ever came to grief that way. But if you won‚Äôt keep track of what your own soul‚Äôs doing, how you can you not be unhappy?‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*‚Äî* *Marcus Aurelius, Meditations*

I originally [published this on Medium](https://theascent.pub/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others-644e6a82bf48). You can find more of my writing on productivity and work there.

# TLDR

Comparing yourself to others doesn't make sense because we're all different genetically, grew up in different environments, raised by different people, etc. Comparing yourself to who you were yesterday also doesn't make sense, because it's too easy. It's really easy to be just a little bit better than yesterday and it doesn't help you reach what you're capable of. So the best thing is not to compare yourself with anyone at all, but to measure your progress on a goal outside of yourself - by how much you're being useful and helping your community.

aqbrem,4,2019-02-13,A summary of the first act of my JW rewrite.,TheGeekyZoologist,JurassicPark,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/aqbrem/a_summary_of_the_first_act_of_my_jw_rewrite/,"Like I mentioned in other posts, I began working on a retelling of JW three years ago and at the current state, it's around 500 pages long. According to my estimations, it will be finished this summer, the french version at least (I don't think I'm bad in English so the writing of an english version is not impossible for me, it will be quite a big undertaking however and help might be needed). I've shared a link on this subreddit months ago (topic : [https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/8ftjqo/a\_link\_to\_the\_first\_two\_thirds\_of\_my\_novelform\_jw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/8ftjqo/a_link_to_the_first_two_thirds_of_my_novelform_jw/)), where the first two acts of the story are featured (the first half of the third one have been completed on the meanwhile). Near the end of this month, I will put another link for the updated version of Act I, II and a big chunk of Act III (up to Chapter XV) 

 

Here's are the main changes from the movie and some of its features :

\- Increased length, more akin to an epic movie ([https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicMovie)) than your average summer blockbuster.

\- A more adult and darker tone, similar to Crichton novels or HBO's Westworld. While most of Act I is quite kid friendly with the park's visit and the characters introduction, the same can't be said for the latter parts of Act II and Act III in its entirety, espacially for some scenes of the latter due to their harsh nature.

\- More accurate animals even though if the species introduced in the previous installments keep their appearence while the concept of different versions is discussed in one of the scenes.

\- A larger cast and bestiary.

\- A different esthetic for the park. While the most remote parts of it have a safari feel akin to what can be seen in Universal's Parks or Jurassic Park itself, the main hub is a ancient-looking city called Burroughs and whose architecture have heavy precolombian and Spanish revival style inspirations.

\- Although it is mostly based on JW, it also includes some elements from Fallen Kingdom.

\- A 3 Acts structure like I mentioned earlier, with a prologue set at the beginning of the construction of JW in the early 2000's and an epilogue heavily inspired by one of the original novel scenes.

***Prologue : The End of a Reign***

&gt;!After an opening scroll describing what happened after the San Diego incident and explaining the reasons behind the construction of Jurassic World, the story opens in some misty tropical rainforest and we witness a boa constrictor being preyed upon by an harpy eagle. The bird brings its prey at the top of a large tree and begins to eat but suddenly, a helicopter emerges from the mist, flying very close to the canopy. Said helicopter is actually searching somekind of large creature in the jungle. When the shooter onboard spots its, he informs a ground team about this. !&lt;

&gt;!On the ground, a small group of vehicles (the same thant the one used by the hunters in TLW) drives quickly. From a cage which top one of the vehicles, Hoskins lead the operation. He orders his men to stop in a small meadow and to wait for the target which is coming in their direction. As their target, a very large animal, emerges from the jungle, he orders the activation of a ultrasound-producing box. As the animal is bothered by the ultrasound and flees, Hoskins get a glimpse of it while its tails brush past the top of the cage, their target is non other than an adult T.rex. Hoskins order his men to follow the dinosaur and to force him to head in a certain direction. A jeep gets too close to the jaws of the T.rex and angered, the animal rams the vehicle with his head and the jeep barely escape the attack but doing so, it rolls on a big root and crashes. 
Inside the helicopter, the hunter put darts in his rifle and aims at the T.rex as it is heading towards a field. He misses his shot the first time but as the dinosaur is now in the open, he has a clearer view and this time he succesfully manage to tranquilise the animal which roars. The vehicles exit the jungle and circles the dinosaur, preventing it to go back into the jungle and the hunters wait for the tranquilizer to act.
The body of the dinosaur is then put into a large truck by a flying crane. The vehicles used in the hunt are parked next to the truck and the hunters are relaxing while a documentalist is filming them and the tranquilised T.rex. Hoskins congratulates his men for the successful capture. They leave the area, escorting the transport truck, while passing next to decaying electrical fences and driving on one of Jurassic Park‚Äôs roads, now partially covered by grass. The Convoy enter the Embrace, a large U-shaped Valley (where the Gallimimus Stampede was witnessed by Grant and the kids in JP), heading towards a tunnel dug in the mountains. They enter and the vehicle emerges in a forested area but as one part of the road was taken away by a landslide, the convoy leave the road and exit the forest. As they are crossing a hilly zone, the documentalist takes her camera to photograph the skeleton of a brachiosaur as the convoy drive past it. Another skeleton is half-sunked in a waterhole and the convoy head towards the south-east, driving past cliffs overlooking a river called the Cartago.
A few minutes later, they arrives at a bridge spanning the Rio Iris gorge and pass a portal guarded by armed men. As they are heading towards their destination, they see workers building some construction at the top of a rocky spur. The convoy descends into a valley and arrives in a construction site extending over dozens of hectares where workers and cranes are being busy around the skeleton of large buildings or digging a giant mine-looking hole in the middle of the site.  The vehicles split up and the transport truck heads towards a complex delimited by giants walls. While Hoskins is talking with a cheerful Masrani at the other end of the telephonic line, the T.rex is being put in a quarantine paddock connected to its future paddock, still under construction. Nothing seems to threaten Jurassic World's construction. !&lt;

&gt;!Night fall and work stop for the day. On a ridge north of the Rio Iris, a female proceratosaurus is watching the camp. She then journeys accross the island back to the lair of her clan, located in the decaying jurassic park visitor center. Among the labs, several nests were built and next to one of them, the mate of the proceraotsaure awaits and together, they watch the first eggs of their clutch hatch. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

***Chapter I : A Long Expected Journey***

&gt;!The chapter starts with Zach and Gray arrival in Costa Rica on the 23rd December 2017. They board into a bus at Juan Santamari√† Airport in San Jos√©, travel to the Pacific Coast and stops at Caldera, a port near Puntarenas, where they enter into a ferry terminal owned by Ogen Cruiselines, one of Masrani‚Äôs Global subsidiaries. There, the two brothers board into the largest ship of the company‚Äôs fleet, a 200 m+ ferry named The Avalon. When it leaves the harbour, it‚Äôs around midnight and the journey to Nublar taking between six and seven hours, the boys spend the night in their cabin. !&lt;

&gt;!They awoke the following morning before dawn. As Gray is walking the Avalon‚Äôs promenade deck, the ship enters into a thick veil of mist and passes near huge tower-like rock formations. As passengers are gathering on the bow, Isla Nublar slowly appears. The Avalon follow the southern coast of the island northward, heading to the Ferry Terminals, between the coast and a mountain. The passengers disembarks and inside said building, they take a metro that drives them through the mountain overlooking the terminal. ¬† 
They exit the cave and stumble into a narrow pass between the mountain‚Äôs spurs. At the end of the pass, their way is blocked by a massive wall that looks straight out of King Kong in their eyes, with a huge gate at its center, flanked by two massive tyrannosaur heads sculpts. A recorded voice, provided in-universe by one certain famous sci-fi actress, greets the newly arrived guests as an orchestral music with choirs plays. 
The gate finally opens, letting the visitors enter into the park. Behind the gate is Hammond‚Äôs Plaza, whose name is drawn from the statue of John Hammond that stands at its center. While Zach meets Zara, Gray goes to the panoramic viewpoint at the end of the plaza, overlooking Burroughs and the 25 hectares lagoon around which the city was built but also giving a view on a large part of the island, including the Cartago Valley, the Misty Monts and, at the northern end of the island, Mont Sibo. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

***Chapter II : The Eighth Wonder of the World***

 &gt;!After they drop their luggage at their aunt‚Äôs house, the boys are bringed by to the Eastern Boardwalk. Since they have to met Claire in the volcano-shaped Discovery Center, they must take said boardwalk and Richard Owen Avenue, both featuring quite a number of shops and restaurants. As they walk in the busy avenue, the crowd in front of them make way to somekind of old-fashioned tramway but instead of being drawn by horses like in Disneyland, they are by mantellisaurs. Stepping out of the mantellisaurs and carriage‚Äôs way, they proceed and reach the Obelisk Plaza, cross it and reach the stairs leading to the bronze gates of the Discovery Center, guarded by two life-size giraffatitans stone statues. 
Entering the building, they head to the spacious rotunda, which main feature is a huge squatch field sized model of Isla Nublar. Claire arrives, chatting with two of her colleagues about the press conference scheduled for the same morning and complaining about a certain Henry. Once the conversation is done, she greets her nephews and talks briefly with them, telling them that since she will be busy all day, she is the park director after all, Zara will watch over them.!&lt;

&gt;!Following Claire‚Äôs advices, the brothers begins their tour by the zoo. They visit the Children‚Äôs Zoo, encountering and feeding with a special kind of granule avimimi, kunbarassaurs, hypsilophodonts and the juveniles of the largers herbivores that populate other attractions, including young ceratopsians which children can ride like shetland ponies ; have a glimpse of a presentation show where a zookeeper feeds a dimorphodon with mice ; passes next to the pachyrhinosaurs enclosure and walks after straight ahead to the Tyrannosaur‚Äôs Kingdom. 
As Gray watch the T.rex feeding, he notices that Zach is texting and Zara is on her phone, seeming to not pay attention the superpredator that is in front of their eyes, underlining the idea that watching live prehistoric creatures have became an experience not too dissimlar from watching a movie in 3D or riding a rollercoaster. This serves as a good transition to the beginning of the next chapter. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

***Chapter III : Panem Et Circenses***

 &gt;!We come back to Claire as she is in the middle of the press conference that was mentioned earlier, It‚Äôs purpose is to discuss about the future of Jurassic World, including the development of its franchise (two others parks are planned to be built in Mediterranea and Southern China) and the direction that the Isla Nublar park will take. She mentions the phenomena of the normalization of cloned prehistoric animals in modern society, explaining that millions of people have seen them live at least once in their lifetime since the opening of Jurassic World, they are all over the internet, and InGen is selling animals to zoos and aquarias worldwide. That brings her to pretend that they need something very unique for their next new attraction, a man-made dinosaur species : The Indominus rex. In a short video, the attraction name is revealed : The I.rex Colosseum, scheduled to open in July 2018.
Claire turns to Wu and he answers some of the journalists questions before playing an explanatory video featuring Mr DNA and himself in which they delivers a vulgarization of the process that aims to create entirely new species from scratch. The conference proceeds and ends around 11 a.m. !&lt;

&gt;!Leaving the Discovery Center like all the attendants to the conference, Claire brings along with her the envoys of a potential sponsor and they drive out of Burroughs, passing near the Administration building, sitting on the top of a rocky spur like a fortress or a monastery, before entering into a canyon that leads to an helipad at the base of a tall waterfall, the same one that was used in the time of Jurassic Park. Claire and the envoys waits there for the helicopter that will take them to the Colosseum and it lands shortly after. They notice that Simon Masrani is flying the aircraft, he greets them and Claire, surprised by his unexpected visit. 
They take off and the helicopter then heads north-east first, flying over apatosaurs and corythosaurs drinking in the Rio Iris gorges as one of the Jungle Cruise boats floating down the river and later, in the middle of the Cartago river, a group of baryonyx feasting on the arapaimas that zookeepers on the upper deck of one of the boats are feeding to them. They then bypass the Cartago Aviary, the largest in the whole world, encompassing over twenty hectares and being 200 meters tall at the top of its geodesic dome, and housing several pterosaurs species like geosternbergia, rhamphorhynchus and tupandactylus in a spectacular lush gorge and waterfalls environment. 
After a passage near the northern summit of the Misty Monts, the helicopter turns west, fly over a group of therizinosaurs, and enters the Embrace (a.k.a Kaaawa Valley for those familiar with the saga‚Äôs filming locations) where they see some safari trucks and herds of several dinosaurs, including dryosaurs, gallimimi, triceratops, parasaurolophuses and two mamenchisaurs near which the envoys sees a small group of riders wearing dark green-grey uniforms and watching over the dinosaurs and groups of tourists in the trucks. 
Masrani turns north and flies over one of the mountainous range encompassing the valley, heading first towards Mount Sibo. As they behold the desolate landscape at the volcano‚Äôs foot, one of the envoy ask Claire if they fear the effects of an eruption. She reassure them by saying they have taken every precaution recommended by the consulted volcanologists (i.e digging trenches to prevent fluid lava flows from reaching key installations), that a minor eruption in 2006 have actually attracted people on the island, and telling them that the volcano provides over sixty pourcent of their energy through the geothermal power plant. She points the Colosseum and Masrani lands shortly after on the margins of the construction site.!&lt;

&gt;!They joins at its entrance Claire‚Äôs colleagues, Wu and the journalists. As they all heads towards the enclosure itself, not located in the colloseum which is only the show area but located further away, encompassing a cirque, Claire and Masrani talks about the conflicts Park Management have with the Grey Guard, saying that if they have delays it‚Äôs because of them. The group then meets with Jonas, head zookeeper and large theropods curator, and while he talks to it about the enclosure and its denizen, Claire goes to see what captain Katashi Hamada, the commanding officer of the Grey Guard‚Äôs garrison on Nublar and who was waiting for them alongside Jonas, wants from her. Once again, he ask the park director about the large security bunkers needed according to him and his colleagues in case of large-scale disaster. She tells him that they will see that after the press tour and she comes back to the group who has spotted howler monkeys in the enclosure. They are scattered away by a roar from the I.rex. The chimera dinosaur stay hidden behind the thick vegetation of the enclosure. Masrani asks about the second specimen cloned and Claire answers that she was devoured by her sister. The I.rex being the subject of some not-so pleasing surprises, Masrani worries a bit and asks her about Owen Grady‚Äôs opinion on the matter. 
The press tour of the colosseum concludes with a test showing. Masrani, Claire, the envoys and Wu take place in the vip lodge as the groups sit on regular bleachers. ¬†Amovible walls and roof began to move, obscurating the sunlight and plunging the arena in total darkness. A portcullis is lift up, letting the I.rex enters the arena. Spotlights project the I.rex shape on the audience. !&lt;

&gt;!We cut to the achillobators training scene. It plays very much like in the movie and just like in it, it‚Äôs followed by a debate between on one side Owen and Barry, and on the other Hoskins but here, informations on competition existing between InGen and other biotech companies are given (Among other things, a safari park housing animals from the ice age and situated near Toula in Russia is mentioned). During the conversation, Owen receives a text message from Claire, asking where and when she can meet him later in the evening. Again like in the movie, Leon falls from the walkway into the enclosure, albeit in a different manner, but in this version, Owen orders him to stay behind him and they slowly back away from the raptors, following behaviours and gestures that are adopted by nature guides in Africa when confronted to lions and other dangerous game. Owen and Leon manage to leave the enclosure unharmed but the former reprimand the latter, telling him to show himself more cautious the next time before asking him to pay his and Barry‚Äôs beers in the evening as a retribution. Hoskins muses about the way Grady managed to have, in his eyes, control over the achillobators. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

***Chapter IV : Sunset O'er Isla Nublar***

&gt;!Claire, Masrani and co returns to Burroughs where an contract with the envoys is signed. Before going back to her office, claire pass by the control room for a daily checking. She have a debate with Lowery about the I.rex and the sponsoring around her.!&lt;

&gt;!Zach and Gray attends the mosasaur feeding show and once it‚Äôs over, as the bleachers brought them down below the lagoon surface, they meet up with Zara and visit the oceanarium, made of not only the mosasaur lagoon but also other lagoons that together forms the big lagoon, separated from one another by barrier reefs that converges towards an underwater mountain located at the very center of the lagoon called Mount Thetis, which houses aswell the submarine tour base. 
After walking through subaquatic tunnels and viewing galleries, the trio goes back to the surface and passes in front of the nothosaurs enclosure. While Gray is petting henodus in a touching pool (similar in design to the ones that exists in many aquarias and marine animals parks over the world), Zach gets a phone call from their mother, Karen.!&lt;

&gt;!After being told by Zach that Claire is not with them, Karen phones then to her half-sister, then working in her office, and they argue about this and other family matters. ¬†They coldly ends the conversation and Claire decides to go out on the attenant balcony to relax herself, overlooking Burroughs as she drinks sips of some alcohol glass. !&lt;

&gt;!Near 5 p.m, Wu arrives at the hilltop Masrani‚Äôs hacienda and him and the indian billionaire talks about the day, with Masrani‚Äôs preasing the indominus and Wu‚Äôs efforts. They then sits in the terrace and drinks tea as the sun sets and dinosaurs come to drink at a nearby lake. The two soon have a conversation about Wu‚Äôs proposal to update some of the oldest species cloned by InGen and begin to slowly replace the old versions individuals by others from new and more scientifically-accurate versions (a scene which is very inspired by the version 4.4 chapter from Crichton‚Äôs novel where Wu and Hammond discusses on the same subject). Both debate, with Masrani showing himself reluctant and saying that reaching scientific accuracy is nothing but delusion since new discoveries will make current representions obsolete, making the pursuit of this ideal a never-ending race. Once their conversation on that subject is over, they drink to the park‚Äôs prosperity and the future success of the I.rex as an attraction.!&lt;

&gt;!In the I.rex enclosure, an old howler monkey is left behind by his troop. As he tries to flee, the I.rex catches and eat it.  !&lt;

***Chapter V : The Merry Iguanodon***

&gt;! Night has fallen over Isla Nublar but while the animals areas had been closed for most of them, the park is not yet devoid of activity, far from it as both guests and employees goes to dine and entertain themselves in Burroughs restaurants, bars and other leisure places for the evening. Claire is dining with her nephews in the Winston‚Äôs steakhouse. While Gray is in the toilets, Claire tells Zach about her conversation with their mother. When they exit the restaurant, Claire ask Gray if he wants to go to the cinema but he declines, saying that he is tired, but the oldest of the brothers that he will stay a bit longer in the area and ask her aunt if there is some nice bar there. She recommends the Merry Iguanodon, where she have to meet Owen a bit later. 
As Claire bring Gray back to her house, Zach wanders around the Obelisk Plaza, the large pond east of the Discovery Center, the facilities located under the Grand Nublarian Hotel overlooking said pond (among them there is a casino and a cinema multiplex), the Eastern Boardwalk. Following Claire‚Äôs indications, he founds the Merry Iguanodon tavern and enters it. Zara bump into him there and she apologizes for the distant behaviour she had with the brothers. Lowery and Vivian, who are friends with Zara, arrives and Zara asks Zach if he wants to join them. He accept and while heading towards them, they pass next to Leon, who is telling his fellow interns his near-death experience with the achillobators. Barry appears in his back and reminds him that he must pay two beers. Leon complies, brings the beers at Owen and Barry‚Äôs table and takes his leave from them. The two zookeepers then talks about the potential reasons behind Claire‚Äôs need to talk to Owen. Claire arrives in time and she and Owen go outside, while her assistant, the two control room technicians and Zach discretly watches them. After losing a game, Zara have tell to Zach the story of Claire and Owen‚Äôs secretive but intense relationship. !&lt;

&gt;!While talking about Masrani‚Äôs request, Claire and Owen goes to the lower terrace and stops there, as a sound and light show takes place on the previously mentioned pond. They end up arguing a bit about the flingy relationship they had a couple of years earlier but they soon focuses back to the inspection requested by Masrani and agrees on a rendezvous time at the colosseum for the following morning, when the I.rex will be subject to an operation whose purpose is to implant into her a new tracking implant. They wish a good evening to eachother and Claire leaves.
We come back to Zach, Zara, Lowery and Vivian as they still talk about the latter three‚Äôs boss affair with the raptor‚Äôs whisperer. !&lt;

&gt;!Hamada and two other guards, the Forrester couple, arrives after and go upstrair in a separated room where a non-negligeable part of Nublar‚Äôs garrison are off-duty and relaxing. While Hamada sits with the other officers and join them in their game of cards, the two Forresters go to meet the five recruits that incorporated the guard this year. One of them being the niece of a lieutenant stationed in the Five Deaths, they pass her uncle‚Äôs greetings to her. 
Hamada tells his colleagues that Claire informed him that it will be a no for the bunkers he recommanded. The other officers are disappointed and displeaded by the news. 
After a game of darts, the Forresters and the recruits sits and the couple tells them more about the Five Deaths and the reasons that push soldiers and forces of order members from all over the world to serve in the Grey Guard. 
The manager of the Merry Iguanodon, Lambert Ross, enters the room and asks what Hamada and the Forresters want to drink. They order but when a waiter arrives with the drinks, a tremor. Being of small to medium magnitude, it‚Äôs not strong enough to do any signficant damage and Central America being quite a geologically active region, most of the people on the island aren‚Äôt that worried despite being surprised. However, when Roberta unleashes a powerful but plaintive roar, echoeing in all of Burroughs and its valley, Hamada worries since the T.rex didn‚Äôt do the same thing before the 2006 small eruption. Sharing with the others the signs they witnessed (odd behaviour from the wildlife and the park‚Äôs denizens, worrisome readings coming from the Geothermal Power Plant‚Ä¶), many guards fears than a larger eruption is set to happen soon. Durant, one of the recruits, think it will be the end of the island but Glenmore reassures her by saying that the Sibo isn‚Äôt the Santorini‚Äôs volcano, Mt St Helens or the Krakatoa while another guard, an amerindian costarican who knows a lot about Nublar‚Äôs history, mentions that despite having entering into eruption several times across history, Nublar didn‚Äôt exploded or sank into the ocean, and that the only victims of the Sibo were spanish settlers who built their colony, San Fernandez, a bit too close from the volcano. Said colony was destroyed at the end of the 16th century and it being located not too far from where the I.rex Colloseum is being built, the officers fear that the trench whose purpose is to protect the attraction from any lava flows will not be completed in time, making the evacuation of the I.rex a possibility. The I.rex having a bad reputation among the guards, some states that they will let her die if that happen and rants about the Park Management desire to display the largest and viciousest beasts that they can make because they are the one who attracts people on the island. 
Lambert tells them that Masrani and Park Management have became too confident over time and that most park executives ignores what exactly had to be made to make Isla Nublar safe again. He reveals to the recruits that he worked before as an henchman for InGen Security. He narrates the aftermath of Roberta‚Äôs capture, stating that this event wroke havoc among the already fragile ecosystem of Nublar by allowing the smaller carnivores, whose populations were kept in check by the T.rex, to multiply and eat all the herbivores that weren‚Äôt captured before turning themselves to the most abundant kind of meat on the island, manflesh. Lambert tells that one night, a horde of proceratosaurs raided InGen‚Äôs camp, killing many people and snatching others, This attack marked the beginning of a series of conflicts opposing InGen to the feral predatory dinosaurs : The Saurian War. During that ¬´ war ¬ª, Lambert was badly wounded (he limps and have one eye hidden behind an eyepatch) and spended the rest of the it in an hospital bed. His wounds were inflicted by one of the infamous three gorgons, a trio of dilophosaurs, whose venom half-blinded him. Aside from the three gorgons who were shot after weeks of tracking and some of the herrerasaurs who were captured and integrated into Jurassic World collection, Lambert ignores what happend precisely to the proceratosaurs. Some of them were indeed captured aswell to be put for the rest of their lives in the quarantaine paddocks and still lives but they were only a fraction of their population. How InGen Security dealt with the others is still a mystery and all related informations are classified.
After telling his story, Lambert leaves and the guards goes back to what they were doing before the tremor.  !&lt;

***Chapter VI : A Dragon's awakening***

&gt;! Near half past seven on the morning of Christmas Eve, Lowery goes to work on his bicycle while humming the main theme of Terry Gilliam‚Äôs Brazil. He is the first of the control room‚Äôs day team to arrive and when Vivian and the rest of his colleagues arrives, he talks with her and some of them about their plans for the evening. Meanwhile, the I.rex is being tranquilised.!&lt;

&gt;!We then follows Owen as he drives north on his motorbike, towards the Colosseum. He arrives there and meets up with Claire. They enter the construction site and while theye enter the Colosseum and climbs the bleachers, they talk about the I.rex genetic composition and Owen can‚Äôt help but to make fun of many things concerning the chimera dinosaur before warning Claire about the ethical drifts that the I.rex creation can create and the fact that they don‚Äôt exactly know how her physiology works (they talk mainly about the choosen amount of tranq administrated to the I.rex with Owen stating the same thing that Muldoon says in the novel concerning the amount of tranquiliser to choose with large animals). They arrive near the entrance of the surveillance room, guarded by Darbinian, where he must join Jonas and some of the guards (Brunet, Tian and Velasquez in addition to Darbinian) to start the inspection, wish to eachother merry christmas and he heads to the room. Darbinian lets him pass and he finds Jonas and Brunet finishing their breakfast and the two forementioned recruits drinking coffee. He greets them and as he is pouring himself some coffee, Darbinian teases him about the rumors concerning his relationship with Claire. Owen then asks Jonas and Brunet how the I.rex is and they answers by listing some negative adjectives. Once they are ready, Brunet orders Darbinian to stay in the room and Tian and Velasquez to come with them. They goes down to the I.rex lair where Owen sees gnawed-on bones. Jonas explains him that when the I.rex is fed carcasses, she took them to the lair where she rapidly eat them before gnawing the bones during hours. He leaves Owen and the guards to the inspection and goes to the holding area, where the I.rex is being operated in her indoor enclosure.!&lt;

&gt;!The veterinarian administrate the I.rex, whose body is covered with a surgical drape, an anesthetic at the base of the neck, where the tracking device is to be implanted. But as he is ready to cut the skin and the flesh there, he notices that they left the needed hand circular saw in their ambulance. One of his two assistants proposes himself to go to the ambulance and bring it back.!&lt;

&gt;!Owen and the guards arrive to the enclosure wall and sees the claws marks on the wall. They tell him that the I.rex often does this, sometimes in front of the guards standing in the miradors, like if she wanted to provock them that way. They head to the wooded area of the enclosure.!&lt;

&gt;!As she is looking over the I.rex health record, the assistant that remained with the vet shares with him her concerns, stating that the weight she gaine and her current appetite is abnormally higher from what they expected. The vet ask her if she thinks the I.rex is pregnant before saying it‚Äôs ridiculous. They mention the eggs found in the ruins of Jurassic Park during the 1994 expedition and the consequences of the inclusion of west african frog DNA inside the dinosaurs genomes. ¬†The assistant brings the idea that the potential offspring of the I.rex might be the result of a parthenogenetic process and adds that since Wu didn‚Äôt reveal the integrality of the I.rex genomic composition, they don‚Äôt know if he made another mistake by including the DNA of some species able to reproduce itself through parthenogenesis. ¬†The vet reassures her assistant by promising her they will do the necessary tests the next month if that can take away her concerns.!&lt;

&gt;!In the wooded part of the enclosure, Owen finds a howler‚Äôs monkey paw and deduces that it was devoured by the I.rex. Tian wonder why the I.rex had done that since monkeys are way too small to be considered as suitable preys for a dinosaur of her size. Owen answers by stating that she doesn‚Äôt do that to feed herself, but in a distraction purpose. He then recapitulates everything they have seen until now and admits to the guards that he is against displaying the I.rex to the public. Brunet proposes him that they go the indoor enclosure to see how things are going there and he agrees.!&lt;

&gt;!His other assistant had return on the meanwhile with the hand circular saw on the meanwhile, the vet begin to cut the I.rex skin with but suddenly, a malfunction in the ventilation creates a strong draft that sends sheets flying all over the place. The same assistant that brought back the saw is charged by the other to pick them all. He does this but the other assistant tells him that one of the sheet had slid under the drape, next to their patient head. The assistant goes under the drap and notices that the sheet went under the jaws. He tries to lift them up and not without efforts, he manages to pull the sheet out but after he launched a scream of satisfaction, he hears the I.rex opening one of her eyes. 
Paralysed by fear, he tries to move or scream to warn his colleagues but can‚Äôt do it properly and the I.rex raise her upper lip, revealing her rows of teeth. He finally screams and the vet makes out for the door but a tail swing push him to the ground. One of the zookeepers that was watching the operation at the other side of the enclosure heavy railings, rushes to a panel on the wall to push an alarm button, warning everyone in the vicinity and the control room at the other end of the island. The other assistant rushes to pull out her colleague far as possible from the I.rex head but when she grabs him, the chimera closes her jaws around the lower half of his body, letting the upper half to his victim‚Äôs colleague who screams in terror and panicks. 
While the drap is still covering her, the I.rex stands up. The vet put himself quickly on his feet but seeing that the I.rex stands between him and the man-sized gate in the railing, he exits the enclosure right into the tunnel that connects the arena to the enclosures and taken before by the assistant when he went outside, rushing to the door at is other end. When the zookeepers came back with electroshocking ammo rifles, he is too far away to be within earshot. Grady and the guards arrive aswell and the first go inside the enclosure to get the remaining assistant out of there as Jonas and another zookeeper, standing between the gate and the I.rex, shot on the exposed body parts of the predator. She repels the two zookeepers out the enclosure with a tail blow and swiftly turns, making the medical devices attached to her flies over Owen and the assistant who are forced to crouches down to avoid getting hit, before closing the gate and ramming it with her head to break it and trap Owen and the assistant with her. The two runs to the tunnel, heading towards the same normal-sized gate to which the vet headed. 
The latter had arrived before it but as he is looking for the keys that open it, he reminds that he gave to the assistant who still had them when the I.rex ripped him in half. The beast roaring at the two humans that are running away from her, the vet fears for his life and through a panel, opens a larger gate in which the small one is integrated and big enough to let trucks pass through. But as he flees outside, he forgets to engage the closing process. Seeing this, Brunet contacts the control room and orders the technicians to close it but Lowery, fearing that he will trap Owen and the assistant by doing so, heavily hesitate. However, the closing process is still engaged. A CCTV footage that Darbinian has done this from the surveillance room in the Colloseum. ¬†
Owen and the assistant are still running but suddenly the latter collapses on the ground, with a lot of blood pouring out of a wound on her throat. Wondering how the I.rex was able to inflict said wound from a distance, Owen accelerates and rushes out of the tunnel as the door is almost closed. Outside of the facility, a large veil of mist covers the parking and Owen goes to hide under a tipper truck as the door is about to break under the I.rex assaults. Knowing that the I.rex could easily find him because of his scent, Owen cut a pipe and pours fuel all over him. The gate finally fall and the Indominus walk on the parking but the mist is so thick that Owen sees only her feet when she passes near him. The indominus pick the vet scent, who is hiding behind the Veterinary Services ambulance, and as she silently gets closer to him, Owen has only a glimpse of her general shape. When she is close enough of the vet, she brutally throw the ambulance on its side and stand over her screaming prey before shutting up her prey by closing her monstrous jaws on him. Owen stays still under the truck, praying not to be found, but suddenly gunshots are fired, scaring away the I.rew which flees and disappear into the jungle. 
Once he thinks it‚Äôs safe enough to get out, Owen screams to let his presence be known and crawl away from the truck. The guards, zookeppers and J-SEC agents arrives and Brunet asks Owen in which direction the I.rex went before telling the garrison that they have work to do.  !&lt;

aqbsmn,1,2019-02-13,GF seems to be losing identity and wants to break up,havywik5,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aqbsmn/gf_seems_to_be_losing_identity_and_wants_to_break/,"Hello there reddit. So me (22m) and GF(20F) have been in a relationship for almost 2 and a half years. To clarify the situation we are both in college and thats were we met. So we are the typical we love each other couple who have issues now and again. Example is one year in I failed Engineering classes and started seeking help through counseling to realize my individuality and work on being my own person. At the same time while picking myself back up I got the ultimatum of pick myself back up and focus on myself or the relationship is over. Since then we have been for the most part good. Good communication was important and we both thrived on it. However I kept failing courses which last semester caused me to change my major. Im doing better and continued to seek counseling and help for my study habits but around Halloween she said she wanted to move in together for both of our final years. She and her parents were into the idea. I for awhile was wishy washy for a month or two to make sure I was not blinded by love eventually came to realize I was also into it. Around the holidays I brought the idea to my family who were completely opposed to the idea. I communicated my concerns and in order to not cause problems said she did not wan't to cause issues between me and my family and we made other arrangements. Since then I've found a major that I can graduate comfortably in, and she has gotten and amazing internship for the summer. She has voiced concerns but not harshly that she doesn't feel like herself since the new year. She broke up with me rather abruptly this past Sunday. When I asked about all the normal reasons why she told me that she loves me still, I am a great boyfriend, and that she has been sad and doesn't know how to fix it. I think she is going through what I did and lost her identity in the relationship. I asked her to detail any particular thing that is making her sad and she could not say a single thing. I don't want to lose her and that may be me being selfish but I it was without a doubt after my own long thought a good relationship. If she needs to distance herself to figure out her identity thats ok but its just how she described it as a good relationship but she was sad. So I know breaking up and gaining experience is the best way to figure herself out but is it really the only way?"
aqdjy8,7,2019-02-13,No interviews!!,missthebeach,iastate,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/aqdjy8/no_interviews/,So I did not get any interviews at the Engineering career fair yesterday. Computer engineering sophomore.  Anyone have experience in landing an internship after the fairs are over?  Willing to try anything/anywhere.  Do most people find they at least get interviews?   How many companies do most people apply to?  Thought it would be a lot easier.  I have decent grades and some club activities but not a lot of engineering clubs.  Would that make a difference?
aqdopp,3,2019-02-13,When everyone blames you and you just gotta keep smiling while ur completely breaking inside,SyaraC,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/aqdopp/when_everyone_blames_you_and_you_just_gotta_keep/,"I'm mostly a positive type soul but recently I've realized I've been going through some depression stages in my life. Well firstly I will say that I have not been so called 'diagnosed' for depression as I hate visiting the doctor or any of these help centers. I'll start with what makes me depressed currently in my life. First off I literally have no real life friends, none Nada. Everyone is busy with their own awesome life, amazing jobs, or married life and even planning on kids. BTW I'm just 24, jobless, in a relationship that is starting to feel complicated and really just fed up of everything to be frank. My parents forced me into engineering and even after scoring well I'm still jobless as I didn't score great in my college science or as we call it here 12th std. According to the norms u gotta be literally perfect in everything related to education for a great high level job. Every day I'm insulted by my parents cuz according to them I'm not trying hard enough for a job. I've been to job interviews related to engineering but I just sometimes get told they will let me know. I even waited 6 hours for an interview and the guy came in casually, interviewed me on a topic I hadn't even applied for, and then told me to work for free for them. Now don't get me wrong I'm not again internships but wud you really work for free for someone who made you wait six hours just for an interview from early in the morning to late in the afternoon. I hadn't eaten anything, not even had a chance to go to the washroom and then to hear that. When I came home I explained the situation to my family but all they did was just insult me further saying I'm useless for not taking the job. I had got a job at a teaching facility for classes but my parents outright refused me to join that as it was below my expectations as I'm an engineer. I sometimes do a but of crochet and knitting and make some stuff to show my family but they always tell me to stop doing this stupid stuff and concentrate on seeing a good job. Now they are forcing me to do my MBA as their friends have said that will help me secure a great job. Every single day my mom compared me to her friends children saying see how they work, how they are married this and that. I have a bf who I've been dating for five years and I believe he truly loves me but sometimes I feel he gets too possessive too. If I chat with anyone online or find some happiness in making friends online he tells me to delete the apps as those so called ppl can't be trusted. So that little happiness I used to get from talking online went down the drain too. I have no friends to chat with in real life so I basically sit all alone in my room all day studying random coding or reading up on books. The day I go out with my bf he is always irritated with me if I just look at my phone even for a sec to check on a game. Mobile games are the only entertainment I have in my life and I like to click pics or Snapchat but he gets mad at me so I only click pics if he is gone to buy something or is busy somewhere else. Sometimes to deal with this depressing feeling I have inside me I like to do up my hair, do some new types of makeup and paint my nails. My bro who is smaller than me will always insult me on that too saying I look completely different with makeup on and that I'm trying to hard. At home too I never ask my parents for any money or anything, never expect a gift from them for any holidays and do all my end of the housework too. My mom will say sometimes that I don't help out with the housework but if I go and help her she shouts at me saying I just can't do anything right and that I'm making more of a mess. I seriously don't know what to do anymore. I've had weird thoughts of ending everything just cuz I feel everyone will be happy but IDK I feel selfish cuz I just don't wanna die. I just wanted to do my own little thing be it teach some kids or knit stuff and sell online but my parents only care what their friends will say. BTW her friends kids are all from super rich families and gone abroad so my parents always tell me why I haven't gone abroad. I don't want to go abroad and waste anymore of their money that's the only reason why I was trying for some small time job here to save up for that. My mom too only favours my brother, if he wants something he gets it, if he life that certain food I'm supposed to give him my share too cuz according to her I anyways don't each much. I stopped eating also much cuz I don't wanna be a burden anymore. I've never felt like this in my life and I really don't know how to cope with this. I've discussed with my bf if we cud get married a bit sooner just so I can start my own little life goals but he is not ready and is like marriage will come after his big bro will get married. Sadly I don't have any friends or I will DJ have moved out of my home from when. I know many people will call me lazy and complaining but IDK I just want to feel happy doing what I want to do even if it's not such a great job. I'm sorry for this rant. Thank you so much if you read through this just for listening to me. I hope ur life is going much better than mine. "
aqdrro,9,2019-02-13,Is CMU worth the debt for machine learning education?,thrandomaway,cmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/aqdrro/is_cmu_worth_the_debt_for_machine_learning/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a prospective junior transfer student currently at a state university (I'm a sophomore right now). I'm applying to around 10 total universities, all top unis in CS that have good ML research and education (some better than others though). Of them all, CMU SCS is my personal top pick since I feel it appeals to me the most.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, my tuition's free, but education in machine learning is severely lacking. There's just no comparison to be made between my state school and CMU in the number of specialized research opportunities as well as courses in deep learning, computer vision, N.L.P and AI that are offered at CMU. There's also barely any machine learning courses offered here at all, and they are barely specialized with around one or two computer vision courses and the only deep learning taught is about 3 weeks at the end of an advanced ML course. General CS wise, my school isn't bad but it's not exactly good either.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm already quite involved in my current university, doing the most ML research that I can (we don't have specialized research really, and it's really random varying from some in the cybersecurity department, and to the electrical engineering department. It's a pretty weak presence here) under the university, as well as working on several deep learning projects of my own on my github. There's just not much more I can do in terms of machine learning at my university, and I'm just left craving more. I'm pretty set on my decision to transfer out, but if I don't get it, no big deal I'll just try really hard for grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's my situation, I'm still on an H4 visa (will switch to F1 student soon) so I'd basically be getting no financial aid anywhere I'm applying to (other schools similar to CMU in CS ranking as well as machine learning research). I can't do internships, so research and personal projects are about the only things I can do. Financially, my parents and other family members are willing and ready to help pay my loans, since I can't actually work until I graduate from grad school (internships do count though, but I think I might be limited to only grad school)

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth accumulating 70K a year for 2 years + another two years of grad school presumably at schools like Stanford, MIT, CMU, etc.? It just seems like a lot to pile on my family and later myself. They don't really mind but a quarter of a million for my entire education is a lot of money...

I'm going particularly for the machine learning education (ML minor is really enticing, along with the huge CS department and ML researcher staff), which CMU really excels at compared to other schools.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance everyone!!"
aqdwwc,3,2019-02-13,"All things considered, I grew up to be a pretty well adjusted adult... or at least the closest approximation to it I can be",d-__-bender,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/aqdwwc/all_things_considered_i_grew_up_to_be_a_pretty/,"I got a promotion today.  

I was ecstatic. Honest. The promotion would allow me to make more money than I ever have in my entire life. I worked so hard to get here.  

Naturally, the first person I called was my wife. She is always the first person I want to share good news with. We ‚Äúomfgggggg adskfaksdj‚Äù with each other like true gay millenials. I get off work early and decide to call my parents. I haven‚Äôt spoken to them since last week so I figure, why the hell not?

I told my stepdad I got the promotion. He said his ‚ÄúCongratulations, eh‚Äù and even though it was silent for a few moments, I could hear him smirking on the other end. My step dad is a man of few words.  He then passes the phone to my mom. She said her ‚ÄúCongratulations...‚Äù half-assedly then devolved into sobs and muttering.  

I listened for the better part of an hour how she thinks her life is terrible. How she thinks she is depressed (she may very well be depressed, it runs in our family). How she thinks everyone is leaving her (we are not). I moved out a long time ago and my youngest sister just got this great opportunity for an internship in LA. My mom should be happy for us but instead she is playing the victim. She also somehow brings up my grandpa who has been dead for years now? *‚ÄúMom, lolo didn‚Äôt die because he* wanted *to leave you...‚Äù* but of course that‚Äôs not how she sees it.  

We got off the phone and I cried. So this woman, the one who ruined my childhood, *finally* admitted that she fucked up somewhere along the way. All the hoarding, the hitting, the neglect, the denial about my mental health--she tried convincing me that I should feel bad *for her* because her family is growing up?

My childhood was shit. There is no denying that. When I joined the Navy, it was the first time in my life I ever had a bed. Up until then I slept on a couch in my grandma‚Äôs basement (she never dared let me call that house ‚Äúmy home.‚Äù She made sure to remind me that she could kick me out whenever she wanted. I always had one bag packed just in case.) or on a pile of clothes on the floor in one of the many rooms taken over by my mom‚Äôs hoarding. The Navy helped me get my life together and far, far away from her. I used to be very depressed. Even tried committing suicide a couple times. I ran away from home until I was technically a missing person and picked up by the cops, barefoot, in the winter, hanging out by a bridge. I‚Äôve had insomnia since I was 6 (I  was molested as a kid. A family member would touch me as I was ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep right since). I‚Äôve had suicidal  thoughts since I was 10 (a 10 year old should NEVER have to think about killing themselves).  

And yet‚Ä¶ I still feel guilty somewhere. I know my mom tried her best. She came from a shitty third world country and she tried her damndest here. It was a better childhood than she had. I‚Äôm conflicted and still feel so bitter despite knowing all that. I had to raise my sisters. I had to help them with their homework. I had to protect them from bullies. I had to teach them how to ride a bike. I had to teach them how to cook. I had to tell them that I was proud of their hard work. I had to give them hugs and congratulate them. I  had to do that because if I didn‚Äôt do that, then no one would  have and they would have turned out as empty and sad as me.  

My mother just plays the victim. It‚Äôs hard to feel bad for someone who is always throwing themselves a pity party. Someone who *wants* to feel bad. Someone who refuses to change anything but still expects everything to magically somehow get better. She always says she‚Äôs going to change, or declutter, or get help, or eat better and exercise, or start taking her meds, but she never does.  

TL;DR Anyway, I just wanted to say that I got a promotion today. And I am really proud of my hard work.  "

&amp;#x200B;

I recently finished completing 3/3 Associate AWS certifications and am wondering if I should apply for jobs soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I have general Unix/Linux skills and I enjoy programming (particularly in Python).  I‚Äôve deployed a small site with Django using open source tools, but nothing serious.  I‚Äôve had one CS internship.  I am mostly self-taught and have an undergrad degree and Master‚Äôs in an unrelated (but technical) field.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on continuing to learn AWS in more depth, and I want to learn config management tools + infrastructure as code tools.  I am currently trying to decide if I should go and do the professional certifications, or spend that time building more of a portfolio instead (some people here have kind of hinted that a junior person with a ton of certifications is a red flag for ‚Äòincompetent but good at test-taking‚Äô).  Regardless, I‚Äôll continue to make stuff and improve in more areas than just AWS/infrastructure management.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I described above, do I seem employable?  Developing more of a portfolio is certainly something I will continue to work on.  I want to prepare well for the application process, but I don‚Äôt want to delay getting experience at a company any longer than I have to.  Thank you for any input!"

I rushed home and within that hour someone saw my package and must have taken it because it was not there when I got home, no package slip, no box, no email from Amazon or the deliverer either.

If you're reading this and you realize that it was perhaps you who took my package. I genuinely hope you get good use out of it, however if you want to return, I would like to offer you dinner at my house (I guess you know the address already) and honestly, if need a humidifier, keep it. I can always get another one. If you're in a bad place and need a hand with things, come let me know, I don't have much as I'm just renting and an intern but I can do what I can! (I'm a pretty good cook so food would be my specialty)

If youre reading this and you know who it was, let them know I'm not mad, I am a bit annoyed currently, but I would honestly like to have them over to my place and cook them a meal, or treat them to one out if that's better.

Thanks for reading, spread the word, someone out there needs help, I'd like to be able to help them. Also maybe be careful with you packages if you're in Hidden Valley.

I study a business related degree, I have one more year till I graduate and have been applying for internships. I find the interview process very nerve wracking (I‚Äôm sure it is even for non femcels!) but I feel like my looks will put me at a bigger disadvantage for most interviews, we all know the studies that show attractive people are hired more easily especially for corporate roles.



My grades are decent, but I have social anxiety too (which I‚Äôm trying hard to improve) and graduate schemes are very competitive in the UK. I‚Äôve been to careers networking events and most employers seem to prioritise ‚Äòpersonality‚Äô and relevant experience over grades. (Often what they consider as someone with ‚Äòpersonality‚Äô is essentially a good looking extrovert, smh what is wrong with introverts?! surely different personalities are needed in a workplace)


Also, most work experience / internships are London based and some are paid next to nothing or even unpaid so unless you‚Äôre originally from there you cannot afford to live there (pay rent) and work for so little even though getting relevant experience will be an investment - so much easier to then get a graduate scheme.

I really regret not choosing to study computer science as my undergraduate bachelors, in fact I‚Äôm even considering doing a masters conversion course in CS ü§î"

Currently have a 2.4 GPA and haven‚Äôt really done anything but I started to get serious about school and I‚Äôm improving greatly. I see no reason why I won‚Äôt get above a 3.3 from here on out. 

The biggest problem I have right now is no internship. Im begging to look for one tomorrow but I just don‚Äôt know what I can get with my lack of resume. I may be in college for an extra semester so that would give me an extra summer to look but I‚Äôm not sure.

I do have somewhat of an advantage with my dad. He has mostly worked with supply chains and has been a high level executive I believe (I‚Äôd guess he has made 150k-350k and had VP in his title) at many companies including Lowe‚Äôs and Sears. Currently he does consulting and soon will run his own team that focuses on supply chains. I can‚Äôt get an internship or job there though because all the employees there have years of executive experience. Relationships with old companies aren‚Äôt great. He poached Lowe‚Äôs employees, Sears was a disaster, another owes him tons of money etc. All I can count on now is the opportunity to follow him at work any maybe go on a few trips to see him work with clients. I also have him send me some of his work time to time to look at. 

Is there anyway I can leverage this more. For example could I take something away from shadowing him and add it to a resume? I feel like I have the opportunity to learn a ton of information but no real way to show employers . "

Based in NYC, so I can come in and out of here as my home base.

Looking for any tips, and basically asking, what would you do with this time? Ideally, I could spend most of the time abroad, but am definitely open to trips within the US as well.

My biggest issue is I'm having a hard time prioritizing. Money isn't a big concern and I'm open to multiple flights back-and-forth, but I would like to be reasonable and not splurging everywhere I go. Some of the top countries on my list (not necessarily in order) are Southeast Asia, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan, Egypt, France, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Greece.

Amazing nature is my top priority. Mix of city life, cultural experiences, and good food follow that.

Another consideration I've had is finding some short-term volunteer opportunities or paid/non-paid internships at interesting companies.

Finally, beyond the actual trip locations, looking for advice on how far in advance you would book things, how you'd get around once in the specific countries you visit, any must-visit to-do's (restaurants, nightlife, culture, nature), how long you'd stay in each location, and any other tips that might be helpful.

Many thanks in advance! Happy to provide more info on my situation if it helps you in giving advice."
aqfmvq,4,2019-02-13,Trying to decide if I should accept my first job offer,iconic_bond,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/aqfmvq/trying_to_decide_if_i_should_accept_my_first_job/,"I recently graduated with a chemical engineering degree from a fairly well known state university with a pretty good (3.5+) gpa. I started applying for jobs in the semester and though I got several interviews and even a site visit, I did not receive an offer. Now, about two months post graduation, I have received my first job offer. However, it is not for an engineer role. The offer is for a lab technician position at a fairly large chemicals company. The position seems to require more education than a typical lab tech position since a bachelor's degree is required. The money is also good, they're offering $50,000. I know I could get more money from a plant type of job, but I have little debt and living expenses in the city the job is are pretty decent. Additionally, it is located in a city that I like and have family in. I also liked the atmosphere and people I met during the interview. However, I am worried that taking a lab tech position instead of a job with ""engineer"" in the title could keep me from advancing my career in the future. There are opportunities for advancement within the company, but I know I could likely land a job that is ""higher up the food chain."" However, my experience (one internship and two years in research) all were focused on R&amp;D, so I think working within a lab environment is probably my best bet career-wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be unwise to go ahead and take the lab tech position? Another factor here is finances, since I am now two months into having no income or financial aid. Though I have money saved up, I would like to keep it that way.

As I began doing a psych internship at a behavioral health unit of a hospital, I've realized I don't want to continue on to a graduate program in clinical psychology anymore. 

After a little research, I found that becoming a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practioner will give me a more stable career that's worth the money being spent on the education. 

As well as a significant amount of time spent with patients to practice psychotherapeutic techniques. 

Plus, I really don't want to open a private practice nor do I want to study psychology to do research(PhD), I want to apply it(differently from a PsyD). 

So now how do I go about hitting the brakes and turning around my education?

Also while I don't mind working with adults, geriatrics has always been a point of emphasis for me while studying psychology.

*Edit: I am also under DACA(Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) which for those of you who know is not perminant citizenship. Would not being a U.S. citizen cause any issues in achieving a MSN(Besides lack of financial aid, let's not open that can of worms)?"

I completed a Masters of Arts in Clinical Psychology half way through the program (non-terminal). I am near the end of my third year and have about 140K of debt (I started with  11K from my undergrad)  with some of the 20-30K chunks reaching a maximum of 6.5% interest, most are lower.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering dropping out of the program due to the lack of quality training at my practicum site and my own program that I am a part of not training/teaching the material needed to succeed in the field. I am realizing how poor my training is and I have had second thoughts for the past year but kept going so I could complete the Masters and decide at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about 2 years left if all goes to plan regarding enough intervention hours, passing oral exams, and advancing to candidacy in time to apply for internship. After the two years I will have to accrue hours towards my licensure.

&amp;#x200B;

What options do I have? If it was not for the debt I probably would have dropped out awhile ago but I could not justify it with nothing to show for it. I have not worked for the last three years. I know with a Masters I could probably teach at a Community College which is something I have always wanted to try but know it pays very little. I do not find myself committed to completing the program. I am sick of the stress, the debt, the lack f progress I feel I am making in my life, I have been diagnosed with mental health and physical health conditions in the past year that require self-care, weight-loss and stress management which is near impossible with the program.

&amp;#x200B;

I am holding on because the debt is insane.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it manageable? Will I be able to pay it off with a Masters degree? What kind of salary should I be looking for in order to pay it off? What programs are available? Should I stick it through? Is the pay off worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: At the end of the program I will have over 200K of debt. So the question is do I cut my losses now or have the debt with a doctorate degree?

Back then I just want to find some casuals hanging out and have fun. The first date was great and exactly happened as what I want: dinner, drinks then bed.  The second date started to be a bit different. He offered me for a walk to the supermarket after dinner. Under the sunset, he held my hand. This is unusual because the causal relationship to me is just having sex. Dinner, drinking filtering maybe but definitely not holding hands on the street. 

Around 2 weeks later, he told me that he needs to go back to his hometown for the internship during the break. We kind of talking about dating but he said something like well we just met for a couple weeks and now I would be away/I thought about dating you but let's see how it goes/I don't want a gf at the moment ...etc. 

He has been away for 2 months. While we are apart, we video chat from time to time, quite often actually and sending message every day. One day he told me that hey I went out with my ex today and I think we are totally friends now. I think it is important to let you know about this. At the moment I really thought he is into me, like I am different to him some sort, but then 2 days later, he told me again saying that he has something VERY IMPROTANT to tell me. Turns out he was drunk and crying about he ex saying that 'ahhh I thought I have moved on but then I am so sad right now blablabl'. Seriously I was crying after that phone call until morning. He has told me at least twice in these two months like ""I am not sure that I like you in that way"", ""I am afraid that what if I fall in love with someone it might hurt you"", etc but at the same time he introduced me to his family and friends over the video call; sharing his life with me by talking many pictures; most of all, saying I miss you nearly every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago he went back, I also came back from overseas. When he picked me up at the airport, he held me so tight and looking in my eyes said: I miss you so much. He is now staying over my place because he is looking for a place to rent. The first day at home was amazing, cuddled and kiss me all the time whether it is at home or not. We did grocery shopping together; he cooked dinner for me; we held our hands and walking to the supermarket just for ice cream; I get into the trolley on the kerbside and he pushed me all the way. I thought it might have a chance to develop a relationship, maybe it really just like what he has said: maybe when we hang out a bit more then see how it flows. 

BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After this lovely first reunion, which is yesterday, I drank too much that night. I can only vaguely remember that he said:

""I am 100% having no romantic feelings to you"", "" I am leaving this city this year after my graduation"","" we are just friends"","" I thought about dating you but I don't want a gf yet',""I am pretty much enjoying the current situation and let's talk about it when someone feels inappropriate "". I was very sad when I heard about this AND I made the worst out of the worst decision: I took 2 tabs of Temaz. Booze with Temaz, Boom!! I lost track of my memory of the night, I cried out loud, but that ain't too bad. What makes me super worried and panic is that I am not sure that did I divulge the things I don't want him to know, especially him. I tried to ask him but he just said oh you told me you don't want to live anymore, supporting your sister makes you stress out, and .... the guy from China is kinda shitty. 

Yes, the guy from China, my client, old enough to be my dad. I remembered this part, but I can't remember how I deliberated the details AND ....I am not sure that have I ever told him about the job which gives me quick and big dollars while he is away. I wish I didn't say it. I wish he never knew about it. 

Today is being good like nothing happened. We go for brunch and he took care of it. Gave me a card saying this is valentines day so I thought about giving you a card to celebrate ""friend valentines""

seriously up until here I am damn confused, if he is not into me then why doing these all shit. I don't think there is anyone on earth thinking that what we are doing considered as **friend.** 

**SOOOOOOO,** how should I do from now and how should I ask him about did I talk about my ""work"" out not? (or maybe I shouldn't ask?!)

My name is Gary Dunn, and I am running for President of the United States.

It sure as hell wasn't something I saw myself doing twenty years ago. I was a gangly kid from the Midwest, still plagued with acne at twenty five. I grew up in a mining town that outlived the copper mine it was built for. I never met my father. I went to college at an unremarkable university in yet another unremarkable town, pursuing a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering.

It all changed when I found [the ring](https://www.reddit.com/r/soIwroteathing/).

I was working at Target, I remember. It was my last few weeks there, since school was about to start. My cousin Sarah invited me to join her friends in a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. One of their friends had to pull out because of food poisoning. After weeks of trying to find someone to fill the slot, she settled for me.

It was a seven day trip, and suffice to say it was awkward as heck. I made a couple of jokes on the first day that didn't really quite stick, garnering half hearted laughs.

Matt was one of Sarah's friends who I felt I could really connect to. We both loved Starcraft. We thought Jimmy Fallon wasn't funny, and we both agreed that the Star Wars prequels weren't all bad. So naturally, I gravitated towards him, hanging out together with him more than the others.

It all went to shit on day five. I was with one of our guides, securing our supplies on the raft before we head into Phantom Ranch, where we would rest for a night before heading up. The others were setting up a small campfire, for us to lounge and relax before the exhausting climb out.

The sun had set pretty quickly, casting the entire canyon into darkness. The Colorado ran along quietly, having lost most of its power upstream. As we approached the now active fire, I could hear what they were talking about.

""- really weird, honestly. I saw him staring at Matt yesterday with a real longing look in his eyes while we were rowing yesterday."" Jane, one of Sarah's closer friends, said.

""Maybe he *likes* you, Matt."" Sarah teased.

""Oh, bugger off. Creepy and clingy isn't really my type."" Matt laughed.

In the dim, flickering light, Sarah saw me. The smile on her face instantly evaporated. ""Gary - ""

I ran. I turned around and ran back to the river. I could feel my heart beating so hard it felt like it wanted to break out of my ribcage. My chest felt tighter, and I couldn't breathe.

When I finally stopped, I was at the riverbank. I had no idea how far I had ran, or where I was. I was incredibly dizzy and felt like puking. My chest felt like it was crushed, and I could only draw short, quick breaths. I collapsed against a tree and tried to calm myself down.

That's when I saw it. A silver ring, washed up on the shore. It gleamed unnaturally in the pale moonlight, shining brighter than it should be. I picked it up.

It was a simple band, with no particular fancy inscriptions, no incredibly large gemstone. The only thing on it was the word ""Pride"", engraved along the outer side of the band. I was only vaguely conscious of the group calling my name in the woods when I slipped it on.

I felt... different. The ring, upon contact with my skin, sent an incredible surge of energy through me.

I knew then that things will never be the same.

The ring cleared up my acne. It transformed my messy, unkempt curly black hair into a slick back comb. My jawline got sharper, and my neck got shorter.

It wasn't just changes in physical appearance. It got easier for me to pack on muscle. I stopped mumbling during my presentations. I spoke with gravitas. My jokes got funnier. People asked me out. Endless invitations to parties in Vegas. I even got an offer for a part in Hollywood, cause I charmed the right person that one night in LA.

But I wanted more. More than fame and adoration. *Power.*

That's why I ran for the Arizona Senate.

I crushed it. In the time I was there, I fought and destroyed anyone in my way. See, the thing about the ring is that it doesn't just boost my confidence, or increase my pride. It allows me to manipulate the pride of others, too. I could make someone cast away their inhibition and send the dick pics they've always wanted to. I could make someone so stubborn they hold up an important healthcare bill, which of course, led to the media tearing him apart.

When I ran for President of the Arizona Senate, the Democrat running against me didn't even stand a chance.

Yesterday, I met with George, an attorney from Sullivan &amp; Mason. He was representing Mr. James Holt, the CEO of the largest tech conglomerate in America. Yesterday, I secured the funding for my presidential campaign.

Today, I'm running for the office of the President of the United States.

I was feeling pretty good, too. Leader of the free world. Imagine that.

Who could stop me?

\_\_\_

An intern - of all people - brought her to my attention.

He was watching reruns on this big TV we had in the lounge when I walked in. It was the end of the day and I wanted to unwind with some Call of Duty before heading back home. Upon seeing me enter, he hastily apologised and left the room. I loosened my tie and booted up the Playstation.

I was just about to change the channel when she popped up.

""America is *not* the greatest country in the world."" She said. ""Not anymore.""

The advertisement was just that. No gimmicks, no inter-cut photos of her smiling with communities or shaking hands with people. She went on, ticking off various metrics, illustrating how we're no longer the best.

But I stopped listening.

There's something on her right ring finger - a gold ring - that seems all too familiar.

""Help me,"" she said, staring intently at me. ""Help me make America great again.""

It can't be, no, it can't be -

""My name is Dr. Jane Lim, and I am running for the President of the United States.""

Engraved on the outer band, just barely visible in the television, was the word ""Greed."""
aqhm4l,2459,2019-02-14,You set the price,Sn3akr,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/aqhm4l/you_set_the_price/,"So.. I was an intern at at small startup during my education. When i initially got hired they promised me that we could renegotiate my salary after 6 months.

I gave it my all because i found the job interesting and challenging, and my bosses left me alone to work on large projects like making an automated shelving system for a factory etc. No guidance or nothing!  


We moved to a new office, and i put in extra hours painting the office, epoxying the factory floors, and because of my interest in hardware i made all network, printserver etc.  


During my first 6 months i was paid around 12$/h (normal student rates here) but i knew my boss was charging 70$/h for my time to our customers (went up to 115$ my last year there), but now i had been there for 6 months, some days completely alone having to tend for everything in the company. But.. Despite all my hard work and extra hours i was told they felt i was paid what they thought i was worth (which apparently was about 15% of what they charged others for my time???) This was of course a bit of a slap to the face, and being i was in the middle of my education and under contract i couldn't just leave, so for the rest of my time there i had to sit there for 12$/h knowing they pocketed about 50$/h on my work, treating me like crap and doing absolutely nothing to teach me anything which was part of their responsibility to me as a student. I got trough my time as a student and quit the company as soon as my contract was out and never looked back.  


A few months after i had quit i received a phone call from my old boss.. and the conversation went something like this  


Old Boss: Hi, this is your asshole old boss, we're having some network issues, would you mind come fix it for us since your the only one with all the codes?   
Me: Sure, I'll only charge you 115$/h, since that's the price you set for my time already.  
Old Boss: ...... But.. you... That's way too much.... (sound of steam coming from his ears)  
Me: That's the price you charged for my time while you told me was worth only 12$, and just for telling me it's too much, my rate just doubled.  
Old Boss: But you're the one that has all the codes!?!?! You can't do that, we can't get into the systems...  
Me: Yeah?? Good luck with that \*click\*  


Best feeling ever! :D"

I have tried SO hard to feel the way I felt about him with anybody else. Went on at least 20 dates, tried to meet people at bars, even hooked up with my best friend here. I can't get it. I sincerely cannot get my heart back in that place as the way and intensity I felt with him. 

We're going to be roommates again this summer (other reasons)but we've talked a lot more and just overall kept a friendly attitude with each other. I know be hasn't dated anyone but I've slept with a solid number of people since then just trying to explore a little more. 

I would *not* change breaking up. Not at all. I've learned and grown so much, and he's learned and grown so much. It was absolutely worth it. But even talking to him on the phone today, we just have so much chemistry. My friends are going to be so mad but I honestly think I want to get back together with him when I get back. Maybe give it a couple months so I can see if maybe I'm just rushing into it.

They didn‚Äôt see me, i just turned around and got the hell outta there. I‚Äôm a B4 intern in a pretty small city, and I reported it mid-January. There‚Äôs only so much I can say without getting specific, so bear with me here. 

After *many* calls and a few meetings with local and national HR reps, it seems as though the partner is being suspended while being further investigated. Apparently, a few other people have lodged complaints about seeing those two being close and kinda touchy, so that helped them believe my report. They also conducted an initial investigation soon after I reported, so I‚Äôm not sure what proof or evidence they found - maybe the partner or intern confessed when they were asked about it. The HR reps implied, albeit not specifically, that the intern in question would be finishing the internship but almost certainly not getting a full time offer. Apparently the partner and intern knew each other before she got hired - the intern was the daughter of the partner‚Äôs friend or something. It was hard to get specifics from the people I talked to, which is understandable since I‚Äôm just an intern myself and they don‚Äôt want to give me the whole story. I didn‚Äôt receive any punishment and the people I‚Äôve talked to have all been extremely kind and professional, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt get an offer as they might just want to move on from this. I‚Äôll probably decline even if I do get an offer, this is a pretty fucked up situation that I don‚Äôt want from my first full time job. 

Everyone I talked to at HR made it clear that they wanted to keep this very quiet, which is understandable but still shitty. This makes me think that the partner will be suspended for a few weeks and then just get some mild punishment and continue life as usual. It didn‚Äôt seem like the firm was seriously considering firing the guy, but who knows.  

The HR reps told me they‚Äôd be periodically contacting me as the deeper investigation occurs, but I think this is the last bit of information about the situation I‚Äôll get. My internship ends in mid-late March, so we‚Äôll see. 

Ah, back to testing controls. Happy busy season!"

---


I started working in this office 9 months ago in June. D introduced himself to me in an elevator a couple months in when he learned I wasn't a summer intern but full time. D was a supervisor for another section, completely irrelevant to me and my job. His office just happened to be close to me and outside our printer. From then on we were only on a hi/good morning basis. Around Thanksgiving, I bumped into D and we got into conversation and that's when I started to feel some sort of chemistry. Before we left for Christmas holidays, I mustered the courage to go into his office to chat. We talked about the company, our jobs, and some personal details. I started to frequent his office maybe twice a week; D only worked 4x a week Mon-Thurs. And his section was always in 2 hours before me. I was only in there for 10 minutes or less before someone else had business to discuss with him. I started leaving things in his office such as chocolate and cough drops with sticky notes (feel better).¬†


The new year comes along. It gets harder to visit D because D gets busy and lots of people are going in and out of his office. I remember I told D I was going to go on a snowboarding trip. D bumps into me at the printer and gives me handwarmers for the trip. That's when I told him I was going to quit my job and pursue another path. D said he was going to miss me. After that, I decided I was going to chase; I was leaving after all and he knew.


On the Thursday before my snowboarding trip, I was out of the office all day. I came back and found a note on my desk from him signed with a heart. This was 7pm at night, no one else was in the office. The next day, Friday morning, I come in¬†and the note was gone. 10 minutes getting settled in and also confused, R sees me and asks me to talk. I have never spoken to R before but she worked with him and her cubicle was somewhere between us. R takes me to the conference room and starts saying things like, ""I want to talk woman to woman"", ""I overheard D's two bosses saying they don't know why you're always in his office because you're not under his supervision."" Basically, R claimed his bosses thought I distracted him from his work and she claimed that D said he didn't know why I was in there talking to him either about personal details. R kept repeating D saw me as a daughter and she tried to be my friend saying she would adopt me as a daughter too if she could. Then R asks me to keep my distance to avoid drama/conflict and to repeat none of this to anyone. I believed her and decided to respect that. I stopped visiting him.


D comes to visit my cubicle instead. He asks if I used the handwarmers. I was confused, I thought we were keeping distance. He seemed clueless. I decided R was the bad guy. So I left chocolate and my phone # on D's desk Friday before I left.¬†


Monday comes along. I don't see anyone but I overhear R gossiping to her other co-worker. At the end of the day, as I leave I get 2 calls from a restricted number. I answer the 2nd time and recognized R's voice. I am in shock thinking D gave her my number. I bump into him Tues &amp; Wed but now I feel I am being watched by R. Anytime I go near him she shows up. I start to think he never got the chocolate and she took it. I finally see him on my way out and ask him if he got the chocolate. D says he did and gives me a wink. I am super confused now. Finally, Thursday comes. He texts me after work. I told him I was going to New Orleans for a while and would come back Wednesday. Our texts get romantic and it is very obvious what we both want. D worries about the age difference and we decide to talk about it when I return. Everything is fine until 5 days later...


Early Tuesday morning I asked him about his relationship status, a question I should of asked before. I knew he wasn't married but I made a poor assumption he was single. D told me he was seeing someone a few weeks ago but ended it in case him and I had a chance. Hearing this, I immediately apologized for homewrecking. I had no intention and had I known, I would never of pursued him. However, D assures me i did not homewreck...that it was barely a relationship he had.¬†


A few minutes after these exchanges of text I start getting calls from a Restricted # again. I ignore the first 3 but they keep coming. I finally answer and the woman introduces herself as D's gf. She claims she has been with him for 7 years and she is going nowhere. She sounds very shocked, angry, and she's yelling at me to stop contacting him. In the middle of all her words, I keep saying, ""Please let me apologize, I did not know. Please-"" and she says she doesn't want to hear any of it. Hangs up.¬†


Few minutes later she calls again. She sounds calmer, she apologizes for taking it out on me, that in all her years with him, D has never done this to her. She lets me speak and I giver her a complete apology. I assure her I am cutting ties. Hangs up. As she is calling, D is still texting me. Minutes later, she calls once again to tell me she got off the phone with D and he said he wouldn't contact me. She asks that I do the same and she says ""woman to woman"" . I assure her 100% I will not be in contact with him. hangs up. From then on, I stop replying to him. I was still on my trip and was also learning that my flight was going to be delayed. I was quite bothered and shook by everything.¬†


3 hours later, another restricted call. it is his gf again. I am super confused as I pickup I say, ""I thought we cleared this up this morning. You asked me to cut contact and I have done that. We agreed to something and that's it. It's over. End of discussion.""

¬†This time she is mad again yelling, ""why you talking to my mans, stop talking to my mans"" and I insist I am not talking to him, I am respecting you and following your request. She keeps attacking me, asking me to read his last texts, asking me if he ever said he wanted to be with me, asking me why I chased after someone else's man. At this point I am getting extremely annoyed by her constant calling. She starts threatening me ""If i find out you even look at him at work, talk to him, go near the printer, we are going to have a problem"" I tell her you don't have to call me so many times to repeat the same things. She says, ""I am going to keep calling, what you gonna do?"" I immediately hang up. A little while later, D texts me again¬† saying he understands if I am upset but I am not sure if he knows what's going on because he makes no mention of his gf. I still ignore his texts because I am trying to do the right thing. After a few hours, I decide to send him a closure text without mentioning other parties. I didn't want to get involved with his own relationship with his gf. I wanted to keep the closure between us. I used the age difference as the reason and asked him to keep the office contact professional and minimal. D answers immediately that he will respect my request.¬†


I come in Wednesday morning. R is laughing all happy and gossiping. I bumped into D and he looks terrible. He has dark circles around his eyes and he doesn't look at me or say anything. Then, during the day, I hear R gossiping to a friend she brought in. AND I RECOGNIZED THE FRIEND'S VOICE. It was the ""GIRLFRIEND"". I don't see her voice but her voice I recognize right away. At the end of the day, my other co workers say they saw D walk the friend out. I start to believe he really did have a girlfriend and she was her.¬†


I go home. At 5 pm I start getting restricted calls again. In total I get 6. some have 2 hour gaps. I was hoping to just continue ignoring it because this woman has to get tired like c'mon. Finally after the last call, I decide I have to tell D. I text him to tell his girlfriend to stop calling and harassing me. I send him screenshots of the calls. He doesn't answer and I assume he's asleep.


Next morning D answers me. He said he doesn't have a gf and he doesn't know whos calling me. I start telling him everything from the beginning. He keeps saying he doesn't know what's goin on and keeps asking me"" are you serious"". I can't believe he didn't realize everything that was happening!! I tell him he's being watched at work because his ""gf"" knows everything that I do and everything that he does. He doesn't answer for an hour. D texts me back saying he confronted the two woman and they denied everything. He said he believes me though and he is shocked as well that ""two jealous married woman with kids"" would do this. I tell him I only cut things off to respect the other woman if she indeed, was his girl. I wasn't tryna get in on their drama and problems. D says he understands now and is relieved because he couldn't sleep for days thinking what went wrong. He says he is going to keep distance from R now.¬†


I don't know if I can completely believe he was that clueless. I don't want to ask anymore questions such as if the ""gf"" ,who is R's friend, was someone he had something with or if these 2 women decided they had nothing else to do in their pathetic life. I am leaving this job in a week as well, should I call out R in my exit interview? Her and her friend was indeed, harassing and threatening me. I don't plan on coming back to this job though, nor do I particularly enjoy drama but I do think they should face some sort of consequence for their actions. They were very persistent in their act. I still don't really know D and R relationship other than that they worked together for 20 years but I thought they were close.

I understand that this issue will be ""solved"" by me leaving but I am just so confused and don't know what to think.

One perfect candidate is the early day voice of the opposition Morning ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù Joe.

Post **Q# 2700** on 2/12/19 (in part):

**Nobody should be above the law (no matter how massive the spider-web is (entangled).**

**This will never happen again.**

As if right on cue Psycho Joe has once again labeled President Trump and his supporters as openly racist. The deranged Progressive Leftists and their media allies have doubled down against President Trump/MAGA/and QAnon.

Post **Q# 2002** on 8/30/18 (in part(:

**FAKE NEWS.**

POTUS is a much better brander and has come up with appropriate nicknames for many on the Fake News. Joe now goes by ‚ÄòPsycho Joe‚Äô and his romantic sidekick is  ‚ÄòDumb as a Rock Mika‚Äô or just plain old ‚ÄòCrazy Mika‚Äô.

Post **Q# 743** on 2/12/18 (in part):

**The Inner Circle.**

**Mika Brzezinski.**

November 29, 2017 POTUS sent out a cryptic Tweet message referring to Morning Joe. This tweet  highlighted the mysterious death of a young pretty Scarborough campaign staff intern.

Post **Q# 2683** on 2/10/19 (in part):

**The media no longer represents the will of the people.**

This sad event happened at one Joe Scarborough‚Äôs (R-FL) panhandle campaign offices almost 2 decades ago. That unfortunate young very fit campaign aide was Ms. Lori Klausutis.

Post **Q# 1515** on 6/16/18 (in part):

**THE BRIDGE: PODESTA GROUP.**

On July 20, 2001 the dead body of 28-year old Lori Klausutis was found at her place of work. Lori worked for U.S. House Joe Scarborough (R-FL) at his Ft. Walton Beach/FL regional campaign office.

Post Q# 1785\*\* on 8/1/18 (in part):

**Do you think they got the \[4am\] memo?**

Klausutis was a daily runner of 5 miles and was the picture of perfect health. No drugs or alcohol were found in her system from the autopsy lab results.

Post **Q# 1431** on 5/20/18 (in part)

**Those who are the loudest....**

**Suicide weekend?**

**Pain.**

Strange as it seems Scarborough had just announced that he would not seek another U.S. House representatives term. This unexpected statement came two months after Lori‚Äô death and on the heels of very comfortably win from his last campaign for re-election.

Tweet **POTUS T#-265** on 11/29/17:

**And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the ‚Äúunsolved mystery‚Äù that took place in Florida years ago?**

Psycho Joe then claimed he needed to spend more quality time with his beloved family. This coincidently appears to be the number one excuse for retiring public service liars and criminal politicians. 

Post **Q# 2902** on 2/26/19:

**When the real TRUTH re: Russian collusion is right in front of you but the FAKE NEWS media prevents public awareness.**

Rumors had swirled around the Florida panhandle about affairs involving Psycho Joe. Local tales connected past promiscuous activity as the reason Joe would never run for elected office again.

Post **Q# 2691** on 2/11/19 (in part):

**FAKE NEWS DESIGNED TO KEEP THE FAKE NARRATIVE IN PLAY \[COVER\].**

This was contrary to his recent cookie-cutter public narrative announcement about of his loving family. I‚Äôm not sure we can find many honest politicians residing in the Washington DC ‚Äòswamp‚Äô.

Post **Q# 1515** on 6/16/18 (in part):

**These reporters and networks have been named in the Wikileaks to have colluded with the DNC or Hillary‚Äôs campaign during the 2016 election cycle.**

**MSNBC-Joe Scarborough.**

**MSNBC-Mika Brzezinski.**

Coroner's report had Lori passing out due to rare previously undetected fatal heart condition. Cardiac arrhythmia caused Lori to suddenly fall over hitting her head on an office desk and causing her instant death.

Post **Q# 2643** on 1/5/19 (in part):

**TRURTH AND TRANSPARENCY IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.**

Autopsy tests could never confirm this undetectable rare arrhythmia irregular heart rhythm. Primarily because it can only be detected while the heart is beating (victim must still be alive).

Post **Q# 1270** on 4/25/18 (in part):

**Happened.**

**Dangerous.**

**Threats.**

decode: Assassination threats [187].

Surprisingly this coroner was able confirmed that the head trauma did kill her. This case had things going sideways right off the bat indicating shenanigans.

Post **Q# 2489** on 11/12/18 (in part):

**\[Placeholder - OIG Report-FBI, DOJ, and Media Coll\].**

What confounded a local WGTX reporter was right after being notified of the Lori‚Äôs death, they unexpectedly got an official statement given out by Joe and several key staffers. This statement told a false narrative that Lori was very sticky and not been a healthy person recently.

Post **Q# 2174** on 9/15/18 (in part):

**WE, THE PEOPLE.**

**WWG1WGA!**

Psycho Joe and his team were scrambling to build a false narrative about Lori‚Äôs ill health. This incorrect 'ill-health' theme was shot down instantly by the Klausutis family members and her close friends.

Post **Q# 1500** on 6/15/18 (in part):

**Access kills.**

**Morning strolls are refreshing.**

Scarborough and his aides were pressured by her family to retract their original false public statement concerning Lori. Incredibly this low-life Scarborough was more concerned with optics than the death of this young lady.

Post **Q# 2687** on 2/10/19 (in part):

**Why does the FAKE NEWS media continue to attack a so-called ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô.**

Dr. Michael Berkland was assigned to perform Lori‚Äôs autopsy. Michael had a history of unethical conduct. Berkland was fired within a year due to faulty and incomplete official reports.

Post **Q# 572** on 1/21/18 (in part):

In 2008 authorities found a real life ‚ÄòHouse of Horrors‚Äô in a rental unit by Dr. Berkland. Discovered were various body parts of over 100 different cadavers in this U-Haul storage facility.

Post **Q# 1678** on 7/4/18 (in part):

Insanely these body parts/organs were stored in various Tupperware containers, Styrofoam cups, and garbage trash bags. These people are truly evil and sick individuals.

TL:DR

EM doesn‚Äôt pay after school care fees, kid gets excluded, EM blows up

Hey beloved Sub-Reddit.

I was a long time lurker, never poster but this amount of crazy which just happened at my job today was absolutely reddit worthy.

I currently retrain since my old job is kinda meh and you know, Germany the land of opportunities. Also means, english isn‚Äôt my first language, excuse some spelling and grammar mistakes, yada yada yada..

Here we go!

The retraining requires an internship so i applied at the local Youth Welfare Office and surprise, they needed my help.

I do pretty basic stuff like sorting out the post, phone calls, copy documents.. Secretary kinda deal.

It was a quiet and peaceful day so far, no major incidents as suddenly some female in her mid-thirties stormed into my office, without knocking, instantly starting to yell.

EM : entitled mom CC: cool co-worker Me: me.. duh.

**EM**: What do you think who you are to exclude my kid from the after school care! It‚Äôs your responsible if it will suffer from social anxiety now. She never gonna get social skills and that‚Äôs your fault!

**Me:** (utterly confused since the woman with her fake fur coat just appeared outta nowhere) Excuse me? How can i help you?

Since i was only an intern i absolutely had no clue about what went down. Eventually she threw the letters she got on my desk, myself reading it over quickly..

**EM**: I want you to take that back! Now! My child has a right to attend to after school care. She was there for months! All her friends are there. Also, i have to work my job and need to pick her up later.

**Me**: Well, that‚Äôs right although, sadly you haven‚Äôt paid your fee and that‚Äôs why your child got excluded..

But this logical fact didn‚Äôt really mattered much to her since in her mind she obviously did nothing wrong, no she even went that far to insult me!

**EM**: You do this on purpose, are you sure you are doing your job right?! Is here anybody around who isn‚Äôt an useless office cu\*\*.

My jaw slightly dropped, needlessly to say that i have nothing to do with the decision about excluding kids. But my faith in humanity still not fully dead, i tried to explain again..

**Me:** It‚Äôs not an ill will to exclude your kid, it‚Äôs simply the fact that if you don‚Äôt pay the monthly fees, your kid gonna get excluded from attending to the after school care.

Yea, that was a bad idea, EM was now furious and shrieking..

**EM**: Why do i HAVE to pay? The youth welfare office can pay for me!

Luckily my co-worker, a pretty cool lady in her mid forties, heard all the yelling and shrieking since she was working in the office next door, wandering over and asking about what happened. The EM suddenly an angel, telling how there have to be a mistake, her child got excluded from after school care and she can‚Äôt imagine why.

I handed my co-worker the letters she just tossed at me and quickly explained the situation which caused EM again to blow up. 

**EM:** I am a single mother, i can‚Äôt pay that monthly! (Excuse me, it‚Äôs 15 Euro for your god damn child.. Also yes.. The single mother card.)

**CC**: Well, the financial situation was stable enough as we checked it. Also, we sent multiple letters as reminder that the payment was still due. The exclusion is just the consequence of you not paying.

**EM**: I am not leaving until you take that back and my child is allowed to visit the after school care service!

**CC**: Sorry, that won‚Äôt happen, if you want to contradict the decision you are more than welcome to make an appointment with Insert Colleague Name here and discuss further payment plans. Otherwise i would suggest you to now leave this office or i am calling the security.

EM now all huffy puffy, slamming the office door and leaving, my head shaking as i couldn‚Äôt believe people like that exist.

A little background info which you could totally skip:

Basically every parent who wants help with paying the after school care fee‚Äôs gets checked in what kind of financial situation they are. Some have to pay nothing, some are stable enough and have to pay a tiny fee.

We are talking about 15 Euro instead of 370 Euro per month.

If you are late with your payment you get 2 letters and 1 month time to actually pay up before your kid gets excluded from the service.

So clearly the EM here just ignored every warning and rather spent her money on more fake fur coats. Let‚Äôs just hope this kid never gonna turn out like her mother."
aqm5f3,4,2019-02-14,Career Question -,Mscollins32,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/aqm5f3/career_question/,"Hi All, I am a 29 year old male INTJ with a question for the INTJ community. What process or method did you use to determine your profession or specific career field?

For background, I started my career in enterprise software sales and I was in that field for almost 5 years before a total burnout which, looking back, had a lot to do with spending a lot of my energy in areas that are simply difficult for me as an INTJ. 

While it can sometimes turn into a less than ideal habit, as an INTJ I like having an understanding of my options before I make a decision. Unfortunately, I was unaware of habit during my college years and spent those summers playing competitive baseball instead of testing out potential career fields through internships. And when the time came to figure out what I wanted to do upon graduation, my immediate response was, ""how would I know what I want to do without trying out different roles.""

I now find myself wanting to experience different roles that are specific to finance and investing but those fields have very high barriers to entry. 

My ideal situation would be the following -- spend a year working in 3 month cycles in a few  complimentary areas of finance that would allow me to continue develop skills in corporate valuation, financial modeling, and market research with the broader goal of understanding what separates great companies from simply mediocre or poor performing companies. 

Curious if anyone in the community has gone through a similar career transition, felt a desire to learn several different skills or specific knowledge, and then created a program that was somewhat unique that allowed them pursue these goals.

I'm an adult looking for other adults for online fictional fun.

No fancy introduction, here is a little list of prompts that might interest some of you ladies. 


* **The Free-minded Aunt**: You're my mother's sister, the kind of person that never grew out of your fun playful personality, always traveling and doing exhilarating stuff. You crash at our home to wind down from your last trip and notice something shifted in me. Is it you, or am I really looking at you with a new glimmer in my eyes? I've always been the good son to a point of being almost boring, so am I really staring at your bare legs and feet extended on the coffee table instead of watching TV? From there you could choose to find out the exact extent of my interest for you, teasing me and making me your favorite game while you're at your boring sister's. Can range from teasing me under the table during family dinner, and then barging in on me later as you know I'm masturbating the pressure away, to pretty much anything you'd fancy!

* **Bitchy Big Sister**: I'm your younger brother, and for some reason it feels that I'm almost always in your way or following you around for attention, asking things of you, chattering away, being generally noisy and annoying even though I don't do it on purpose. Or do I? One day as I wouldn't shut up during a family movie night, you were so fed up that you didn't even think when you put your hand on my crotch under the plaid, right beside mom and dad. The effect was so drastic and efficient that you had to leave your hand there, feeling the bulge growing increasingly under your fingers and palm. Then it started this little experiment for you to find new ways to shut me up by throwing me off in such a fashion, enjoying the sight of my face instantly melting as the train of thought derail and the incessant flow of words and noise comes to a sudden stop, to the point were at some point you start being the one following me around... you know... just to shut me up; 

* **Teasing Cousin**: One night during a family gathering at my house, as you noticed I had disappeared from the main room where the activity was, you looked for me in my room without thinking to knock. You still remember the intense guilty surprise in my eyes as you laid yours on my exposed manhood wrapped in your sock, that you removed earlier in the night after walking on a bit of water after a bathroom trip. You couldn't let that go, nor let me forget it, could you? Enjoying how I blushed each time we crossed eyes during the rest of the night, you couldn't help but subtly tease me to playfully increase my uneasiness in front of everyone. Bulging your cheek with your tongue while looking intently at me, whispering little comments without anyone but me hearing, only to get at me. Comments on the size of my dick, or on how frustrated I must be to do that, or asking if I'm a virgin, or plain asking me how hot I think you are, etc. 
The relief of seeing you leave was short lived when I received your first teasing SMS. After a couple hours (or days) or exchanges, your teasing tone started to shift ever so slowly to flirting. Asking sarcastically if I'm missing a sock or panties of yours, or if I can jerk of alright. Sending a pick of a pair of panties along with it. Then a pic of the same pair of panties, but wearing it. And so on.
All of this making me half excited half dreading the up and coming family trip...

- **Celebrity fanboy**: The setting would depend on our choice of celebrity, but I get to meet you, in total awe. Everything you say or do is completely amazing to me, so you decide it might be time to get yourself a new 'intern' to use at your leisure. 

- **Teacher Quandary**: I'm one of your numerous students, but to you it is obvious that I'm not just that. For some reason when I'm there it feels that there is a connection unlike with any other student. There is something about my eagerness that you can't really explain: is it a thirst for knowledge, or is it somehow directed towards you as a person?
From there it could go both ways: either you can't help but be flustered by my attention, and start dressing sexier when I'm there, dangling your heel in my vision as you know it mesmerizes me, until you can't help yourself anymore, and ask me to see you after-class, where you tell me to do as you say, if I want to pass this year.
Or maybe I'm the one initiating a private meeting with you after class, and tell you that I'll have my father the headmaster move you to another city if you don't let me rub my member on your pantyhose. Then every week I would ask to see you again, always having my way further with you.

Perhaps one of these will tickle your fancy! If so message me! Feel free to tweak any of them to your liking. E.g, although most of these prompts feature a female that's somewhat in control, or with the initiative, you might want to use one of these as a starting point, but slowly evolve to the opposite dynamic, where I gradually impose myself on you. 

If none of those inspire you, you might wanna check my historic. I wouldn't mind use one of these.


Girls with a liking (or who don't mind) playing a little around legs and feet will have my preference. But don't let that prevent you from messaging me if you really like one of these prompts, I'm not one of these guys that can't get off without it. 

It'd be nice if you include what you like and dislike in your first message, so we can soon get to the fun stuff ;)"
aqn3co,181,2019-02-14,Training abs after waking up? (Need some tips and questions),JoeSpaghetto,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/aqn3co/training_abs_after_waking_up_need_some_tips_and/,"As of last monday I've started with a graduation internship, which means the better part of my day is filled with work. Now I go to work at around 7 AM, but am usually already awake at 5.30. This gives me roughly 30-45 minutes to fill with either extra sleep (screw that, I'm already getting 7.5 hours every night) or something useful. I was thinking about doing an ab routine after waking up, since I dislike doing them in the gym after work because I already spend a lot of time doing my normal routine. I've read some posts saying situps arent good as they require spine flexion and the spine is stiff after waking up. 

Summarized:
- Following a PPL routine
- Want to work abs straight out of bed
- Unsure wether that is a good idea

Things I want to incorporate in ab routine:
- l-sit work/compression work (I have parallettes)
- Ab wheel rollouts 
- Half crunches (are they useful enough?)
- Exercise to improve dragon flag progression (lying leg lifts?)

Would really appreciate thoughts, tips and/or personal experience from you guys. I'll try to respond asap."

Jennifer was an intense athlete in high school.
She went on to be a star for the Carolina Phoenix (Women's semi-professional football) while coaching basketball at Greensboro College.

She was also selected as an intern for the Carolina Panthers last year which led her to getting this gig.

So now I have two teams, The Hotshots and the Express. Yes the Express. I watched a lot of underdog movies growing up and I'd rather pull for them than a fucking Atlanta team. 

Sorry for the ramble, definitely look into JKing. Not only one of the friendliest people you could meet; she has an incredible brain for sports and I think she's one to watch out for in terms of female football coaches. Thanks for listening to me rant about a friend from high school! Go EXPRESHOTS!

Edit: This is her twitter handle @JenniferKing5, and below is article that details her time with the Panthers.

The problem is that i always seem to get stuck at 170, will stay there for a while, and then shoot back up. 
In high school I went down from 200 to 170 over 2 years and felt great! My senior year I gained weight putting me back to 185 and after summer I was back to 190. 

Since starting college in fall 2017, I have gotten back down to 170 and I am just hovering here! I‚Äôm worried that I will go back. I‚Äôm at a wall and it is very frustrating. I have managed to get down to 168 and without changing anything I will gain back the two pounds. 

I do not currently go to the gym as I have 17 credit hours, a job, and an internship with my professor. I do my best to make any healthy eating choices that I can. 

Is there any way to get over this wall? "

I asked a lot of these questions in my internship supervision but I still don't feel like I have a confident response in mind for if/when these come up as I begin my career. 

These are a few scenarios that I wonder about and know I need to be prepared for:

1-a client has a psychotic outburst in the waiting area or in session, how should I respond?  Do you try to engage the client or does it depend on the severity?

2-a client calls you and says they have a knife/gun whatever/ and they are going to kill themselves at that moment

3-client gets triggered/angry in session and tries to hurt you?

4-you find out a client is neglecting/abusing her child?

I'll be graduating in a few months as well as looking for a new job and trying to pass my classes while I intern here. 

You can imagine my level of stress, holy shit.

Maybe this is premature, but I've been doing IF since Sunday and I didn't even think I could do it for a DAY, let alone almost a week. 

Is it normal that I'm immediately seeing a difference? For the most part, I'm doing low-carb, CICO and IF. 

I wake up a little hungry and think ""Ugh, how am I going to get through this? But then I just do what I have to do and before I know it, it's time to EAT babeeey! 

So far the progress I've seen:

1. **My willpower has increased.** I really, really, REALLY love Five Guys. I LOVE sushi. I can't get enough donuts or french fries or chicken wraps. But every time I'm like ""damn, I really really want that right now..."", I can easily push that thought out of my head. Additionally, if I do want something, and think ""Hey it fits in with my calories for the day!"" I also think ""But do I really want to ruin this by eating sugar/sweets/carbs and ending up hungry an hour later?""

2. **Motivation to cook has increased.** For the past few months I've been telling myself that I want to cook and blah blah blah. Never happens. Well, I did it. I finally cooked a low-carb meal and it was tasty and I MEAL PLANNED and it was CHEAP. Never done that before!!

3. **No longer obsessed with food.** I get my snacks for the week. Peanut butter, yogurt, veggie straws (not the best, carb-wise or money wise, but they do actually help for my cravings). I eat those and that's it. I used to really constantly think about my next meal. ""What fast food place will I get food from? Should I stop and get snacks? What will I binge?"" Not anymore.

4. **Less hungry.** I fucking love rice, fries, mashed potatoes, chips, so on and so forth. My diet ~~is~~ was full of carbs and that always made me so goddamn hungry. I'd be absolutely starving right now, but all I've had today was yogurt and some veggie straws and I'm legit, barely hungry. 


My only concern is that I want a burger. I do, genuinely want to pig out on a five guys burger and some fries. Do I have space to do that with this diet? I can't imagine I do, if I want to stay low carb, right?

Does anyone here not do low-carb and still see results?

aqpb38,2,2019-02-14,Ex-girlfriend (23f) lies about her ex-boyfriend and keeps me (29m) a secret from him in a regular talks. Right decision to end things after giving her multiple chances?,throwaway20190214ra,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aqpb38/exgirlfriend_23f_lies_about_her_exboyfriend_and/," Hello Reddit :) 

  
  I am afraid that this is going to be a long read and I really hope that some of you can stay with me and give me some advice on my situation. Maybe this TLDR at the beginning might increase your interest ‚Äì **TLDR**:

My ex-Brazilian queen (23f) turned out to be a master of lying. Talked almost daily to her ex-boyfriend (two years together), while hiding it from me and me from him. Only found out after she spent a week with him in New York. Kept on lying about telling him about us. Prefers to keep love letters to and from him on Facebook from 1.5 years ago, but deletes my message/image of us thanking her for our six months together after her return to Brazil and never posted anything about us. I decided to say tchau (goodbye). Right choice? 

  
  I met my (29m) now ex-girlfriend (23f) on Tinder in April. We instantly started to talk a lot and I learned that she was from Brazil doing a one-year internship in the city that I worked at.  
Since she said she was a bit shy, we decided to talk some more before having our first date.  
When we did, we quickly realized that we had many things and interests in common. Date number one and three we spent 5-6 hours each together and the time just flew by - it was really great. That's when we basically started dating...and when things got a bit complicated sometimes.  
When things bothered her, she sometimes didn't tell me, but instead started trying to hurt me emotionally or suddenly blocked me on WhatsApp. 

  
On our first trip together two months after our first date in June, she said that she loved me for the first time, only to tell me three days later during an unnecessary argument about a simple misunderstanding that she loved a friend called Jason (not the real name) - that he was the best person she knew.   
I had noticed before that she had been talking to this guy on WhatsApp sometimes when we had been together. Once when she was jealous of an old school friend at a concert we both attended, she tried making me jealous by talking to him. But I didn't care and just let her talk to her friend, because I do know that women can be friends with men.  
That was the first red flag concerning Jason (in addition to some of the other general ones that you might have noticed).   
After that things continued to be awesome for the most parts with some arguments in-between, i.e. blocking me when I take more than an hour or two responding to a WhatsApp message when I'm with friends playing video games. After some time she always said she knew it was wrong and that she would try to be better. She did get better, but it still kept on happening.  


**Fast forward to October/November:**  
I had organized and helped her move, we had made plans and bought tickets to attend two concerts of two bands that I introduced her to that we both really loved - something that we both seemed to be looking forward to at that time.  
One day she said that a friend of hers asked her if she wanted to go to New York. She told me that if she went, she wouldn't be able to got to the concerts. But since it was a dream of hers to go to New York, I recommended her to go since I had been there twice before and I knew how nice it was. So I told her to not worry about me and go there with her friend.  


When doing the check-in the evening before we had some issues so she asked her friend that was going there with her - Jason.  
I immediately had a bad feeling. When she had travelled before she had always mentioned the friends' names, but that time she only told me the day before - it felt strange.  
But I tried to cover my feelings and we proceeded as planned, including driving her to the train station at 5 am.  
During her stay in New York I started to feel weird. I felt like she barely took any time and barely made any effort to talk to me. I started questioning if Jason was just a regular friend as I knew that she had gotten out of a two year relationship just five months before we met. A relationship that had to end against her/their will due to her ex-boyfriend moving abroad for a few years to do his PhD.  
So I just asked her openly:

&gt;*Hey, you said Jason is a friend of yours. I am wondering, is he a regular friend or is he your ex-boyfriend that you talked about?*  


After evading/ignoring the question a few times, she said that he was just a friend who she met in Brazil. At first I believed / wanted to believe her.  


But then I thought to myself: why didn't she tell me before about him being a friend? Why did she hide his name and ignore my question?  


So I remembered that there were a few images of them together on Facebook with long texts in Portuguese. I had found them by accident when I missed her when she was on a vacation with friends. That time I hadn't thought that much about it and, of course, didn't translate the messages as I don't understand Portuguese :D  


Although I'm not proud of it, but with these doubts, I decided to translate them and check if he's really just a friend.  
But immediately the first image I found turned out to be love letter from her to him...and there were many...monthly/yearly anniversaries of their relationship...and finally the notification when the relationship had started.  


I felt crushed!!! I immediately told her that it was over!  


However, stupid and naive me continued to talk about it and she seemed sorry. So we decided to talk in person.  
She explained that she didn't know how to handle this, that she didn't want to hurt me. I asked her if something happened between the two of them and she swore that it didn't, amongst others, because it might have have given them hope about possibly being together (sic).  
I told her that I believe her and that I will try and forgive her for lying, if she did two things;

* never lie to me again
* tell her ex-boyfriend about me so that we three are on the same page, because it feels immature and hurts my feelings to be kept a secret. And that this shouldn't be an issue if they were just friends.

She said she would do both.  


**Fast forward to January/February 2019:**  
She had returned to Brazil and seeing her leave was really hard, especially since we spent the last two days together with her parents and twin sister. I even was there for her on the phone in the middle of the night when she had her connecting flights, since I didn't want her to be alone as her family took different flights. We continued to talk and everything seemed to be as good as possible considering the break up, the distance and the occasional arguments.  
...until my birthday arrived.  
It started off with an amazing and lovely message and call with her at midnight - telling me again that she loves me, wants to be with me and that I'm the best.  
But it had kept on bothering me that she hadn't told him and that she had kept on ""hiding"" me from him as well as on her social media, after regularly (daily) posting stories and pictures of herself and her friends on Instagram - so I honestly told her about my feelings.  


I let her know that she continues to hurt my feelings by not telling him and only posting pictures with her friends.  
I told her that I understand that it is difficult to tell Jason and that it does not have to be now, but that I think that it is the right thing to do for all of us - also for him. However, she said that she understood what I meant, but that she didnt care about him and didnt talk to him at the moment, so that there was no reason for me to think about that. Still we agreed that she would think about her feelings and I would give her time.

This basically was the beginning of the end. 

  
  About one week after this discussion, she abruptly broke up with me with a WhatsApp message while I was at work. When we talked about it in the evening, she said that she needed more time to think about everything, in order to find out what she wanted to do with her life, including deciding if she wanted to return to study in Germany and to be with me. When talking about this, she finally admitted that she still cared about Jason and didnt want to hurt him by telling him about us. When I told her how much it hurt me to see her caring more about her ex-boyfriend's feelings (the past) than mine (present), she simply responded that I should not be that dramatic and that I should just forget Jason and the love letters, which she supposedly didnt care about, but which she still wanted to keep. Due to the different lies, I told her that although I wanted to believe her, I needed some small sign that she cared about my feelings and that she didnt try to hide me. Despite saying that she could post something, she continued to evade and point out that I hadnt posted anything either. In order for her to see that I can easily do this for her, I decided to post my first image overall/ever on both Facebook and Instagram for her. Since I knew that we broke up, I only thanked her for the amazing time as well as the many unforgettable moments together. However, the moment she saw these posts, she immediately deleted the image on Facebook on her wall and her name on the image on Instagram. Following that she told me to stop doing that. 

  
  While I was afraid that this might happen, as I thought she might not want mutual friends of hers and Jason to see the image and tell him, I somehow still hoped that she would not mind or maybe do something similar. I never told her to stop talking to Jason. I encouraged her to treat him like a normal friend, including being able to talk about him or rant about arguments with him. I told her that I would help her find a way to tell him and that I only needed to know that she would tell him fairly soon. Of course, I also did not tell her to delete the love letters from 1.5 years ago. I just wanted a small sign that I am not a secret that she keeps and that she cares about my feelings and does not put Jason's first. 

  
  However, since I have the feeling that she could not and cannot do it, I told her today that she can remove me from her future plans as I finally realized that I truly deserve a woman who treats me better. 

* Did I make the right decision?
* Do you have any advice on how to be better myself in such situations?
* Anything you have to add that might help me in the future?

This is just my second relationship after previously being in a relationship for nine years. And no, I did not tell my girlfriend as I do not talk to her anymore. However, I would not hesitate to tell her about a new girlfriend I talked to her on a regular basis, since I think that this is the right and mature thing to do for all of the people involved.   
  Thank you very much / Vielen Dank

aqpi7x,5,2019-02-14,Say her name! LAREEB KHAN (19).,rebeldreams,islam_ahmadiyya_de,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam_ahmadiyya_de/comments/aqpi7x/say_her_name_lareeb_khan_19/,"# ""Bitte rette mich, hol mich hier raus, im Sterben ist es nicht so schlimm wie hier. Auf die Hochzeit kann ich ewig warten, aber nicht hier."" (Lareeb zu ihrem Freund)

One Billion, also eine Milliarde - das ist die Zahl der Frauen, die weltweit Opfer von Gewalt werden. Seit 2013 protestieren deshalb Frauen weltweit am 14. Februar tanzend auf den Stra√üen, um auf das Problem aufmerksam zu machen. Wir haben uns deshalb am heutigen Tag entschieden, an den Mord an unserer geliebten Schwester Lareeb Khan (19) zu erinnern, ihrem Leid zu gedenken und an die Jamaat zu mahnen, die Repressionen gegen Liebe und Sexualit√§t sowie die Ungleichbehandlung von Ahmadi-Frauen, die weiterhin Gang und G√§be sind, zu stoppen.

Die Ermordung von Lareeb wurde in der Jamaat, wie ihr wisst, schnell bekannt. ***'Alle waren schockiert und trauerten'*** \- so lauten zumindest die g√§ngigen Erz√§hlungen. Doch wir wissen alle: nicht jeder in der Jamaat hat so empfunden. Vielmehr gab es nach dem Mord an Lareeb eine Reihe an Ph√§nomenen in der Jamaat, die uns bis heute sehr w√ºtend machen. Wir beobachteten neben den vielen verlogenen Bekundungen von Trauer vor allem **Schuldzuweisungen an Lareeb** (Victim Blaming) und **Schuldabweisungen von der Jamaat**. Es gab seitens der Jamaat keine Zugest√§ndnisse oder strukturellen √Ñnderungen. Sie war eher darum bem√ºht ihr **Image zu sch√ºtzen und jene Geschwister zu sanktionieren,** die intern die Repression von Liebe und Sexualit√§t anprangerten und den Mord skandalisierten.¬†

***'Lareeb h√§tte es selbst √ºbertrieben, es wurden halt Kondome in ihrer Tasche gefunden'; 'Sie h√§tte ihre Eltern eben w√ºtend gemacht und ihre Ermordung provoziert'.***¬†

All diese Aussagen stellen Formen des **Victim Blamings** dar, die wir nur zu gut aus der Gewalt gegen Frauen kennen. Statt sich mit den T√§tern von sexualisierter Gewalt zu besch√§ftigen, werden meist die Frauen, die Gewalt erfahren haben, beschuldigt, Gewalt aufgrund ihrer Handlungen oder Kleidungspraktiken erst provoziert zu haben. Gewalt wird so gerechtfertigt. Das ist keine gute Sache.¬†Gleichzeitig versuchte die Jamaat sich rein zu waschen, indem sie argumentierte, alles Erdenkliche getan zu haben, um die Gewalttat an Lareeb zu verhindern. An anderer Stelle h√∂rten wir auch, dass einzig und allein die Eltern, die selbst sehr aktive Mitglieder der Jamaat waren, verantworlich w√§ren f√ºr den Mord - dabei wurden auch viele rassistische Narrative reproduziert: ***'Die haben das getan, weil sie einen pakistanischen Hintergrund haben'*****;** ***'Die Eltern haben einen niedrigen Bildungsstatus'; 'Dieses Ehrding kommt daher, dass die Familie Khan paschtunisch ist'***; *‚ÄûNach Deutschland kamen eher pakistanische Ahmadis aus bildungsferneren Schichten‚Äú* (Khola H√ºbsch in der Welt vom 02.11.2015).

Wir aber glauben, dass die **Jamaat eine Mitverantwortung hat, weil sie aufgrund ihrer Regeln eine diskriminierende Atmosph√§re schafft,** die Gewalt an Frauen erst m√∂glich macht. Zu diesen Regeln z√§hlen wir die Kopftuchpflicht, das Verbot von vor- und au√üerehelichen Liebesbeziehungen, das Verbot von Homosexualit√§t, das Ben√∂tigen eines m√§nnlichen Vormundes f√ºr die Frau bei der Hochzeit¬†und der Rauswurf von Frauen, die au√üerhalb der Jamaat heiraten. All diese Regeln kommen vom Khalifen, nicht von den pakistanischen Gro√üeltern der Betroffenen. Dass Frau H√ºbsch kommentiert: *‚ÄûEs gibt viele mediale Labels f√ºr solche Taten. Dabei k√∂nnen die ganz pers√∂nlichen, inneren Konflikte und Probleme der T√§ter auch aus dem Fokus geraten‚Äú* stellt f√ºr uns nur einen erneuten Versuch dar, von eben diesen wahren Atmosph√§ren und Repressionen in der Jamaat abzulenken - nicht zuletzt, um das Image der Jamaat zu sch√ºtzen.

Auf den folgenden Seiten von **Peri e.v., eines Vereins f√ºr Menschenrechte und Integration, findet Ihr eine ausf√ºhrliche** [**Akte**](https://www.peri-ev.de/aktuell/fall-lareeb-khan/) zu dem Mord an unserer Schwester Lareeb mit Gerichtsbeobachtungen zu dem Prozess und einen **kritischen** [**Kommentar**](https://www.peri-ev.de/aktuell/fall-lareeb-khan/kommentar/) zu dem Auftreten der Jamaat bzw. den Aussagen von √∂ffentlichen Jamaat-VertreterInnen. Hier einige Ausschnitte aus dem Kommentar von Britta Biehl:¬†

* *""Die angeklagten Eltern haben diese Lehre viel zu sehr verinnerlicht. Herr Wagishauser hat im Prozess sehr sch√∂n dargelegt, unter welchem Druck zum einen erwachsene, unverheiratete Kinder (besonders nat√ºrlich Frauen) stehen und zum anderen deren Eltern.""*
* *""Von den Eltern wird verlangt, dass sie sich zwischen ihren T√∂chtern oder der Gemeinde entscheiden. Zumindest wird verlangt, dass die Eltern Probleme mit den Kindern der Gemeinde nicht verschweigen, denn wenn sie sie verschweigen und sie dringen an die √ñffentlichkeit, dann werden auch die Eltern aus der Gemeinde ausgesto√üen ‚Äì auch dies keine pakistanische Regel, sondern eine der Ahmadiyya.""*
* *""Ja, die Eltern von Lareeb f√ºhlten sich offenbar verloren. Aber keineswegs, weil sie nicht in Pakistan lebten, sondern weil ihr einziger Kontakt au√üerhalb der Familie die Ahmadiyya-Gemeinde war, die jeglichen Kontakt zwischen einem unverheirateten Mann und einer unverheirateten Frau als ‚Äûgegen den Islam‚Äú bezeichnete.""*¬†

&amp;#x200B;

**Was denkt Ihr zum Mord an Lareeb und zur Mitverantwortung unserer Jamaat? Teilt Euch hier gerne mit und verarbeitet Eure Wut und Trauer mit uns!**

Liebe Gr√º√üe,

aqt1yk,14,2019-02-14,"Belgium, exposed",h3lsinginyliopisto,belgium,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/aqt1yk/belgium_exposed/,"I'm an American college student and did an internship in Belgium last summer as a part of my university studies. I've never traveled abroad and the only information I knew about Belgium were from the internet (lots of strikes, too much bureaucracy, terrorism threats, dirty and unsafe capital city). Actually, I wanted to do my internship in Germany, Switzerland, or the Scandinavian countries, which have a much better reputation in my mind, but I got placed in Belgium, a small country that I barely even knew existed. But I was determined to make the most of it, so I rented a bike and during my free time (bless the Belgian work culture for the lack of overtime work on the weekends) cycled around the  country, departing from my apartment in Brussels every Friday or Saturday morning and returning at night. I had never biked such great distances before, but living in Brussels was rough: the metro doors didn't automatically open, the checkout line at Delhaize was long, and I could never figure out which color trashbag to put out on which day. But it was what I saw during my bike trips to other cities that was really shocking.

* Leuven - This was the first bike trip I made. I rented the bike on Friday after work from a lovely shop in Ixelles and followed the Google Maps route that took me on dirt ""paths"" that ran through farmers' cornfields. I was minding my own business, biking alongside a tractor that was harvesting corn. The sun started setting, I was on a dirt path in the middle of nowhere, I felt a bit stressed, but eventually I emerged out of the forest near Gasthuisberg and saw a ton of construction work going on (a promising sign of civilization!), probably the first and only time I was delighted to see construction work in Belgium. I wandered around Grote Markt on a Friday night (Leuven seems like an amazing town to be a college kid), ate some McDonald's, and ogled at a Facebook-themed restaurant called FaceFood. The ride back to Brussels was brutally cold and a bit spooky though. In comparison to Leuven, the nightlife in Zaventem on a Friday night seemed quite dreadful, and the whole place seemed eery. Interesting story: when cycling down Wezembeekstraat (Zaventem) at night, there are absolutely no streetlights along the stretch of road that runs beneath the E40 motorway, which results in you plunging downhill into complete darkness, hoping for the best. It also doesn't help that when you come out on the (south) side of the tunnel, there are still no streetlights, the road narrows to one lane, and you're surrounded by cornfields. I thought I made a wrong turn and ended up in the wilderness again, but I thankfully saw lights in the distance and eventually made it to Kraainem metro station, where I bought myself a lemonade to rejoice and rejuvenate.
* Antwerp - It was rainy that morning, but I set out from my Brussels apartment and squeezed my bike onto a tram full of annoyed Docks Bruxsel shoppers and got off at the northernmost station. Followed the canal up to a town called Boom, but the bridge was closed so I took a ferry across the river (the first, and arguably most important, Dutch word I learned during my stay in Belgium was ""Omleiding""). Along the way, whenever I stopped to rest in these small villages, a lot of elderly Belgian villagers would always look at me as if they'd never seen a Chinese/Asian-looking person in their village before, so I felt special. After crossing the river at Boom, I biked along the A12 motorway (a bit depressing), had a nice McChicken in Aartselaar, and biked on. When I reached Antwerp, I was concerned because there were so many serious looking men wearing black clothes and black hats on the streets, so I thought there was some sort of dress code in the city that I wasn't aware of, but it turns out Saturdays are like this in Antwerp. I sat by the river Scheldt (which, unbeknownst to me, I would see again a few weeks later), poked around the H&amp;M, and took a train back to Brussels that night..
* Halle - originally, I had planned to bike to this town first, as a ""test run"" before biking to places further away, so I rented a Villo! bicycle at Stalle (Brussels) and furiously peddled my way towards Halle, but later gave up. The second time around, I rented a proper bicycle, leisurely biked along the canal down to Halle's Grote Markt (seems every place has one?!), ate a ""McKroket"" delicacy, and bought some oily fried dough balls from a food truck. Biking back to my apartment in Brussels, I realized that drivers in Brussels really have some sort of vendetta against cyclists. There were some weirdos near the Midi station too. The dough balls were good though.
* Ghent - this was an.. interesting trip. I set off from Brussels, biked through Asse and laughed, and ate a McChicken in Aalst, where I almost ran over some tourists. I decided that biking along the motorway was too boring, so I followed the river Dender up to Dendermonde, ate another McChicken, and ran a red light (whoops, I thought bikers were exempt), but some police officers just happened to be nearby, and they yelled something to me and motioned for me to stop, but I couldn't understand what they were saying, so they let me go (Chinese privilege?). Then I followed the river Scheldt, specifically the jaagpad (yes my Dutch was getting proficient at this point), but apparently there was some running race or marathon going on and part of the jaagpad was fenced off near Wichelen, but while the volunteer helpers weren't looking, I snuck onto the jaagpad and continued biking (didn't see any runners though?) until the finish line, where there were a bunch of people cheering, but they stopped when they saw me on a bike. Later on, I got really hungry and delirious while biking through the countryside, but like an angel appearing out of thin air, the Smatch supermarket in Schellebelle materialized, and I bought a pack of packaged Belgian waffles (didn't know people in Belgium actually ate this). I arrived in Gent at sundown, which was surprisingly deserted, and wandered around Korenmarkt for an hour or so. For the first time during my stay in Belgium, I saw an interracial group of friends hanging out in the Korenmarkt McDonald's, which was housed in a building with tasteful architecture (no pun). I didn't want to see the Belgian police twice in one day, but the tram ticket machine at Korenmarkt wasn't working, so I just got on board and prayed I would get to Gent-Sint-Pieters. At the train station, I asked the ticket lady if I could buy a ticket with my credit card (the food truck outside had only taken cash), and she dramatically proclaimed ""yes, young man, this is a free country and you are free to do that"". I didn't know what she was insinuating. Maybe De Lijn had informed her that I was a free rider.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have faint memories of my internship in Brussels, which was about helping extremely smart PhDs solve EU problems, if I recall correctly. Funnily, I only had 1-2 Belgian coworkers and didn't socialize outside of work, so I still don't know where all the Belgian people are. Regardless, I got to experience a side of your country that no guidebook or travel agency ever mentions, and those are the memories that still stick with me today. If I ever get the privilege to visit Belgium again, I can only imagine all the adventures I'll have (maybe I'll even bike to Wallonia).

aqtqfl,2,2019-02-15,AITA for not appreciating my mom,youngdumbandghost,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aqtqfl/aita_for_not_appreciating_my_mom/,"My parents got divorced 12 years ago. My dad started using drugs and my mom had a new relationship about once a month and we moved in with a new boyfriend about once a year.  One of these boyfriends was incredibly creepy and I told my mom I didn't feel comfortable with him at the house.  My mom told me I couldn't live at home anymore (I was 14) forcing me to live full time with my dad and his girlfriend who were always high on meth and couldn't provide basic necessities. Turns out I was right about the creep boyfriend and my mom ended up getting a 15 year restraining order, which she still has never admitted to (despite me being a protected party on the order). 

I ended up living with my paternal grandparents.  My mom has a good job and my grandparents weren't my legal guardians and don't have a ton of money.  When I first moved in, my mom kept paying for my health insurance and cell phone. When I was 15 this stopped and my grandparents took care of me. I got my GED equivalent and started community college at 16 and worked at a doctor's office to pay for school, food, gas, etc. with help of my grandparents. I barely spoke to my mom until I transferred to a top university at 18, at which point my mom reentered my life.  This is when she began taking credit for me getting into this school, apparently telling people at her work and family friends she helped me with my applications and essays helping me to get in (my mom never even saw an application let alone helped me with one). My mom sent me the odd $100 but my grandparents kept paying for my phone and I paid for everything else with student loans, grants, and scholarships. I moved in with my mom after college while I waited to start law school, she helped with my phone bill and didn't make me pay rent (which I am very grateful for) while I worked to pay my other expenses. 

I started law school and my mom paid for my flights home for the holidays so I could spend them with her and her family.  She also paid for a flight home for me to interview. However, all rent, tuition, etc. was paid with student loans and money I made working as a paralegal during law school. My mom let me stay with her one summer during law school so I could intern somewhere in her area and not pay rent, she also rented me a car so I could get to and from work. While I was studying for the bar my mom told me I could stay with her.  Her ex-boyfriend who I had a good relationship with helped me pay for my bar prep and to get a car. My mom wasn't with him at the time but obviously if they hadn't dated this wouldn't have happened. 

The day I started studying for the bar, every hour I would get a call to come downstairs to help her do something like move furniture or watch her try on new outfits.  Anytime I would say I needed to study she said I was lying to get out of helping her. Needless to say, I wasn't getting any studying done. My mom kicked me out for ""disrespecting"" her (per my mom no one has any respect for her so I cannot provide you with specifics as to what I think she meant by that) and thankfully I was able to stay at my maternal aunt's. Meanwhile, my dad got sober and he and I started rebuilding our relationship. My mom constantly fought with me about my relationship with my dad and my maternal aunt that summer. I moved out of the area for work and things with my mom got better. However, my brother moved home and now any time her and my brother fight, she calls me and tries to involve me in the fight. Every time this ends with my mom wanting to talk about all the sacrifices she made for me and how she never did anything for herself - this always seem out of left field to me since, again, these convos are about her and my brother.  Also, for some background, my mom dated all sorts of guys regardless of how they treated me or my brother, she buys all sorts of designer clothes, goes on all sorts of vacations, always has a new BMW, meanwhile from age 14 until very recently I was constantly concerned about whether I would have enough money for food, gas, utilities, etc. She then compares her sacrifices to my ""selfish"" father and wants to talk about all the ""terrible"" things he did and tell me what a ""piece of shit"" I am for wanting a relationship with him.  She tells me all she has ever done has been there for me and that everything I have in life I owe to her. Today I finally said I couldn't be spoken to this way anymore, that she made a lot of mistakes too not just my dad, that I am tired of being manipulated, and that what I have, I worked for. Am I the asshole for saying/ thinking these things I mean it is true that she has helped me out in many ways? I am grateful for what she has done, but I don't agree that I owe everything to her or that she has made many sacrifices for me, but she seems so convinced I am starting to worry that I'm the asshole."
aqtqhe,9,2019-02-15,Primerica Rep. came to recruit in my store,White_Columbia,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/aqtqhe/primerica_rep_came_to_recruit_in_my_store/,"So I work at a sub shop by the college I attend and a well dressed young man walked in while we were in the middle of lunch rush and looked at me in an odd fashion. He stared me down and after I met eyes with him he walked over really slowly and got in the way of me sweeping the mess someone had made and asked what my name was. This guy looked really familiar like I‚Äôve met him or seen him before.  Having a bad vibe from him and his abrupt question I reply with a fake name. 

// It‚Äôs Andrew! How can I help you?

** Hello Andrew my name is -Blank-! I see your working really hard making someone else rich! 

// What are you talking about?! (Rudely) 

** I just looked through the window looking to get some food but instead I saw a young man wasting his life stuck in a dead end job making someone else rich! 

// Well I like what I do and I‚Äôm almost done with nursing school! If you need help someone else can assist you I‚Äôm sorry but we‚Äôre busy and I have to clean then hop back on the register. 

** Well it just so happened I do have a question just for you! 

// What might that be? 

** How would you like to turn your life around and make money in a more professional setting? No need to shave everyday or wear that silly apron! You look like a young man who belongs in an office with a nice shirt and tie! I just so happened to have lost a member of my team because they pursued other interests and I have room for one more! What do you say? 

// And what company or team do you work for exactly? 

** My teams name is actually the Big Bosses and the company is called Primerica! We have offices all over the nation and we split the office up into teams to see who can get the most work done! It‚Äôs a game in a way and the team with the most earnings gets rewards and cash prizes on top of a 6 figure paycheck! 

// Well that‚Äôs nice! But I enjoy what I do and with college and my current job I can‚Äôt handle anymore. 

** Well it can be a side job! Yea that‚Äôs it! A SIDE JOB! 
(Gets in my face)

// Look sir, I love who I work with and the company I work for! Plus I‚Äôm in college and my internship I do weekend pays me well and keeps me busy and with school rolled in I have NO TIME for ‚ÄúGames‚Äù as you call them. Please leave me to my work. 

** (Eyes my co-workers busting ass on the other side of the counter cooking and slicing meat and making subs) Well would any of them be interested in my amazing opportunity since you don‚Äôt know a good one when you see one? 

// No. I think I speak for my TEAM when I say we aren‚Äôt interested! 

** (Backs up finally) Fine. But take my cards and hand them out! It‚Äôs a life changing opportunity I swear it! Anyway have a good day! (Leaves in a hurry after staring over the counter more) 

// (Looks back at counter and sees manager on shift giving this guy a dirty look) 

~~~~~~&lt;&lt;&lt;~~~~~~~&gt;&gt;&gt;~~~~~~

Manager: Michelangelo! See me in the back! 

// Copy all! 

Manager: Who was that guy and what did he want? 

// He said his name was -Blank- and that he wants me to join his team and make bank. 

Manager: I see him a lot walking in and around stores asking people shit and I don‚Äôt like the looks of him! What did he hand you? 

// His cards and he told me to hand them out because they ‚ÄúChange lives‚Äù or something. (Extends cards towards Manager) 

Manager: Gimme that! (Snatches and rips cards up) The logo on top was all I had to see! If you see him again tell him to get out politely and if he still doesn‚Äôt go or try‚Äôs talking to you come grab me or Assistant Manager ASAP! 

// Yes sir! I understand! 

Manager: Good! And I‚Äôm sorry if I scared you raising my voice, (As he‚Äôs always calm and has an even temper and voice even when he‚Äôs stressed) But stay away from him! He‚Äôs trouble! 

// I understand! I‚Äôm sorry! I‚Äôll get back to work man, we‚Äôre getting slammed on phone orders and I have to cash them out! 

Manager: Just do them in the back! It‚Äôs more quiet and you can think so you don‚Äôt mess up any of the big ticket orders! 

// (Listens and takes all orders to the back of house) 

It being silent and doing boring computer work for about an hour it got me thinking of where I knew him from or where I‚Äôve seen him before. 

Then I thought back to when I was almost sucked into Primerica after high school and how it consumed and ruined a lot of good people I knew. I also remembered the man that walked in as one of the upline people to one of my friends that tried recruiting me. He wasn‚Äôt out to help. He recruited all my friends and after ruining they‚Äôre lives with his crap he dropped them for not being profitable! I wish I could have remembered when I met him so I could have told him off! And along with this post in a day or two or even in a few hours I might post my high school story as well. Just be safe out there guys cause they‚Äôre recruiting in stores now! Stay blessed! "
aquj2r,17,2019-02-15,Organized a V-Day Speed Dating Event in a predominately White and Asian town and got 0 matches,enchantedhlth,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/aquj2r/organized_a_vday_speed_dating_event_in_a/,"In honour of being a fabulous single pringle this Valentine‚Äôs Day, I thought I‚Äôd share the story of how I organized (and was forced to participate in) a Valentine‚Äôs Day Speed Dating during my internship semester. 

**Note:** It‚Äôs great to read to read the OkCupid study about Race and Attraction that was released a few years ago for context: https://theblog.okcupid.com/race-and-attraction-2009-2014-107dcbb4f060

Some background: This dating event took place in my university town right being my renowned Engineering, Math and Computer Science-oriented university (town has 2 universities, 1 college total) and was my boss‚Äôs idea. I, being a lowly intern, did her bidding and executed a hell of a cute, fun, speed dating event! I would‚Äôve had an even more positive memory of that event if I wasn‚Äôt forced to participate (more on this later)...

Here it goes: During the planning process, my boss placed a huge emphasis on attracting girls to the event (lowering ticket costs for girls who brought friends and advertising in mainly female spaces) as the first time the event was run, there was a shortage of women and a waiting list of men. I heeded this warning and worked my ass off trying to get my coworkers and friends at school to buy tickets online. Our 20 male tickets **sold out** in **less than 2 days**. Our female tickets however, were not filled until literally 15 minutes before the actual event! 

We were up to 19 women and my boss volun-told me to participate since it was my event after all and because we needed an even number stat! My boss and I are also quite close so she really wanted me to put myself out there and meet some guys just for fun. So, I succumbed to pressure and signed up as the 20th girl. 

The night of the event, I got my face beat to the *gawds* by my aspiring MUA friend, put on a cute dress and heeled booties and ventured out into the semi-unknown. DISCLAIMER: Since I was the organizer, I had control of the Eventbrite account so I did a thorough Googling of many of the guys and set my sights on some of them (creepy, yeah but I couldn‚Äôt go in *that* blindly!) 

The set-up of the event had a jar of questions and a board game at the table with women being stationary and men rotating every 2-3 minutes. 

Now for the deets on the guys: The majority of the men were East Asian with the rest being evenly split between White and South Asian guys. The women were an even split between White, Asian, and biracial (Black and White &amp; Asian and White) with me as the only Black girl. 

I maintained a bubbly, friendly, and chill vibe with steady, interesting conversation with each guy. I had (or at least I thought I had) some pretty cool conversations and games with the guys who were receptive and not the few archetypal Silicon Valley socially awkward computer dudes (a lotta love for people like them but some of them didn‚Äôt know when to start or stop speaking or how to maintain eye contact or read or give social cues. I kept the same demeanour with those guys but they weren‚Äôt all that receptive.) 
A couple of guys I hit it off with even started chatting me up during the cocktail hour and continued our initial convos. 

**The twist came in at the end of the night.**

My boss (acting as the organizer to protect my identity as a participant) gave the instruction for all the participants to write down the names of the people they were interested in and hand them in. *Keep in mind* that I was also responsible for sending thank you/match emails after the event to inform everyone of their matches (or lack thereof). This made for a hella awkward situation at the event after everyone cleared out. 

I took a look at the matches in the envelope and separated the match slips into female and male piles and naturally, I searched for my name on the male match slips: 

**I found my name on *one*.** I don‚Äôt mean to sound entitled or like I was the best participant out there or anything ridiculous like that but it did come as a surprise to me as I felt that I put my best smile, looks, and personality out that night. Also, the one guy that put my name down put *every. single. girl‚Äôs name down.* So nothing special lmao! 

One trend that I noticed was the types of girls that were the most matched: ALL the White girls were put down on every single male match slip (with the exception of one girl who was overweight) and lots of the Asian girls and both biracial girls. I do understand that same race attraction is kind of the norm with most races but it became negligible with the Asian and biracial girls. One thing that really boggled my mind, was that the girls with the most matches (the White girls and one Asian girl) were EXTREMELY RUDE during the speed dating event to the boys. These girls frequently rolled their eyes during and after their mini-dates and loudly chatted to the girls next to them about how socially awkward/not very good-looking/or ‚Äúgross‚Äù their previous guy was when the seat was still warm! Evidently, the guys didn‚Äôt care and still overwhelmingly chose these girls. 

If anyone is curious for the remainder of the results, only 2 girls were matched once or not at all and they were both really cute (imo) girls who happened to be overweight (1 White, 1 Asian). 

Many of the most popular female matches asked my boss to not give their info to their matches (they asked, ‚ÄúDo we HAVE to put someone‚Äôs name down?‚Äù) and did not follow-up with their matches.

Guess you live and you learn! All in all, it was an interesting and stand-out Valentine‚Äôs Day experience that I wanted to share with y‚Äôall üíï

P.S. Hope I didn‚Äôt sound entitled, rude or judgemental and that I didn‚Äôt offend anyone! I just wanted to share the objective facts of the situation. 

TLDR: Knew the results of the OkCupid Study were factual but I was still shook when I was confronted with the realities of dating as a Black woman at a speed dating event (got 0 real matches). "

aqw6hz,22,2019-02-15,I failed High-school and became homeless.,DoopleWrites,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/aqw6hz/i_failed_highschool_and_became_homeless/,"TL;DR: I decided I was too good to study for my final term. Played video games instead and failed. Threw my life off track, and ended up making me homeless.

So, I‚Äôm gonna start this tale with a bit of background information, since I think some context will help a lot with keeping this story coherent.

This incident happened 4 years ago.

It was my final term of High-School. The big one. Finals were three months away, everyone was studying hard, and University applications were being sent out on the daily. It‚Äôs the most stressful time of our young lives. Everyone was sick with worry over whether their marks will be good enough or not. Whether they‚Äôll make it or break it in this final stretch.

Except for me.

I wasn‚Äôt concerned at all.

I‚Äôve passed every single term of my entire school career. Each and every single one, with minimal studying. I‚Äôve coasted through middle and high school with no issues.

Why would this term be any different?

So, I refused to study. Instead I played League of Legends and CSGO until 10 at night, every night. My girlfriend told me I‚Äôm stupid for not studying, my mother begged me to, everyone wanted me to study. But I fully believed I was smart enough to just‚Ä¶ Wing it.

I had my life plan sorted out, you see. Pass high-school, go to university using that nice little nest egg my family saved up for my education, get a degree, get a well-paying job as a journalist or editor (writing was my passion, after all), and live my life in wealth and luxury.

All I had to do was pass.

And I failed. Miserably.

I remember when I got the results. It was a month after the final exam. I was at my friends house, playing games on his xbox. My mom called me, so I stepped outside and answered it.

‚ÄúWe got your results.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, cool. And?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou failed.‚Äù

My heart sank. I remember running to his bathroom and just crying. My whole life plan shattered, just because I was too lazy to put in the effort.

Thing is, that my failing didn‚Äôt just ruin my life plans.

It ruined everyone‚Äôs life plans.

My mom and dad are divorced. Have been for a very long time. My father was physically and mentally abusive towards me, so I refused to see him. Thanks to a really good divorce lawyer, though, we managed to force him to pay a nice sum of money to my mom (who has no job or qualifications of her own) every month until I turned eighteen, as well as getting him to sign over the house to her. He paid happily with the millions he owns, brought two new houses for his mistress (turned wife) and fucked off, content that he no longer has to worry about his first wife and son.

That money went towards everything. The levies for the house, the school fees, the food, the petrol, clothes, everything.

The second I turned eighteen, just as stated in the contract, my dad didn‚Äôt have to pay a single cent anymore.

So he didn‚Äôt.

My mom could support us for a bit, but not for long. I HAD to go to university, use that money saved up to stay in a residence and get a degree while my mom sells the house and moves back in with her parents overseas. The money was in a special account that could only be used for my education, and whatever was left would go back to my parents once I turned 22 (which would have been when I ended my studies).

Of course, since I never studied, I never got to touch that money.

My mom had to sell the house. I couldn't come with.

My dad didn't want me. He was playing ‚Äòperfect household‚Äô with his mistress (then wife) and her two teenage kids. He shoved them in a private school and cut me off his life. Brought her a third holiday home (that she took in the divorce, two years later. Karmas a bitch, huh?).

My mom sold everything we owned. She packed her bags and used that money to buy a ticket overseas.

I had my motorbike and a bag of clothes.

I stayed on the streets for about three months. My bike would get me from place to place, I'd look for little odd jobs from friends and acquaintances to make money for food and I'd shower at the public pools shower.

I still drive past the petrol station that I slept in at night. I'd park my bike outside and go to the handicap bathroom, lock the door and sleep there.

Then my friend offered me a room at his place.

I still believe that's what saved me.

I found a job as an intern in an IT company. It paid me next to nothing, but it let me move out into my own place. It was an old maids quarter, with just enough room for a bed. It had a shower, toilet, bed and a sink though. I ate packet noodles every second day, since that's all I could afford at the time, until I worked hard enough to get a raise.

And then another.

And then another.

And then I had an interview for a potential new job.

And I got it.

It paid me triple.

I became a miner. It paid my bills. It let me eat three meals a day. I got promoted to surveyor, and I got my own car. I got a bigger house. I got a cat. I brought a computer.

My girlfriend is now moving in with me next month, into a beautiful two bedroom place. She's an amazing artist, and I'm supporting her financially until she grows that passion and talent into a career.

Since I was never able to grow my passion for writing into a career.

I just turned 22. That bank account has now been released to my parents. My dad's with his third wife at this stage, money's still no issue for him but he'll keep it anyways. My mom fell on some hard times. She brought a kiosk using the money she got from selling the house, and it's doing poorly. She's in debt. The money will bring her out of it, at least.

I built my life up myself. I clawed my way through the dirt to get to this point. My dad messaged me the other day, saying he's depressed and that he wants to see me. Supposedly, ever since his second wife and step kids left him he's been depressed. Ever since he lost the job that he abandoned us for.

I told him to fuck off.

Ever since that fateful day, that my mom called me to tell me I've failed, I've had to fight to stay alive. I've almost died twice in my job, just so I can provide for myself. I never had any support from the family that abandoned me. And now he's asking me for emotional support?

Hah.

Karma‚Äôs a bitch.

Thanks for reading."

aqwxu5,1,2019-02-15,Tips for closure for someone I'll never see again,heroineworship,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aqwxu5/tips_for_closure_for_someone_ill_never_see_again/,"Hi Everyone! I need help getting over someone and I don't know where else to turn.

I (21F) met a guy (21M) at the start of an internship in July. The internship lasted for 12 weeks and during that time we grew really close and spent insane amounts of time together.

Nothing ever happened between us. I never wanted to tell him how I felt because I knew that at the end of the 3 months he'd be leaving the country and I'd probably never see him again. I don't know if he felt the same way. I didn't want to know, really. If he didn't feel the same, then things might get awkward and I might have lost a great friend and if he did, I'd lose him anyway when he left.

I missed him like crazy at the start. I had tried to schedule video calls so we could keep in touch but he wasn't interested (told me on multiple occasions that he hated phone/video calls before I even mentioned keeping in touch) and while we messaged a fair amount at the start, I started to feel like I was bothering him (I would ask a question and he'd reply with a paragraph answer but wouldn't try to continue the conversation by asking me a question in return, which I found really odd - like he was simultaneously interested and not interested in talking) so eventually I stopped texting him and he never tried to make contact again.

I really thought I was over him. It's been like 5 months since I've seen him and I was starting to not think about him all day every day.

I got offered another internship for this summer with the same company but in a different city. I knew that he was coming back to my city for another internship. I knew that there was going to be a forum for all European interns to meet and find accommodation. The forum went live a few days ago and I filled out my details since I wouldn't be living at home this summer.

I was checking up on the forum and I saw his name. I was in college surrounded by people so I managed not to cry, but all of the feelings came rushing back hitting me like a tonne of bricks. I wrote out an unsent letter to him to try to work through my feelings (I was planning on posting it to r/unsentletters but I didn't in the end).

I think the reason that I'm handling this so badly is that I've never felt this way about anyone before. I've had small crushes but it's never gone this far, because life has always got in the way. I don't know how to move on from someone that I never even dated.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

I am a Canadian CS student about to finish my first year, thus going into my second year. I've started to think about my career and my future, and I decided I would like to work in either Web Development or Mobile Development in Sweden. However, I am also open to working in IT, though it is not my first choice.

I was wondering what the best path for me would be to take, i.e. trying to do a summer internship, working for a bit in Canada to gain experience, or would it be possible to just apply to jobs in Sweden in my final year?

I speak English and French, and I know basic Swedish (A2) level, to which I am actively working on and trying to improve.

I would rather live in Malm√∂, to live in a city, and also to be close to Copenhagen, but to be honest I am open to working anywhere as long as I'm close to *a* city.

I will be 22 y/o after graduation as well, if age affects anything.

Klopt het bericht dat uit onderzoek blijkt dat douaniers op Schiphol een te hoge mate van werkdruk ervaren? Zo ja, welke oorzaken liggen hieraan ten grondslag?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het bericht klopt dat uit onderzoek blijkt dat er op Schiphol douaniers zijn die hoge werkdruk ervaren. Zoals ik in de 22e halfjaarrapportage Belastingdienst heb aangegeven, heeft de Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging &amp;#40;FNV&amp;#41; in februari 2018 een werkdrukenqu√™te uitgezet bij de medewerkers van Douane Schiphol. De resultaten zijn in maart 2018 gepresenteerd. De conclusie van de FNV is dat de werkdruk bij Douane Schiphol hoger is dan gemiddeld in Nederland.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst, waartoe de Douane behoort, voert periodiek tevredenheidsonderzoeken onder de medewerkers uit. In 2017 heeft een dergelijk onderzoek plaatsgevonden onder andere onder medewerkers van Douane Schiphol Passagiers en Douane Schiphol Cargo. De uitkomsten van het medewerkerstevredenheidsonderzoek bij Douane Schiphol Cargo laten weliswaar op kantoorniveau geen bijzondere score zien voor zowel werkdruk als herstelbehoefte, maar wel verschil tussen de verschillende teams. De uitkomsten van het medewerkerstevredenheidsonderzoek bij Douane Schiphol Passagiers zijn niet in een algemeen rapport opgenomen omdat te weinig medewerkers mee hebben gedaan aan het onderzoek.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane herkent dat in de processen met roosterdiensten sprake is van een hoge gepercipieerde werkdruk. De medewerkers kunnen werkdruk&amp;#40;te&amp;#41; ervaren door de gemaakte keuzes in de handhaving, het niet kunnen uitvoeren van geplande activiteiten en onderbezetting waardoor medewerkers het gevoel kunnen hebben met minder mensen hetzelfde werk te moeten doen, en waarbij het werken in een rooster op een werkplek zoals Schiphol, waar 24 uur 7 dagen in de week gewerkt wordt, een grote impact heeft op medewerkers.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De uitkomst van het medewerkerstevredenheidsonderzoek van de Belastingdienst uit 2017 en het werkdrukonderzoek van de FNV zijn belangrijke signalen voor de Douane over de hoogte van de werkdruk zoals die wordt beleefd door medewerkers van Douane Schiphol Passagiers en Douane Schiphol Cargo.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Voordat het onderzoek van de FNV bekend werd, had de Douane al diverse maatregelen in gang gezet. Daarmee geeft de Douane ook invulling aan de aanbevelingen van de FNV. Het gaat daarbij onder andere om het opstellen van nieuwe roosters door de leiding in overleg met medewerkers en medezeggenschap, versterking van de communicatie over keuzes en wat de medewerkers bezig houdt en instroom van nieuwe medewerkers om op formatieve sterkte te komen.

Kunt u aangeven wat er bedoeld wordt met ‚Äòer geregeld onvoorziene pieken in het werkaanbod ontstaan waardoor er soms moet worden gekozen om controles niet te doen‚Äô? Welke onvoorziene pieken worden hier bedoeld, hoe vaak en wanneer hebben deze het afgelopen jaar plaatsgevonden, hoeveel controles zijn er niet uitgevoerd en hoeveel controles zijn er ten dele uitgevoerd vanwege deze onvoorziene pieken in het werkaanbod &amp;#40;graag een overzicht per maand van het afgelopen jaar&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het proces op Schiphol wordt gekarakteriseerd door een hoge mate van dynamiek; vluchten van en naar bestemmingen over de hele wereld komen aan op en vertrekken vanaf Schiphol en kennen onverwachte en onvoorspelbare wijzingen in aankomst- en vertrektijden van vliegtuigen &amp;#40;volatiliteit&amp;#41;. Daardoor ontstaan pieken in het werkaanbod die vaak niet te voorzien zijn. Het komt voor dat er gekozen moet worden om &amp;#40;gedeeltes van&amp;#41; geplande controles op basis van risicoafweging op dat moment niet te doen. Bij het maken van dergelijke keuzes geldt het uitgangspunt dat de grootste risico‚Äôs de meeste handhavingsaandacht krijgen; de Douane werkt immers risicogericht. Zo wordt bijvoorbeeld een geplande controle-interventie op een vlucht uit een lager risico land niet uitgevoerd om op dat moment capaciteit vrij te spelen voor vluchten met een hoger risico waarvan de aankomsttijd is gewijzigd. Deze dagelijkse dynamiek op Schiphol staat niet in de weg dat Douane Schiphol Passagiers zijn doelstelling over 2018 heeft gerealiseerd; er zijn in totaal 15.413 vluchten gecontroleerd daar waar de planning uitging van 13.032.   
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Herkent u zich in het bericht dat er een capaciteitstekort is in het aantal douaniers op Schiphol? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, deelt u de mening dat dit capaciteitstekort zo snel mogelijk moet worden verholpen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Sinds wanneer is duidelijk dat er een capaciteitstekort is bij de Douane en welke acties zijn het afgelopen half jaar ingezet om dit capaciteitstekort op te vangen, los van de extra benodigde capaciteit voor de op handen zijnde brexit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 5 en 6   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik herken mij in het bericht; de bezetting bij Douane Schiphol Passagiers heeft in 2017 een dip gekend en bij Douane Schiphol Cargo is op teamniveau soms sprake van &amp;#40;forse&amp;#41; onder- of overbezetting. Zo hebben de teams fysiek toezicht en aangiftebehandeling te maken gehad met een forse onderbezetting. Over de jaren heen is Douane Schiphol Cargo als geheel vrijwel op sterkte.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane heeft hard gewerkt om de bezetting weer op sterkte krijgen. Op dit moment is de bezetting op het niveau van regiokantoor vrijwel op sterkte. Op teamniveau komt het nog wel voor dat er sprake is van onder- of overbezetting. Uitstroom, instroom en doorstroom van personeel is een continu proces. Ook het ziekteverzuim speelt natuurlijk een rol bij de daadwerkelijke capaciteitsinzet. Om met de bezetting op sterkte te blijven stuurt de Douane voortdurend bij onder andere door werving van nieuw personeel. De werving vindt plaats in tranches voor groepsfuncties en tussentijds voor specifieke individuele functies. Ook bij de beide regiokantoren op Schiphol stromen nieuwe medewerkers in.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het artikel wordt gesproken over een vernietigend rapport van de vakbond; wanneer heeft dat onderzoek plaatsgevonden? Kunt u aangeven of u naar aanleiding van dit rapport zelf onderzoek heeft laten uitvoeren? Zo nee, waarom niet en bent u bereid dit alsnog te doen? Zo ja, wanneer heeft dit onderzoek plaatsgevonden en wat waren de uitkomsten hiervan?

In februari 2018 heeft FNV Overheid een werkdrukonderzoek gehouden onder de medewerkers van Douane Schiphol Passagiers en Cargo. De resultaten daarvan zijn in maart 2018 gepresenteerd. In de periodieke medewerkerstevredenheidsonderzoeken van de Belastingdienst, waaronder de Douane valt, wordt werkdruk meegenomen. Het laatste onderzoek was in 2017.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De leiding van Douane vindt het van belang om in het kader van goed werkgeverschap te zorgen voor een verantwoorde werkdruk &amp;#40;niet te weinig werk maar ook niet te veel werk&amp;#41;. Een verantwoorde werkdruk draagt bij aan het cre√´ren van een intern veilige omgeving, waar iedere medewerker met plezier zijn of haar werk kan doen. Werkdruk en werkdrukbeleving zijn voor de leiding van de Douane dan ook belangrijke gesprekonderwerpen met de medewerkers.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Voordat het FNV-onderzoek bekend werd, hadden de beide regiokantoren al diverse maatregelen in gang gezet en daarmee wordt ook invulling gegeven aan de aanbevelingen van de FNV. Het gaat daarbij onder andere om het opstellen van nieuwe roosters door de leiding in overleg met medewerkers en medezeggenschap, versterking van de communicatie over keuzes en wat de medewerkers bezig houdt en instroom van nieuwe medewerkers om op formatieve sterkte te komen.

Hieronder is een overzicht van formatie en bezetting voor de beide regiokantoren op Schiphol gegeven. Douane Schiphol passagiers is belast met het toezicht op de goederen in het reizigersverkeer. Douane Schiphol Cargo is belast met het toezicht op goederen in de luchtvracht.

De formatie geeft het meerjarig te financieren personele kader dat de Douane nodig heeft om haar taken optimaal te kunnen uitvoeren. De formatie wordt periodiek aangepast. Bijvoorbeeld aanpassingen door het invoeren van andere werkwijzen &amp;#40;automatiseren van administratieve processen en de inzet van innovatieve controlemiddelen&amp;#41; en het verschuiven van taken tussen onderdelen van de Douane door herinrichting van de organisatie. Het kan voorkomen dat de bezetting op momenten tijdelijk hoger is dan de formatie omdat de feitelijke verplaatsing van de medewerkers later plaatsvindt. Zo is in de formatie 2016 de overheveling van taken van de regio‚Äôs naar een landelijk organisatieonderdeel verwerkt. De bijbehorende verschuiving van de medewerkers is in bovenstaand overzicht terug te zien in de bezetting op 1 januari 2017.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De bezetting geeft het aantal medewerkers van de Douane aan waarmee het werk in de praktijk wordt gedaan. Van onderbezetting is sprake als er minder medewerkers zijn dan de formatie. Onderbezetting betekent dat er wervingsruimte is.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Afgezien van de extra werkzaamheden voor de Brexit, is Douane Schiphol Passagiers, zoals in bovenstaand overzicht is te zien, na een dip in 2017, inmiddels vrijwel op sterkte. Douane Schiphol Cargo is over de jaren heen vrijwel op sterkte. Voor wat betreft verschillen in bezetting tussen teams wordt verwezen naar het antwoord op vraag 6.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn door Douane Schiphol Passagiers in 2018 in totaal 15.413 vluchten gecontroleerd daar waar de planning uitging van 13.032.

Klopt het bericht dat de 100-procentscontroles van risicovluchten niet altijd uitgevoerd worden? Zo ja, kunt u dit verklaren? Is bij het besluit om niet over te gaan tot 100-procentscontroles een veiligheidsanalyse uitgevoerd? Zo ja, wat was de uitkomst? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor wat betreft het 100%-regime waarover gesproken wordt in het desbetreffende artikel ‚ÄòDouane laat controles risicovluchten schieten door hoge werkdruk‚Äô is de minister van Justitie en Veiligheid &amp;#40;JenV&amp;#41; beleidsverantwoordelijk en opdrachtgever van de Douane. Doel van dit controleregime is de beheersing van het risico van de smokkel van verdovende middelen op vluchten afkomstig uit de door de minister van JenV aangewezen herkomsten. Onder het 100%-controleregime vallen intercontinentale vluchten afkomstig uit Cura√ßao, Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Maarten, Suriname en Venezuela. Het gaat daarbij om 30 tot 35 vluchten per week. Over de invulling van dit controleregime is uw Kamer in het verleden meerdere malen door de minister van JenV in vertrouwelijke brieven ge√Ønformeerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane heeft gedurende het jaar overleg met haar opdrachtgevers over de uit te voeren handhaving en de bijdrage daarvan aan de realisatie van de beleidsdoelstellingen. Zo ook met JenV, onder andere over het 100%-controleregime. De Douane spreekt met JenV over de nakoming van de handhavingsafspraken over 2018. Daarbij wordt door de Douane aangeven dat zij de afspraken over het toepassen van het 100%controleregime op de door JenV aangewezen vluchten is nagekomen. Ook geeft de Douane aan wat de resultaten waren, wat in de handhaving is bevonden en wat de ontwikkelingen waren. Er zijn reeds afspraken gemaakt over de handhaving in 2019. Afgesproken is bijvoorbeeld dat het 100%-controleregime gewoon door gaat in 2019; er wordt dus niet ten koste van dit controleregime geprioriteerd ten behoeve van de Brexit.   
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wordt op dit moment op alle vluchten die daarvoor in aanmerking komen gegarandeerd een 100-procentscontrole uitgevoerd? Hoeveel 100-procentscontroles hebben er niet plaatsgevonden? Kunt u aangeven welke risico‚Äôs er hierbij zijn geweest voor de nationale veiligheid en de veiligheid van medewerkers?  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Binnen welke termijn worden de 100-procentscontroles weer volledig uitgevoerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10 en 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Met JenV is afgesproken dat het 100%-controleregime in het kader van de drugsbestrijding op de door JenV aangewezen vluchten, ook in 2019 uitgevoerd zal worden. Daarbij is ook afgesproken dat er niet ten koste van het 100%-controleregime wordt geprioriteerd ten behoeve van de Brexit.   
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Op basis van welke informatie maakt de Douane de keuze welke controles en/of werkzaamheden wel en niet worden uitgevoerd? Hoe vaak vindt een ‚Äòrisicobepaling‚Äô plaats?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane is verantwoordelijk voor het toezicht op goederen die de buitengrens van de EU overschrijden. De Douane handhaaft risicogericht en kan daarin keuzes maken naar thema, doelgroepen en intensiteit van het toezicht. In overleg met de opdrachtgevers van de Douane wordt risicogericht het handhavingsniveau bepaald voor de handhaving op het nakomen van fiscale en niet-fiscale verplichtingen op de goederenstroom.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane werkt in de actualiteit. Dit betekent dat wanneer risico‚Äôs veranderen de Douane de handhaving en planningen daarop aanpast. Voor haar risicoanalyses maakt de Douane gebruik van informatie uit diverse bronnen, zoals de bij de Douane ingediende aangiften, openbare bronnen, en informatie van nationale en internationale handhavingspartners.   
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke gevolgen heeft de onderbezetting bij de douane voor het kunnen screenen van alle mensen die Nederland via Schiphol binnen willen komen? Welke gevolgen heeft dit voor zowel onze veiligheid als de veiligheid van de douaniers zelf? Weet de Douane wel wie er precies ons land binnenkomen? Deelt u de mening dat onze veiligheid niet in het geding mag komen en dat strenge en gedegen controles door de douane noodzakelijk zijn bij het waarborgen hiervan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane is ‚Äì ook op Schiphol- verantwoordelijk voor het toezicht op goederen die de buitengrens van de EU overschrijden. De taken van de Douane liggen op het gebied van de afdracht van invoerrechten en belastingen, beschermen van de maatschappij tegen gevaarlijke en ongewenste goederen en het bevorderen van de concurrentiepositie van het bedrijfsleven. Voor wat betreft de bescherming van de maatschappij tegen gevaarlijke en ongewenste goederen, draagt de Douane bij aan de veiligheid. Het handhavingsniveau wordt in overleg met de opdrachtgevers bepaald.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Als met screening wordt bedoeld het toezicht houden op het grensoverschrijdend personenverkeer in het kader van de Vreemdelingenwet, dan heeft de Douane daarin geen taak. Op Schiphol zijn de politietaken ‚Äìwaaronder de uitvoering van de Vreemdelingenwetgeving &amp;#40;paspoortcontroles&amp;#41;- opgedragen aan de Koninklijke Marechaussee. De bezetting van de Douane heeft geen invloed op de veiligheidssituatie op de luchthaven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft de Douane op andere Nederlandse vliegvelden ook te maken met capaciteitstekorten, een te hoge werkdruk of andere problemen? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, welke problemen ervaren de douaneafdelingen op deze vliegvelden? Zijn er naast vliegvelden nog andere douaneafdelingen &amp;#40;bijvoorbeeld havens&amp;#41; die te kampen hebben met capaciteitsproblemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ook binnen douaneregio‚Äôs die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het douanetoezicht op andere vliegvelden kan het voorkomen dat er ‚Äì tijdelijk- sprake is van onder- of overbezetting op teamniveau. Daarbij merk ik op dat alleen op Schiphol vluchten aankomen die onder het 100%controleregime vallen. Landelijk was er op 31 december 2018 &amp;#40;exclusief Brexit&amp;#41; een feitelijke onderbezetting van 60 fte op een formatie van 4.645 fte. Per locatie en functie kunnen er verschillen zijn in over- en onderbezetting. Bezetting is namelijk een dynamisch geheel; er stromen mensen in, uit en door. De landelijke doelstelling van het totaal aantal te controleren vluchten in het in- en uitgaande passagiersverkeer in 2018 is gerealiseerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De doelstelling voor 2019 is om de totale bezetting in lijn met de formatie te krijgen. Zoals reeds aan uw Kamer is gemeld, is de verwachting dat eind 2019 alle medewerkers benodigd voor de Brexit-werkzaamheden zijn ingestroomd.  
De Douane werft in tranches. In maart 2019 is een volgende wervingsronde voorzien. Er wordt zowel voor de toename van de werkzaamheden ten gevolge van de Brexit geworven als voor overige werkzaamheden, voor zover er sprake is van een onderbezetting. Tussentijds wordt er ook nog geworven voor specifieke individuele functies, zoals de functie van teamleider.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor wat betreft de risicogerichte inzet van de medewerkers verwijs ik u naar het antwoord op vraag 12.  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven of medewerkers nog tegen andere problemen aanlopen in het kader van hun werkzaamheden, zoals bij het gebruik van ICT? Zo ja, welke?

Wat is het percentage ziekteverzuim onder de douaniers op Schiphol over de afgelopen twee jaar &amp;#40;graag per maand weergeven&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In onderstaande tabel staan de verzuimcijfers voor zowel Douane Schiphol Cargo als Douane Schiphol Passagiers voor de jaren 2017 en 2018 uitgesplitst per maand.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het management besteedt continu aandacht aan de beheersing van het ziekteverzuim. Douaneregio's met een verzuim boven de 6%, waaronder de beide regiokantoren op Schiphol, hebben een plan van aanpak opgesteld.

&amp;nbsp;    
18  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven hoe de hierboven beschreven capaciteitsproblemen in relatie staan tot de grote vraag naar inzet van de Douane bij de op handen zijnde brexit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
19  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit eerdere rapportages blijkt dat u in aanloop naar de brexit 300 fte heeft aangetrokken om de extra werkzaamheden in verband met de brexit op te vangen; klopt het dat deze nieuw geworven mensen niet ingezet worden voor het huidige capaciteitsprobleem? Zo nee, kunt u een uitgebreide toelichting geven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 18 en 19   
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals geantwoord bij vraag 14 wordt er geworven voor zowel de toename van de werkzaamheden ten gevolge van de Brexit als voor de overige werkzaamheden daar waar er sprake is van een onderbezetting, bijvoorbeeld als gevolg van medewerkers die met pensioen gaan of een andere baan accepteren. Daarbij is de doelstelling voor 2019 om de totale bezetting in lijn met de formatie te krijgen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het geval zittende douaniers solliciteren op een plaats die open is gesteld als gevolg van de Brexit, zal voor de openvallende plek &amp;#40;extern&amp;#41; weer worden geworven.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Medewerkers die zijn ingestroomd in het kader van de Brexit worden samen met ervaren krachten ingezet op de te verrichten werkzaamheden, of die nu voortvloeien uit de Brexit of niet. Dit om een evenwichtige mix van ervaren en nieuwe medewerkers de werkzaamheden te laten uitvoeren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
20  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u een overzicht geven van de nieuw geworven mensen voor de uitbreiding rond de brexit-activiteiten en nieuwe geworven mensen voor de reguliere activiteiten? Kunt u aangeven hoeveel mensen er voor beide categorie√´n nog geworven moeten worden voor 29 maart 2019? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In totaal werft de Douane 928 fte in het kader van de Brexit. De verwachting is dat dit aantal nodig is om de gevolgen van een Brexit no deal op te kunnen vangen. De verwachting is dat op 29 maart 2019 ruim 500 nieuwe medewerkers zijn ingestroomd waarvan ruim 300 opgeleid en inzetbaar. De verwachting is dat eind 2019 de 928 extra douaniers voor de Brexit zullen zijn ingestroomd, waarvan ca. 760 inzetbaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Om voor de reguliere werkzaamheden de bezetting op de formatie te krijgen is, tegelijkertijd met de vierde tranche werving Brexit, in het najaar 2018 daarvoor geworven. Het gaat daarbij om 71 groepsfuncties. De instroom op basis van deze werving vindt vanaf 1 maart 2019 plaats.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Op dit moment is de selectie in het kader van de vijfde wervingstranche gaande.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De start van de zesde tranche is voorzien op 7 maart. Het gaat daarbij om vacatures voor de toename van de werkzaamheden in het kader van de Brexit en overige werkzaamheden daar waar er sprake is van onderbezetting, bijvoorbeeld omdat medewerkers met pensioen gaan of een andere baan accepteren. Het precieze aantal van de vacatures voor Brexit- en overige werkzaamheden van deze zesde tranche moet nog worden vastgesteld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
21  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven of de nieuw geworven mensen voor de brexit, die inmiddels de opleiding hebben voltooid, op dit moment worden ingezet voor reguliere taken? Zo ja, wat gebeurt er met de reguliere werkzaamheden en capaciteit als zij op 29 maart 2019 worden ingezet voor de extra werkzaamheden met betrekking tot de brexit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De ruim 300 nieuwe medewerkers worden in maart daadwerkelijk inzetbaar in de werkprocessen.

&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke manier&amp;#40;en&amp;#41; werft de Douane nieuwe medewerkers? Zit er een verschil tussen het werven van medewerkers voor de reguliere activiteiten en specifiek voor de brexit-activiteiten? Zo ja, welke verschillen? Welk opleidingstraject doorlopen nieuwe douaniers?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Douane heeft gekozen om de werving op te delen in tranches.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Er is geen verschil in &amp;#40;eisen bij&amp;#41; werving, selectie en opleiding tussen medewerkers die in het kader van de Brexit en medewerkers die voor overige werkzaamheden worden geworven.

aqxut8,17,2019-02-15,Does Veganism make sense in my situation?,EpicVacuumCleaner,antinatalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/aqxut8/does_veganism_make_sense_in_my_situation/,"Hello, new antinatlist and vegan here.

I've been going vegan for about 2 months for now, but relapsed in the past couple days.

We went out with relatives for dinner and I ate a steak. My justification was that there were no vegan meals on the menu, and I didn't want to act like a baby and be a pain in the ass for everyone else while hungering all the time myself.

But I also ate like a cake pop or something yesterday night cuz i got the munchies. My justification for that was that we got those from my aunt because my father and I helped her clear out her basement the other day. I mean, the cake was already produced and purchased by someone else. The damage has been done and letting it got to waste is even more pointless, right?

That led me to think about my situation and if veganism is even sensible right now. I'm 18 and live with my parents, I'm in an internship and it doesnt pay that much. Not enough to make it possible for me to move out anyway. There's me, the vegan, my little brother and both my parents. My mother cooks some vegan stuff for me sometimes, but the household still consumes animal products. When I'm at work I only eat bread with vegan spread, which I'm fine with since it tastes really good.

But food really isn't the only part of veganism, it's also buying vegan clothes and all of that, which I can't really pay for. The vegan food is already burning  a pretty hole in my wallet.

So the question is if it is sensible to go vegan in a household that is consuming animal products anyway. The food is bought and the damage is done."

Been dating this girl for about 5 months now, I'm pretty relaxed when it comes to male friends. I really don't mind. She has been sleeping at my house everyday for the last 4 months or so even though she has her own house. Things seem to be going really well, getting along with her parents etc.

About a week ago she told she was going out for drinks with a friend(she actually told me he was gay even though I never asked). I didn't think much of it. She sent me a few pictures during the evening. She seemed to just be having a few beers, nothing interesting really. When it was getting later in the evening she told me she was staying at her own house (which she hasn't done in about 4 months). I got a strange gut feeling but still went to sleep.

The next morning I got a little suspicious and checked my laptop (she is logged into most of her stuff on my laptop I rarely use it)
and checked her whatsapp conversation which said just a few things like a time and a place to meet etc. But one sentence stood out in particular that said ""doesn't your boyfriend mind you meeting her old fuckbuddy"". I got so angry that I immediately turned my laptop off and knowing she was coming over in about 20/30 minutes prepared to end the relationship. (Maybe a over reaction?)

When she came in I confronted her and she burst into tears and started to get angry for snooping which I understand but I stood my ground and told her I'm done if she actually lied to my face about who the guy was. She told me he was just a male friend and they met on Tinder years back and they are just friends now. eventually I kind of gave in and told her I'd think about it. 

its a week later now and I don't really know what to do. I'm kind of acting like nothing is wrong but when I'm at work I feel like a idiot. I have this bad gut feeling about it. Should I just end the relationship if I feel like I can't trust her anymore? she's also going away on a internship abroad for 3 months in 2 months. and I would have to pretty much trust her 100%..."

Hi Everyone,

I hope you January scores are everything you could have ever hoped for! Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt say that of the score I received this morning. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm looking forward to going headstrong into the next cycle. 

I wanted to seek advice from the community as for the most effective study plan moving forward. I‚Äôll detail my study journey thus far and ask for your help in crafting the best plan of attack.

I started with a cold diagnostic in July 2018 of a 142.  Took the Blueprint in-class course during the duration of the summer, but couldn‚Äôt devote full time because I was working a full time job. 

Continued studying into the fall quarter of my senior year in undergrad for the November test by doing homework/practice problems from the Blueprint online program and one PT a week on Saturday morning. I was PTing around 149-153.  Took the November test and scored a 150. 

I then studied all of winter break (2 and a half weeks) with the same Blueprint online program by watching their lectures in order to review the material. Then, when the winter quarter started, I studied for the three weeks leading up to the January test by doing 3 timed sections per day and a full PT on Saturdays. About a week and a half leading up to the exam, I discovered Ellen Cassidy‚Äôs book: The loophole to LSAT logical reasoning. I read through the material and continued to take practice tests with her method of stimulus first (i found that I like this strategy a lot more). My PT‚Äôs increased to the 153-156 range, but come January test day, I earned a score of 151.

I am in the camp of ‚Äú170 or bust‚Äù, and I have the utmost confidence that I can achieve this level of success with the right plan. I will be taking on an internship program with a full time school schedule in the spring quarter and graduating mid June of this year.  As such, the September or November 2019 exams seem to be the best options for me in the next cycle. Could any of you give me some advice on how best to devise a study plan given these parameters?"

**The 10 Step Method to Getting an Internship in the Music Business**

By Drew Washington

Trying to break into the music business is no easy task. The amount of people trying to do the same thing can make it seem almost hopeless. Fear not there is a way! Now don‚Äôt get me wrong it will be hard work and the industry has changed over the years making the methods to get in a little tougher. 

The hardest pill to swallow in the beginning is the fact that you probably won‚Äôt get paid much in an internship if at all. I know that‚Äôs not pleasant to hear but this is the part where your passion needs to drive. Remember why you are doing it and what keeps you going and the money part will fade away. Plus there are a lot of great benefits to being an intern! And you can always get a second or part time job to pick up the slack.

**Step 1: Find Your Musical Area(s) of Interest**

What area do you see yourself working in, in the music business? This may be a tough question to answer in the beginning and that‚Äôs normal. So don‚Äôt spend too much time on it. It will come! The reason to have an idea of this is so that they can know where to place you when you get hired. It is beneficial to have a list of at least 3. Below is a list of some general jobs you may find available. 

Jobs: Publicity Firm, Management Company, Booking Agency, Radio Promotions Company, Streaming Promotions Company, Live Music Venue, Concert Promoter, Production Studio, Publishing Company, Film &amp; TV Licensing, Music Website, Social Media, Digital Marketing, Music Blog,  Specialty/Lifestyle Marketing, Small Record Label.  


Departments: Promotions, Publicity, Marketing, Licensing Radio, Sales, Promotions, Marketing.  


**Step 2: Make a List of Companies/Artists You Like**

Take your time and research what jobs you like and which company and artists apply to them. This is a great way to inspire yourself on your future potential too. Many artists and industry professionals started out right where you are now.

**Step 3: Have a Professional Resume**

Take your time and create a resume that showcases your skills and experience in pleasing manner. There are many tools and websites that can help with this. It is also always good to get a second opinion on it when you finish Keep it short and sweet, typically one page. Add any social media or links you have. 

**Step 4: Recommendations**

Start compiling a list of professional and personal references and start networking. In order to stand out this can make or break you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out to old teachers and employers for this. They can help prove and express your strengths.

**Step 5: Applying**

Yay! You made it to the fun part. Now this stage is a bit harder. Most companies don‚Äôt often advertise for these positions so you are going to have to do a bit of cold calling. The best thing to do is to take your list and call or visit them asking if they would consider accepting a resume for interning. Then find out where and who to give the resume to. Then you should scour the internet and magazines for posts. And finally your college or school can be a good resource for internships. [The Recording Conservatory of Austin](https://www.trcoa.edu/), a prominent recording school offers internships to their current students and has an internship program for example.

**Step 6: The Internship Rules to Live By**

Always use a professional cover letter and resume when applying. Make the cover letter personalized to whomever it is going to. Highlight any personal achievements or followers you may have out there on your social media, blogs or any other medium.

**Step 7: Mail in a Resume**

In addition to filling out any online application that allows your resume to be attached, also make it a habit to send in your hard copy of your resume via mail with it attentioned to the appropriate person.

**Step 8: Follow Up**

It‚Äôs always a great idea to follow up after applying or sending in your resume. These business handle a lot of traffic and it‚Äôs very possible and likely to get lost in the shuffle. Just remember to be polite and courteous when calling to follow up.

**Step 9: The Interview**

Congratulations you‚Äôve made it to the big dance. Now it‚Äôs time to rock the interview. Practice your interviewing skills as much as possible. Schedule your interviews from least to most important. Be prompt and early and courteous. Let your personality shine. Chances are resumes are gonna look very similar so try to establish a conversation to set yourself apart. Bring your resume with you here and any other supporting documents. And prepare a few questions you would like to ask.

**Step 10: Same as Step 8, Follow up!**

**Conclusion:** 

Hopefully this helps you break into the competitive world of music with some practical techniques to help you succeed. Always remember to be yourself and don‚Äôt doubt yourself. Chances are many of the people your are contacting had to do what you are doing. Good luck to you!"

ar0sgm,7,2019-02-15,really sad,Peryr623,SingleParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleParents/comments/ar0sgm/really_sad/,"  

Feeling really sad.

I dont even know how to start this, other that saying im really crush, so bare with me with a long post.

Im a single mom, I got pregnant by a man who wanted a baby and was in a serious relationship. The same day I told him I was pregnant he said he didn‚Äôt want me, and although I did try to have a relationship with him things got out of control because he was abusive in every way you could think to me and later on to my son, feeding him with hot peppers so my son wouldn‚Äôt ask for the salad he was having for lunch.

I left him , and other than giving me money ( that doesn‚Äôt even cover 50% of his son expenses) he doesn‚Äôt see my son ever.

I met this guy last year, single no kids, for a while I would say we went on dates but nothing ever happened not even a kiss , but he loved children and eventually met my son and he was amazing to my son and I considered him to be a great role model. I thought there was empathy because the guy who I will call D , had lost his dad when he was 6.

I work with an intern that recently graduated but comes from a family that is having a really hard time financially wise, and I mentioned that to D. He said we should all go out to a nice restaurant and have a celebration for my intern. Soon enough that dinner totally turned into a match making dinner and comparisons started to draw right there. He went from basically denying we were close friends ( I mean so close we spend almost every weekend together, like my son and I at his place, of course me sleeping with my son, to beach trips , etc) to plain out loud telling her how good she looks. He would often say how impress she was by almost any coment, asking her for dreams for the future etc.

I hate to sound like a negative person but your dreams when you are so fresh out of college are so big, and often you realize that life has limitations and you wont turn out to be married to prince William.

He then turned to me, and asked her why do I always complaint about my job, that im such a negative person. I explained I have a whole lot more reponsabilities than her, and my boss (who is the owner) relies on me even when it comes to hire people at the factorie. I also have a child, and that will make anyone more more hours, even outside work line. The girl back me up saying my job is not nearly as stressful as hers , but then he said maybe I shouldn‚Äôt cook so much for my son and get him use to pbj sandwiches and man up.

I saw her, she is in her 20¬¥s and Im in my mids 30. I know I cant ever compete with younger people specially those who invest 3 hours a day in gym , yoga and surfing. I get she has dreams and ambition, and I wish all her dreams come true, and I had those dreams that were limited when I decided to raise a child. Limited because I cant work as much as I would because I have things at home, and I am sorry im not so happy go lucky with things because reality is diferent for me.

But I was hurt by my friend choosing to question my opinions. I was hurt that I was blindisided that he was trying to do something goo and maybe noble and all he wanted was meeting her and get a number. I was crushed that my friend, the man I admired was making me seem so small, instead of cheering me up when he knows perfectly well how this path is so often difficult and challenging.

That maybe im not a heroe, but I am trying my hardest to raise a child I didn‚Äôt create on my own and I was lied into motherhood wich a total different plan. I had to quit my dream jon, the one I was CEO for Latin America SALES, so I could have more time with my son, so no im not stupid or not educated,.

And now I am really wonder if being a single mom, chosing limitations as economics etc make you damage goods. Make you complicated .

Do we have hopes for someone loving us, and maybe seen despite this mess we often are? Can we be more than a hot mess?"

ar2o7y,178,2019-02-15,Update: my journey across the world after leaving my toxic dom,yikes0000,BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/ar2o7y/update_my_journey_across_the_world_after_leaving/,"A little over a month ago, I made a post about breaking up with my dom, who had added another submissive to our relationship in spite of my explicit lack of consent: https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/a7vy5j/alone_in_another_country_after_being_dropped_by/ 

I've been abroad for about a month now and thought this community deserved an update. I didn't say much as the replies came flooding in, because I was so overwhelmed and broken at the time, but the stunning outpouring of support from everyone here touched me deeply and played an active role in my healing (which, of course, is still ongoing). 

I am in a beautiful European city. The kind that brings tears to my eyes when I look at it; I'm struck by the fact that I worked hard for this and was strong when the circumstances of my trip changed so drastically, and was rewarded for my courage with all this beauty. I look at pastel buildings, shining lakes, cobbelstone streets that I trip over in my heels, laughing hard when I do (I've picked up the nickname 'bambi' from my peers here, for my shaky legs), and it feels like the outside matches the inside. It feels like it was time for this newness, this beauty, this adventure. It's becoming of me.

I'm an intern for a well regarded blogging company here and I edit all of their English texts for them. They're even starting to let me write content of my own. I've gotten good feedback about my work ethic and the quality of what I do. Being somebody who loves writing and adores working with words in any capacity, it's been a dream come true. 

I've been enjoying my autonomy and, in retrospect, have realized that I let my dom take advantage of me in a lot of ways that made me unhappy. I do believe that he cared about my wellbeing and didn't want to hurt me. But I also believe he was misinformed about what submission actually is, that he thought I should forfeit my happiness to his in areas of kink that I pushed back against: orgasm denial, pain, etc. Things I told him time and time again I didn't like, that made me uncomfortable or upset or unhappy. Things he would defend with a smile, ""but don't you see how happy it makes me?""

There is absolutely a degree to which we just weren't compatible, and I can't blame him for being more sadistic than I was masochistic or for having a need. But I feel that through his ignorance he inadvertently groomed me to believe these were things a pet HAD to do for her master, even if they took their toll emotionally. 

After I left him, I took some time to break my old rules, enjoy some orgasms, and just get real fucking anarchistic with it. It was fun. And now I'm coming back together with a more mature understanding of what my submission is to me: the inner workings of it, the boxes that need ticking, the boxes I want kept at LEAST 500 feet away from me at all times. I accept now that I am a softer, gentler submissive, and want to be treated that way. And that anyone who could ever call me or my submission 'fuss' doesn't deserve it. 

I've even found someone who's taken me completely by surprise with, well, everything. It started with us meeting to talk writing and philosphy in local tea shops, then turned to me laying beside him in the dark, stunned and happy with the existence of my body next to his body (ya girl was a bit touch starved), and has progressed to him taking rope tying classes in our local community while I'm abroad, in anticipation of my return. The emphasis here being on the fact that feelings came before kink. They were not the byproduct of it. 

After all, I am a person before I'm a submissive. I've realized this. 

So, to summarize, I've grown from this. I know now the kind of shit that I won't put up with. I accept who I am and how I function and I will pursue that faithfully. I am genuinely happy. 

The one negative ""I"" statement, though, is that I'm still angry. 

I don't think on my ex often. I certainly don't still love him. Sometimes it takes me days before I even remember that he exists or that he happened. But other times the rage keeps me up at night. The helplessness of the injustice done to me. I stare straight ahead for hours thinking about how cruel it all was, how unfair it was to me, and I want to get back in touch and tell him off-- but I never do. I think it would be undignified of me. And by morning, I'm relieved I hadn't bothered with it, because oh my god. Why introduce that conversation back into my life? 

But the waves of anger keep coming. And they're strong, believe me. Sometimes paralyzing. And I just want to know how I can get this out of me, healthily, so that I can keep moving forward as I have been. I don't want to feel like I need HIM to know I'm angry in order to feel validated or gain catharsis in my anger anymore. I want it to be on my own terms. 

So I'm coming to you lovely people once more to ask for your advice. What do I do? How do I move on through so much anger? 

Thank you, thank you so much, for the support those of you here offered me in my time of need. It is a gift to have a community to turn to. I hope that this update says something in the way of all it has done for me. I'm so excited to be posting and chatting here again. :)

ar32i7,1,2019-02-15,I'm stuck in an unfulfilling job,jroobz,jobadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobadvice/comments/ar32i7/im_stuck_in_an_unfulfilling_job/,"I work for a large multinational in London, UK. I've been in the same job for 7 years. My boss is a fastidious micromanager and keeps the team structure very flat. This means as a senior manager, I do the same basic role as the intern, just more of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The money is average but the industry is what I wanted to work in when I was a teenager, so it's always had a pull on me. But I'm in my 30s now and what I want is different - more money, more fun/freedom/creativity, less stress/negativity. What that means in a practical sense, I'm not sure?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my job is sapping my confidence and I'm wasting my career here. My skillset is not improving and it's pretty soul destroying going in every day. The work itself is 95% process driven, which is incredibly dull and repetitive. The atmosphere in the room is set by my boss and it's grumpy, grouchy and curt. We all sit in silence with headphones on and crack on with the job until it's time to go home. My when questioned by myself and the other senior manager in the team, my boss thinks everything is fine. We disagree.

&amp;#x200B;

I go through bursts of calling recruiters and job hunting but it feels like slim pickings. I have found a couple of jobs I was invited to interview for - the feedback I got was 'good, but lacking experience' because my skillset is not growing with the industry. My next job might have to be a sideways or downwards step. FML. Screw it, as long as it gets me moving forward again, I don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm asking for is, have you been in this kind of predicament, where you're trapped in a role that isn't doing it for you but moving feels terrifying? Tell me about your great escape! + I'm willing to take any advice you may have.

&amp;#x200B;

So TLDR: I'm stuck in an unfulfilling job? How did you escape yours?"

I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs off topic. I‚Äôm open to suggestion about where to post. 

I‚Äôve been going through a really hard time lately. As a sophomore CS major I‚Äôve been applying to a bunch of internships. Last semester, I had a bit of luck with interviews. And I think I got to the final round with one company only to be ridiculed by the interviewee because I couldn‚Äôt solve a ‚Äúbasic‚Äù problem. That really dented my confidence. But I kept applying. I think over the last 6 months, I have applied to at least a thousand positions with only one interview. Granted I don‚Äôt go to the best school but I do work hard and I think I have a pretty good resume. On Monday, a company scheduled an interview with me for today afternoon. I spent all week studying for it because  I didn‚Äôt want to be made fun of again. I worked so damn hard. Today morning while I‚Äôm taking an exam, they sent me an email saying they already filled the position. I submitted a really crappy exam (cause I was studying for the interview) came back to my room, missed the rest of my classes and just cried. I have 0 confidence in myself and my abilities. And all I can do is feel sorry for myself. This post is me feeling sorry for myself. I want advice as to how I can be better and not let these things affect me. I‚Äôve been told before that I have a weak character. Is that just it? Do I just need to have a thicker skin? Change my major and the jobs I‚Äôm looking for? 

What am I doing wrong and how can I improve?

P.S: I apologize for the ‚Äúranty‚Äù nature of the post. Wasn‚Äôt my intention. Just on mobile and typing out whatever comes to my head. "

ar6t24,5,2019-02-16,AITA for being late to work too make times?,passesglasses,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ar6t24/aita_for_being_late_to_work_too_make_times/,"I‚Äôm a graduate student with an internship in the public sector. Yesterday I found out that my boss had called my department head and said I‚Äôd been doing good work, but I had excessive absences and tardiness. Here are all the instances of me being absent or tardy this semester:

Jan 14: I bought a parking pass for school and I had to go to the office the first day of classes and pick it up. This was the only day I could do it because I was working or in class 9-5 every day when the school‚Äôs offices were open. 

Jan 18: I forgot my badge and key at home, so I went back and picked it up. This is the only time this has happened, and I‚Äôm now diligent about keeping my badge and key in my purse and checking before I leave. 

Feb 4 &amp; 5: I had a cold that was bad enough that I went to the doctor to make sure I didn‚Äôt have the flu. 

Feb 12: I was six minutes late to work. No excuses, I‚Äôd slept through my alarm. I have trouble sleeping and I scheduled an appointment with a sleep doctor March 1 to make sure this doesnt happen again. 

Thats it. I‚Äôve known she‚Äôs very strict on time‚Äîshe once told me ‚Äúif you‚Äôre eight minutes late, if you‚Äôre two minutes late, you‚Äôre late.‚Äù But I‚Äôve worked my ass off for this internship, turned everything in on time and I‚Äôve gone above and beyond on the work. Each time I was late, I stayed late to make up the time. I‚Äôm actually ahead on my hours. 

My biggest fear in life is being a disappointment and to hear that she called my department head and he had to talk with me about it sent me into a panic attack. I was very apologetic, took responsibility, but I do wonder if this was really enough to call my department head over?"
ar86jj,19,2019-02-16,The Promotion [MF] [Prost],JackFisherBooks,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/ar86jj/the_promotion_mf_prost/,"‚ÄúA new day, a new office, and a big promotion,‚Äù said Jonathan Zander with a beaming smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve earned this!‚Äù

It was the culmination of a decade of toil. After working so hard for the most prominent investment firm in the state, he had achieved something that had once seemed impossible. He started as an intern, getting people coffee, printing out presentations, and organizing meetings for low pay and no overtime. Now, he was a full-fledged executive director, complete with a yearly bonus, his own parking spot, and a private office.

It might not have been the biggest office in the building, but it was still a major step up from the cramped cubical he‚Äôd worked in as an intern. It had once belonged to his supervisor, who had mentored him for the past seven years. He had since retired and was instrumental in helping Jonathan get the promotion. The office had been empty for over a month, but he intended to make it distinctly his.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll put my diploma over there,‚Äù Jonathan said to himself, pointing out blank spaces on the wall, ‚Äúand that picture of me and my dad at the Super Bowl will go there. I can maybe get some artwork from my sister if she has any, but I can just as easily get some from that convention next week. And this time, I‚Äôll actually be able to afford it!‚Äù

He kept on smiling, even as he set his box of personal effects on the large mahogany desk. He was still getting used to the idea of not being underpaid. He‚Äôd spent the last decade paying down his student loan debts and living frugally in rented apartments with unreliable roommates. That was about to change. Jonathan already planned to move into his own place by the end of the month. That was just the beginning.

‚ÄúWith a fat bonus comes a new suite, better furniture, and maybe even a new car at some point,‚Äù Jonathan said to himself, his mind still racing from all the exciting possibilities. ‚ÄúIt will be nice to actually drive to work in something that isn‚Äôt 12 years old and bought at a discount from my grandfather.‚Äù

He‚Äôd worked so hard to find success doing what he loved. He intended to enjoy the hell out of it.

As an executive, there was no dead end to his job. Jonathan was no longer just some replaceable office grunt. He had influence, authority, and flexibility. He could help direct the company forward and reap the inevitable rewards. That was what he had wanted after seeing his father toil with the post office for decades. He sought more and he was willing to work for it.

There would be plenty of time for that later on, though. At the moment, it was Friday evening and most of the staff had already left for the day. Jonathan was tempted to join them, but opted to get a head start on setting up his new work space. He was too excited to just go home and wait for the next phase of his career to begin. Looking out his window, which had an awesome view of the park space just outside the building, he marveled at how far he had come.

‚ÄúAll that hard work‚Ä¶the late nights, the impossible deadlines, and the coffee enemas‚Ä¶I did way more than I thought I could do,‚Äù Jonathan mused. ‚ÄúMy dad told me that hard work can‚Äôt just be for the sake of working. It has to be for something greater. Guess it‚Äôs up to me to figure out how great it‚Äôll be.‚Äù

That was still the most daunting prospect of his new job. Jonathan had spent so much time working for others. The idea that others would work for him in the name of his vision for the company still hadn‚Äôt sunk in. He had to adjust quickly because there was plenty more he hoped to achieve.

‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr. Zander?‚Äù said an unexpected female voice. ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù

Jonathan turned around to see a young woman standing in the doorway to his new office. She looked like one of those cute secretaries the old CEO loved to hire, complete with a low-cut skirt, polished heels, and a blouse that seemed a size too small. Never one to turn away from a pretty girl, he welcomed her in.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said to her. ‚ÄúCome on in. Are you one of Sheila Grant‚Äôs new assistance in HR?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm actually a‚Ä¶well, I guess you could call me an office temp,‚Äù she said coyly.

‚ÄúOh? What kind of temp?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe kind your old boss hired for the sole purpose of celebrating your promotion,‚Äù she told him.

Jonathan was taken aback, somewhat. He recognized the undertone in that woman‚Äôs voice. He had been to his share of bachelor parties to know what it implied. Upon seeing the woman close the door to his office behind her and lock it, he began filling in the blanks.

It seemed outrageous. He‚Äôd heard rumors about certain people hiring strippers and prostitutes for executives, but Jonathan thought they were just perverse water cooler talk. Now that he was an executive, though, those rumors took on a very different meaning.

‚ÄúMy name is Daisy,‚Äù the woman continued. ‚ÄúI guess you could call me a ‚Äòpersonal motivator.‚Äô I specialize in helping aspiring executives stay driven, so to speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds‚Ä¶useful,‚Äù Jonathan said, not acknowledging the overt innuendo in her tone. ‚ÄúHow exactly do you go about that?‚Äù

The young woman casually walked over to him, revealing in the process that the top part of her blouse was already unbuttoned, exposing her ample cleavage. It was, by no means, appropriate office attire. However, Jonathan felt little inclination to report her to HR. If anything, he had a feeling that his old supervisor had circumvented HR.

The way she walked did not imply that she had come directly from business school. The way she swayed her hips and glared at him with seductive eyes made it seem like she‚Äôd come right from a strip club. Knowing as that there was a strip club less than four blocks from the office, the possibilities were plenty feasible.

When she reached him, she stood so close that her ample breasts actually touched his chest. He could already smell the makeup, eye-liner, and high-end lipstick. Still standing by the window, Jonathan didn‚Äôt move in inch in any direction.

‚ÄúI could spend the next half-hour explaining my unique talents,‚Äù Daisy told him, skillfully snaking her arms around his neck, ‚Äúor I could just show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat might be optimal,‚Äù Jonathan said, already sounding like an executive. ‚ÄúIn my experience, people learn by doing and not listening.‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt agree more. That‚Äôs why I think you‚Äôll love my technique!‚Äù

The attractive young woman ditched the innuendo from that point and lured him into a kiss. As soon as her lips touched his, he was intoxicated by the intensely sensual taste. It was like tasting literal success, so sweet and rewarding. Whether or not Daisy was the literal manifestation of his success was a matter of perspective‚Ä¶one that he did not care to rationalize at the moment.

Kissing her did more than just affirm his success. It got all the blood in his body flowing in a certain direction. That reminded him that he was a healthy heterosexual man who hadn‚Äôt had time for a relationship. His work made finding love ‚Äì or meaningless sex, for that matter ‚Äì a challenge subject to serious time constraints. Having not known the intimate touch of a woman for a while, it was nothing short of refreshing.

‚ÄúMmm‚Ä¶I like it already!‚Äù Jonathan said after their lips parted.

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm just getting started, Mr. Zander,‚Äù Daisy said, sounding sexy, yet serious. ‚ÄúHave a seat. The real presentation is about to begin!‚Äù

She kissed him again, snaking her arms around his neck in the process. He boldly returned the gesture, slipping his hands around her waist and feeling up her womanly curves over that not-so-modest dress of hers. As he felt her up, she guided him away from the window and towards his new desk. Jonathan offered no resistance, going along with Daisy‚Äôs unusual technique.

He soon found himself sitting on the edge of his desk, his legs dangling over as the young woman stood in front of him. His hands still on her waist, he could already feel his pants tightening. Daisy even seemed to realize that and grazed her thigh up against the growing bulge.

‚ÄúHold still,‚Äù she said upon breaking the kiss again. ‚ÄúThis office getup is feeling very itchy.‚Äù

Then, her seductive gaze never once diverting from him, Daisy began taking off her clothes. She didn‚Äôt do it casually, either. She was slow and sensual, strategically unbuttoning her blouse so that he could watch her breasts steadily tumble out. She was just as subtle when she unzipped the back of her skirt, turned around, and casually slid it off down her thighs, revealing a red G-string thong that perfectly augmented her shapely butt.

It confirmed what Jonathan had suspected. She was a stripper, most likely one that his old boss had hired before for other executives. Given how comfortable she was stripping in a stranger‚Äôs office, Jonathan surmised she had done it before and gotten it down to a system.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs one way to deal with uncomfortable office clothes,‚Äù he joked.

‚ÄúSpeak for yourself, Mr. Casual-Friday,‚Äù Daisy teased while feeling up the in-seam of his custom-made suit.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúalthough it does get a little confining when it‚Äôs this hot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, in that case, why don‚Äôt I help with that?‚Äù

Jonathan didn‚Äôt say a word. He just cast her a goofy grin, which told her everything he needed to tell her. Looking quite comfortable in her bra and thong underwear, Daisy went to work undoing his belt, unzipping his pants, and pulling them down to his ankles, boxers and all.

His semi-erect manhood freed, Jonathan already felt a light sweat forming on his forehead. As Daisy narrowed her gaze on his lower anatomy, he quickly undid his tie and unbuttoned his dress shirt.

‚ÄúOh my,‚Äù she said playfully. ‚ÄúYou keep that confined in those tight pants all day? You have earned this promotion!‚Äù

‚ÄúI like to think that‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôve earned it,‚Äù he quipped.

‚ÄúWell, it looks like it needs some professional attention. Lean back a bit and I‚Äôll get the job done.‚Äù

‚ÄúI look forward to seeing you demonstrate your skills.‚Äù

They both laughed at their shared tone. It resembled that of an executive and an assistant in a serious business meeting. It would‚Äôve been cheesy if Jonathan didn‚Äôt enjoy it so much. He even found it extra arousing, although that might have just been a byproduct of not having sex for so long.

That wait was almost over, though. As he fumbled to get his shirt off, Daisy dropped to her knees and began giving him oral sex. She made it clear from the beginning, though, that she was a true pro.

‚ÄúOohhh, Ms. Daisy!‚Äù Jonathan moaned. ‚ÄúYour skills‚Ä¶they‚Äôre amazing!‚Äù

The beautiful woman glanced up at him, showing an eagerness and motivation that any executive could respect. She wanted his approval, just as he had wanted approval from his former boss and she really worked for it.

She was so thorough, grasping the base of his shaft with one hand while stroking the shaft with the other. She carefully, but fervently worked her lips along the length of his dick, using her tongue to stimulate all those sensitive areas. It felt so good, sending shudders of bliss coursing through his body.

Jonathan had barely managed to get his shirt off, now leaning back on his desk as he soaked in the feeling. He watched her work with such dedication. At one point, she released her grip on the base of his shaft and used it to undo her bra.

‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôll need more advanced techniques,‚Äù Daisy said intently.

He just grinned back at her in approval, watching as those voluptuous breasts of hers hung free. He couldn‚Äôt tell whether they were real. He didn‚Äôt really care, though. Daisy showed that she knew how to use them, positioning his dick right between her fleshy mounds and using them to initiate a full-fledged tit-fuck.

‚ÄúOhhh yeah!‚Äù Jonathan moaned. ‚ÄúThat feels‚Ä¶so advanced.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a professional,‚Äù Daisy said seductively.

Up and down, his manhood slid smoothly between her breasts. He still couldn‚Äôt determine whether they were natural or fake. He honestly couldn‚Äôt care less.

Blissful moans soon morphed into labored grunts. His dick went from just erect to rock hard. Daisy certainly took notice. She even seemed to take pride in it, being able to get a man that aroused with her tits and mouth. It was the mark of a true professional, which seemed quite fitting, given the circumstances.

‚ÄúWow! Talk about hard work paying off,‚Äù Daisy said.

‚ÄúHard‚Ä¶that‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù said Jonathan, already breathless.

‚ÄúYou worked just as hard to get here, Mr. Zander. Hard work should be rewarded. That‚Äôs what I intended to give you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you haven‚Äôt already?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you kidding? That was just the appetizer. Now, it‚Äôs time for the main course!‚Äù

With a lurid tone in her voice and a seductive glint in her eye, Daisy rose back to her feet and kicked off her heels. She then turned around, showing him that perfect ass of hers again, and slid off her thong.

Jonathan‚Äôs mouth watered at the sight of her butt and pussy. He even noticed that she was aroused, a sign that she was among the lucky few in the world who actually enjoyed her job. That didn‚Äôt just give them something in common. It put them on the same page.

‚ÄúTell me, Mr. Zander,‚Äù said Daisy, turning around and showing him all her naked glory. ‚ÄúHow do you want to celebrate your promotion?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I had to choose,‚Äù Jonathan said, already enchanted by the sight, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd pick you up in my arms, set you down on my fancy new desk, and fuck you until I came all over your tits.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù she said curly. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre in luck. That just happens to be my kind of celebrating!‚Äù

Now, it was Jonathan‚Äôs turn to grin playfully. Throwing aside his dress shirt and kicking off his overpriced shoes, the newly-minted executive got off the desk and seized the moment in the name of celebrating his success.

He slipped his arms around Daisy, savoring the feeling of her naked skin pressing up against his, and kissed her intently. She eagerly kissed back, jumping up into his arms and throwing her legs around his waist. He instinctively caught her, which also gave him a perfect grip on her butt. It left him feeling empowered, the flesh of a naked woman pressing meshing with his. Jonathan longed to exercise that power, celebrating the promotion that he worked so hard to earn.

As their lips and tongues twirled in their lustful embrace, he set her down on the polished desk in the exact position he‚Äôd been in moments ago. Daisy kept her legs wrapped around his waist, clinging to his shoulders as he positioned himself in front of her, aligning his dick with her wet entrance.

‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù he asked her, his every word radiating with lust.

‚ÄúLet the celebrating begin!‚Äù Daisy proclaimed.

Heeding her words, Jonathan grabbed hold of her waist and thrust his hips forward, driving his throbbing cock into her. In an instant, he felt the hot warmth of womanly flesh surrounding his manhood. The process was so smooth, his arousal complementing hers. They each let out a blissful moan. From there, they the real celebration began.

His feet planted firmly on the freshly-cleaned rug, Jonathan began humping the beautiful woman in his grasp. Together, their naked bodies rocked in a vigorous rhythm. Like a well-oiled piston, his cock pumped within her pussy. The sound of his pelvis smacking against hers filled the room, along with the light squeaking noise of the fancy desk. Something about that motivated him to intensify the movements, as though it were a manifestation of his hard work.

‚ÄúYes! Ohhh yes!‚Äù Daisy cried out. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! Fuck me! Fuck me like a big, strong executive! Ooh I‚Äôm coming already!‚Äù

She could‚Äôve been faking it. She probably was, but she sure sounded convincing. Jonathan could feel her inner folds throbbing around his dick. The gasps turned to squeals. Rather than just cling to his shoulders, she dug her nails right into his skin. It strong, but in the best possible way.

Fake or not, Jonathan felt even more motivated. Shifting his hands from her waist to her thighs, he pushed he legs farther apart so he could thrust in deeper. He also kissed down her neck, tasting the light sweat that had already formed on her skin. More moans followed. It was like the sweetest music coupled with his favorite treat, the ultimate desert to go along with a momentous event.

‚ÄúDaisy,‚Äù Jonathan grunted, ‚Äúyou like being fucked‚Ä¶by an executive?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! I love it! I fucking love it!‚Äù she affirmed with surprising enthusiasm.

‚ÄúThen that‚Äôs‚Ä¶how I‚Äôll fuck you!‚Äù

In another show of his newfound authority, Jonathan withdrew his cock from her briefly so that he could reposition the naked woman in his grasp. With strength he didn‚Äôt remember having before he got promoted, he pulled her off the desk, turned her around, and bent her over so that her breasts were mashed up against the polished wood. Now facing that heart-shaped ass of hers, he thrust his cock back into her and resumed his vigorous humping.

‚ÄúOh yeah! Ohhh fuck yeah!‚Äù Jonathan seethed. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶is how‚Ä¶an executive fucks!‚Äù

Daisy responded with more blissful moans. He already sounded like a new man, one far removed from the quiet intern he‚Äôd been ten years ago. He‚Äôd worked hard to become that man and he was already loving it.

Daisy must have loved it too. In fact, she seemed to have a fetish for powerful men in business. She kept loudly proclaiming that she was having an orgasm. The more she said it, the less certain he was that she was faking it. That might have been due to his position in a major company and not his sexual prowess, but Jonathan didn‚Äôt care. If he could celebrate his promotion and make a beautiful woman climax, then that was just an awesome bonus.

He worked just as hard to make their sex both memorable and momentous. As the desk shook and Daisy‚Äôs body rocked, Jonathan felt himself approaching his peak. It might have been the most intense peak he‚Äôd felt since his ex-girlfriend dressed up as a sexy librarian in college. It was like a volcano ready to erupt and, like his promotion, it required a little extra effort to achieve it.

‚ÄúDaisy! I‚Ä¶I‚Äôm close!‚Äù he told her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready‚Ä¶to come!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready too, Mr. Zander,‚Äù Daisy replied.

With their lusts perfectly in synch, Jonathan pulled out of her again and she quickly turned around so that she could drop her to knees again. Just as before, she put those voluptuous breasts of hers to good use, pressing his throbbing cock between them. From that position, he slid his manhood between those fleshy mounds of his until he crossed that final threshold.

‚ÄúOohhh Daisy!‚Äù

After those fateful words, the volcano of pent up desire erupted. Holding onto her head, Jonathan closed his eyes and threw his head back as the feeling washed over him like a tsunami of pure ecstasy. It was incredible, his throbbing releasing a thick load of cum onto the beautiful woman‚Äôs amble cleavage. From head to toe, the sensations rippled through his body in a surge of pleasure, power, and accomplishment.

The volume of manly fluid surprised Daisy as much as it did him. She even gasped somewhat at how much ended up on her face. It had definitely been a while for him. A lot of feelings had been pent up in his effort to advance his career. As tough as it had been, the end result was worth it‚Ä¶even if it was somewhat messy.

‚ÄúWow!‚Äù Daisy said. ‚ÄúSo much cum‚Ä¶you really did work hard for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶hard,‚Äù he said, still an orgasmic daze.

They both laughed somewhat as Daisy used her tits to extract every last drop from his manhood. She even made sure to lick up the bits that lingered. Once the ecstasy passed, Jonathan let out the most content sigh he had experienced in over a decade.

He ended up leaning back on his desk, sitting down on the floor next to the naked woman who still had his cum dripping from her tits. She didn‚Äôt seem to mind, though. She even pulled him into a light embrace, as if to offer once last round of congratulations for what he achieved.

‚ÄúA job well done, Mr. Zander,‚Äù she told him.

‚ÄúSpeak for yourself, Ms. Daisy,‚Äù Jonathan laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to make a great executive here. I look forward to celebrating your future achievements with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo do I,‚Äù he told her, ‚Äúand don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll have plenty of achievements worth celebrating in the future. I promise!‚Äù"

ar90xl,7,2019-02-16,How do I subdue my clinginess to people?,SilverDeoxys563,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ar90xl/how_do_i_subdue_my_clinginess_to_people/,"Hello /r/aspergers! I'm a 20-year-old male, and I come here as someone with HFA, but I completely 100% relate to absolutely every fine detail that was stated in [this AMAZING thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/2qivy8/i_have_a_problem_with_people_obsession/) that I found off of Google while trying to research my own problems. You guys seem extremely welcoming, and that's something I really appreciate when I'm trying to mingle with people. There's absolutely no better feeling in this world that I find to be more relaxing than pure acceptance. The more of my own being that is accepted and welcomed by someone, the more at ease I feel with them. Unfortunately, sometimes that feeling of ease leaves me complacent and allows me wiggle room to sort of regress on the social improvement I try to work on.

I'm trying to start a relationship right now, and in order for it to work out, I obviously need to take some action to make sure I'm continuously improving myself rather than worrying solely about her perception of me. I started an engineering internship a month ago and already I feel like I've gone through ages of personal growth which is an incredible feeling! The good news is that every day I feel more and more accepted and open with the person I'm trying to work up to a relationship with in my university who's working at the same engineering firm with me too, so we're clearly interconnected with each other (we have rare moments too!), but I still have personal issues with myself deep down.
___

Specifically, I've historically struggled with leaving people or not knowing their whereabouts, especially my good friends I love being around that I feel secure with. Nowadays I've been doing a lot better with that, and that's one good way I think I've been showing her that I'm improving with this. It's also a ton easier if I know exactly when I'm going to see that person next so that I have certainty that we're not leaving each other for a while. However, I've recently been slowly getting involved in the same organizations as her because I love experiencing things with her, and I really hope that's okay in terms of clinginess. I kinda can't go back on that either, because since she's in them I've made sure I'm fully committed to the causes too. She has been open with me in that she wants to make sure I'm going to different events as well, and I do my best to respect those wishes whenever possible/I'm interested.

Another personality trait I need to work on is excessive giving. I did a good job with not doing anything too crazy for Valentine's Day this week (!!!), but I'm scared I could fall back into my bad habit of superfluous giving to people I really really care about after all that happened this week.

Also, for context: She doesn't know that I have wanted a relationship with her at the present. Considering our history, the context isn't right yet, but it's getting extremely close--I can feel it with the mutual respect/admiration/support we have of each other. Considering my growth as a person, the timing probably isn't right at the moment either. There's still some social things I need to do such as meeting her parents and her meeting mine and such, but I can't just wait for the right time to happen without not doing anything on my own. I talk to her about my dad's support a lot, and how I want to grow to a point where I don't need that kind of support anymore. Social independence is something I really want to achieve, to the point of it being a focus interest for me.

___

**With that said, do you all have any advice on how to manage and subdue clinginess and excessive giving to someone you're interested in/caring about?** I know that I CAN adapt to make it work because that's just who I am and what I know I'm capable of, but I just need some input from you guys who are on the spectrum too in order to figure it out.

Also please go read that reddit thread I linked up above if you haven't already. It changed my life. I've always been chastised for my love for others being awkward and a bad thing, as much as I feel it's cute. Even then I'm still worried about the gender dynamics of it because I'm male, but I know it will work out so well in the end if you guys can give me some feedback! Thanks in advance! &lt;3"
ar98mv,3,2019-02-16,[student] Office tour at small firm that specializes in government auditing,brointurmoil,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ar98mv/student_office_tour_at_small_firm_that/,"Hey guys, curious for your 2 cents about my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

After a successful phone interview they want me to come in for an 'office tour' or something, they never mentioned the word 'interview'.  Anyway its a small firm with offices just inside my state and they specialize in local government and non-profit organization audits.  

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike most public jobs my phone interviewer said they rarely work more than 50 hours a week and never come in on Saturdays.  Plus they will pay for my CPA review and exam.  She also said 9/10 interns are offered full time jobs after the internship.  

&amp;#x200B;

It almost seems too good to be true.  Are there any red flags?  Or is this a place I take advantage of the CPA stuff then bounce? "

arbkhq,1,2019-02-16,Hi! First time casual looking for some advice about whether SFF is right for me.,viishied,sffpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/arbkhq/hi_first_time_casual_looking_for_some_advice/,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a 22 year old grad student who just got a his latest loan check and it's finally time to build a PC like I've wanted to do my whole life.  I expect to be moving/travelling a lot in the future, taking 4 month internships across the country, working abroad after I finish my degree, going home to visit parents and hopefully taking my PC with me etc. So I would like, if it's viable, to have a small PC that I can wrap in a blanket (or buy a case, I'm not sure, whatever you guys suggest) and put in my suitcase or even backpack.   


The main concern I have is how much more it might cost me, which I'm having a hard time getting an idea of from browsing this subreddit. As I said, I'm buying this on student loan money, so while I have a comfortable amount considering I'll be earning wages in a few months, it will be racking up interest for a few years so I'm looking to get something quality and good for me, but not splurge. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's made easier because I don't really care too much about it being a super powerful gaming PC. For the last 8 years I've had a 14 inch alienware laptop which I can't upgrade the parts for, because of course I wanted an alienware I was a 14 year old WoW nerd. I don't game a whole lot, and I mostly play old games (private servers) when I do, but there are a few new games I'd like to try my hand at once I'm off the piece of shit I currently play on. 

I don't care about graphics at all, I've spent my whole life on medium/low settings, and I don't play games for the looks I just play to compete against other people/myself. I also don't really enjoy single player/exploration games where you really want it to look good.  

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially, I want to comfortable play some newer games, on whatever mediocre graphics settings if necessary, but without the horrible screen tearing/lag I currently deal with, but mostly I want to be able to travel by train/airplane with my PC and move apartments etc easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

And again, I'm mainly asking if this is possible on a budget that's comparable to what people spend on decent normal sized PCs, and if so how would I go about doing it?

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm kinda just throwing my problem onto you, but it's just because I really don't know the first thing about PC hardware. I understand if nobody wants to take the time to help me out, but if anybody does I would appreciate it deeply!  


Thanks so much,

Viishied"

arcpfs,0,2019-02-16,Physician Mortgage/Building Credit,HottyToddyMed,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/arcpfs/physician_mortgagebuilding_credit/,"Im going to be moving to the August/NA area to start a Urology residency on July 1st this year. My wife and I currently own a home in Jackson, MS that will be going on the market in a couple weeks. We will be in Augusta for 5 years so according to the rent/buy calculator i did, we will pretty much break even either way. We would much rather buy because it is what we are used to and I love the convenience of having my own place. My wife makes 62K and ill be making 52.5K. We are looking at homes around the 200K price point. Here is where im having a little bit of trouble. My credit score is 694 according to one bank. They need a score of 700 to qualify for 0 down, no PMI, 30 year fixed. They can do the loan with my score, but it will require 5% down which we would probably due if necessary. One bank we talked to can go off of my wifes score because it is 717 and she qualifies for their professional loan program with her masters/CPA.  I have around 175K in student loans, but most places dont count those against me. I guess my biggest questions are:

What can I do to raise my credit score above 700 over the next couple months and does anyone else know of any places that have any really good mortgage programs for a new medical intern?

I believe the reason why my score is on the lower side is because i really just dont have much credit. My wife and I are on a car loan that we have made all payments. We have made all payments on our house we own currently. I have one goodyear card that has 0 balance and I dont use much. I have 4 hard inquires that will drop off in may 2019 from when we bought our car. No derogatory marks. Any idea of cards I could sign up for that would be good for me? I tried to get an Amazon card but pretty sure i got auto denied because of my student loans."
ard51c,1,2019-02-16,Struggling to get over my ex. Its been 6 months and learned she is dating another man.,The_Meatiest,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ard51c/struggling_to_get_over_my_ex_its_been_6_months/," Me and my ex broke off about 6 months ago. We were dating for 5 years with rough patches here and there. (mostly caused by me) But, we were happy. I knew it in my heart. She left for an internship for a month and came back a whole new person that didnt want to be with me for all the wrong reasons. She said she needs to go out in the world on her own and doesnt know if a relationship is the right thing for her. She told countless lies and changed her story so much during the break up I dont even know what she actually felt. 
 I was fully committed to her and I showed it everyday even if my past didnt. We had plans of getting married. When we broke up she mistreated me and made me turn suicidal after months of struggling to find a middle ground. I had a turning point and felt my life coming back around a bit. Then I learned she had already moved on and is dating another guy. I'm having a total relapse. I feel like I'm worthless, I feel like even though I tried my best, it wasnt enough. We were soulmates and we said it everyday. Now she is committed to someone else.
 She never forgave me for the things I did, no matter how big or small. Everything that wasnt in her interest was an attack on her. I've never been rude, or mean until she drove me to insanity, then she plays the victim. I'm always open and honest but that did nothing but make things worse apparently. I made my mistakes but I'm young and need to learn, especially if I was going to make a decision like marriage.
 She has made my life hell for the past 6 months and of course I'm to blame for my mindset, but she sure as shit didnt help. I've though of her almost everyday since the breakup and was hoping she would come back but she said that she wont. I dont understand, I truly loved her and she knew it. I hurt her but there is always pain in every relationship, that's just how people are.

 TL:DR- My ex is dating another guy and its breaking my heart all over again. I need advice on how to move on beyond the obvious ""go take a walk, you will feel better"" bullshit. I still love her on some level and I'm holding onto a fantasy, I cant believe this is reality sometimes. I need to move on and make a life for myself. Please, any help is much appreciated. (P.S. I dont need any sympathy for her, her feelings dont matter much anymore.)"

I feel depressed and think the possibility of grad school is now impossible for me. I applied to their MCS non-thesis program because I am a non-major. I am a senior Info Sci major at a top 20 IS and CS program. Had 2 SWE internships, an AI patent, 9 MOOCs, good LORs, and good SOP explaining how I found my passion for CS after switching from a business track and my struggles of being a first-generation student. I worked so hard in the past year, and I essentially am a double major in CS now (won't be able to finish) and made countless incredibly hard decisions which have continually forced me out of my comfort zone so that I would improve. I have tried so hard, and getting rejection feels like a double rejection because all I want to do is make my mom proud, who supported me and never had the opportunity to go to college herself...

&amp;#x200B;

sigh\* really was hoping my achievements would outweigh my GPA. USC's program I think is my last hope -- and my top choice program. I know they accept a lot of applicant's (and being that this track is geared for non-cs majors) but what are the odds they overlook a poor GPA 2.6\~ major GPA (3.2) from an American applicant? sigh\*  everything else except gre/gpa is strong.

ardok2,14,2019-02-16,I believe that I was in a cult.,nihilistic_gorgonx,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ardok2/i_believe_that_i_was_in_a_cult/,"Let me start this off by saying that I don‚Äôt enjoy speaking on this subject much as it occurred during a very dark time in my life where I was very vulnerable. 
Back in 2016, I was deep in meth addiction, depression, and legal issues. I was lost and just not in a good state of mind. 

Well, one day in July of that year, I met this group in front of Walmart that were raising money for their ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù program by selling handmade wooden crosses. They spoke to me about all the info on the program with the offer that they‚Äôd help me with my legal troubles. As it turns out, I got lucky and was given the choice to get the charges dropped if I attended a long term drug program. Since their program was free, I decided to give it a shot, even though I wasn‚Äôt remotely close to believing in it. I just wanted to get off the junk. 

Anyways, the entire year consisted of bible classes and work until the weekend came in which we‚Äôd travel all over the US to sell our crosses in front of Walmart‚Äôs, TSC, etc even though most of them didn‚Äôt want us there and didn‚Äôt even know that we weren‚Äôt local. We‚Äôd give paperwork with a fake address to get them to allow us to set up. 

Once set up, we‚Äôd rack up at least a couple of thousand a day. (Friday to Sunday) There was at least 19 crews going out across the US and we‚Äôd often come back with well over 100k net every weekend. The weird thing about it was that there was a very limited amount of time we could be on the phone with our families and only a specific amount of days we could actually make plans to see them. Other than that, there‚Äôs no communication and no visitations since we weren‚Äôt allowed to have phones. 

After about 8 months, I was given the opportunity to become an ‚Äúintern‚Äù there to not only lead crews, but I also was given the job of helping the program directors as an intern to help lead the crews for them. I eventually became staff and ended up staying there just a week short of two years. While I was there, I got wrapped up in the emotional and manipulative ideas that they placed on me. On the outside, I never believed, but I‚Äôve always been atheist since I was young. I think that living there and just following them made me trick myself into believing. 

Leaving was a big deal for them. If you even mentioned it, they‚Äôd tell you that you‚Äôre going outside of God‚Äôs will and that you‚Äôre supposed to be there so you can get married and raise a family. (Yes, that‚Äôs an actual practice there) As you can tell from all this, it was no ordinary church. They were racking up big money while trying to play the ‚Äúpoor old church card‚Äù.. The reason that they go fundraising more than places like Teen Challenge, is due to the fact that don‚Äôt get funded by the Assemblies of God Church because their Pastor has a different view on things of the Bible. They were manipulative and never showed where the money went to which was an issue because they didn‚Äôt pay the people in the program, but there also wasn‚Äôt a lot of renovations or building for better dorms for the men. It was awful living quarters for a lot of them. 

This past July was when I had enough and I just told that I was going to leave. I didn‚Äôt even look back. I felt terrible for a long time for being a staff member and trying to help others convince themselves when deep down, I didn‚Äôt believe myself.

I‚Äôm much better now. 2 1/2 years clean and just finished my welding school. I‚Äôm about to get my HVAC certifications as well. I don‚Äôt have anything to do with them anymore, but it still haunts me that there are genuinely good people there who are just looking for direction in life, but are being tasked advantage of for the benefit of their ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. 

I was nervous to post this as I‚Äôm sure that most people would want a name or website, so I‚Äôm not too sure what to expect. It was a strange two years, but I‚Äôm so happy to be past it and on a better path. 

Thanks. "
ardvl9,9,2019-02-16,Double majoring (or minor) in Computer Information Systems worth it or no?,madmax79818515,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ardvl9/double_majoring_or_minor_in_computer_information/,"I'll be finished with my B.S. in Accounting in summer next year. I've been contemplating doing a double major in CIS but it will be 11 more classes, 4 of which are upper level math classes (ugh). They have a minor option but its called Computer Applications instead of CIS, its 5 classes and no math. I dont even know if employers care about minors?

Is either option worth it? Im just trying to give myself as much advantage as possible as a candidate when i graduate because im going into this field with no experience outside of an A/P internship."
ardwbz,24,2019-02-16,"People joking about, defending and normalizing abuse",potje,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/ardwbz/people_joking_about_defending_and_normalizing/,"I go to a place where I make art, it's for people with disabilities, mental health issues, that kind of stuff(I'm trying to keep this relatively short so it's a bit vague, I know, sorry).

&amp;#x200B;

People there, clients like me, but employees, volunteers and interns as well, have a bizarre tendency to talk about abuse. It probably happens at least once every week(and I'm there two days a week at most). It's mostly personal accounts and arguments why it's necesarry and a good thing to beat your children. On the one hand I'm astounded, on the other hand: I've met a lot of people who are incredibly ignorant around the subject of abuse.

I get triggered by it, hard.

It is so, so hard to hear people list reasons for why hitting your children is fine and sometimes necesarry. I know this isn't right, and I know these people are wrong. I know every intelligent person I would ever associate with agrees that hitting your children is abusive and detrimental to their health. If I overheard someone saying ''it's teaching them boundaries!'' on the subway, I'd roll my eyes and turn my music up. But I'm stuck here. I feel incredibly angry in those moments, it feels like a personal attack. Because my life has been hard because of the very things they're talking about, I'm sitting in that chair because of CPTSD, which is due to emotional &amp; physical abuse. So it's very, very bizarre to have to listen to that... shit. It genuinely feels like an attack, and then my body senses danger, and I feel anger building up inside. And then I'm already gone, triggered, and know I'm going to be dealing with this maybe hours, maybe days. Why on earth discuss such a heavy subject in a tiny space? To me, advocating for sexual harassment would feel similar. I'm sitting there surpressing all my emotions, while inside I want to cry or yell or say it's bullshit, shut up. Or educate them. Obviously not going to do that - except for the crying, that does happen sometimes(but then I walk away and no one notices).

I did discuss this with the man who runs this place, and he told me ''if that's what they want to talk about, that's their choice.''

This place is supposed to help clients with disabilities, but they're honestly objectively pretty terrible with CPTSD - my therapist helped me see that. When I get triggered, I go outside to calm down - because when I stay inside, an employee will come tell me why what I'm feeling is wrong. Cool, that's not how triggers work, my system is just freaking out, and emotions are always valid. I don't think anyone is intending to hurt me - they just honestly don't get it. But I don't have the energy to explain what triggers are, or how (C)PTSD works.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago, two interns started talking about their mothers. One of them said ''my mother used to say: come over here, I won't hit you. And then she'd hit me.'' this was followed by loud laughter(which again, both shocked me and didn't surprise me at all). This is exactly what my sister used to do. It's abuse, it's obviously in no way funny. But they just. kept. going. Discussing abusive things their mothers had done, in detail, and then laughing. I had to take some deep breaths but couldn't block it out - not that weird when someone's talking loudly two meters from where I'm sitting. And I just sat there. I walked home and noticed my fists were clenched in my pockets. It pisses me off. And I don't know if that's rational, I just know my emotions are valid. I don't, ever, want to be in the company of people who pretend abuse is hilarious, fine, even good for you. And I don't want to be silent in that situation. I think after what I've been through, I'm allowed to set that boundary - and it's only now that I'm writing this that I realize that.

I'm so exhausted by it, I just feel drained and still triggered - and I need to do something about it. I don't have to sit there and make their ignorance around abuse my problem. What happens to my brain when I force myself to sit in an emotional flashback and do nothing is that I dissociate. Somehow it's only now that I realize why I've been so out of it these past days - I was trapped in something that felt like a traumatic experience, and told myself to stay put. Because I tried to say something and got shut down, and didn't know what else to do. Of course I'm going to do the thing I always do. Blame myself and disappear. Dissociate.

Damn it, that stops now. The self blame and feeling powerless - no more.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to do when no one agrees with me. I can probably isolate myself somewhere, and work in silence, alone. But part of why I'm there is because I need some social interaction. Because there are other clients with CPTSD or depression that I like talking to. I have no idea how to fix this... but this is done. I'm not sitting through another one of these conversations. What a relief. I'm done.

are25x,5,2019-02-16,Dad yells at me for not magically giving him an appointment,GroundhogDayFeeling,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/are25x/dad_yells_at_me_for_not_magically_giving_him_an/,"Hello everyone.

This is my first post and it¬¥s not as flashy as others you¬¥ll see on this subreddit. I¬¥m not even sure it belongs here. I just really wanted to get this off my chest.

Disclaimer: English isn¬¥t my first language or the official language in my country so some nuances got lost in translation.

So, for a bit of background: I¬¥m 21 and at the time of this story I was nearing the end of an internship at a therapy clinic that offers treatment for children as well as adults. We had a long waiting list with some people on the list for well over a year and every month or so we would call everyone who had been on the list for longer than two months to find out whether all data we had was still correct or whether they even still required our services.

I was going through the waiting list that day in between helping the receptionist lady planning the schedule for a new member of the team. Everything seems normal at first ‚Äì some people are annoyed they still have to wait, some have additional info, some don¬¥t require our help any longer ‚Äì until I get to the dad in question. ED will be entitled Dad and ME will be me.

**ME** in my best cheery service-worker-voice: (Name of clinic) (My name) Good morning! Am I speaking to ED?                                                                                                        **ED** (already with a slightly annoyed voice): Yes, that is me. Who are you again?                                                                                                                                                             **ME**: I¬¥m calling from (Name of clinic). I¬¥m currently checking with everyone on the waiting list and I have your daughter¬¥s file here so I wanted to check in whether you still require our services or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        **ED** (still annoyed, but margainally less so): Well, you called at a bad time, I¬¥m currently at work. I need to speak about this with my wife. When is the appointment you have for us?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **ME** (growing anxious at his presumption but still friendly): I\`m sorry Sir, we currently don¬¥t have a free time slot. This is a routine call to make sure our files are up to date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **ED** (now getting pissed): WHAT? Why are you calling me if you don¬¥t have an appointment for my daughter?                                                                                                                                                    **ME**: Well, like I said, Sir, I want to ensure our files are up to date, that you still want our services and at the time we have put down -                                                                                                                                                    **ED** (Cuts me off, now half-yelling): Of course we still want it! Why wouldn¬¥t we?                                                                                                                                                            **ME**: Well, it¬¥s possible you found a clinic elsewhere. I also need to know whether you are still available at the same times. I have you written down for Monday and Tuesday after 4pm, is that correct? (I don¬¥t recall the exact times, only that it was something ridiculously specific)                                                                                                                                                    **ED**: Of course it¬¥s correct? Why would it change?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **ME** (annoyed at this point, but trying to keep my composure and remain professional): Sometimes I get informed that a child picked up a hobby or that work times changed so I wanted to check that the times I have written down for your daughter are still correct so I can inform you as soon as we have a free time slot that¬¥s relevant to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **ED**: And when will that be?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **ME**: That is quite difficult to say, it depends on factors like a client completing their therapy or having to take a break but the least you can expect are two months (our standard answer since that is about the time it takes to complete a prescription).                                                                                                                                                         **ED** (screaming again): You told me that last time already!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **ME**: Sir, I have never spoken to you before. A colleague might have told you that.                                                                                                                                                         **ED**: It¬¥s the same bullshit they told me at the other clinics!

Then I hung up and was finally done with him. I was close to shaking from the stress this bloody call put me under.

are44v,0,2019-02-16,[D] Currently enrolled in a masters degree in Computer Science and am looking for an internship over the summer - care to help me make my decision about which internship to pick?,The_Grey_Wolf,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/are44v/d_currently_enrolled_in_a_masters_degree_in/,"Hello guys,

I'm posting this here since I think this is the best subreddit to post to, so you can help me make a decision which I'm a bit fuzzy about making.

**My background**

Ever since I read *Superintelligence* by Nick Bostorm I decided that I want to learn more about AI safety. To do that, I decided that I will spend some time building the fundamentals - learning about machine learning - and then contribute to AI safety. I am currently enrolled in a Computer Science major which features some AI-related courses (such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning etc.). *To this very day, I haven't had an internship, except for a very brief period of freelance work.*

**My future plans**

Since eventually I want to do AI safety research, I will probably do a PhD in Machine Learning. But, before I do a PhD (in between my masters degree and my PhD) I would like to get a taste for the Machine Learning landscape. I would prefer to do an internship for some research scientist position, but I feel that I am not yet able enough to do substantial amount of research on my own.

**Internships this summer - the most optimal for my position?**

So, with the above being said, I am faced with (essentially) 3 choices in applying for internships:

1. Research scientist internships - this way I could test out if I actually like doing research, but I don't know if companies exist out there that would take me, a Computer Science major, and show me the research process and guide me
2. Research engineer internships - balance between a research scientist and a ""regular"" software engineer; I read something about this on this subreddit and people had divergent opinions, but the taste I was left with was not to really do this unless it is somewhere like DeepMind
3. ""Classical"" software engineering roles - could be in some major companies, minor local companies etc.

*If you were me, what would you do?* My long-term goal being eventually becoming a research scientist and doing research independently. Keep in mind I haven't had extensive programming experience in the ""computer science"" industry.

Thank you in advance!"

I hope I'll make the reading epic enough for you to be entertained !

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER**

I am in now way a nutritionist nor a sport expert. I'll share my own experience and my advices are not holy words whatsoever.

I also am a fairly healthy person, with no prior medical condition, no known metabolical disorder of any sort.

Therefore, if you have specific medical conditions, always check with your doctor first. Don't overdo yourself because I told you I could do it.

On a genetical and metabolical point of view, we have our own pros and cons, so be aware of your own health etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The boring part being done let's go !

&amp;#x200B;

**My story**

I've been overweight for almost as long as I can remember. I was the typical smart kid with glasses, too much weight and not enough friends. It took me 24 years, and hitting 273 pounds (124 kgs) to realize something needed to change.

Oh, short break: I hate the imperial system, but I love using pounds about the weight I've lost because it feels like I lost so much more it's motivating.

Anyway, when I realized I had to drop weight I was in college. And luckily, as in a lot of colleges, there was a gym I could go in the evening. So I started going, four times a week. I had been given a few years ago a work out program, working all muscle groups. It lasted for a few months, but then I had an internship to do, in another city.

I was having lunch with my colleagues, in restaurants 5 days a week. And it was messy, al LOT... Desserts, sauce, fats and other useless extras I was taking, and you can bet I stored this freakin' weight. I stepped on the scale, and oh boi.

Down the road we go. So I started watching motivational videos. Watching people having lost so much weight, discovering their stories... Thinking ""I would love to lose that much wiehgt too !"". But here is the twist: I never thought ""I COULD do that too."" Until one day, wandering around the internets looking for motivation, and I found it !!!

It was a post, written by some dude who took on running after being adviced so by a hooker he was seeing.

Pretty unlikely you'd think, but hey. I identified myself in the story told by this man (except for the hooker part).

And I bought running shoes. Quite expensive one I must say, around 180‚Ç¨. The guy said, if you buy expensive shoes, you'll fell more guilty to leave them rotting in a drawer. May not be 100% effective, but if you tell yourself that, maybe you too will catch on.

On saturday 27/07/2013 I was buying my first pair of running shoes. The next monday I started my first willingful jogging ever. It sucked, I suffered and barely ran 11 minutes. But those were MY 11 minutes. I DID them. I freakin' dropped sweat, tears and pain but they were mine. And for 5 days a week I would go running. The guy that inspired me was saying that he'd run 5 days a week, eat clean and then on week end would eat a ton of food, desserts and so on.

I couldn't do that. Because I would ruin my efforts of the week. Beside running I was eating clean. We finally had a special company restaurant where I could have healthy options and where I wouldn't take mayonese, ketchup and where I could have salad and fish.

I know eating healthy is difficult when you're not in a stable environment, but doing your truly is best is better than doing nothing at all.

Once back in college, I kept on running. I don't recall much of my eating habits, but I can tell you for sure, I was eating waaaaaay better than in my junior year.

At the end of my last year of college, I moved abroad for a last internship. And I didn't stop excercising.

But I was lucky, it was in asia and I had decent healthy food options and cheap, in addition to that.

During that time, I would either run on a treadmill or go to the swimming pool. I was getting bored of running.

Flash forward to me starting a new job, end 2014. It was at that time I was told about a particular workout program: INSANITY.

Simply put, INSANITY is a video program, hosted by Shaun T a muscular and lean man screaming at you and his crew while doing crazy workouts. Hence the name for sure. So I started that, and here I was, jumping, crawling around, giving my full self into these workouts. Unfortunately, it was so extreme I had some sort of periostitis, an inflammation in the leg tissue.

I needed a backup plan, and may the gods be praised, Shaun T had one. Insanity MAX 30 ! A workout program that would be only 30 minutes long, with a modifier version to be no impact and preserve my fragile body parts.

And I kept on going, the full program is two months long. And do you know how much weight I lost ? 15 pounds. I was finally under 100kgs (220 pounds). My dream ! I was finally not a three digits number on the damn scale !

That was a damn achievement. This happened the 8th of March 2015. Two years into working out.

I took on other programs, such as P90X3, similar to MAX 30 but with more weight lifting.

From there, things went a bit downhill for me personnaly. I lost my girlfriend then my dad, and I had quit smoking at the same time. To be fair, quitting smoking has been undecently easy but I believe I suffered some metabolical backlash afterwards.

Anyway, from there I regained all the weight I had lost, because all the bad habits I got rid of came back, and because my metabolism is a bitch. I will not drag on the years where my weight came back, there is nothing much notable to be said.

I have one exception to make, on the year 2017 I ran one semi marathon (2h39 minutes) and did a Mud Day, an obstacle run with a lot of challenges.

I will fast forward to 2019 where, after gaining back so much weight I decided to get back very seriously  at working out and eating healthy.

Here is the end of my personnal story, I will now give you my advices and points of view on how to start and keep living healthy.

Please note that I am a single person no childs around and I am giving these advice not accounting for the problems you may have and I haven't. Therefore, not being able to reach the same objectives or milestones as I did is in no way a shame or a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Live by these rules**

&amp;#x200B;

**NO SPORT NO EATING**

Working out must become part of your life. The same way you shower every day, you eat every day and go the toilet every day, sport is not an option. I've had days where it was 9 pm, and I didn't eat before I was done with my damn work out.

&amp;#x200B;

**GREEN TEA IS YOUR NEW COFFEE**

Everything is in the title. You should drink a LOT of green tea so you can enjoy draining effects and other anty oxidant and stuff. I drink it so I don't stock too much water. I personnaly drink around 1.5L of green tea everyday. I add to this water during work outs and at my office. I drink my tea at home. And obviously NO SUGAR in the tea.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCIPLINE &gt; MOTIVATION**

Following what I previously said, once you have acknowledged that sport is now a part of your life, you will not need any motivation to do what you want to do. You will do it because you HAVE to do it, not because you WANT to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**FOOD IS NOT A REWARD**

You've been in a good strike, losing weight continuously, so you feel like you deserve a small treat.

WRONG. The only consequence of this is the weight you will gain back because you felt like an all-you-can-eat buffet was deserved after dropping 10 pounds.

Depending on the program you'll be following, if you have one, some people will say you will have to have not extras during the program. And this is socially difficult. Because you have restaurants with coworkers, you have a birthday to celebrate, and so on, and so forth.

I unfortunately do not have a good answer to this one myself, as I am in the same dilemna you are.

I would recommend to find an healthy option you can eat but that tastes better, or is a bit more unusual compared to what you have regularly so you can have this feeling of variety and freshness as you eat something you don't have often.

However, KFC or Burger King should not be invited to the party.

&amp;#x200B;

**GOOD BYE JUNK FOOD**

One of the worst bummers, especially when sugar is your thing. It seems to be that sugar has a way worse impact on weight loss than fat. Simply put, from what I understand, high sugar presence in your blood will make your body more prone to store fats. Therefore, cookies, pastries, sodas and all sorts of sweet stuff must go.

&amp;#x200B;

**EATING HEALTHY IS NOT BEING ON A DIET**

Changing your way of eating is not being on a diet. I don't believe in diet at all, and as far as I'm concerned I say fook off to paleo, low carbs, full prot, unicorn based protein and whatever gibberish you may be interested in selling.

In my opinion, eating healthy, diversified and junk food free meals is the best way for a sustainable weight loss.

Being on a diet means it will had to end at some point. And therefore, all the foods that were previously forbidden will come back. And you know what else will come back. THE FREAKIN WEIGHT you cried and sweated to lose.

And this is a no. I'm not yoyoing the shit out of my metabolism just because some maniac sold me a diet based on fairy powder and minotaur's flesh. Again, you people are perfectly free to do whatever you want with your eating habits. Just know I'm not doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

**FIND A WORKOUT PROGRAM YOU LIKE**

As I said earlier, sport is a compulsory part of your day. No discussion.

However, when going to the gym, I would get bored as hell if I was rowing for 45 minutes.

Realize that working out doesn't have to take long, and it doesn't always have to happen in a gym.

Some of the programs existing out there do not require equipment, and the extra fat you carry will serve as dumbells in a way.

I enjoy video programs because they keep me company while I'm cursing at the damn trainer telling me to keep going.

Moreover, you get to see how much time is left for the day. And you'll realize that you've already reach the first quarter, then half, the last quarter, and THEN the last excercize of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

**WORKING OUT IS NOT TIME CONSUMING**

I didn't point out much in my story how much of a geek I was, and still damn am.

I realized when I starting running that it would cost me only half an hour of sports. (Not including shower anyway).

Half an hour of running would be around one game of LOL. So I was like **""If I play one less game of LOL I will be able to get the body I have dreamed of my entire life ? Sign me in bitches !""**

Again, I don't know what the life of a parent is, so I'm not judging if you can't find the 30 minutes AND the energy to work out.

But I believe I'm setting requirements that can be met by A LOT of persons. A LOT.

&amp;#x200B;

**DON'T HURT YOURSELF WHILE WORKING OUT**

There is no point in losing weight if you're scrapping your joints so much they won't last for the next 10 years.

If you're too overweight, or naturally heavy because you're tall (and overweight), don't jump. Don't do full burpees that will ruin you in no time.

You want to be healthy AND not overweight, not only the half of that.

&amp;#x200B;

**WEIGHT LOSS AND SELF CONFIDENCE**

I will now talk about what some of us feel, and why they want to lose weight.

I'm a man, so I'll speak from my point of view but I believe that some girls may find my personnal experience relevant as well.

I've always wanted to lose weight because I felt it was that that was stopping me from getting a girlfriend.

Being fat, feeling ugly, and basically not feeling any good reason why people would be attracted in me has always been a concern.

The truth is, as you will lose weight, you will accept more and more the fat you still have, and you will start to realize that fat isn't the one holding you back.

I fairly believe that look and fashion are what make a first impression but I also believe that it's what will come out of your mouth and the general ""aura"" you give to people that will make people attracted in you.

I have to admit, it was when I was doing good with my weight loss that I could get girlfriends.

But then, when I was gaining up weight I would still be able to interest people and to flirt.

Maybe you will more free once you've dropped the pounds that always hindered you, but at some point you will realize that you are much more than a number on a weighting scale.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where am I now ?**

As I'm writing these lines, Im 112.5 kgs (247 pounds) and I'm planning on going under 100 kgs again.

I am trying some nutriotionnal supplements now, namely guarana, caffeine etc.

It seems to have a good impact on me, but again, check with your doctor. You can't overdose yourself of caffeine just to drop pounds.

I'm currently doing a second round of 21 Day Fix Extreme, and since my birthday is in March I'll try to start a longer workout program after my BDay. I hate breaks in the middle of a program, feels like I'm failing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I wrote everything in one shot. I've been wanting to do that for so long, now I've given you my view of life and my experience and I truly hope that at least someone today will make the first step towards a healthier and happier lifestyle.

If I spent more than an hour to write that and if only one person takes on this journey. Then I'll already be successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember people, your weight loss journey starts with you, and nothing else."
areejf,99,2019-02-16,6 easy things you can do to help the persecuted Uighur,WhyNotIslam,islam,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/areejf/6_easy_things_you_can_do_to_help_the_persecuted/,"#https://www.saveuighur.org/act-now/

By God, we are seeing multiple Holocausts occurring in our era. Just those in the 20th century wasn't enough. Religious minorities are being persecuted and oppressed by fascist countries throughout the world. Just one is the Uighur of East Turkestan, renamed to Xinjiang meaning ""new colony"" by the Chinese govt., implying their sinister intentions.  Rape and murder is occurring everyday. Over 2 Million Uighur are in Concentration camps. A govt man is stationed in each Uighur home to report any Islamic activity. Anyone accused of Islamic activity is sent to investigation then the Concentration camps. [I Begged Them To Kill Me](https://youtu.be/_hCoh2snUgw?t=78)

They  cannot say Salam (""peace""), they are forced to eat pork, they are forced to do labor, their cell phones require spyware, their cars are tracked, their passports confiscated. There isn't much we can do to help them as individuals except pray to God but as a group we can help enact economic and political pressure if God wills.

""As Muslims and as Americans, we cherish and uphold freedom of religion.This God-given right (Quran 2:256) is enshrined in our constitution. We must retain our role as a nation that leads in democratic values, even as we watch authoritarianism seek to sweep them away worldwide. We must speak up for freedom, liberty, and justice for Uighurs. Here is what you can do:

**1. Contact your Congresspersons and Senators**

These men and women were elected and chosen to represent you and your concerns. Make sure they hear from you asking them to do the following:

To pass S.3622  &amp; H.R.7123 S.3622 &amp; H.R.7123 - Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2018. It has 21 Senators and 17 congresspersons cosponsoring it. If your congressperson and Senators are not involved please call them. Check Congress.gov for details.

Ask that Uighur be treated as Tibetans. Unlike the Tibetans, Uighur do not benefit from a well-defined U.S. policy supporting their political rights, autonomy and identity.

Open consulates in the East Turkestan regional capital of Urumchi that will permit a closer monitoring of human rights conditions in the region.

Use the ‚ÄúGlobal Magnitsky Act‚Äù to take action against the Chinese officials complicit in human rights violations.

Call on China to immediately release all internees in camps.

Establish a ‚ÄúSpecial Coordinator for Uighur Affairs.‚Äù

**2. Write and call the Chinese Embassy** 

Here are points to make when you communicate with them:

China must close all concentration camps

China must respect families by not taking away children and not inserting Chinese men into Uighur family homes

China must grant Uighurs full freedom of religion: To pray, enter mosques, pay Zakat, fast in Ramadan and perform Hajj

Contact info:

Chinese Embassy - Washington, DC 1-202-495-2266

Consulate - New York    1-212-244-9392

Consulate - Chicago    1-312-453-0210

Consulate - San Francisco     1-415-852-5900
Consulate - Houston    1-713-520-1462

**3. Donate to end concentration camps**

The Uighur Muslim leadership is disturbed and concerned about the silence and inaction of American Muslims, as well as that of Muslim-majority countries. Sound Vision is helping guide the Uighur leadership, and has arranged meetings on their behalf in Washington DC, Chicago, Toronto, Houston, New York, and Los Angeles. We need your donations to hire two full-time staff and several interns to educate and mobilize to close these concentration camps.  Please mail your checks to Sound Vision, 27 E. Monroe St. #700, Chicago IL 60603. Or go online www.SoundVision.com/give

Sound Vision has led many campaigns for Muslims persecuted because of their faith in the past. Bosnia Task Force, and now Burma Task Force are based in Sound Vision. Sound Vision arranges public relations, media, and resource development for the Muslim community.

**4. Please volunteer to help this cause**

We urgently need volunteers with the following skills. Please email volunteer@SoundVision.com if you can help:

Masjid ambassadors to keep a Masjid informed and engaged on this issue

Organizing presentations and fundraisers

Interfaith outreach to mobilize them for this cause

Social media mobilizers

Writers to record and write stories of Uighur survivors

Translators from English to Arabic, Indonesian, Urdu, Bangla and languages used in various African countries

**5. March for Uighurs: April 6, 2019 in DC**

April 6, 2019 is the date set for worldwide demonstrations against the Chinese government‚Äôs persecution of Uighurs. Please join us in Washington DC or organize in your city.

arf383,15,2019-02-16,Dilemma of choosing an internship: in Singapore or the US?,naoki_1010,aznidentity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/arf383/dilemma_of_choosing_an_internship_in_singapore_or/,"what's up bros

&amp;#x200B;

I've been finding myself in this dilemma:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a rising senior in school, and have my last 6-month internship during school coming up very soon. I've two options in hand as of now: I could work at a startup in Singapore doing data science and analytics (which pays me around 1900-2000 USD a month, plus a stipend from school that covers my travel ) or I could go back to my previous summer's employer, one of the biggest options trading firms here in the US doing trading analytics.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I really want to go to Singapore because I don't think I'd get the opportunity to travel all of SEA and at the same time live there without having to go to school, once I start working full-time or go to graduate school. I'm also a very big history and culture nerd, and SEA is one of my favorite places in the world. I get to see the world (can't save as much then). The issues however, are lower pay in comparison to America (I'm frugal, i also can get my tax returns to prop me up, I know people in Singapore etc) and other stuff like finding a quick subletter for my apartment, missing so many close friends' graduation etc.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I would get paid much more (have meals covered, office is like 10 minutes away from my apartment) if I go back to my old employer. And along with it comes the highly potential chance of getting a full-time offer by the time I graduate (I don't think I'd want to move to Asia for full-time work yet, however). But well, I get to miss the whole experience of being able to live in Asia.

&amp;#x200B;

In a way, I wanna go to SEA since I also sort of want to mentally rejuvenate myself/refresh: school has been intense, mental health not so good, just got out of a relationship-sort of situation. But my parents are not too well-off, so I don't want to screw over the safety of having a high-paying starting full time job.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys do ? Any words of advice? If anyone who lived in Singapore or SEA, do you guys recommend it?"

But at the same time, he's the guy who totally loved Mer for who she is - all the carousel, dark and twisty thing going on. He accepted how Cristina just needs Mer sometimes and never tries to replace her in his life. Even though he was a black and white sorta guy (like he honestly couldnt understand why Mer would feel bad for a killer), he just lets her be and comforts her though he knows she really might get Alzheimer's in the end which I find so beautiful. So help me out people - what does this make him? Great or nay? Or does he just reflect people in reality. And if so, would you guys say that he's a great guy or an overrated one? 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I also want to know thoughts about when Mer said that for Derek, she's always gonna be the young intern he fell in love with and he the hot shot surgeon. Does Mcdreamy's ego need constant boosting or something? And, is that why he didn't super love Addison? I mean Mark said that Derek just walked out when he caught them in bed but Mark just talked to Mer, and he got punched... "
argu2k,28,2019-02-16,How to Hire a Professional Lawyer that‚Äôll Help You Win Your Personal Injury Case,KeishaM,u_KeishaM,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KeishaM/comments/argu2k/how_to_hire_a_professional_lawyer_thatll_help_you/,"Choosing a lawyer for dealing with your personal injury case is a cumbersome task, and it might be possible that you may or may not find the best one to fight your case. To make sure that such is not the case then you should make sure that you do some research on the lawyer that you are going to choose for your case. If you are a US veteran for instance, and you have a work related injury case at hand, you can check out [3m military earplug lawsuit](https://militaryearplug.com/) to learn more about the personal injury case lawyers. 

Here are some of the tips that would help you to hire the right personal injury lawyer: 

**1.¬†¬†¬† Look out for recommendations** 

It would be best to seek out help from people you know to have won a [personal injury related case](https://www.forbessolicitors.co.uk/for-you/personal-injury.htm) in the past through the help of a professional lawyer that can help you win your case. Alternatively, you can search for such services online or can even approach the lawyer in person to make sure that you have no doubts regarding the case. You should also make a list of potential lawyers whom you consider best to fight your case and interview all of them to arrive at a conclusion. Be ready with relevant questions regarding your case and ask the lawyers about the chances of winning in your case.¬† 

**2.¬†¬†¬† Discuss the fees before signing** 

It would be best that you discuss the fees before signing the lawyer so that you are sure that everything falls within your budget. You must tell them the complexity of your case and then only arrive at a conclusion so that you can make the best decision in your favor. Be ready to negotiate so that you can crack a good deal. Also, ask them about the [no fee, no recovery policy](https://dominguezfirm.com/about/no-recovery-no-fee/) so that your things fall in your favor even when you do not win. 

**3.¬†¬†¬† Ask them about their experience** 

It is considered ideal that you ask the lawyer about their experience in this field and what kind of cases they have fought for the people so that you have a clear idea about their background.¬† Research about them online and garner some information about them on your own so that you have a fair idea as to whether to hire them or not.¬† 

**4.¬†¬†¬† Ask them whether they would take care of your case personally** 

Ask the lawyer whether they will transfer your case to their secretary or an intern so that you have a fair idea as to how your case is going to be fought. In case the lawyer is not attending to you personally and has asked his assistant to take up your case then it would be best that you avoid taking their services, as then you are confident that you won‚Äôt be enjoying from their wealth of experience and knowledge.¬† 

**5.¬†¬†¬† Listen to your gut feeling** 

Even when someone recommends you a lawyer, it would be best that you go with your gut feeling and finalize hiring the one that you find the most suitable to fight your case. Prepare your questions regarding the case, your expectations, along with other legalities so that you are clear about hiring them. After all, it is you who would be investing time and money in the case to make sure that the results are positive. Be clear about your case with the lawyer and share all the intricacies of the case so that you are sure about hiring them. 

**6.¬†¬†¬† Consider whether your lawyer has a vast professional network** 

For dealing with the cases of personal injury it is required that the lawyer should have a vast network of professionals who can look after the case quite well. He must be able to call professionals from a different field so that they have more resources from where they can manage to help you win the case.¬† 

**7.¬†¬†¬† Check the work style of the lawyer** 

The working style of the lawyer must match what you are looking for so that you can be benefited. Make sure that they communicable and reachable throughout the case so that you can share the intricate details regarding your case quite freely with them.¬† 

**8.¬†¬†¬† Check the specialization of the lawyer** 

You must make sure to [check the specialization of your lawyer](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/types-of-lawyers) and whether or not they hold the right credentials that are required to fight a personal injury case. Check their accreditation before you finalize them for your case.¬† Check all the legal documents related to the practice of that particular case so that you have no doubts at the end. 

These are some of the tips that would help you in choosing the lawyer of your choice. Only hire a lawyer when you are sure that they would serve your purpose completely and would ensure high chances of winning.¬†¬† "
argxic,2,2019-02-16,Applying for jobs,Throwaway18668854,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/argxic/applying_for_jobs/,"I'll be graduating from uni in June (with a bachelor because I was too stupid for a masters). So I'm supposed to be applying for jobs an internships right now, but I can't stop thinking about the possibility that I won't get a job. Because I'm not cute or charismatic and I don't have an amazing work history or good contacts, and when I've tried to find summer jobs while at uni I've been dismissed by everyone.

There are so many people who are competing for these jobs and they're all better than me in some way. And what do you do with your stupid degree and your stupid loans if no one wants to hire you. 

Writing personal letters is also hell because I hate everything about myself. I don't have any positive traits to speak off and my job experience is in manufacturing and call centres so I haven't done anything meaningful at my previous jobs. I'm just a worthless person who doesn't have any cool talents that I've worked hard to develop and who's only alive because the idea of my death being an inconvenience for other people made me so anxious that I couldn't do it.

I'm also being thrown out of my apartment in August due to the whole graduation thing and the rental market here is so hard that my five years of queue time won't get me anything at all. Which means that I'll probably have to move back in with my parents. I've been independent for three years and I don't want to move back to my shitty hometown where all of the people who made my life hell still live. "

I was a junior in college who enjoyed math and liked my business classes, so, it seemed like a natural fit. I was an overachieving 4.0 GPA kid in school who never backed down from a challenge.


Over winter break, I studied hard while my friends &amp; family did fun things. It killed me to stay in on my ‚Äútime off‚Äù, but I decided to study. In January, I sat for the exam, passed, and then started studying for FM. I was lucky enough to find an internship at a small company that summer and had a deceit experience and made good money for an intern.


Fast forward to today. I‚Äôve been working a corporate job for 3 years with a large multinational insurance company under a competitive Actuarial Rotational Program. 3 years out of college, I‚Äôm making 6 figures and don‚Äôt hate my job. I‚Äôve never failed an exam or a module throughout my journey. I‚Äôm about to sit for my last Fellowship exam in the spring. From the outside looking in, people would likely consider my progress a huge success. Even at work, I‚Äôve succeeded at both roles I‚Äôve had so far and my boss says I‚Äôm bound to be a great leader for the organization one day. I know there are countless people around the world who would kill to be in my position.


But, my entire life has revolved around work and exams. For the last 5 years, the word ‚Äúactuary‚Äù has haunted my existence. There hasn‚Äôt been one 24-hour window where I haven‚Äôt thought about an exam I just took or am about to take. I feel overwhelmed with guilt when I‚Äôm having fun because I‚Äôm not studying or working. I feel guilt when I‚Äôm studying because I‚Äôm not out having fun.


While I‚Äôm at the office, I feel like I‚Äôm just a hamster on a wheel. No matter how well I do, (or how poorly), the wheel will always be there with more projects, coding, &amp; problems. People at the office are generally very jaded and no one ever smiles. I now fully understand why people call it the ‚Äúrat race‚Äù, and, it kills me to see co-workers being so standoffish for personal gain when we‚Äôre all supposed to be a team. Sometimes, It feels like I‚Äôm selling my soul to the office environment.


As I‚Äôm staring down my last exam, it feels like I‚Äôm just tightening my own golden handcuffs with a ~20% raise to come if I pass along with the potential for future equity bonuses. The last 5 years have been quite the trek, and, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm going to stop, but some reflection has made me think. I often find myself thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take half as much money for something I really enjoy‚Äù. I wake up dreading Monday morning and wish the road was over. But, I‚Äôve never given up on anything on my life and I don‚Äôt intend to so close to the finish. My plan is to check this last exam off the list and then re-evaluate.


I want anyone in the same situation as me 5 years ago to know it‚Äôs not a race. Don‚Äôt compromise living live to finish these exams. Also, the moment you feel something‚Äôs not right, don‚Äôt go chasing the next exam. Take a step back and evaluate. You only have a limited number of days on this earth. Enjoy time with friends and being a human. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Treating it like a sprint will leave you burnt out &amp; discouraged. In the end, I‚Äôll be okay. But, I could have made the last 5 years much better in hindsight.


TLDR: With a lot of aspiring actuaries on this sub, I want people to know this journey is a marathon. Don‚Äôt compromise relationships and your personal happiness for the pursuit of credentials."

arh8kl,1,2019-02-16,"I have got a bit of a Limitless (the movie) scenario going on with my ADHD medication, and I don‚Äôt want it to get out of hand.",SurfaceCard,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/arh8kl/i_have_got_a_bit_of_a_limitless_the_movie/,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôve got a dilemma about my ADHD medication.
Before I get straight into my issue I will give you some context and history about my ADHD and medication.

Diagnosed at the age of 7 and prescribed 10mg of Methylphenidate quick release

Age of 7.5: 10mg x2 of Methylphenidate QR

Age of 8: 20mg x2 of Methylphenidate QR

Age of 10: 30mg x2 of Methylphenidate QR


Age of 14: 52mg of Concerta XL slow release

Age of 16: 72mg of Concerta XL slow release; 20mg of Concerta XL for homework in the evening (when needed)

Age of 18: 92mg of Concerta XL slow release

And this dose worked until I was in the start of my third year at University (just turned 20) when my workload become a lot more intense and my grades started slipping and I couldn‚Äôt keep up. 

And for context the way the ADHD support system works in the UK is you have a meeting every 6 months with a ADHD psychiatrist until you turn 18 and you‚Äôre discharged from support unless your doctor still thinks you still have ongoing ADHD issues (which was the case for me) but you get placed into a lower priority system where you‚Äôre matched with a ‚Äúpsychiatrist nurse‚Äù or something. 

When I was discussing my issues about my Academics with her, she thinks the pattern with my medication increasing is: whenever I move to the next stage in school and workload increases (eg GCSE to A-levels to University) the NHS always gives more pills to help me cope, which is true. 
So she‚Äôs thinks the best way to progress in the long term in my life, is to give me a open ended/limitless supply of 20mg of Methylphenidate quick release to use in conjunction with the 92mg of Concerta XL. 

So this was a 2-3 months ago now and it has been really effective, perhaps too effective. It seems that the combination of both of the drugs has shot me up to an extremely intense level of focus and intelligence (if feels like my brain has been‚Äúupgraded‚Äù, if that makes sense). I‚Äôve gone from getting Ds &amp; Cs to As &amp; A* in my studies, I‚Äôve been working harder, smarter and for longer, my attitude to work has completely changed. It seems that I‚Äôm vastly better at everything I try to do, for example for the last 3 weeks I‚Äôve been learning C# and started to learn how to speak French by myself. Also, something that‚Äôs really put this in perspective recently is I‚Äôve been asked to run a tutoring lesson for first year students. Fuck! I was one of the struggling students in that very class, I‚Äôm now running.  But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs sustainable and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm starting to abuse it (now taking my 92mg of Concerta and 20mg x3 methylphenidate spread out across the day)

And here‚Äôs my dilemma: I study Finance &amp; Economics at University and I hope to start my career in Finance and Banking if everything goes well. Obviously this industry is extremely competitive and requires a certain type of person and skill set. 
If I‚Äôm fortunate enough to get some internships or job at a financial institution and my boss notices my artificially enhanced performance and promotes me, which means I need to perform at an even higher level, so I need to take more to keep up with myself.

This really worries me because this cannot be sustainable and I could be creating a never ending cycle that forces me take more and more pills to keep up at work. 
Additionally, I‚Äôve noticed some side effects that‚Äôs a bit worrying, like mild hallucinations in my peripheral vision. My ‚Äúpsychiatrist nurse‚Äù said it‚Äôs not possible to become addicted to my medication but I‚Äôm really not sure.

TL;DR: I have got a bit of a Limitless (the movie) scenario going on, and I don‚Äôt want it to get out of hand.

arhjku,30,2019-02-17,Koroshiya,poloniumpoisoning,PPoisoningTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/comments/arhjku/koroshiya/,"My grandfather committed suicide in 1990, when I was a child. His body was found by me and my parents, who lived with him at the time; being his son, my father fell apart before the gruesome scene: an old man hanging from the ceiling, his fresh corpse still softly swinging to the sides.

It was up to my mother to quickly try to protect me from the awful truth, but it was too late. Seeing him dead really messed me up in the head and deeply damaged me emotionally, no matter how much therapy I‚Äôve been through in the last three decades.

Before climbing the stool and kicking it so the rope would tighten around his already fragile neck, my grandfather cut one of his wrists and wrote the weird word in blood across his white shirt: *koroshiya*.

I had no idea what this meant back then, being only 6. The only thing I remember were my father‚Äôs hysterical cries, as my mother screamed for help, always placing her big hand over my eyes like a blindfold. The neighbors came and called the police and an ambulance.

‚ÄúDo you wanna know why, Marcus?‚Äù my mother asked my father, a few days later.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôs not the good man I know‚Äù.

So she gave my grandfather‚Äôs suicide letter to my uncle, but made a copy. It was years later that I found it.

My grandfather died at 68; he was old, but not ancient, and probably not too close to death by natural causes.

After two years, my father was a total mess. My mother divorced him so we didn‚Äôt have to suffer through his alcohol problems; he was never aggressive, he just cried until he blacked out from the booze and couldn‚Äôt keep a job anymore.

For years I wondered why, but it was always in the back of my head. I tried not to think about it. My mother worked hard to make my life good and provide on her own everything I needed, both money and affection-wise.

A few weeks after we moved to another place, I overheard my mother complaining to her friend that my grandfather was inconsiderate, and that stuck to me. To this day, I can repeat what she said word by word.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tragedy that the old man committed suicide, but damn! That‚Äôs so inconsiderate. I don‚Äôt even care about me or his son, but he knew Amelia would be there when we found the body, dammit! And that entire scene with the strange word in blood? What was he thinking?‚Äù

I was 20 when I first read the letter.

&gt;No one knows what it‚Äôs like to hold the future of the Earth in your hands. I never told anyone, not even my wife, but I worked in the making of one of the biggest carnages of our story: the atomic bomb.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was so young. I was somewhat an intern, running unimportant errands for the important men. They told me I had future. They told me I wasn‚Äôt going to make it if I was weak. Because there would be no future for anybody.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the time, I was shown dreams. Of how the Germans would destroy everything if we didn‚Äôt stop them. Japan was a strategic place for them, and ravaging the distant country would greatly impact the Nazis.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the only way, they told me.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I stayed. I almost wished the one to be sacrificed was me, but I knew it would amount to nothing. I feared more than anything a purposeless death.  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, look at me now.  
&gt;  
&gt;In my dreams, the beautiful, hard-working people from Japan told me I had nothing to worry. That they knew. That they were ready to be sacrificed. But I guess that, even if that was true, their mothers and fathers and children and brothers were not.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way Hitler is right and Albert Einstein is wrong‚Äù, my boss told me. I respected him greatly. He was an important man on The Manhattan Project.  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked myself every day and still do: was that really necessary?  
&gt;  
&gt;The first time I saw a picture of a distorted body ‚Äì something I was part of ‚Äì I went home and cried for three days straight.  
&gt;  
&gt;I had terrible nightmares in the last 45 years. The families, they accuse me. They haunt me. I wonder if that‚Äôs the same for everyone else involved.  
&gt;  
&gt;Did we save the world or did we doom it? Or did we just unnecessarily hurt a lot of innocent people?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yesterday, I went to the supermarket. I was walking carefree, as carefree as a man with thousands of murders on his shoulders can be. Then I noticed I was the only western person in the aisle. Everyone else was Japanese.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have been called a xenophobe for the last years because I can‚Äôt stand the sight of eastern people; I know in my heart that I‚Äôm not, and it happens because seeing them makes me break down crying like a boy, and relive my nightmares of guilty; I‚Äôd rather hide the truth, but now that I am telling it, one can imagine my terror when I found myself in this situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre scared of them. Move naturally. Find the exit. Leave your cart‚Äù, I told myself, in a futile attempt to avoid desperation.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of them turned to face me. It was a girl, no older than 13, and it gave me a started me terribly. As she opened her mouth, tears started flowing from my eyes.  
&gt;  
&gt;She whispered the word *Koroshiya*.  
&gt;  
&gt;One by one, they all turned to my direction and chanted in a macabre tone.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Their eyes were unblinking, gaze fixed on me. They slowly approached me, reaching their hands in my direction. I tried to escape, but my legs were lead. I tried harder to escape, but all the aisles were full of them, and they blocked the exit. I cried and begged for forgiveness.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù a woman with a baby stroller said, very calmly. ‚ÄúJust let me melt your son to death and we‚Äôre even‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúGive me your grandkids‚Äù a woman probably older than 80 spoke, her raspy voice full of pain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give them back to you with incurable cancer to succumb in your arms‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI curse you, James Herald Stone. I curse you and your sons and the sons of your sons. You‚Äôre not even close to atoning for what you did to my people. Your bloodline will pay dearly for this.‚Äù a very young man spitted the words, drawing closer.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;They closed in on me, always chanting in unison, reaching for my exposed skin. As their fingertips touched me, I felt a terrible burn and pain like a million needles. It was like having my body covered in acid, then pierced over and over.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a dreadful scream, I passed out.  
&gt;  
&gt;I woke up to a paramedic leaning over me.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúSir? Do you feel better?‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶?‚Äù was the only thing I could articulate.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúYou passed out in the supermarket. People said you had a panic attack‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;Am I delirious? Did I see things that are not there?  
&gt;  
&gt;I easily accepted that. After all I‚Äôve been through, it‚Äôs obvious that I would have PTSD. I wanted to have my wife by my side, to tell her about everything and cry in her lap, like the desperate, tiny thing that I am now. But she‚Äôs long gone; it‚Äôs been over a decade that life took her from me, and I would never bother my boys and girls ‚Äî all adults and with their own boys and girls now ‚Äî about it.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was funny how I thought that I would rather die than tell my sons the horrors I caused and dreamed of all my life. Because I will.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ambulance took me home, convinced it was nothing serious. I went to bed, had my share of horrific nightmares for the night, and got up. My son James Junior and his family are currently living with me and I appreciate it. It gets lonely during daytime, but I love having a full table for dinner and a child‚Äôs laughter filling the air.  
&gt;  
&gt;Junior and his family had already left the house as usual. Today the weather was great, so I decided to take a small walk across the neighborhood. I have to be in shape to play with Amelia and my other grandkids, I thought.  
&gt;  
&gt;And as I got out, there it was. The word. In red graffiti, right there in my wall. *Koroshiya*.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know it means murderer. And I know that‚Äôs what I am. I apologize to anyone that may care about me. I just want to be reunited with my old lady, and cry in her lap, like the desperate, tiny thing that I am.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Äî James H. Stone‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how I felt about my grandfather, because I barely remember what life with him was like. What I remember is seeing his horrible recently dead body, and my mother‚Äôs words. What I remember is my father choosing to be worthless for the rest of his life, and barely acknowledging my existence. Him crying in front of our house after the divorce, pleading for my mother to take him back, countless nights.

I slid a copy of my grandfather‚Äôs suicide letter under the door of my father‚Äôs crappy apartment, where he spends the whole day feeling sorry for himself for almost 30 years, only able to survive thanks to a modest share of his father‚Äôs money and, I assume, the generosity of his siblings.

Using spray paint, I wrote the word *Koroshiya* on his door. Let‚Äôs see where this goes.

As I said, finding my grandfather‚Äôs corpse at only 6 irreparably messed me in the head."

I'm sure there are often posts on here about this topic considering the area, and I apologize if this is a repeat question but I wasn't able to find any answer for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm looking into accepting an offer at company in Mountain View for a summer internship, and I was wondering what the housing situation is like. Is it as difficult to find a suitable living place for a good price as I've heard, since I keep hearing several horror stories about people sharing a bedroom with four people for exorbitant prices, or are those edge cases?

And if it isn't as bad, or even if it is, when and where should I begin looking for a place. I'm actually perfectly okay looking for a place outside of mountain view and renting a car for those months if it means not having a cramped living space, but I'm from the east coast so I have no idea what to expect and where to begin, so I'd love some help!

So I'm sorry if my problems sound trivial or stupid or dumb, but to me they make me feel like my world is crumbling. I grew up with a lot of (I realize now) emotional abuse, with lots of criticism, insults, and putting down. I'm in college now, and having zero self-confidence and self-esteem is becoming an increasing burden. I find myself looking now for any type of reassurance from friends, mentors, acquaintances, and sometimes even strangers to make myself feel better about myself, to make myself feel not like a failure. 

One such person I've come to emotionally depend on a dangerous amount is an older mentor who is also a student at my school. He's not my boyfriend (really, not), but a very close mentor and advisor who's been kind to me and supportive of me, which I didn't think was possible of anyone to do for me. When I'm around him, I feel good, like I'm successful and have a bright future ahead of me. I realize I will go to great lengths to protect his impression of me. I won't do anything bad in front of him. Because him having a good impression of me just begins to fill that void of confidence that paralyzes me.

Anyway, for the past few months, after unbearable pressure from my parents, I've been looking for internships. I managed to get a couple offers on my own from small companies, but I was too afraid to take them, not wanting to work while school was in session, worried my grades would suffer. Ultimately, I got offered a summer internship position at the same company where one of my parents works. It's a semi-big company, and I KNOW I only got offered the position (having no prior work experience whatsoever) because my parent works there. I took the offer, and I even stupidly, happily, gleefully told my mentor that I found a position at this company for the summer, failing to mention that my parent works for this company and that this was basically the only reason they wanted me. I wanted to feel as if I had succeeded, but really I just failed to find an appropriate position on my own. After I told him, I immediately felt the guilt build. I feel like I'm living a lie, making him think that I'm something special and found a prestigious internship on my own when it's just not true. 

Should I tell him the truth that I had to have my parent's help in finding this position? Is it too late or weird or awkward to do that? It might not sound like a big deal, but at this point I've been torturing myself with thoughts that I don't know what to think anymore...I'm sorry if this all sounds stupid, but any advice is much appreciated"
ari2u1,0,2019-02-17,Is it worth it to Live in Seattle and commute to Bellevue?,cirque_i,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/ari2u1/is_it_worth_it_to_live_in_seattle_and_commute_to/,"Hi!

I recently secured a summer internship in the Seattle area where I would be working out of Downtown Bellevue, and I just started to look for places to live. I just started looking around and researching Seattle/Bellevue, and think I might want to try and live in Seattle and commute to Bellevue.

I think I'd do this just because I'm a big city kind of person and it seems like it could be harder to go and do things after work and to explore the city and take part in nightlife if I lived in Bellevue. I previously had an internship in New York where I became used to amenities such as 24/7 transit and am afraid staying connected with the city will become a lot harder living in Bellevue.

On the flip side, I'm also afraid that it could be a lot more expensive finding a place in Seattle and that the options for commuting to Bellevue might not be very good - ie. long travel times on bus due to traffic, overcrowding, low bus frequency, etc.

So I'm just wondering how feasible it is to commute from Seattle to Bellevue on a daily basis and how much time that could take out of my day, as well as if the difference would be worth it to live in Seattle or if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is.

arisu6,1,2019-02-17,Rainbow Precure,Cheemingwan1234,precure,https://www.reddit.com/r/precure/comments/arisu6/rainbow_precure/,"Rainbow PreCure.

The idea came after wondering what would a counter-terrorism themed PreCure series would be and some looking at the Operators from Rainbow Six:Siege.

Rainbow would be an international and interdimensional organization that employs both normal Operators from different special forces groups and PreCures trained in counter-terrorist tactics .They are just recovering from an terrorist attack by the White Mask that caused the Legendary Operators (most of the 20 Operators of the base game) to be sealed in Operator Cards and the head of Rainbow,Lady Six's power to be shattered in the cards as well as killing off most of its active duty PreCures forcing the fairies working for Rainbow to seek people to become the new legendary counter-terrorist operators;Pretty Cure. It is the duty of the PreCures now to find the Operator Cards and unseal the Operators trapped inside them in addition to their counter terrorism duties which means being used as a force-multiplier for what remains of Rainbow in their fight against terrorist organizations.

Unlike the more 'mainstream' PreCure teams,the PreCures from Rainbow ditch the dresses in favor of jackets,jeans/tactical trousers,boots/sneakers,bulletproof vests and helmets with some frills on the armor pieces. This means that a PreCure working for Rainbow would look a lot like a counter-terrorist operator instead of a magical girl for example. The PreCures also carry guns which are mostly used against regular terrorists and the mooks, switching to hand to hand combat for the monsters of the week.The Rainbow PreCures have gadgets in addition to their powers and use them to support their teammates and other PreCure teams.

The transformation device of the PreCures is their Raid Communes which is based off a tactical radio.They need their mascot and their respective Cure Card to transform (with the words ‚ÄúGear Up,PreCure!‚Äù) and also has the normal function of a tactical radio. The Raid Commune also have the ability to scan an Operator Card to give a Cure a gadget based off the Operator after the Operator has been unsealed by their mascots. For example, scanning Sledge‚Äôs Operator Card after he has been unsealed by a PreCure grants the PreCure his breaching hammer, the Caber to execute the Caber Groundquake.

The PreCure‚Äôs identities are public. While Monika‚Äôs and Elias‚Äôs parents kind of approve of their jobs as PreCures (Elias‚Äôs dad is okay with his son‚Äôs job as a PreCure in particular as he finds that his son‚Äôs duty as a PreCure is a good way to contribute to society.) but they often get concerned about their children‚Äôs safety when they get hurt in the line of duty . Yumiko‚Äôs parents, however disapprove of their daughter‚Äôs PreCure duties.

The main trio of PreCures: (Cure IQ, Cure Hibana and Cure Blitz.)

Monika Weiss/Cure IQ.

A shy,young academic overachiever of a student who is socially awkward amongst people she does not trust .She was recruited into becoming a PreCure after saving the fairies from the White Mask together with her friends Yumiko and Elias .She transforms into Cure IQ who has the power of electricity and specializes in detecting electronics with the RED-MK-III Spectre,a wrist mounted device which she built herself for her project in school.

Yumiko Imagawa/Cure Hibana.

A passionate,tomboyish and adaptive team-builder who is the daughter of a butcher and a Kyudo master.She became a PreCure together with Monika and Elias after saving the fairies from the White Mask.She transforms into Cure Hibana who has the power of fire and specializes in breaching walls with her X-Kairos Exothermic Breaching Launcher.

Elias Kotz/Cure Blitz.

A jovial student with a talent in athletics and academics. He often cracks jokes to lighten up a gloomy situation and is mentally resilient. He became a PreCure after rescuing the fairies from the White Mask together with Monika and Yumiko.He transforms into Cure Blitz who has the power of light and provides a support role with his G52 Tactical Shield, a riot shield equipped with 3 rows of flashbang grenades.

(Yes, Cure Blitz is basically Shiny Luminous from Max Heart if she had a riot shield equipped with flashbangs and armed with a pistol.)

Additional PreCures: (Cure Tempest and Cure Pulse.)

Zofia Bosak/Cure Tempest.

A former PreCure working for Rainbow that had since settled down to family life with a two-year-old daughter who was recalled back to duty to train the younger PreCures.She possesses a determined nature and would not give up. She transforms into Cure Tempest who wields the power of the skies and is armed with the KS-79 Lifeline, a grenade launcher that can use grenades that detonate on impact or concussion grenades that stun and disorient foes.

(Zofia‚Äôs daughter is called Sofia, but the other PreCures call her daughter ‚ÄúZotan‚Äù or ‚ÄúChibiZofia‚Äù just to mess with her.)

(Because the KiraKira PreCures have enhanced hearing as part of their powerset which is based of sweets and animals, when working with Cure Blitz or Cure Tempest they tend to wear ear protectors to protect their ears as flashbangs and concussion weaponry affect them more than a normal human and they take longer to recover from the effects.)

Jack Estrada/Cure Pulse.

A stoic biometrics student on internship with the FBI with a knack for detecting even the most microscopic of emotional variations who was noticed by Rainbow and partnered with a fairy to become a PreCure. He is a natural negotiator and transforms into Cure Pulse who has the power of hearts (which manifest in the form of hard light constructs) and uses the HB-1 Heartbeat Sensor,a small handheld sensor that is capable of detecting enemies through walls via their heartbeats. He has some issues with his powers giving out at critical moments as his stoic personality clashes with his powerset at first.

Finishers:

PreCure Final Assault:The standard rainbow beam finisher common in the Pretty Cure Series.

PreCure Tachanka Final Salvo:The second finisher gained after Tachanka sacrificed his life to protect the PreCures and his powers formed a new Operator Card upon his death.Upon scanning the Operator Card,it grants the PreCures the compoments of his DP-28 LMG turret which they assemble and fire at the target.What is fired from the DP-28 depends on the Cure manning the turret,for example Cure Tempest would have a mixture of explosive and concussive ammo.

Mascots.

Amp:

Monika‚Äôs partner. He is more outgoing than his partner who is quite shy and shares his partner‚Äôs talent with electronics.

Ryuu:

Yumiko‚Äôs partner. She is very ladylike and hence she and her partner tend to bicker a lot. Ryuu also has some demolitions training and helps Cure Hibana locate structural weak points to make the best use of her breaching launcher.

Hikari:

Elias‚Äô partner. He is very disciplined in contrast to his partner who tends to be jovial at times.He is an expert in riot control and helps to train the other PreCures.

Kotwica:

Zofia‚Äôs partner. She has gone into a slumber as she thought that her powers were not needed with Zofia leaving her duties as a PreCure to raise a family. When Zofia resumed her duties as a PreCure,she reawakens from her slumber to aid her partner. She has a motherly attitude towards the other fairies and the PreCures.

Holter:

Jack‚Äôs partner. He is a new recruit to Rainbow and has an easily startled and impulsive personality. He also has his partner‚Äôs knack for detecting microscopic emotional variations which he tends to use to hide behind his partner whenever he detects signs of hostility.

White Mask:The villains.They are a terrorist organization that feeds off terror and fear and have converted many worlds into ones of terror before being stopped by the PreCures and Rainbow and sealed away in the past.In recent times,the seal has been broken and they have continued their path of terror,with only the PreCures and what remains of Rainbow after the attack to stop them.They are ones to use regular humans as their regular foot soldiers who share the same mindset as them who wear the white masks that is their namesake.

Osamas:The monsters of the week.They are summoned by a commander of the White Mask to go after a victim experiencing high levels of fear to possess an object related to the fear to turn it into a monster.They are capable of speech and often taunt their enemies .If left alone for too long,the victim becomes imprisoned in their own fears forever in a catatonic state .

Transformation and Pre-battle speech for the PreCures:

All: ‚ÄúGear Up! PreCure!‚Äù

arjcys,1,2019-02-17,M4A (A playing F) The Ultimate multiple prompt list. Edging all day gets a guy flustered so.. Hopefully something for everyone! (Fairly long) (open/multiple prompts) (light or dark) (chat or rp) (Short or long term),Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/arjcys/m4a_a_playing_f_the_ultimate_multiple_prompt_list/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

*(In no particular order, and feel free to mix and match!)*

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Living with HyperSpermia:** This is a prompt that is a little more far fetched. The premise is that I have a 'condition' called HyperSpermia that causes my balls to produce semen at a faster rate than most people which means I have to empty them a lot more often. Side effects include no refractory period and very large loads.

We can have a concerned sibling, doctor or friend that finds out about my condition and 'helps' me. But there's a lot that could happen so go nuts.

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Futa Fun:** (I play Futa you play Female) Pretty self explanatory, wanna fuck a chick with a dick? Wanna see a pair of bouncing tits while your holes get filled with warm cum?

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**Pornstar encounters:** Similar to the celebrity prompt above, this one includes famous pornstars instead. If you interested I can tell you a few of my favorites over PM (Or you can send yours) I don't tend to enjoy asian, black or indian though, just to clarify.

This prompt can be explored in a cheesy porno styled scenario or maybe i'm a fan that 'wins' a day with you or maybe just a fan that comes across you in everyday life.

**The threesome with the two sisters:** (Major bonus points for this one) It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

**Others:** Free use, throat fucking, breeding, public stuff, rape, cumplay, raceplay. Literally anything. Message me with your ideas!

That is the end of my prompt list. Those that have read this far, thankyou! Please send me your ideas aswell, if you have something specific to play out and it doesn't conflict with my limits, I may be up for playing with it! If you want to chat aswell, that's fine with me. Mixing up multiple prompts is also very welcome :)

(Reference pics are welcome but not necessary and BONUS points if you let me choose your character)

Kink lists can be traded over PM!

limits: toilet play, blood, extreme violence, death, beasts, ass to mouth, regression, transformation/weight gain, Daddy play/Mommy play.

I hope to catch your eye and your dirty orange envelopes.."

Yesterday someone I know, said that they knew a company that was looking for an Intern but I needed to start on Monday. I was excited about but when I got there, I realized that this wasn't really an Internship but more like a full-time job and the role I would take seems advanced and of high responsibility, I would have to travel so it won't be a good option for me because college is also starting this Monday and there are other factors.

I've explained my situation to the company's director but he said that he still wants to take a shot and told me go there, start working and see how things go. 

I've been analysing this situation during this weekend and I'm now completely sure that it won't work out. I should start tomorrow but I want to quit. What's the best way to do that?"

It's been 4 months, but I'm still not over him. Some alarming things I've noticed since we broke up:

1. I graduated from uni last month, but I'm still working the same crappy dead-end job I was working before he dumped me. All of my friends have moved away for their new jobs &amp; internships. My uni roommate moved out last week for the same reason. I want to move back home because I miss my family so much, but my hometown is a rural area with no career advancement opportunities. I feel stuck.
2. I spend most of my free time lately silently lurking on my ex-boyfriend's various social media accounts. I almost wish he'd block me, just so I'd stop obsessing over him online.
3. I know we're never getting back together, but in my inner fantasy world we never broke up. I constantly daydream about us together, when we were happy. I know it's melodramatic &amp; incredibly stupid, but I feel like no other guy could ever measure up to him. It might have something to do with the fact that he was the first (and so far, only) person I've ever dated. I don't know.
4. I don't know how to be on my own. We dated for 7 years (lived together for 2 of those 7 years). When we were together, his opinion was everything to me. I'd only feel proud of myself for achieving something (a good grade, a promotion, whatever) if I felt like *he* was proud of me. Sometimes I'd take a class or volunteer for something or wear a specific outfit because I felt like *he'd* approve. I was happy with myself if *he* was happy with *me*. I just. I don't know how to feel about myself, now that we've broken up.

arkl84,4,2019-02-17,AITA for refusing to listen to my mothers opinion on my medication?,7Doppelgaengers,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/arkl84/aita_for_refusing_to_listen_to_my_mothers_opinion/,"I just wanted to know a more objective opinion, because I fell like everyone who knows any party in this situation is going to be biased. The story isn‚Äôt exactly very interesting or life changing, but I have been feeling wronged and like an ass simultaneously, and don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I apologize?

So basically, it all started as a normal conversation at the dinner table, there haven‚Äôt been any arguments recently or anything, and everyone seemed to be in a good mood. My parents were asking about my plans for the summer, so I said that I was going to try to get an internship at a psychiatric hospital for the two moths I will have off from uni (it is something that many med students do where I am from, not necessarily a psychiatric hospital, but in a hospital in general, because that helps with getting a job later), and didn‚Äôt want to add any other plans in advance in case I get it, so that there wouldn‚Äôt be any complications later.
My mother instantly seemed to be annoyed by what I said, and simply replied with:

M: ‚ÄúIf you want to work in a psychiatric hospital you should get of your medication first‚Äù

I felt that this was really out of nowhere, because my medication is not exactly for a behavioural problem, or for a mood disorder, or anything. And even if it was, what does it have to do with anything? When dad saw where the mood was shifting, he instantly excused himself out of there (honestly, I wish I had done the same thing), and so there I was, left alone with my mum. I told her, that the medication I was on was prescribed by a professional, and that it really improves my general wellbeing (it is a SNRI, because I have insomnia, and it really helps me sleep).
She says, that I am too young to be on that kind of medication and therefore am not mentally stable enough for that kind of job. I got a bit irritated, not going to lie. She constantly tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt act like a know it all because I don‚Äôt have a degree yet, but sometimes the things she says are really ridiculous and she still won‚Äôt just accept that sometimes she‚Äôs wrong.

So, this is the part that I regret. I was tired of listening to that, so I interrupted her and said, that if she has no medical training at all, let alone a degree in any medical field, she shouldn‚Äôt think that she knows better than professionals and that she shouldn‚Äôt just throw her uninformed opinion around. She got angry about this, and said that she was just looking out for me, and that I supposedly never listen to her. I got up and tried left the room, because I didn‚Äôt see the conversation being beneficial in any way, because we were just both getting mad, and haven‚Äôt really addressed this to her since.

I feel like I was wrong by telling her not to say what she thinks, because that‚Äôs just her opinion, and when I think back, she should be allowed to express it. But I also feel like it was wrong of her to call me out on a thing I have no control over.

AITA for not wanting to hear her out, because I thought, that her opinion was uninformed?

Everyone keeps saying, it gets better, but it hasn't. Every little bit of hope I try to grab on to ends up being destroyed and I just feel worse than before.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner of 8 years left me on new years day 2017. After a year of working hard to try and save the relationship and him being checked out. I moved to another country for him, and I didn't have a stable job or anything in my home country to go back to. I was in a ""trainee program"" through the unemployment office, and the business I was with kept extending my unpaid traineeship until they finally let me go after six months when I pushed for actually being hired.

  
I was able to get some part time work, and moved into spare rooms, but I had horrible luck with landlords -- the first was an alcoholic I almost called the police on more than once, the second would go through my room and send threatening texts that they wanted me to break the lease early.

&amp;#x200B;

As that was going on, my mom, the only family I was close to, had a grand mal seizure back home and I was constantly calling to check on her, and she was constantly calling me to tell me how much she hated her life and wanted to kill herself. I went home for three weeks, to avoid the landlord over christmas and check on her, during the busiest time of the year where I could have been working more than full time and actually making money to save. It was clear to me she had significant cognitive deficits and she wasn't my mom anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back, went to school in another city for the third time to retrain because I desperately needed housing  in January 2019, and... it wasn't what I expected. I had so much trouble making friends. I felt like I was in high school again. The education itself is good, but I've been so lonely. Developed a crush on someone for the first time in years, was told to back off and did, but that caused so much stupid drama with a 22 year old that I can't believe I was a part of. That crush was the first time I was happy in 2 years, and I couldn't even have that. I thought I made a friend, and we were friends for a few months, but she pulled away by ghosting me for weeks because I have ""too much going on"" in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom continued to deteriorate, calling me at all hours to complain about how horrible her life was and how much she wanted to end it all, and it became clear that she'd developed dementia. She's 62. There's been constant issues since then, the rest of the family not wanting to deal with it or wanting me to move home and take care of it. Finally, she's being moved into a home, but it's in Texas where I know no one except an uncle who isn't particularly fond of me. I lost any sense of home I've ever had,

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to make friends, tried to reach out to people, and gotten nothing in return. I have to constantly try and pretend I'm okay, and even then, I'm still ""too sad"" and have for people to actually want to be my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

All the while, I was trying to get help from the local mental health clinic... and they fucked everything up. Lost my file, tried to blame everything on my aspergers diagnosis, when I just kept begging to get a therapist. Claimed that I already had had ""too much therapy"" for an unrelated issue (PTSD), when I kept telling them I'm in crisis now and the situation's changed now. After a YEAR I finally got to see a counsellor, but she's only available every 3 weeks. That might have been fine when I first asked for help, but now I don't think it's enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm close to the end of this education, and the last few days I've had a few small setbacks that feel like the straw that's broken the camel's back. I'm tired of being told I need to feel compassion for people who have hurt me, when it's evident that people don't have compassion for me. A guy I met at an art festival over the summer was supposed to come visit and we've been texting for months, but he backed out and broke things off because he chickened out.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly it has been the only thing I've been looking forward to for months.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm broke, barely getting by on student loans, I don't have the mental energy to work on the portfolio I need to get an internship to finish my education, I have no one to talk to, and I desperately, desperately need a mom to hold me and tell me it's gonna be okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I take my meds, I go to school, I eat. I just want to stop existing, because everything I do is only for other people's sakes. I don't know how to be happy anymore. I don't rememeber what it feels like to be safe anymore. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.  "

I am 21 years old, currently in a 5 year accounting program and I‚Äôm 3/5 done this semester. I have an internship where I make about $300 a week. My parents and I made a deal where I pay half and they pay half if I keep my grades high, so tuition for me is about $6,000 a year. I also have a car payment of only $110 a month. My other costs like insurance, phone and food is mostly covered by my parents, which I am grateful for. I also have one credit card which I use for just about every purchase because I get a percentage back, I pay the full amount off every month. I have about $300 in investments like bitcoin and on robinhood. 

So here is what I want to do.

I have been looking into moving out to gain some new freedoms and be a bit less reliant on them. There‚Äôs some decent places in my cities area, rather cheap too.  The one I was looking at was $100,000 with a $20,000 down payment and $670 a month mortgage. I have about a fourth of the down payment. 

What can I do to move out sooner rather than get another part time and wait? 

I do NOT want to get an apartment, I don‚Äôt want to rent and have nothing at the end of it.

Any advice of moving out as a young person whatsoever helps a lot.

I noticed I would suffer from PIED which was a horrible feeling for me. I was used to have sex since I am 14. I was in a long term relationship during 5 years with sex on a daily basis. But after the break up it was as if my world would fall apart. I went to study engineering abroad in a new city. The whole first year I had no contact with girls and I accused my engineering life for this. I met mostly guys in university and spent my whole time with the boys and nearly never met new girls. I spent many hours at home grieving for my loss watching netflix and anime which helped me soothing my pain. Moreover I watched porn 1-2 a day and masturbated as a normal ritual or to sleep better and to stop thinking about my ex. It numbed my feelings.

After 2 years I finally met a cute girl with whom I spent a lot of time. after one month we wanted to engage in sex and I was really attracted to her but I couldn't get the 'junior' up for battle. It was a pretty shocking revelation for me as it normally just worked on its on.

Many self-doubt have come to my mind. I was 21 and waaaay to early to not get an erection. I wasn't doing so much sports back there maybe once or twice a week. But could this really be the reason for not getting an errection?

&amp;#x200B;

This was the main reason why I started my journey with you guys. In other aspects in life I would say that I am doing fine. Ended my Bachelor degree in Chemical engineering and I am doing an internship at the dream company in a dream city at the moment. But the loss of libido killed me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now over 45 days and after 20 days I already had my first time sex which actually worked.  It was a tinder date. i always struggled the most to put on the condom and loose my half erection while wearing the condom. But this night everything went well. Already after the first 20 days I felt much more confident and calm during the act. It wasn't perfect but it still worked out.

&amp;#x200B;

The part which makes my journey so much easier than I thought is because I moved to a new city and meet a lot of new people and I have this regular working life. I started nofap as soon as I moved to munich and working 8 hours a day gives me this routine where I come home and I feel a little tired and I don't have the urge to fap. My goal is it to get to 90 days. I started meditating on a regular basis to get to know myself better. I am addicted to my phone and also to tinder as substitute to porn. It's hard to get through this but guys I have to say:

A HUGE THANK YOU to all of you. My morning ritual has become to read 2-3 sucess stories of nofap every day. It helps me focusing on my goal of completely getting rid of porn in my life. I read podcasts of the porn reboot on spotify everyday which helps me focusing my mind. I intend to go to the gym and find a better me after one year.

&amp;#x200B;

I always keep in mind this journey of becoming a better version of myself and I already have done some progress:

Yesterday I went to the metro and saw a cute girl standing on the street waiting and I looked at her, our eyes met. I simply smiled and she smiled back. This was such an amazing feeling and something I never experienced in the last years. I become much more acquainted with myself and I evolve much faster than without nofap.

&amp;#x200B;

But brothers keep in mind. Nofap doesn't give you superpowers. It helps you develop yourself and replace a bad habit with good habits and thus the so called superpower rises. But these are just traits you already possessed. Become the better you and help me becoming the better me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love you guys and thank you for letting me share my story which helps me process this whole change"
arni0y,59,2019-02-17,Entitled Troop Mom wants kids to get hypothermia,MatildaMathis,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/arni0y/entitled_troop_mom_wants_kids_to_get_hypothermia/,"Alright, I've never actually posted anything other than comments here and there on this site so I hope this turns out all right. 

This happened when I was about 16, I was in a CIT (Counselor in Training) program for a Girl Scout Camp here in Utah. It was essentially like an internship. We were still treated as counselors just with more supervision and we weren't being paid. 

Overall the summer went great, I had a blast but there were 2 weeks we all dreaded. Troop Camping. After 4 years of going back to this camp I can safely say there are 2 types of troop moms. The ones I love and can't wait to see, and monster moms. I have a lot of entitled mom stories but this one stood out most to me. 

This particular entitled mom came with a troop of ""brownies."" That's in quotes because Brownies are *supposed* to be around first grade. They are the youngest this camp allows, but the girls this mom brought were Daisies. Kindergartners. If that. For some of these girls it was the first time they had changed into swimsuits without help. 

But they did it, and her troop went down to the lake for the Polar Bear dip. Mind you the lake at 7am is COLD. For girls who want to do it, we walk them across the dock and they jump in the shallow end and swim/walk to shore. It's policy to *immediately* wrap them in a towel and send them up to the main lodge to change into dry clothes and get hot chocolate. 

I'm with a few other CIT's in the Lodge waiting for girls to come get hot chocolate, and they do, but they're still in their swimsuits. Soaking and shivering. **Not okay.** I ask one of the girls why she hasn't changed. 

Smol child: Troop Mom told us not to change. 

Me: That's ridiculous! You'll get sick!

But sure enough, more girls keep coming up. Just cold to the bone and me and the other CIT's are getting concerned. A couple of the girls lips are turning blue, and they are shivering so hard that several of us were taking off our own hoodies to put on girls. 

Just as I'm about to go get the Camp Director the Troop Mom herself comes up. And the conversation essentially went like this. 

Me: Um, excuse me, but why did you tell them not to change? 

TM: Oh, we have waterfront right after breakfast and it's not worth the hassle to get them changed only for them to change right back. They take so long it'd eat up all their waterfront time! 

Oh my god. I had never wanted to slap a woman so much in my life. I know how long this age group takes, I'd worked with them for months. But that wasn't a decent excuse FOR PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AT RISK! More so, you don't HAVE to wear swimsuits at waterfront! If you want to go in the canoe in normal clothes, THAT'S OKAY! So long as you have a life vest and water shoes on, the lifeguards don't mind. The only girls who would have to change back into their wet swimsuits would be the ones who wanted to go back into the water. 

Me: Well, they need to go back and change. I'm sending them back down to the bathrooms. They're going to get hypothermia if you make them sit in these suits for another hour and a half. 

Apparently this was the *wrong* thing to say, because she BLEW up on me. 

TM: HOW DARE YOU TELL ME HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MY GIRLS! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM ALL THE TIME AND WAIT FOR THEM TO TAKE FOREVER GOING EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, YOU'RE JUST A CHILD YOU CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO

Tbh, I wish I could say I did something bad ass like yell at her for endangering her girls, or slap her, but 16 year old me just cried. Luckily, while the mom was yelling at me, another CIT had gone and grabbed the Camp Director. Who physically put herself between me and the mom and explained that if she didn't allow her girls to change that they would all be asked to go home. 

Ultimately the girls were changed and had a great time at the rest of the activities, but that mom death glared me the rest of the two days they were there. "

I have 5 classes under my belt so far and I'm looking to transfer into a UC or Cal State in fall of 2019.
Im am currently looking for an entry level job or internship around my area to get any form of experience in the field. I haven't had any luck in finding a place that will take someone with my level of experience in.

My question for you guys is, what is the best way to achieve my career goals. I would like to have my own bookkeeping business as well as eventually working for companies in the video game industry (I hope this part doesn't violate the rules of posting.)

What are the best steps to take to move towards that direction. My current plan is to get my bachelor's and work towards my CPA.

But my biggest struggles are my lack of knowledge (I look online and I get different answers, and the people I've asked in person either don't or won't help.) And lack of experience. If i can get any type of help I would really appreciate it. I know its busy season right now and I hope I don't take too much time from your busy schedules, but I would appreciate all the help I can get."

I'm looking for a scene that's fast, fun, sexy, dirty, kinky, and overall enjoyable! If you're in the mood to get down and dirty with a cute femboy, then you've come to the right prompt, my friend. We can roleplay or chat, I don't mind, but it's gotta be sexy. Here are a couple scenario ideas to think about (though you can submit your own if you want, I have no problem with that!)

I knew it was so wrong. Meeting a stranger in the park for sex? What kind of a freak was I? But if those pictures were real...then maybe I was in for a lot of fun.

I looked up at you with pure love in my eyes, a long white wedding gown around my thin, slim and boyish body. We were married, and now was the chance to consummate it...

I groaned, holding the sheets as you plowed into me from behind. How was I supposed to know that my new girlfriend had a super hot mom/sister who was into pegging boys like me?

We had been holding hands all day. We visited foreign places and tourist sights, on a fun vacation from our regular lives. But when in private, even traveling can't stop us from exploring each other.

I bit my lip, watching the older, heavier man put on the slick, new condom. He turned to me, and grinned, so I lied down on my back. He was my step dad, but he was about to become my daddy.

My wife had been talking about spicing things up in the bedroom, but as soon as the doorbell rang and I saw the immensely handsome stranger who was going to fuck me and only me in front of my wife, I knew she made the right decision.

You held my brightly-colored wig by the top, letting my mouth bob in and out of your crotch. I had only planned on visiting this comic-convention for another day, but maybe even in this costume I could stay a little longer...

The job posting just said ""intern,"" didn't it? I had no idea I'd actually be posing as a secretary. But if I'm the special secretary for the boss...then why does he already have one?

I don't know why, but my brother's cute friends keep coming over our house when he isn't home. Usually they just hang out with me, but maybe there are other reasons they stick around...

I'm an Icubus in training, a sex demon who's supposed to take the life energy from horny women. But on my first assignment, I get the wrong house, and find a thick-cocked guy instead...

Damn, dude, that's a rough situation. She bailed on you last second? Ouch. W-Wait, what are you suggesting? Are you stupid? I can't go to prom as your date...and there's no way I'm pretending to be your girlfriend either! Okay, maybe...

We'd been childhood friends for so long, you didn't think anything wrong to just barge into my room to tell me about the newest game or show you saw. But what you did see was me, playing with myself in girly ways...

I joined the cheerleading squad to try to pick up girls. I never though I'd get picked up by the handsome captain of the team...

Have an idea? Feel free to send it! We'll play!"

arobu6,6,2019-02-17,Sunday Sci-Fi: I Created a Monster,BLT_WITH_RANCH,BLT_WITH_RANCH,https://www.reddit.com/r/BLT_WITH_RANCH/comments/arobu6/sunday_scifi_i_created_a_monster/,"Sweat ran down my brow like beads of fate as I held the tiny rat in hand. He squirmed and writhed in agony, little shrieks from pained, bloody teeth. His long tail wrapped around my index finger while he clutched tight to threads of life. Beady eyes bled crimson down white fur.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, little buddy. It‚Äôs ok,‚Äù I said, stroking his head gently.

Unblinking, I returned the rat to his plastic box. I couldn‚Äôt stand to see him like this; no living thing should ever have to experience such torment. Clutching the edge of the counter with white knuckles, I whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

The poor creature rasped once, then lay still.

‚ÄúNo. Not again!‚Äù I slammed my fist on the counter, again and again, until it was bruised and bloody. Papers jumped with each thump, falling onto the floor; the notes of all my failures rained down in piles around me.

The treatment was experimental. Revolutionary, really. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before‚Äîthe first use of nanites to successfully kill cancer cells. My creation, my magnum opus, all wasted on countless failures.

I reached into my pocket, grasping the edges of my wallet with shaking hands. The black leather faded to brown, sun bleached and well-worn. Sniffling, I removed her picture. Torn in places, tattered, the ink smudged and blurred with fingerprints, I could barely make out her smile. My legs lost their strength; I slumped down against the counter and the cold concrete.

I grasped the edges of the photograph, moving them to my wet lips. I could still remember the touch of her lips on mine. I promised to love her, through sickness and health, till death do us part. But the truth was that I loved her long after she left this world. I never stopped loving her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I'm trying‚Äîso hard‚Äîfor both of you,‚Äù I whispered.

I let the picture fall idly on my lap. Holding my head in my hands, I wept openly. In the corner of my wallet, peeking out from a different photograph, my daughter stared up with the same blue eyes of her mother. I couldn‚Äôt save her. I couldn‚Äôt save either of them.

A gentle knock on the laboratory door stirred me from my melancholy. Rachel still wore her hospital gown and badge from earlier. She looked a hot mess. ‚ÄúJacob, are you alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äîjust give me a minute,‚Äù I said.

I stood and stared at my girlfriend with bloodshot eyes. I didn‚Äôt try to hide the tears, and she didn‚Äôt speak of them. She didn‚Äôt need to. A lump caught in my throat. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù

She looked down with damp eyes. ‚ÄúYou tried your best. I‚Äôm headed home, I need to sleep for a bit. Come home with me? Please‚Äîyou need to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúRachel, you know I can‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, leaning back against the counter, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave Lucy alone.‚Äù

She nodded and lifted up a bright pink backpack. ‚ÄúI know. Just‚Äîtry and rest‚Äîok? I brought you a fresh change of clothes, and there‚Äôs some leftover casserole in here too.‚Äù

*Casserole.* There was a time when Lucy and I lived alone. She grew so distant from me, and I think in a way she blamed me for mother‚Äôs death. I know she hated Rachel at first, but it was Rachel‚Äôs casserole that got her smiling again. Casserole was the glue that kept our family together.

I pulled Rachel close. I wanted to tell her how thankful I was for her, or how much I loved her, or how much she meant to me and Lucy, but all I could say was simply, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

She gently took my hands in hers, studying the cuts with a frown. ‚ÄúLucy fell asleep before I left her. Try to be quiet?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said.

Rachel lifted up my bruised hands, kissed them once, and let them fall back to my side. She walked away; her heels echoed down the dim hallway. I took one look back at my workstation, thinking of all the tests I needed to run. I decided to leave it all for tomorrow. It wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

Instead, I rode the nearby elevator in solace, entering the cancer ward with a gentle ding. The whole floor smelled like sterile hopelessness. The night nurse eyed me wearily, and opened her mouth as if to speak, but closed it, thinking better.

Maybe she saw the weakness in my eyes, or maybe she saw the drops of blood from my battered hands. Whatever the reason, I entered Lucy‚Äôs room undisturbed, tiptoeing as best I could in my lab gown. Lucy woke regardless. She looked pale and fragile lying in the hospital bed, like a wilting flower cut from its roots. She cracked an eye open, her voice a frail warble. ‚ÄúDaddy, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, sweetie. I‚Äôm going to sleep here again, is that ok?‚Äù

She nodded, and turned aside, closing her eyes once more. I spread out on the pull-out couch. Wrapping myself in weak, cold hospital sheets, I prayed to every god I didn‚Äôt believe in. I begged them for a miracle.

It wasn‚Äôt long before the morning light filtered through the cracks in the blinds, and I woke to a gentle knock on the door. The nurse from before poked her head in. ‚ÄúJacob, can I see you outside for a moment?‚Äù

I held back a groan, slipped out of the sheets like a ghost, and walked the door. The nurse wasn‚Äôt alone; Dr. Malcolm stood by her, holding a clipboard behind his tired eyes. Chills ran down my spine before he even opened his mouth. He spoke four words: ‚ÄúI have bad news.‚Äù

My heart caught in my chest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs progressed, hasn‚Äôt it.‚Äù

Dr. Malcom nodded. He handed me the clipboard, and I saw the results of the last CT scan. I wish I hadn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI thought you said she had a few more weeks?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I really thought she had more time, but you know as well as anyone just how unpredictable this can be,‚Äù he paused, then looked at me with honest eyes, and I saw for a moment the stoic doctor break down. He became mortal again, filled with weakness. Wet regret started in his eyes. ‚ÄúJacob‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry. I truly am. I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs going to be ok,‚Äù I lied, then added, ‚Äúyou did everything you could,‚Äù and that was the truth. We tried every treatment, save for one, now swimming in the blood of a dead mouse ten floors down.

‚ÄúI need to get back to my lab,‚Äù I said, rubbing the gunk from my eyes.

‚ÄúCan I get you anything before you go?‚Äù the nurse asked.

I rubbed my forehead for a moment. ‚ÄúCoffee, actually. Black‚Äîno sugar. You *do* have coffee up here, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she beamed, and walked back to her workroom.

I grabbed a change of clothes and used Lucy‚Äôs shower to freshen up. The nurse came back to the room, and with new resolve, I grabbed the coffee, letting the dark aroma lead me to a more conscious, thoughtful state of mind. I had a two-minute commute down the elevator, and in no time at all I was back in my laboratory.

Something was wrong.

The papers I had strewn across the floor were neatly stacked on the table. The floor was mopped clean, and the rat was nowhere to be found. Instead, on the desk, was a single white rose, and slinking in the corner was a young intern, tan skin, clean shaven, young at spirit. I recognized him from Rachel‚Äôs department.

He grinned sheepishly. ‚ÄúDr. Parker sent me to clean up your lab, so I organized your notes for you, and cleaned up the mess and sorted some files, and just cleaned the place a bit. She figured you could use it.‚Äù

*Rachel.* She did this, bless her heart. ‚ÄúThank you, Dr‚Ä¶.?‚Äù

‚ÄúAshish Racchawar, sir. I‚Äôm not a doctor yet, still in school,‚Äù he said, grinning up from ambitious brown eyes.

I nodded. ‚ÄúSure, sure. What did you do with the lab rat? It was laying in the plastic tub.‚Äù

He stuttered for a moment, then looked confused. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a rat. The tub was empty.‚Äù

Chills ran down my spine. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tub is over there,‚Äù he said, nodding towards the bin on the counter. ‚ÄúIt was clean, so I put it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt clean. It was covered in blood, and there was a dead rat in it!‚Äù I said, exasperated.

We stared at eachother for a long second. I took a sip of coffee to clear my thoughts. When I looked back, he had the same confused look, and I just couldn‚Äôt believe my shit luck. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me you didn‚Äôt see the rat, or the drops of blood?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt a drop of blood here‚ÄîSir. I am not certified to clean bodily fluid spills, so if I saw anything, I would surely report it‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, stay here a minute,‚Äù I said, walking to my desk. It had been a long time since I accessed the lab security cameras, so it took me a second to find the right application on my old computer. When I did, I scanned the footage, and couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.

One hour after I had left the lab, the rat twitched.

‚ÄúSir, was the rat alive?‚Äù Ashish asked. His voice dripped with concern.

I took another sip of coffee. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

On the security feed, the rat started to bulge and shake. Something poked its skin from the inside. The rat flopped and spasmed, twitching. Blood started dripping from its eyes, running down its fur and into the plastic bin. An involuntarily shiver ran down my spine.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not supposed to happen,‚Äù I whispered. Somehow the treatment had lost control. The nanites must have malfunctioned, somehow moving in sync with one another‚Ä¶

The blood pooled and beaded together. Then, like some ravenous beast, the blood lashed out toward the rat. Ashish shouted, jumping back. I gripped the edge of my desk, my eyes sunk back and frozen on the screen.

Blood surrounded the corpse of the rat like a blanket of crimson. Then the nanites ripped the dead creature‚Äôs cells apart. The rat opened with a can opener, spilling its innards into the tub.

‚ÄúSir, I think I need a second‚Äî‚Äù Ashish said, running towards the waste bin near the emergency showers. He didn‚Äôt make it. His breakfast spewed all over the freshly mopped floor. I choked back bile.

I sat in my chair, frozen, as I watched the nanites consume the entire rat‚Äîskin, flesh, fur, and bones. Soon there was nothing left but a crimson puddle, with veins of black nanites coursing throughout, supporting the amalgam by keeping the pooled blood together.

How could this have happened? I programmed the nanites to self-replicate using available cancerous cells, so with the cancerous rat, they would have no trouble doubling or tripling their numbers. That much was normal, even expected. But this?

This was something else entirely.

Blood sloshed out onto the desk like a sapient wave. The creature crawled slowly, assimilating the bloodstains from my hands. Then it splashed on the floor. I watched It absorb every single drop of blood, leaving nothing behind.

It flowed into the drain and disappeared from the video feed.

I became suddenly aware of the air around me. It pressed down on my skin like a weight, and I looked towards the laboratory exit. Ashish knelt by the door, hunched over the trash can, still emptying the contents of his stomach. Above him‚Äîthe emergency shower, and below him‚Äîthe drain. Hair stood on the nape of my neck. My voice shook. ‚ÄúAshish, don‚Äôt move.‚Äù

His eyes lowered, suddenly transfixed on the drain beneath him.

‚ÄúOh god‚Äîwhat is it?‚Äù

The red ichor started out of the drain and coursed upwards onto his boots, creeping, crawling. Ashish looked up in terror, whimpering. He hunched forward as the blood wave flowed around the edges of his boots, up the frocks of his tan pants and down his black socks.

His whole body started to shake and twitch.

Tears streamed down his face, and he looked up at me with pained eyes‚Äîbegging‚Äîpleading.

‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù"

I held back a groan, slipped out of the sheets like a ghost, and walked the door. The nurse wasn‚Äôt alone; Dr. Malcolm stood by her, holding a clipboard behind his tired eyes. Chills ran down my spine before he even opened his mouth. He spoke four words: ‚ÄúI have bad news.‚Äù

My heart caught in my chest. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs progressed, hasn‚Äôt it.‚Äù

Dr. Malcom nodded. He handed me the clipboard, and I saw the results of the last CT scan. I wish I hadn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúI thought you said she had a few more weeks?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I really thought she had more time, but you know as well as anyone just how unpredictable this can be,‚Äù he paused, then looked at me with honest eyes, and I saw for a moment the stoic doctor break down. He became mortal again, filled with weakness. Wet regret started in his eyes. ‚ÄúJacob‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry. I truly am. I‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs going to be ok,‚Äù I lied, then added, ‚Äúyou did everything you could,‚Äù and that was the truth. We tried every treatment, save for one, now swimming in the blood of a dead mouse ten floors down.

‚ÄúI need to get back to my lab,‚Äù I said, rubbing the gunk from my eyes.

‚ÄúCan I get you anything before you go?‚Äù the nurse asked.

I rubbed my forehead for a moment. ‚ÄúCoffee, actually. Black‚Äîno sugar. You *do* have coffee up here, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she beamed, and walked back to her workroom.

I grabbed a change of clothes and used Lucy‚Äôs shower to freshen up. The nurse came back to the room, and with new resolve, I grabbed the coffee, letting the dark aroma lead me to a more conscious, thoughtful state of mind. I had a two-minute commute down the elevator, and in no time at all I was back in my laboratory.

Something was wrong.

The papers I had strewn across the floor were neatly stacked on the table. The floor was mopped clean, and the rat was nowhere to be found. Instead, on the desk, was a single white rose, and slinking in the corner was a young intern, tan skin, clean shaven, young at spirit. I recognized him from Rachel‚Äôs department.

He grinned sheepishly. ‚ÄúDr. Parker sent me to clean up your lab, so I organized your notes for you, and cleaned up the mess and sorted some files, and just cleaned the place a bit. She figured you could use it.‚Äù

*Rachel.* She did this, bless her heart. ‚ÄúThank you, Dr‚Ä¶.?‚Äù

‚ÄúAshish Racchawar, sir. I‚Äôm not a doctor yet, still in school,‚Äù he said, grinning up from ambitious brown eyes.

I nodded. ‚ÄúSure, sure. What did you do with the lab rat? It was laying in the plastic tub.‚Äù

He stuttered for a moment, then looked confused. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a rat. The tub was empty.‚Äù

Chills ran down my spine. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tub is over there,‚Äù he said, nodding towards the bin on the counter. ‚ÄúIt was clean, so I put it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt clean. It was covered in blood, and there was a dead rat in it!‚Äù I said, exasperated.

We stared at eachother for a long second. I took a sip of coffee to clear my thoughts. When I looked back, he had the same confused look, and I just couldn‚Äôt believe my shit luck. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me you didn‚Äôt see the rat, or the drops of blood?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt a drop of blood here‚ÄîSir. I am not certified to clean bodily fluid spills, so if I saw anything, I would surely report it‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, stay here a minute,‚Äù I said, walking to my desk. It had been a long time since I accessed the lab security cameras, so it took me a second to find the right application on my old computer. When I did, I scanned the footage, and couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.

One hour after I had left the lab, the rat twitched.

‚ÄúSir, was the rat alive?‚Äù Ashish asked. His voice dripped with concern.

I took another sip of coffee. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

On the security feed, the rat started to bulge and shake. Something poked its skin from the inside. The rat flopped and spasmed, twitching. Blood started dripping from its eyes, running down its fur and into the plastic bin. An involuntarily shiver ran down my spine.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not supposed to happen,‚Äù I whispered. Somehow the treatment had lost control. The nanites must have malfunctioned, somehow moving in sync with one another‚Ä¶

The blood pooled and beaded together. Then, like some ravenous beast, the blood lashed out toward the rat. Ashish shouted, jumping back. I gripped the edge of my desk, my eyes sunk back and frozen on the screen.

Blood surrounded the corpse of the rat like a blanket of crimson. Then the nanites ripped the dead creature‚Äôs cells apart. The rat opened with a can opener, spilling its innards into the tub.

‚ÄúSir, I think I need a second‚Äî‚Äù Ashish said, running towards the waste bin near the emergency showers. He didn‚Äôt make it. His breakfast spewed all over the freshly mopped floor. I choked back bile.

I sat in my chair, frozen, as I watched the nanites consume the entire rat‚Äîskin, flesh, fur, and bones. Soon there was nothing left but a crimson puddle, with veins of black nanites coursing throughout, supporting the amalgam by keeping the pooled blood together.

How could this have happened? I programmed the nanites to self-replicate using available cancerous cells, so with the cancerous rat, they would have no trouble doubling or tripling their numbers. That much was normal, even expected. But this?

This was something else entirely.

Blood sloshed out onto the desk like a sapient wave. The creature crawled slowly, assimilating the bloodstains from my hands. Then it splashed on the floor. I watched It absorb every single drop of blood, leaving nothing behind.

It flowed into the drain and disappeared from the video feed.

I became suddenly aware of the air around me. It pressed down on my skin like a weight, and I looked towards the laboratory exit. Ashish knelt by the door, hunched over the trash can, still emptying the contents of his stomach. Above him‚Äîthe emergency shower, and below him‚Äîthe drain. Hair stood on the nape of my neck. My voice shook. ‚ÄúAshish, don‚Äôt move.‚Äù

His eyes lowered, suddenly transfixed on the drain beneath him.

‚ÄúOh god‚Äîwhat is it?‚Äù

The red ichor started out of the drain and coursed upwards onto his boots, creeping, crawling. Ashish looked up in terror, whimpering. He hunched forward as the blood wave flowed around the edges of his boots, up the frocks of his tan pants and down his black socks.

His whole body started to shake and twitch.

Tears streamed down his face, and he looked up at me with pained eyes‚Äîbegging‚Äîpleading.

‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù

arpbed,17,2019-02-17,Living as an ExMo in Salt Lake (slightly offtopic),DudeWoody,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/arpbed/living_as_an_exmo_in_salt_lake_slightly_offtopic/,"Hey all. So my wife and I are coming up on a decision point and wanting to do some research and get some hot take opinions. We currently live in Fort Collins, Colorado and my wife is going to be doing her grad school internship at Primary Children's Hospital.  We were originally planning on leaving the kids and I here in FoCo, but with supporting the cost of two households, we are taking a look at moving the whole family to SLC.  We've lived there before (when we were TBMs) and left in 2010.  We lived in Sugarhouse and West Jordan, and remember seeing kids that weren't mormon being severely ostracized.  

With the church shrinking everywhere (even in the Salt Lake Valley), is this as big of a thing? We have two daughters - 12 and 5 (she's set to start Kindergarten in the fall), and we don't want them to be socially punished for our decision based on finances.  I'm assuming that SLC proper would be safer and more tolerant, but that's just an assumption.  And if we did move everyone there, we would act like completely uninterested NeverMo's, assuming it would be socially safer to be NeverMo than ExMo.  

Also, do landlords still ask about church standing? Yes I know it's illegal, but that didn't stop them from obliquely asking anyway.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anything else we should take into consideration? "
arpksm,3,2019-02-17,Big fight that appears to have ended everything between me (33F) and boyfriend (36M) after 8.5 years.,Independent_insight,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/arpksm/big_fight_that_appears_to_have_ended_everything/,"I just feel numb. I love him a lot but 2/16 was a big fight and I think it's finally over. 

Little backstory: we both have some emotional issues which I think make relationships hard in general. He experienced infidelity in his marriage and got divorced at 27. I met him shortly after that. I was 24 and hadn't had a serious relationship as an adult. I am quite introverted but goal oriented and driven. I think I wasn't as affectionate as he needed early on which led to emotional cheating on his part ab 1.5 years in. I think I also didn't live up to the image he had of who he was with his ex (high school cheerleader marries football jock) and he took me for granted. I ended things immediately after the emotional cheating but we reconciled and did counseling. 2012 was a great year. In my mind, everything was perfect. No work stress and we had many hobbies together. 

Fast forward a little bit. I did have a very hard time getting over the emotional cheating thing and any fight it'd resurface. He probably feels extreme resentment for some things he did as I worked through this. Some largish sacrifices were made (he relocated when I got a full ride to graduate school and helped take care of our cat when I sort of selfishly pursued overseas study and a coveted internship in a different city. He also accepted the cat even tho he was a complete jerk at first. He also started pursuing therapy without me which changed him a lot. I tried doing the same. He nearly ended everything with me in 2017 but I agreed to bury the hatchet and try to move forward. I made some progress with communication and trust but not enough. Arguments have themes and he points this out a lot. 

Then we got jobs in different states. Other side of the country. This was going reasonably well I thought...ldr sucks but we were working it. His city won out as the better spot easily. We talked about buying real estate together and me relocating. I was searching for opportunities. He even referred me to some opportunities on this visit. 

Sex life has been ranged from good to phenomenal throughout. Hardest bit about it has been the time apart due to the ldr. Communication has started to slow and we have drifted apart. 

I wanted to fix. I was able to get away from work for a valentines day plus weekend visit. I got a nice hair cut and highlights, card about our future and bought plane ticket and boarded our pets. Everything was going ok...but just ok. Like being together was really great but he doesn't seem to look at me. Didn't notice the hair or dress or anything I wore out. He did last minute buy a present for both of to share which I love but it just all felt so non romantic. He also skipped my birthday back in Jan unless a birthday text and request to call him counts. I go to Reddit when I feel down. Look at stuff. He asked me about our plans on Saturday ""are you ready to go"" replied right away ""yes"". He asked a follow up question about ""do you really want to go"" and I didn't say anything. It didn't matter if we went or not...werent time sensitive plans. I was distracted commenting on a picture that looked like the ocelot from Archer. This lack of a reply turned into an accusation of ignoring and disrespecting which led to me commenting on feeling slighted bc of the lack of feeling cared for and him not noticing me. It blew up from there. He said doesn't want to have to convince me he cares and doesn't want to be disrespected. Seriously volatile behavior (which scared me a bit) occurred. He yelled ""get the f out. you can do that (change flight or book hotel) from a coffee shop."" I cant help but think of his face yelling and I just packed up and left shortly after. I feel like it was a massive overreaction on his part but he is firm. We attempted to discuss later but he really feels disrespected ab the lack of a reply to the second question. I feel like if he can't admit throwing away 8.5 years over that is overreacting then maybe we need to be apart. 

 
Tldr: SO and I broke up after 8.5 years after what I thought was quite trivial argument. I feel he overreacted which had me running. Communication doesn't feel logical at this point.

In the Biotechnology MS program, I did biomedical research where I generated my own research data, and then analyzed, visualized, and presented these data to my peers, coworkers, other researchers in department. In the Biomedical/Health Informatics MS program, I did a lot of data analysis with hospital/healthcare data. I also used combination of SQL and Tableau to create dashboards while working as a graduate assistant as well as during my internship at Houston Methodist Hospital. For example, I used the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data to create a dashboard as a tool for patients to pick their hospital of choice. During the internship, I extracted high level information from Houston Methodist's SQL database to create a Clinical research dashboard to show information such as enrollment numbers, enrollment dates, and contract information. In both MS programs and graduate assistant positions, I used Excel and Python regularly to clean, reformat, and analyze large data sets. 

To summarize, I bring to the table strong skills in data analysis, data visualization, Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), Tableau, SQL, Python, Java, oral/written communications, and various biomedical research techniques and assays. 

I am currently working part time as a math &amp; science tutor, but I am looking for full time employment in positions such as analyst, consultant, and other similar positions where I can utilize my skills and experience to the fullest. However, it also doesn't have to be position similar to those ones, I want to be able to make meaningful and impactful contributions. I am able to learn new skills/software/hardware fast and can apply what I learned efficiently and effectively. The pay does not matter that much to me."

Only been making $450/month due to wanting to make sure I focus heavily on school. Internship will be full time over summer where I‚Äôll make just under a grand a paycheck. I will then be doing it part time during school year until following May, which will be about $550-650 a paycheck. 

Any good ideas of what I can do that is financially best to myself? My bills are around $200 a month (phone, gas, food etc.). I could save by eating more food from home but parents don‚Äôt tend to buy healthy food cause I‚Äôd be only one to eat them. Currently drive my dad‚Äôs car which I pay just for gas and I live at home while commuting to college. Also have $400 of credit card debt which I plan on getting rid of.

I do want to save $2k so I can purchase 3 more college classes to take during summer and winter, which will let me graduate early and not spend $10k+ for another year‚Äôs worth of loans. Going into computer information systems which hopefully means I‚Äôll be earning a lot more upon graduation.

Any advice would greatly appreciated!!"

You're bent over my desk, your body trembling under mind as I lean over you, my hand wrist deep in the front of your unbuttoned slacks as my fingers work your slick little cunt.

But when I feel you get close, I stop. I let you fall forward against the desk, groaning with frustration as I slowly lick your juices off of my fingers. ""Interns with boyfriends don't get to cum. Remember, baby girl?"" I press my lips to the back of your neck, sucking at soft, sensitive flesh as you shudder. ""You know what you have to do.""

I'm interested in an RP where a woman has never had an actual orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college, and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her orgasm several times before the evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss just fucked her brains out.

The boss wants to have a playfull time with your character, but she resists, insisting that she has a boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again throughout the work day, reminding her of the actual orgasms they had the night before.

So, will you dump your boyfriend and let your rich, older lover spoil you and fuck you raw?

Kinks: anal, cunnilingus, public sex, clothed sex, mind break, ddlg, incest, lingerie, rimming and more

Limits: snuff, gore, any toilet play, and diapers

arrfos,3,2019-02-17,I can't tell if it's my mental health holding me back or just me...,Millennial_Mind,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/arrfos/i_cant_tell_if_its_my_mental_health_holding_me/,"First, some context: Graduated from college in 2016 with no debt thanks to help from my family and scholarships. Studied abroad, did undergraduate research, and got two, 6-month long internships which essentially made my degree a 5-year program. Didn't blow my GPA out of the park but got a 3.42 in mechanical engineering which I think is respectable. Had my first struggles with generalized anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and panic attacks (junior year) but overcame the attacks and much of the anxiety after some lifestyle changes and therapy. I still struggle with letting my intrusive thoughts go but you do kind of get desensitized to them which helps. Regardless of any mental health issues I had, I was driven and felt a sense of purpose in college. I wanted to go to graduate school (my dad had and it would allow for more interesting career options) and was invited to attend a pre-selection group at a big state school. While I'll admit that I was a bit unsure if the heat transfer focus in engineering was the right one , I found it hard to turn down a GRA, full tuition waiver, and a research trip to Portugal. Unfortunately, I've always struggled with low self-esteem and foolishly decided to try a cycle of oral steroids the summer before starting the grad program.

&amp;#x200B;

The immense pressure of the coursework and the crash of my endocrine system after ending the steroid cycle (about two weeks into my first semester) led to my suicide attempt. I withdrew and then spent two weeks in an in-patient program. For the rest of the year, I was just trying to move forward and regain my passion and optimism about life in general. I was working a low-stress job, staying with my folks, reapplying for school next fall, and getting stabilized on Prozac. Got accepted into my dream school (McGill) for the Fall of 2017. I was coming off prozac but left because my supervisor didn't seem to care that he enrolled me in courses that I was missing important prereqs for. For example, I was in a mechanical vibrations project-based course but had never taken the undergraduate prereq to start with. The engineering school wouldn't let me audit the 4 prereqs I was missing or take the semester off since I was an international student. So again I left, third times the charm right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Taught as an adjunct instructor for an engineering lab (Spring 2018) at the local college and joined their graduate program that summer. Finished summer and one class in the fall (2018) but left again. It was a small school but most of the courses I wanted to take were all independent studies and several of the faculty that had taught those studies had left years prior (forcing newer faculty to try and pick up the breadcrumbs). An independent study isn't bad in and of itself but all of these course types weren't differentiated in their graduate course catalog from the regular ones. 3,800k for a ""class"" where I met the prof once a week for an hour was not what I was looking for. That and a general sense of lower quality in the teaching (as compared to the faculty in my undergraduate program) were hard truths to swallow for the cost. By chance I was invited to go with some of the students of the school to a UW career fair while finishing my independent study in the fall and shortly thereafter got a job as a project/controls engineer that I've been at for six-weeks. The more I learn about the position, the less interested in it I become.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for bearing with me. Now, back to the post title! Aside from my suicide attempt, I've never felt so lost in my life.  I'm apathetic about the 32k I need to repay, I'm frustrated with the relative success of my friends, and I hate who it seems I'm becoming (a jealous, entitled quitter). I just feel that, emotionally, I'm running on empty all the time but don't want to keep conveying this to friends/family when they ask how I'm doing (hence this post). I'm starting to suspect that depression never really left me after my suicide attempt and that all the benefits of living at home (no rent, no cooking, and pets) covered up the mild depression that I find myself with now. That being said, I know all this indecisiveness isn't going to be solved by any medication and that I need to stop making excuses for myself. At this point, I really just question if the stress of project management or even engineering is really worth my mental health. I love STEM stuff and always will but I've consistently done best in writing on standardized tests like the SAT (91st percentile) and GRE (80th percentile). It makes me wonder if a career like technical writing might better suits my skills. Kind of a waste for a $180,000 degree but just because you love learning about a subject doesn't always mean that passion follows to the workplace. Any career position can be stressful but I'm just trying to place faith somewhere that feeling like quitting almost every day for the job I chose in the field I thought I'd enjoy is NOT typical."

arrwsz,45,2019-02-17,AITA for blowing up at my son after he failed to meet my expectations by not getting into UC Berkeley or UCLA?,BiggestStephCurryFan,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/arrwsz/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_son_after_he_failed_to/," 

Throwaway account. I‚Äôd like input on something that happened this Friday between my son and I. Warning, this is a very long read.

My personal background (this is relevant, I promise): I‚Äôm the youngest of 4 brothers and the first in my family to go to college. My parents have retired from rust belt factory jobs, and my 3 older brothers currently work at similar jobs. Meanwhile, I obtained a doctorate in experimental physics and currently work at a large, internationally known tech company.

My son is a smart kid. No doubt whatsoever. Straight A student until sophomore year of high school. He‚Äôs probably read every book on World War II in the local library. He self-studied high school level mathematics as a fifth grader. In middle school, he captained his school‚Äôs quiz bowl team for all 3 years and led the team to a second place finish at a national level competition. His teachers even gave him special recognition at his 8th grade graduation. In short, he was an excellent student.

I worked as a lecturer for the introductory physics courses at the local state university while my son was in elementary and middle school. I wasn‚Äôt particularly enthusiastic about teaching but hey, it helped pay the bills and I was (mostly) liked by my students. Over time, I slowly began to dislike my teaching job. At the same time, I created a plan for my son‚Äôs future education. To that end, I studied for and obtained my RHCE certification by the end of my son‚Äôs 7th grade year. I applied to several smaller companies in the SF Bay Area that summer and obtained an offer from one.

Now, here was my plan for my son: Since the state I was living in at the time (Louisiana) did not have a good public university system, I wanted my son to attend high school in California. That way, he could get in-state tuition at either UC Berkeley or UCLA. Even though those schools are not easy at all to get into these days, I had every reason to believe that my son had what it took to get in.

I accepted my job offer, rented a room, and drove to California right before the start of my son‚Äôs 8th grade year. My wife, son, and daughter stayed behind because there wasn‚Äôt enough time to look for an apartment, sign a lease, and move across the country before the start of the school year. Also, I wanted my son to spend all 3 years at the same middle school. The spring after I moved, I flew my family over to California for a week to look at apartments and high schools. Eventually my wife, my son, and I decided on Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto.

My family and I moved into an apartment in Palo Alto in August 2014. The rent was outrageous and the apartment had only 2 bedrooms but I was willing to put up with it for the sake of my son‚Äôs future. I remember an incident about one week after my son‚Äôs freshman year started. After dinner, I asked my son how he was doing at school and what he thought about California. He said that the weather was nice, the other students were mostly friendly, and that the open air campus was a refreshing change from his middle school. But then he started crying about how he was having trouble making friends in California and that he missed his old friends in Louisiana very much. I reassured him that he would make friends in California as well. But then he said ‚ÄúDad, you don‚Äôt understand‚Äù and went to his room.

My son did end up forming a small circle of good friends during his freshman year. As the school year went on, both of my kids said that they wanted to visit their old friends in Louisiana over summer break. I said that they could as long as they got straight A‚Äôs, which they both did.

In the past, my son was never particularly into video games. He did play some Pokemon and Mario Kart in elementary/middle school, but those games never affected his academic performance. When he was in Louisiana, his old friends introduced him to a game called League of Legends. It‚Äôs also important to know that when my son becomes truly interested in a subject, he will obsessively research it. There is a reason why he read almost every book on World War II in the library when we lived in Louisiana.

For reasons still unknown to me, my son‚Äôs interest in League of Legends began to rival his previous interest in World War II. I once caught him playing at 4AM when I went to get a glass of water. He started watching streams when doing homework. I tried several methods to limit his amount of time spent playing League of Legends, but he found a way around them every single time. When I wrote a shell script that limited his time spent on League of Legends to 90 minutes per day, he partitioned his laptop‚Äôs hard drive and installed OS X on the other partition. When I created a firmware password so that he could no longer partition his hard drive, he biked 4 miles to the Apple Store and had them reset it. When I resorted to confiscating his computer, he cried and said that League of Legends was one of the most important ways he had of staying in contact with his old friends in Louisiana. I told him I would return it if he got straight A‚Äôs on his mid-semester progress report, which he did. I honestly shouldn‚Äôt have given it back, because he ended up getting 2 B‚Äôs at the end of that semester.

League of Legends honestly ruined my son. Academics were never his primary focus anymore. He went from getting straight A‚Äôs to having 1-3 B‚Äôs per semester. In the spring of 2018, my son‚Äôs college admissions decisions came in. My son was rejected from 8 schools (S/A-tier UC campuses + private research universities), waitlisted at 2 (UC San Diego and UC Irvine), and accepted at 2 expensive out of state public universities (Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Throughout that spring, I held out hope that my son could get off the waitlist at either UCSD or UC Irvine. When that did not happen, I told him his options:

1. Enroll at either Purdue or UIUC, despite the financial strain it would place on the family
2. Enroll at UC Merced, the bottom tier UC campus
3. Attend community college for 2 years, then transfer to UC Berkeley/UCLA

I was not enthusiastic about (3) because I felt that it would be difficult to transfer into a S-tier UC from a community college. My son was similarly unenthusiastic because he didn‚Äôt want to live at home for 2 more years. He was even more vehemently against (2) because he felt that UC Merced was beneath him. That left us with (1). I thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already lived for 4 years in this 2 bedroom apartment for the sake of my son‚Äôs future and I have a decent amount in my savings account. Sending him to the best university he got into will be worth it.‚Äù My son eventually chose UIUC over Purdue because he was admitted to EE at UIUC vs Physics at Purdue.

After his first semester at UIUC, I had my son show me his grades. To my great disappointment, his semester GPA was only 3.0. I sternly told him that I did not pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition just so he could give me such low grades. He then replied that college was a completely different experience from high school and that even people with 4.0 GPA in high school find it hard to maintain 4.0 in college. I disagreed with his assessment, but since we were on vacation in San Diego at the time, I only told him that he should work harder next semester.

This leads to the incident this past Friday, my son‚Äôs birthday. I called him that evening to wish him a happy 19th birthday. Our conversation went something like this:

‚ÄúHappy birthday son. In case you didn‚Äôt read my last text yet, I just paid your tuition for this semester‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget what I said in San Diego: I didn‚Äôt pay all that money for you to get 3.0 GPA, so can you promise me that-‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even complete my sentence before my son started raising his voice.

‚ÄúDad, can you fucking quit it with the obsession about grades? Ever since high school you‚Äôve never-‚Äù

Now I am pissed.

‚ÄúSon, do you know what you are? You‚Äôre a disappointment to your mother and to me. We sacrificed so much to send you to Gunn so you could attend Berkeley and look what we got in return! Your friends are at Berkeley and Stanford because they worked hard and got straight A‚Äôs in high school unlike you. Also, they‚Äôre probably applying to all sorts of internships right now but you? You‚Äôre afraid to show your face at a career fair because your GPA is so shit! They‚Äôll throw your resume straight into the trash! You know all too well how I grew up in that factory town and how hard I worked to be where I am today. I don‚Äôt even want to call such a lazy shit like you my son anymore. You must at the very least-‚Äù

At this point, my son hung up. I tried calling back him but he never answered. Around an hour later he texts me:‚ÄúDad you‚Äôre such a fucking asshole. A real father would never call his son the shit you called me. You know what else a real father would not do? Create a grandiose fucking plan such as yours for his son when his son is too young to fully understand it. Why the fuck did you move me to California when you knew full well you were taking me away from the network I built in Louisiana? Maybe you could have given me some god damn emotional support in high school when I needed it. Instead, you spend all that time fucking with my computer trying to stop me from playing League. Guess what? That just made me want to play it more. Jokes on you, Dad. I might just have gotten into Berkeley if it wasn‚Äôt for your constant fucking interference regarding League. That was the entire point of your fucking plan, right?‚Äù

So Reddit, am I the asshole here for being pissed at my son for wasting tens of thousands of dollars with nothing to show for it? Or is he the asshole for not working hard enough in high school? Or are we both assholes?"
art50d,3,2019-02-17,Big Career Switch,rtkaratekid,SecurityCareerAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/art50d/big_career_switch/,"Hey guys, really enjoy the sub and the practical advise I've found.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background on me. My undergrad is in Neuroscience and I decided to make the switch from research and/or medicine for a variety of reasons that may not be relevant here. I'm currently in a master's program studying software development and I'm personally emphasizing security and data analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

I (like a few others here) am looking into getting into the Security field. Not exactly sure where I want to end up, but for now I've been doing various capture-the-flag type wargame sites and have really enjoyed it and so am thinking pen testing is where I'd like to end up. Currently I'm looking for summer internships doing pretty much any kind of security work in order to get my foot in the door and, since I have zero relevant work experience (despite projects I can show and those wargame practices) I'm hustling pretty hard to apply tons of places and network as much as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question for you, hopefully soon-to-be peers, is what is the best way to break into this field with the minimal experience I have? 

I do have a very robust background in critical thinking, testing, and problem solving. I really enjoy the hacky sort of work that security has involved for me so far (e.g. some basic assembly, C programming, Python scripting, Linux/Unix, needing to understand fundamentals of protocols really well, etc.). Some companies/organizations seem to like me having little experience, I think so they can mold me how they want (NSA and Sandia are two), so I'm not completely discouraged from getting a job. But I'd really like to start my career with a really great job (don't we all?).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you just know of anyone looking for an intern like me, I won't be opposed to a DM ;)

Cheers for reading till the end!"

1. I am currently in a diploma and will be graduating soon in about 3 months, after my internship period ends this month.

2. After the above, would most likely be serving conscription for minimum 2 years with basic allowance of $500

What I would like to ask is, should i just leave the funds in my savings account? Or should i put it into an index fund? My bank offers 1% fee on the principal sum and has a plan whereby I can set aside minimum of $100 each month to put into an index fund or bond of my choice.

Also there may be some of you here who may be able to guess where I am from so would be even better if I could get some insight from you all.

Thanks in advance!"

In early December, they threatened to take away financial support for my living costs and schooling because I wanted to accept my first computer science internship for the winter. I was super stressed out about this and trying not to fail my courses. (I did much better than I thought, whew.)

Late December, I had another squabble. Then at the beginning of January, they issued me an ultimatum: to go back home, and continue living there, or to get my financial support cut once more. To give you some background, my parents help me with the interest for a student line of credit because they make too much for me to get any financial aid. My sister had warned me earlier that this discussion was going to be about their suspicion that I wasn't going to church. I was a nervous wreck every time they texted, or tried to call. I was terrified to even confront them. I finally talked to them and tried to have a decent discussion with them. They had told me earlier that they'd give me 3 days to decide. But after that discussion, the next day, when I went to the rental office to pay my rent, my credit card was declined. They had put a hold on the card. When I called them, they told me to come home. I decided to cut ties. I could never bear living at home. My parents always mock me, act passive agressive, and talk about me behind my back. They have this whole schtick that I'll be useless and won't be able to survive the adult world. Besides, I'd be living with that sword dangling above my head anytime I'd step out of line.

In January, I had $700 in my bank account (a cheque I'd forgotten to deposit from a summer job) and was $150 short of rent, not including food. Luckily, a few trips to the food bank gave me enough food to survive the next three weeks till I got paid. My boyfriend lent me $150, and a friend of mine bought me groceries. I started working at my internship and got paid, enough for food and next month's rent. 


I'm fine right now. But I still still feel angry and hurt. I want them to feel as hurt as I feel when I think about them. I want them have sleepless nights and wonder what went wrong. But I also want to let go of this resentment. I'm not exactly sure how.


My boyfriend thinks I should give them another chance (to reconcile?), because I have the upper hand now, and because family is useful. But I don't know if I can.

aru58d,15,2019-02-18,Living in a van instead of a dorm,relatable_user_name,vandwellers,https://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/aru58d/living_in_a_van_instead_of_a_dorm/,"Having literally 0 outside financial support, no other home to go to starting next semester (i'm okay for the summer), and being only a freshman, I've been considering over the last several months to go all out and buy and convert a used van over the summer, and I just wanted to ask some questions. But first, some context:

* This is at a large university.

* I no longer have a car.

* Rent around here is more expensive than the cost of living on campus, which I already can't afford. 0 chance at finding any roommates, either.

* I have enough cash saved up to buy a used van and go all out on a conversion.

* I have none of the necessary experience to pull off a conversion.

* I've seen plenty of generic utility vans scattered about on campus day and night, so I'm semi-confident I can get away with just cycling through various parking lots on campus with a stealthy enough build, + I'm 90% sure I've seen converted vans around the local Walmart.

* I have no interest in traveling at the moment.

* I want to live a minimalist lifestyle, and currently have virtually all my belongings packed into the corner of my small dorm. I am confident that I'd be able to move into a van with ease.

* I have a basic layout in my head that I'm planning on modeling out over the next few months.

* I would like the van to be nice and comfy, but adding flare like wood paneling and mood lighting and that sort of stuff is by far the lowest priority for me.

Here are things I want out of the van:

* toilet and shower (**inside the van, *NO* EXCEPTIONS**)

* Ideally enough solar panels to power my desktop (briefly), some lights, and one of those top-down cooler-fridge hybrid things, and a large external monitor (for both my desktop and my laptop) for periods of time during the day (I've already worked out how much solar and what kind of battery I would need for my interests). Realistically, enough power to charge my laptop and phone.

* stealth, which will be hard to pull off with solar panels

I need every penny I can save. Unless I blow way too much money on the conversion, I would make back my investment and then some by graduation, but I would still need to live in the van for at least another year after college to make the investment truly worth it (to myself), which is a big reason as to why I'm hesitant.

I basically have no other options (besides dropping out) since there's no chance I'm getting an affordable apartment (in general and also because it's already February) and I'm getting absolutely burned on costs for living on campus, but the van would have to be a long-term commitment to be worth it.

---

Now some of my questions: 

* Is this the right choice?

* Would I be able to pull this off in one summer?

* Would this make internships more accessible for me (I know some people who've been offered very lucrative internships but without compensation for living costs)?

* How long would I be able to live out of the van full-time without major issues?

* Will I be safer on maintenance and gas costs considering how little I'd be actually moving the van?

* What kind of van should I be shooting for?

* What can I do to reduce the sound leaving the van, such as from having a conversation inside it?

* What can I do about stealth in general?

* Where would I be able to dispose of and acquire water? I'm also interested in and willing to dish out extra cash for some sort of water treatment thing to purify water, especially one for a shower that reuses and reheats the same water

* How realistic is this?

also other general tips and information would be appreciated

i probably have more questions that i'm forgetting about"
arulsq,4,2019-02-18,Millennial with uni advice for those high achievers,[deleted],GenZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/arulsq/millennial_with_uni_advice_for_those_high/,"God I was an idiot in undergrad and less of an idiot now. So here's my advice for you kiddos:

Go major in econ, accounting, public policy or finance and pick up skills in GIS, technical/legal writing, econometrics, some basic programming. This will get you a great job (STEM is a meme). Do student radio and campus politics your freshman year. These are your ticket to getting to know people and getting laid. Stick with one of the two clubs or start a club. Take some art history or lit classes so you don't look like an uncultured dweeb around the person you're trying to attract. A class in some sort of law might not hurt. Consider studying abroad in Hong Kong or Singapore with the intent of picking up Mandarin or if you can study abroad at Oxford get that gpa high enough to do so. Get internships junior year but not too many. Whatever spare time you have should be spent partying. It's ok to join a frat or sorority. Don't let Reddit tell you otherwise."

Hell, I like the curriculum and the caliber seems to be only a bit under-par compared to UCI or UCSD, but the resources for students here are completely pitiful. We literally have no connections to any fucking good companies save for the extremely rare case of some golden-boy getting into Google, who would have gotten in either way at any other university, which definitely excuses the 95% of people that I know who still can't find internships after 200+ apps.

How the hell are CSULB and Pomona getting Boeing and Raytheon while we just end up with a bunch of fucking small names? The only times when Big 4 companies come is to give talks, not for any interest in actually finding interns. I'm getting seriously frustrated at having to put in 10x more effort than engineering students I know who go to other UCs and Cal states with no goddamn projects, shit GPAs, and find great internships at the drop of a hat. What a goddamn joke. "

So through a series of emergencies and bad situations I‚Äôve run into a huge dilemma. As of tomorrow morning I won‚Äôt have a house or place to stay at all. I‚Äôm a paramedic student just finishing up my internship. I‚Äôve been living with my parents however they have to move and I can‚Äôt stay with them at their new location.

I don‚Äôt have money to put a security /down payment on anything until March 8.. but I‚Äôd prefer not to be homeless until then. I do have a job as well as going to school. I‚Äôm just trying to get through all of the stuff I‚Äôve had going on. If you or anyone you know has a place or a room available temporarily I would be forever grateful. Let me know! Thank you!! "

The only sounds in the room are your whimpers, your harsh breaths as you gasp for air, and the soft squelching of my fingers pumping in and out of your pussy. ""P-please, I'm s-so...""

I spread my fingers slightly inside of you, curling them up against your walls for added friction as my thumb slides over your clit in slow, cruelly slow circles. You're bent over my desk, your body trembling under mind as I lean over you, my hand wrist deep in the front of your unbuttoned slacks as my fingers work your slick little cunt.

But when I feel you get close, I stop. I let you fall forward against the desk, groaning with frustration as I slowly lick your juices off of my fingers. ""Interns with boyfriends don't get to cum. Remember, baby girl?"" I press my lips to the back of your neck, sucking at soft, sensitive flesh as you shudder. ""You know what you have to do.""

I'm interested in an RP where a woman has never had an actual orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college, and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her orgasm several times before the evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss just fucked her brains out.

The boss wants to have a playfull time with your character, but she resists, insisting that she has a boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again throughout the work day, reminding her of the actual orgasms they had the night before.

So, will you dump your boyfriend and let your rich, older lover spoil you and fuck you raw?

arvcjt,3792,2019-02-18,"I was one of the ""harassers"" escorted out from the Outlaws game. The entire thing is a lie.",Different_Fruit,Competitiveoverwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/arvcjt/i_was_one_of_the_harassers_escorted_out_from_the/,"First of all, I didn't know any of the other people who were escorted out, I'm in LA for two weeks as part of my internship and I went to the game alone. I sat beside a group of guys who knew each other and clearly went to the game together.

What happened to cause all the drama? Honestly, not much at all as far as I could tell? The guys beside me weren't all that loud or belligerent. They just acted like normal sports fans, cheering against the Outlaws when they lost a fight, etc. I didn't even hear any swearing, the worst was stuff like ""YOU SUCK!"".

The ""slut"" stuff I'm 100% sure never happened. There was no interaction between the two rows of people as far as I could tell. Nobody was turning around or anything, until a random girl (blonde, kind of heavyset), turned around and started yelling at the group of guys to apologize for harassing (her?/the team?). I looked up a picture of Linkzr's fiance and this girl definitely wasn't her, I honestly don't remember Linkzr's fiance being there at all or being involved in any way. The guys didn't really argue back, just said something like ""we didn't say that"" a few times, then ignored her while she continued saying someone called her a slut, and also called them out for being racist, which was completely out of left field.

After a few minutes, the girl turned around and everything went back to normal, the girls were still yelling about the game but the guys mostly stopped, I thought it was all done and over, but after the game ended a group of Blizzard employees came and told most of the row we had to switch seats or leave and contact Blizzard for a refund. I think they just assumed I was part of the group, wouldn't hear me out, and I ended up just leaving because there were no decent seats left and I was kind of jarred and angry at this point.

I'm not mad at the Blizzard employees because it was honestly a shitshow and I'm sure they had no idea how to sort things out, it was a ""he said she said"" battle royale, and they were probably scared of a fight breaking out or something. 

It just annoyed me to see people like the Outlaws' manager calling fans ""animals"" for no reason at all, not sure why a complete lie is being taken as the truth.

I'll be back in the morning to answer any questions, if any Reddit admins want proof they can message me or something.

Edit: Holy fuck I actually read every comment in this thread, replied to PMs, etc. I expected like 50 upvotes maximum to be honest. Kind of pressed for time, but just to answer some common stuff: I have a good idea of who the false accuser is based on Twitter stuff, but I'm not going to name and shame them. I don't want this drama to potentially affect my personal life or career, so I cannot provide proof, this thread can be deleted if necessary. However, I take issue with the fact that the Outlaws manager is able to refer to fans as animals with zero proof and be highly upvoted. 

Yes, it's entirely possible that one of the guys whispered something offensive to one of the girls or something, my bad for creating a misunderstanding. My 100% comment was referring to the idea that sexist and racist stuff was being shouted out in the open by a ""conga line of animals"", which absolutely did not happen. I was only addressing the one Twitter thread involving the Outlaws manager, there were more Twitter posts by other people which changed/clarified the story to [one of the girls heard one of the guys whispering slut under his breath?](https://imgur.com/y1bnlpD) Which seems like a piss poor excuse to kick out an entire row of fans, I'm pretty certain that the arena staff must've received an exaggerated version of events to say the least.

No, I'm not that salty anymore, thanks for the sympathy though. I honestly don't care at all after sleeping on it. People are urging me to try to get these liars banned from the arena, demand additional compensation from Blizzard, etc. I'm sorry but I just don't give enough of a shit to do any of that. Have a nice day, I just hope people can be less spiteful in the future."

arx6re,21,2019-02-18,"My BF died 3 years ago and I'm still not ""over"" it.",jstse,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/arx6re/my_bf_died_3_years_ago_and_im_still_not_over_it/,"This is really long, I'm sorry. I've hardly spoken about the details of the incident before because I'm a very private person, but I think it's time for me to try to get it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my BF when I was 16, and we hit it off right away. We got together merely two weeks after meeting each other for the first time, and I knew I had found something special. He was my first relationship, and although it wasn't the best relationship (compared to other couples I knew), he was the love of my life. I missed him everyday; even an hour after I left him to go home I couldn't wait to see him again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 5 years later. The previous 2 years had been rocky - I've suffered from major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder since I was 14 years old, and it's been rough for the both of us. As much I tried not to rely on my BF for support, I needed someone to talk to. He got pretty sick of me saying stuff like: ""You're not the only one with problems, stop being attention-seeking."" This hurt me a great deal and because of this, I had contemplated on breaking up but decided to give him a second chance. Probably more like I didn't know what I'd do without him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, in 2016 we went on our first overseas trip together to New Zealand. It was there that I realised he was just a blunt, no-nonsense dude who said anything on his mind and he didn't mean to be insensitive. It was just his personality. He really cared for me deeply but he didn't know how to express it. We had such a great time, it was the best 3 weeks of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was scheduled to fly to Japan for a month the day after we came back from NZ to go on an internship for his father's business. I still remember the night he left, when he got into his car I couldn't stop crying. I had this strong overwhelming feeling that I would never see him again. I couldn't stop hugging him and telling him: ""Please come back safe."" He just looked at me weirdly saying he would and drove off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was fine until the week before he was scheduled to come home for my birthday. I knew something was wrong because he hadn't replied me for 16 hours. At 8pm on the 9th of June, I was suddenly overcome with a strong sense of sadness, regret, and guilt and I couldn't stop crying. I thought it was just another one of my depressive episodes (which can come and go for no reason) so I lay in bed and cried it off for another half hour. That's when I got the call from his Aunt back in my home country with the news that he had just passed away. I remember saying: ""No. No. NO."" Then I put down the phone, and I felt so cold, like a stone had just dropped from my chest into my abdomen and somebody ripped my heart out. I ran out the house screaming and threw my phone by the sidewalk wailing. My parents had to bring me in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I promised him that I would be there for him my whole life, and so I decided to follow his family to Japan to bring him home, much to my parents' and his family's disapproval. The next 3 days was the most traumatic time of my life. It had become a police incident because my BF had fallen off a train platform onto the tracks, where he hit his head on the rails and suffered a major concussion. Nobody knew if somebody had pushed him, so we had to watch the CCTV footage of him falling to make sure it was really him and nobody had tried any funny business. The worst thing was that he was still alive when he got helped off the tracks and made his way back to his apartment alone where he had spent the next 8 hours dying, and I was just watching TV back home. Then we had to identify his body - it was in a fucking car park in the police station. I don't know why it wasn't in the morgue. His family went in first, and I had to stand outside and listen to them scream his name and shouting that he can‚Äôt be dead, this wasn‚Äôt him, wake up now. I was there to help them through this ordeal but I completely broke down. I touched him for the last time, and I never knew anything could be so cold. All the while his Father was holding me as I cried and he was sobbing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù because he felt he was responsible for BF‚Äôs death. I had to be supported back to the hotel because I was doubled over in emotional pain. 

His coworker was holding my arm and he asked me gently: ‚ÄúAre you OP? BF spoke so much about you. He said he couldn‚Äôt wait to get back home to take you out for a nice dinner for your birthday.‚Äù  I cried so hard I thought my eyes would burst. Back in the hotel his family and I were speaking to the undertakers about what kind of coffin he‚Äôd be put in. I never imagined I would hear the words ‚Äúcoffin‚Äù and ‚ÄúBF‚Äù in the same sentence together for a long while more.

BF had to go for an autopsy as per government regulations in Japan (something along those lines), and when it was over I could see the stitches running across his chest and around his forehead and I moaned. I kissed him one last time before they closed the lid. 

&amp;#x200B;

We brought him back safely and at the funeral, people would come up to me and hold my hands as I stood next to his coffin saying: ""You have to be strong for his and your parents and just MOVE ON. They're worried about you."" I guess that's why I've repressed my emotions in an attempt to put on a strong front and 3 years later I still haven't recovered. Just 2 nights ago I dreamt that it was the day he died, and that I texted my BF's friend asking about where he was, and his friend said BF is alive and well in the hospital, you can come and see him. And I woke up and opened WhatsApp to text my BF just to realise that it wasn't real, and that he was still dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think what made things worse was the lack of support. People compared his death to the loss of their cat (I know that pets are considered loved ones too, but I don't think it's directly comparable) and breakups (again, not exactly the same thing). So I never knew what to do. The traumatic experiences had me banging my head against the wall trying to get them out, or self-harming. I've been dragged to the therapist and seen multiple psychiatrists (some of which recommended me ECT), and although I'm in a better place now, I still wish I could just see him and end everything now. 

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me even more confused is that I'm dating a wonderful guy now, who loves me despite my mental conditions. But I can't tell him I love him, because I've never said it to anybody else since my BF died, and I know that if I told the wonderful guy I loved him I'd be lying, because I'm still very much deeply in love with BF. Now, my friends and brothers are getting married, and although I'm super happy for them, I can't help but wish it was me and BF getting engaged. It's been so hard, and I'm so tired for being strong for people. 

&amp;#x200B;

He will die over and over again everyday for the rest of my life, and I can't imagine living a life like that. It sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Extra Info: This may sound wacky. I mentioned that I thought I was having a relapse when my BF died, but I realised it might have been me feeling him die. There were other incidents after his death where I could feel his presence. I could share them if you'd like. But I think it makes me feel really lucky that my BF still looked after me from beyond the grave, of which many people in my situation would have longed for. Look on the bright side, I suppose.

ary1pr,17,2019-02-18,I keep feeling overwhelmed and it's not getting better...,sounut,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ary1pr/i_keep_feeling_overwhelmed_and_its_not_getting/,"So I moved across the country to attend Law school, leaving all of my friends and family behind. One day in September, my brain just started racing with thoughts like how I left all my friends and family, was having trouble making new friends, feeling like I wasn't good enough to be in Law School, feeling like I had no idea what I was doing, and many other thoughts. These thoughts started spiralling very quickly in my mind and I felt severely overwhelmed; I felt like I wanted to cry and I didn't know what to do. For lack of a better word, at that moment I felt crippled. I had to sit down and do some deep breathing exercises to calm down.

&amp;#x200B;

It happened again in October while I was trying to fall asleep. That time, every time I shut my eyes, it felt like my mind was being squashed with the spiral of thoughts. It felt worse. It happened again in twice in November and once again in December while studying for finals. 

&amp;#x200B;

During winter break I went home. I realized I needed time to myself so I told myself I would relax. I had planned a trip with some friends to go to a resort in Denver and relax, spend time with my mother, and just enjoy time with my girlfriend. That didn't exactly happen. What ended up happening is my girlfriend broke up with me (she spent two weeks in Belize while I was taking finals and it was life changing for her so she came back and decided that she wanted to work towards travelling the world and didn't feel like she could do that while in our relationship) and on Christmas my grandmother (maternal) in India had a stroke so my mother flew to India to be with her (so my mother wasn't at home. I couldn't go with my mother because my passport was back in Law School and I felt helpless). A week after break was over (and I was back in the semester), my other grandmother (paternal) in India passed away. Last week my grandmother (maternal) went back into the hospital and is now in need of a pacemaker.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I got back to this semester, the intensity and frequency of my overwhelming mind spirals have drastically increased.  They happen about twice a week and now they include thoughts about what I did wrong in my relationship, how I feel helpless about my grandmothers, am I losing myself and who I am, whether I will actually get a summer 1L internship, am I cut out for this, feeling as I am not learning the same as my classmates, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I starting seeing a University provided therapist a few weeks ago but I feel as though it's only getting worse. I don't know what to do and I honestly feel scared. My mind constantly feels pressed now and the spirals aren't getting better. Does anyone have any advice that could help me? I appreciate any advice that you may have!"

De ontheffing ex artikel 39 LVW BES liep in december 2017 af. De luchthaven, evenals National Helicopters Inc., werden eerder door de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport &amp;#40;ILT&amp;#41; gewezen op het tijdig aanvragen van een verlenging alsook op het feit dat zonder beide ontheffingen geen gebruik mocht worden gemaakt van de luchthaven. National Helicopters Inc. vroeg in november 2017 verlenging van de artikel 40 LVW BES ontheffing aan. Deze ontheffing beslaat de periode van 7 december 2017 tot 1 december 2019.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij een administratieve controle, uitgevoerd op 21 januari 2019, is niet gebleken dat de luchthaven na december 2017 om verlenging van de artikel 39 LVW BES ontheffing had verzocht. Zowel de luchthaven als National Helicopters Inc. zijn daarop ge√Ønformeerd dat zonder de artikel 39 LVW BES ontheffing de luchthaven tussen 21:00 en 07:00 uur niet mocht worden gebruikt. De betreffende helikopter is vervolgens uitgeweken naar Saba om toch direct medische vluchten uit te kunnen voeren.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn u gevallen bekend waarin het ontbreken aan adequaat nachtelijk transport naar het ziekenhuis van Sint Maarten heeft geleid tot ernstige medische complicaties? Kunt u aangeven hoe op dit moment wordt voorzien in nachtelijke medische spoedhulp op Sint Eustatius en Saba?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit navraag bij de openbare lichamen Saba en Sint Eustatius is gebleken dat er geen medische complicaties zijn opgetreden ten gevolge van de ontstane situatie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid om de afgifte van de noodzakelijke vergunningen zo spoedig mogelijk af te ronden? Bent u daarnaast bereid maatregelen te treffen om herhaling te voorkomen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Om de luchthaven van Sint Eustatius tussen 21:00 uur en 07:00 uur voor noodzakelijke medische vluchten te kunnen gebruiken en om de helikopter weer in de op Sint Eustatius gevestigde hangaar onder te kunnen brengen, heeft de ILT tijdelijk en versneld het verzoek, zoals op 22 januari 2019 door het openbaar lichaam ingediend, om ontheffing ex artikel 39 LVW BES op 31 januari 2019 aan de exploitant van de luchthaven verleend. Deze ontheffing is geldig tot 1 maart 2019.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De ontheffing is tijdelijk afgegeven omdat deze ontheffing vanwege het maatschappelijk belang met spoed diende te worden verlengd. De aanvraag wordt voor 1 maart 2019 formeel beoordeeld, alvorens er een ontheffing voor een langere periode kan worden afgegeven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naar de vraag waarom niet over is gegaan tot aanvraag na de eerste verwittiging van de ILT in december 2017 loopt intern onderzoek bij het openbaar lichaam Sint Eustatius. Als onderdeel van de ingezette acties naar aanleiding van de Tijdelijke Wet Taakverwaarlozing wordt de ambtelijke organisatie gereorganiseerd, en waar nodig opgeleid, en worden werkprocessen herzien. Het proces tot verlenen van vergunningen is daar onderdeel van.

Over time, I tried different paradigms and was blown away when dplyr was released. I now run a data science department. I've stopped making my interns and new hires learn base operations before teaching them the tidyverse approach. dplyr and purrr are so powerful that I don't see a need for people to know the old ways.

This doesn't mean not teaching *any* base operations. And as people gain experience, they need to know how to read code written in other styles. But why start with the traditional way of building anonymous functions when purrr is more concise?"

I'm looking for partners to RP and write with.

I have some extra info for what kind of stuff I‚Äôm into along with a few sample prompts and/or ideas for you down here. I also have plenty more in my profile ranging from simple MF pairings to threesomes and group scenes even up to a prompt roulette and CYOAs both for you and me. I'm always open to suggestions of themes and ideas we could work forward with.

***

##Writing Style

I play long-term and prefer shorter replies, that allow better interaction, usually one or two paragraphs, except for when longer descriptions are needed. I also only do written character descriptions and expect the same. I like introductions, building the dynamic and flirtatious interaction between the characters along with the obvious smut to make things feel more enjoyable and relatable. I don‚Äôt tend to play extremely dominant nor extremely submissive characters but usually on the flirtier and more active side, though I do like the corrupted cute &amp; innocent girl aspect a well.

I also like to write the introductions, so I can set the mood. Some change of pace for the guys of DPP.

***

##Ideas

**Blackmailed threesome**

For this I'm looking to play a cheating woman in a high position with you playing both the man I'm cheating with and the person who catches us. Two basic ideas are you being a high school student (18+) who catches his two teachers going at it. Or an intern in my company who catches me with a rival ceo etc.

**Picking up chicks around the town**

You might have seen those clickbait videos where the guy goes around picking up chick with an expensive car. I'd like to try out building a prompt based around that without it being acted and much more smuttier.

**Fucking someone on shift**

A prompt based around not really caring a bout my job and just having fun while taking in the cash, can range from anything from me being a clerk at a secluded gas station or a late night security guard.

**Tomboy**

Anything tomboy related really, guy sports, mechanic in racing scene or anything else.

**Interracial pairings**

I'm white but I'm also open to playing an asian in a themed roleplay maybe something Japan or even Yakuza related. Along this I'm always happy to play prompts revolving around black men in a western setting

##Prompts

**Camgirl filming an impromptu session on her way to an exhibition** [F4M]

I'm Fiona, better known by my screen name FoxeyBabe, an early twenties cam girl and an Instagram model on my way to an exhibition to promote my channel and to meet other professionals. The 8-hour train ride has been a bore for the past three hours, so I thought I'd spice it up.

I picked up my phone, turned on selfie camera and posed myself against the window making a peace sign showing my cute face along with my blue dyed pixie cut and freckles.
""If anyone can find me, you can get featured on an impromptu video"" I typed on my phone and pressed post.

I was left there sitting on my cabin dressed in my red t-shirt, which covered my c-cup breasts and black skinny jeans wrapping around my toned butt. I wondered for a while if anyone would find me before returning back to browsing my social media.

**Friend‚Äôs brothers** [F4MM]

My friend Laura had abandoned me in her room and would be gone for at least two hours with her parents with her. I could hear her brothers, both of whom were certainly lookers, playing something downstairs. Since she had done this to me I felt no pity for her for what I was going to do next.

My name is Emily, I was wearing black low-cut t-shirt showing my C-cup cleavage. With that I had paired white sports shorts with long athletic socks in my feet. I had my brown hair tied to a ponytail with some hair hanging loose on my cheeks. I was 5'7' tall. My eyes are blue, and my nose is slightly up tilted.

I stood up from her bed and walked downstairs where the guys were playing. With determination I walked between them and the living room table, bent over to pick up the remote, exposing my firm ass to them in progress, and sat down on an armchair with it.

**Girls betting on your bulge** [FF4M]

Your life had always been defined by your enormous endowment both off and on duty.

It‚Äôs was a late summer night. You were at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive though it seemed like the last one had skipped it‚Äôs turn. Eventually you two girls, just a tiny bit tipsy appeared to the stop and started snickering while trying to covertly stare at you. You had quite a good idea about what.

One of them was about 5‚Äô8‚Äù with her heels on. Her red hair was loose and cut to around shoulder length. She was wearing a black dress down to her thighs and up to her breasts leaving shoulders bare. The other had brown hair in a ponytail along with a long-sleeved black crop top and ripped skin-tight jeans. She had just canvas shoes on but was still almost as high as her friend with heels.

After about 3 minutes of them trying to peak and snickering the one black haired one approached you.

‚ÄúHey sorry to bother and for sorry for advance for being impolite but‚Ä¶‚Äù she stopped for a moment. ‚ÄúMy friend here says you‚Äôve stuffed your pants full of socks, but I think it‚Äôs real. Please, we have 20 bucks riding on this‚Äù

**Secretary for my boyfriend‚Äôs black boss** [F4M]

I had been unemployed for a while before my boyfriend gave me a pleasant surprise. He had arranged me a position as a secretary at his company. The only problem. I didn‚Äôt get assigned to him, rather his boss, the CEO of the company, a seductive hot black guy, impressively still in his late 20s taking his position into account.

I stood in front of my mirror buttoning up my dress shirt hiding away my D cup breasts I was already wearing a black pencil skirt to go along with my blazer and the dress shirt. I was wearing black shoes and stood 5‚Äô7‚Äù high against the mirror. My light brown hair on a bun with my thick framed glasses on my small nose. I had otherwise quick sharp features with a prominent but feminine chin.

My boyfriend Mark was waiting me in the car. It was my first day working after he had gotten me into the company. 

‚ÄúDiane, Diane Winters‚Äù I introduced myself to the receptionist. ‚ÄúI was supposed to start with Mr. Black today.‚Äù

as0nzi,2,2019-02-18,I (F25) dont know if I should continue my secret relationship with my ex (M23) who's still with his girlfriend and living with her. Help!,bossbabejuelz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/as0nzi/i_f25_dont_know_if_i_should_continue_my_secret/,"Sorry this might be a long one! You'll need the backstory.

It all started back in early 2016 when I met a guy when I was doing an internship in Australia. We met on tinder, but texted for a little over a month before seeing each other for the first time. When we finally met we spent 3 full days together. He actually only came to my town to do some work every few months, which was why I decided to fly out and spend a week with him in his hometown the week after we first met.

I was absolutely head over heels for this guy and thought that I had finally found a true connection. When I was visiting him we stayed at a hotel close to his work as that was the easiest option.  During the week of my stay I found out that his ex was trying to get back together with him. I also found out that he had lied to me about not having a Facebook (that showed he was still spending time with his ex). He apologized and assured me that they were done, and we had a lovely week together. We even made it official.

Then came the day I had to leave and travel back to my home country (I had to attend some exams). He drove me to the airport and was actually visibly upset about me leaving. A few weeks went by and we're texting and skyping every day. We were even planning our future and how we would work things out with us being long distance. About a month into the relationship he decided to break up because we wouldn't be able to see each other for quite some time because of education. I was devastated but came around to accept it as we would still talk every day. Mind you we were never ""Facebook official"" not do I think any of his friends or family knew about me.

I noticed he started to tag a girl in cute posts on Facebook (which he had never done with me). I asked him about it to which he answered that she was just a friend. Turned out she wasn't (they even made it official on Facebook) and we lost touch for a few months. Suddenly he started messaging me again. I gave him an ultimatum which was if he wanted to talk to me, then he had to dump his girlfriend. It took him a few weeks (cause apparently it was never the right time) to finally break up with her. We were back to talking.

Everything was great until we started to argue about the fact that he had to come live with me for a year for us to be able to obtain a partner visa. He was being extremely selfish and didn't want to leave his friends and family to come live with me for a year (a requirement and no I unfortunately couldn't move back to Australia as I had used my only visa that would allow me to work and live there for a year). He then started ignoring my calls and messages and would always say he was busy. I found out he was seeing a new girl. I gave up and blocked all contact with him. 

We didn't speak for a year until January 2018 where he contacted me again. I had taken me a long time to get over him and what he had done to me yet I decided to reply to his message. Turned out he was still with his girlfriend and now living with her. Apparently he wasn't happy in his relationship and missed me. I once again gave him an ultimatum. Leave his girlfriend and find somewhere else to stay. He agreed and we started planning for him to move to my country to fulfill the year requirement for the partner visa.

Fast forward a year.  He still hasn't left his girlfriend and is currently still living with her. I'm so tired of everything and has fallen back into depression and suicidal thoughts. He keeps telling me he's saving up to leave and will call me every morning before work. I've told him multiple times that I can't do this anymore and that I can't wait for him forever. 

I completely lost it the other week when he forgot my birthday. He's never done anything special for me yet I know he got his girlfriend flowers for valentines (last valentines he even sent her flowers when they were doing long distance). Why can't he do that for me? His excuse is always that I'm on the other side of the world. He hasn't even skyped me in over two years. I feel used and manipulated, yet I can't get rid of him.

I live alone in my own apartment and don't have any friends here (I was in an international class for the past 5 years and all of my friends have returned to their home countries). He's the only one I have.

I really need some advice on how to deal with all of this. Do I trust him and wait for him to save up so he can move here? Or is he a lost cause. I've had boyfriends before him, but I've never felt such a special connection with anyone but him. Please take everything I say with a grain of salt as this is only my side of the story. What do I do?"
as1rxk,1,2019-02-18,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/as1rxk/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good afternoon, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! It's a new one, so I'm sure there are kinks to work out along the way, but I really like the concept!

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

Bonus points if your character looks like Keiran Lee, he has the perfect cock.

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins more bonus points

Look forward to playing, obviously all stuff will be 18+ on the ages x"
as22uj,7,2019-02-18,SD wants me to move in/ change universities,[deleted],sugarlifestyleforum,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/as22uj/sd_wants_me_to_move_in_change_universities/,"So my first and only sugar daddy has been with me for almost a year.  I'm currently a fulltime university student, and he's a medical director/surgeon. He handles most of my tuition, housing, car, vacations, etc.  I still work my internships in order to savor some independence, but I would say his help adds a LOT of leisure.

But recently we began seeing eachother less due to some factors: He got injured in a trampoline accident and it's 9 months recovery. Also my car got sideswiped by a truck in the snow so I can't drive to him. He wants to Fly/Uber me, but the days he's not in rehab falls on my classes and internship.  

Right that I only see him once every 1-2 months, things are getting tight. Typically our allowances range from $700/a day - $2,000 a weekend, but most of that disapears into a myriad of bills. 

Last night we talked about this inconsistency, and he suggested I move into his estate. He said he'd pay off the entirety of my college, car, and if I needed space he would buy me a condo nearby. He's had a fulltime SB before, and can definitely vouch that he's capable of making my life easier under his  guidance. (He got her into medical school, paid it off, referenced her, and now she's very successful)

But it would also mean total dependence, switching colleges, leaving friends, and moving 2 hours away from family. I also don't know how our sparks will prevail being together every day, especially since as I require certain attention and arts that he had no experience of.

This might be a bit of a long read but I'll try to contain it.  

I've been into cuckold porn and fanfics for a good while now, I'd say 2 years. I'd say it started somewhere in the middle of the relationship with my now ex-girlfriend (who I still occasionaly talk to as friends) about 2-3ish years ago   

Ofcourse I've never told anyone but she had a guy best friend and I always came to the idea of her just beeing plowed by him while I could watch, jerking off.  

Ofcourse I'd still love to fuck her myself ofcourse, but sadly we never got any further then making out and curiously fondling each other's privates. I'm still a virgin to this day unfortunately...  

So over the years I've been somewhat into cuck porn itself but last week I stumbled upon a erotic fanfic of a fandom I am in involving cuckolding and my hornyness is into overdrive right now (I've just went to the bathroom at my internship to rub one out half an hour ago and just by typing up this post I can feel myself getting rock hard again).  

It involved a former enemy coming back as a friendly this time, basically stealing the wife away from the prince.   

The thing that did it for me was the way the author described everything, from the chasity, to the musky damp smell to the way the characters came, the impregnation, his wifes own juices running down her thighs onto the cucks face beneath him, our cuck getting to cum *once* after his chasity has been released  and last but not least: hearing them fuck outside of his own room.  

Oh, and the dominant bull ofcourse.  God I love a dominant bull.  

That story really did it for me and I'm so fucking horny the past few days and it sucks I'm single. I'd even love to try it out in the form of just watching a couple fuck or something.  

I fantisize alot about asking my ex if I can come watch when she's gonna have sex with her next bestfriend (but ofcourse I don't wanna be a creep so I'll refrain).

Anyways, that was my contribution to this community.  

Very open to discussion in the comments!"

I was wondering if anyone had any specific tips for preparation and if anyone has interviewed for this position as well (or other Technical Writing positions at Google).  I have been trying to find more information online but most interview prep seems to be aimed at software engineering roles. If anyone has any resources or experiences that they would be willing to share, I would appreciate it. "

HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS meets THE FILL IN BOYFRIEND in this YA romantic comedy titled CHASING STARS. This manuscript is complete at 65,000 words.

The summer after she graduates from high school, Ada Datchery lands her dream internship, working as a celebrity photographer for the most prestigious agency in New York City. Ada is determined to do whatever it takes to make sure that internship turns into a permanent job offer. But with only one position up for grabs, Ada will have to go head-to-head against the other interns vying for the same position.

When Ada gets into an altercation with Liam Adams‚ÄîHollywood's hottest teen celebrity with a penchant for antagonizing the paparazzi‚Äîshe finds herself not the photographer, but the star of the latest tabloid scandal.

As the rumors of an unlikely romance blossoming between these two sworn enemies give an unexpected boost to not only Ada's career but Liam's as well, they decide there's no harm in faking a relationship for the cameras. But with the line between what's real and what's pretend beginning to blur, will Ada be able to make her dreams come true without getting her heart broken in the process?

&amp;nbsp;

**A little background info:**
I graduated from college with a bachelors in Interdisciplinary Studies focusing on Engineering Management and Business Administration. The last semester of college I had an internship for a Fortune 500 company as a Project Manager at their IT headquarters, in which I managed my own projects throughout their respective lifecycle. At the end of the internship I was approached with an offer to stay on as an Associate PM. I continued to manage all of my own projects throughout their SDLC, and occasionally picked up projects from other PM's hat were handling too much or were let go. During this time I also on-boarded new PM's in regards to the company's process, tools, and SDLC. 

&amp;nbsp;

I continued working for the company for close to two years, before deciding I wanted to take some time (had maintained a job from age of 16-24) and travel the world. Towards the last 6 months of my employment, all the PMs were asked to attend a two day Scrum bootcamp. I grew very interested in Scrum and began assisting a senior PM in one of his projects.

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Pursuit:**

In all I have spent the last 1.5 years traveling, and am looking to get back into a career. My interest in Agile has not swayed, and have continued learning the subject during this time. Last week I completed the PSM 1 certificate and am actively looking for an entry level Scrum Master position. I know experience is worth more than certificates but I figured the PSM would be helpful in my quest.

&amp;nbsp;

Where I am currently located, near Los Angeles County, I do not seem to find many Scrum Master openings and have only seen 2 or maybe 3 Junior Scrum Master openings. I know others have mentioned finding a Business Analyst or PM position, and then transitioning to Scrum if the company practices it. I have also thought of reaching out to companies to see if they would be open to me shadowing their Scrum teams so I can gather some more experience and feel more confident in practicing Scrum. I have reached out to some that I have applied for, but my problem is I don't know how to search for companies that practice Scrum or perhaps may be interested in this.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

Left a good role and company to travel the world after being burned out from working past 8 years. Done traveling and want to transition into becoming a Scrum Master. I have a little bit of experience practicing Scrum, and have completed the PSM1 but would love advice on how to break into the field.

In short, my ex and I were together for nearly 9 years and fully intended it to be a lifelong thing. It was, as far as I could tell, a very happy and healthy relationship. We were recently long distance as he had moved to a new city for work. I was doing an internship and then planning to come work in his new city, where we were going to build our life together. 

He broke up with me in November and told me that he ‚Äújust wasn‚Äôt happy‚Äù. During the conversation he told me he had been having an emotional affair. He ended up having sex with her the very next day and he continued his relationship with her for about two months post-breakup. He says he has now ended things with her. He met her at work and they still work together. He also told me he had had a sort of emotional affair once before in our relationship (maybe more of a mutual crush?), years prior, but that when the girl initiated a conversation about where things could go between them he told her he loved me and it had to stop. He said it never went beyond that and his feelings for her went away. He‚Äôs still friends with that girl. He didn‚Äôt tell me about that until our breakup. 

Last week he came to my city and asked if we could work on it. I told him I‚Äôd think about it and I have been, and that‚Äôs how I have ended up here. I‚Äôd love some insight into whether to work on it and how. 

He seems genuinely remorseful. He suggested couple‚Äôs counselling, which I think makes sense. He also told me he would be willing to try to leave his job in his current city after I told him I would never, ever, ever move there. He said he‚Äôd move to the city I am living in, which is where I decided to stay after he broke up with me. But I don‚Äôt know how long it will take for him to be able to do that. 

I feel like I have a list of practical reasons ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù that‚Äôs like a mile long, but for some reason I still really want to try. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt really know what to do.

It‚Äôs Monday through Friday but I decided that instead of leaving my old job (server) that I would work the office job Monday through Friday and work two double shifts at the restaurant Saturday and Sunday.  This week was the first week I worked both jobs. 

Saturday I work 11am-1am: 14 hours. Then I work another 11-am-1am shift on Sunday. 

Sunday, at work, I get triple sat in my section and two of my tables walk out because I took too long to bring their drinks. My manager has to comp $70 of food and drink that they ordered without paying. I break down crying in front of the whole restaurant because I consider myself a good server and this is a harsh slap to my face.

I‚Äôm still sad and stressed and lack sleep from Sunday and I go into the office Monday morning and I freak out and tell my coworkers that I think I‚Äôll be fired in a few weeks because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to learn the job properly. Everyone tells me to shut up and that I‚Äôm stressing everyone out. And it‚Äôs only my second week

I‚Äôm fucking up both jobs in my life. How do I stop before it gets any worse????"
as4618,36,2019-02-18,[22M] I've been alone my whole life. What can I do?,lunarmagic0,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/as4618/22m_ive_been_alone_my_whole_life_what_can_i_do/,"tldr; Never had a girlfriend, I'm lonely, what do I do about it?

My parents are immigrants (we are of Chinese background) and we live in Ontario, Canada. They worked hard, but I grew up isolated as my parents worked and left me alone. I would go to school, then come home and play with toys and video games. I had poor social skills and I went through most of high school without any close friends. Things got better as I made some friends in my first year of university, though it was slow and accidental - I don't do any social hobbies or clubs. I switch between school and internships every 4 months, and so over the past 4.5 years I've moved back and forth between various cities in Canada and the US, uprooting myself and experience new things over and over again. I practiced making new friends and in my last internship in Boston I managed to make a lot of friends. Particularly I worked on talking to women and now half my friends are female. I've worked out twice a week for the past year. Lost some weight and now I'm 165 lbs (my height is 5'9).

Now I'm age 22, in university, and about to graduate. I took a job offer for $8000/month in Boston and I'll be moving there in July. I've worked there before and enjoyed it, and there's a good work/life balance. Thanks to the jobs I had (and Canada's cheap tuition) I have no debt.

Now, what I want more than anything is to have a girlfriend (and afterwards sex would be nice, I guess). I've never had a girlfriend, or even so much as a girl liking me, and I feel like I am missing out on affection and the experiences that other people in their early 20's have. (though to clarify I have no desire to hook up, it's a relationship that I want). It's affecting my self worth. When I'm alone in my room, once in a while the feeling of being unloveable and the fear of never being loved hit me like a brick wall and I start crying.

When I get a crush on a girl and I've talked to her a few times, I do ask her out, even if I do it kinda awkwardly. But now I've asked 12 girls and I've only gotten a no. The times that I don't say it's a date at first I can get them to hang out with me, but when I eventually bring it up they just want to be friends - which I'm actually ok with once I get over my feelings. Well, if I had it my way I would already be in a relationship so I'd be happy that many of the girls I meet want to be just friends with me. I tried online dating and got a date out of it after a month, but I hated the process and I didn't match with girls that I liked, and the girls put minimal effort into our conversations. I'm not exactly sure what I want from a partner since I never had one, but my friends don't think my standards are too high. I tell my friends and therapist about this and they're very understanding as to why I haven't found anyone, but it still sucks when I'm lonely. As to why this came to be, the reasons are fairly obvious - I'm introverted, not conventionally attractive, my lifestyle involves having little time between school/work, moving to a different city twice a year, and I'm a computer science major in a STEM focused school so I'm mostly around guys.

I don't want to try to someone again until I move and get settled in, so the next 5 months I'm devoting to self improvement. I'll keep working out, but I think I have to practice putting myself out there. My new goals are to become more outgoing and take up some social activities. To become more outgoing I'm going to practice talking to strangers while I'm in school, and once I move I'll start doing this with girls I am potentially interested in so that I can ask out girls more often (maybe going from asking out someone 4 times a year to once a week). For social activities, I don't like bars, parties or nightclubs (I'm a straight laced dude). What I had in mind were things like volunteering, social physical activities (like rock climbing and running), and being in a church community. These are things that I've tried but once I move to Boston I'll commit to some of them. I have fun playing board games and video games socially but it's a really male crowd. Also open to more suggestions.

Do you think I'm on the right path? Any suggestions for a guy in my situation? Thanks."
as4hwq,4,2019-02-18,My GF [18F] and I [18M] have had a rough past. Did I do the right thing getting back with her?,Raptor22482,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/as4hwq/my_gf_18f_and_i_18m_have_had_a_rough_past_did_i/,"Hey Reddit, I still feel a little weird posting this online, but please forgive me for my poor writing skills. I‚Äôm trying to include as much backstory as I can to give the full image.

B and I had been dating since September of 2016, when we were both starting Junior year in high school. She had liked me since November of the previous year, but I was in another relationship. We still talked but I made sure that she knew we were friends until the summer of 2016 when my last relationship had ended. At that point I needed some time to figure out how to be on my own before getting into another relationship, plus I didn‚Äôt just want to hurt my ex by immediately moving on to someone else. (I‚Äôve tried, and mostly succeeded to maintain a good friendship with exes because they were still supportive but in agreement that we wouldn‚Äôt be getting back together). B and I start our relationship at the end of August 2016. September of 2016 breezes by, and so do the following months. We began to get more intimate with each other and were super clingy with each other. We both enjoyed physical affection like hugging, kissing, cuddling, etc. I would usually get to school in the mornings, and I‚Äôd wait for her, then we‚Äôd walk to her locker and back into the main hall where everyone congregated before homeroom as we had most of our friend groups out there. We were both extremely happy and it felt like the honeymoon phase lasted ages. It lasted longer than it had for any relationships that either of us have had, but also the feelings were much stronger. I grew close with her family too, to the point that they eventually called me family. Everything was going really well until May 2017.

My school was doing a blood drive, so she and I decided to schedule around the same time, she was set 15 minutes ahead of my appointment. We‚Äôre getting our blood drawn in the same room of the school, but she had finished a few minutes before me. When she was finished, she went to sit down. Once she thought she was fine, she tried to get up but passed out, fell on the floor, and hit her head pretty hard. Fast forward a few months and she‚Äôs going to therapy for the concussion as she had frequent migraines and dizziness. She also had trouble keeping her balance. After the concussion, she started to change.

We‚Äôre about halfway through the summer of 2017 and I noticed that she‚Äôs begun to act differently. She was getting distant, and didn‚Äôt seem like her happy, bubbly self. I didn‚Äôt think much of it because she‚Äôd go through those phases for a few days in the past, but none of them lasted this long. This is also when she started sharing less of her thoughts and feelings about anything in general, including our relationship. Senior year starts and I was still a little worried about her. At this point I was going to school every other day as I alternated between school and an internship. She starts talking about this guy in her photography class, let‚Äôs call him J.

J seemed like just a friend but a few weeks into the school year, they‚Äôre constantly snapchatting. I went to go see a play with her, and she was on her phone, texting J the entire time. I asked her if she‚Äôd put her phone away and watch the play, but she told me to mind my own business and continued to text him for the duration of the play. I started to get a little nervous as the photography class she had with him was on the days that I was working. When I asked what was going on with them, she swore the relationship was purely platonic. November comes around and we go to Thanksgiving at my great aunts, where she meets my cousin, M (more on him later).

Towards the end of November, she tells me that she isn‚Äôt as happy. She said she didn‚Äôt think it was my fault, but she just wasn‚Äôt as happy as she used to be. This confirmed what I was thinking towards the end of the summer, but it sent me into panic mode. (I was told before that I wasn‚Äôt good enough for multiple people. Yes, they were high school relationships, but those word still stuck with me. I‚Äôm an overweight computer geek and most people at that time couldn‚Äôt get around my looks, and neither could I) I started to think that I was the cause, despite her not clearly saying that, but I was also worried because she and J were still getting closer at an alarming rate.

At some point between these two events, she said she wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to be in a relationship with me. A few days later, she said she made her decision, but wouldn‚Äôt tell me what it was. I‚Äôm normally a pessimistic person, but for some reason, this situation was enough for me to start hoping that she would stay and tough it out. She started getting distant and that didn‚Äôt help my positive thinking.

I don‚Äôt remember which one happened first, but I remember sitting with her both times watching something on her phone and there were two texts that came in from him that started to make me more nervous. The first one was ‚ÄúHey babe‚Äù. She brushed that one off saying something along the lines of ‚Äúhe just gets that way when he‚Äôs having trouble, and it makes him feel better‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt really believe that, but I was so worried about losing her that I didn‚Äôt object. I was so worried about losing her because in my eyes, she was the best I could get, and I didn‚Äôt want to let go. The next message was ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. This one I was conflicted over because I know she says that to people she is close with, in a non-relationship tone, but I wasn‚Äôt sure because of the way she was acting with J.

Towards the end of December, she said that she almost wanted to put our relationship on hold. She didn‚Äôt want to have any physical contact and told me to stop walking her to her locker in the morning. She distanced herself from me during the time before homeroom, but J always sat next to her and kept talking with her.

I spend New Years Eve at her house, and end up staying the night, but sleeping on the couch on the other side of the house as her parents didn‚Äôt want us anywhere near each other. New Year‚Äôs Day 2018, I get up and go home, but now my mind was racing for some reason, and my positivity fell apart. I sucked it up and texted her to confront her about the situation with J and my thoughts about it. And that was it.

She told me that we wouldn‚Äôt work, and that if I couldn‚Äôt trust her, then we shouldn‚Äôt be together. The relationship felt like a burden to her because of me being obsessed with her and J talking.

She said that we could act like a couple for the following weeks until we both got used to it, and me being me, I took the bait, and we did. Neither of us told our parents, and she didn‚Äôt tell her friends or siblings. During this time, she and I went with my cousin, M, to see a movie. After two and a half weeks, we cut the act and told everyone. Enter T.

T was a friend of mine for Sophomore and the first half of Junior year, as during the second half, he had spread rumors that I had an STD and gave it to my now ex in the bathroom of our HS during homecoming, and he had to drive her to the hospital because of it. That is how he lost both my and her trust. But he somehow became friends with her while the whole situation with J was going on.

Also enter G. G was a kid who claimed to be gay but would always hang around girls and see if he could get something out of the friendship, or even turn into friends w/ benefits.

Once T knew about the breakup, he immediately became close with my ex. They were talking constantly and now she was surrounded by T and J before homeroom. I was kind of pushed away by them, so I was in a nearby friend group of mine, still in the main hallway. She seemed to be getting over the breakup much better than I was, but I assumed it was because of her head start, during the time between when she made her decision, and when she finally told me.

We grew closer and distant multiple times throughout this period.

This pattern continued until my parents (also friends with my ex on FB) saw a very vague post she made about someone lying to her and how it was such an important detail that she could never trust the person again. If it wasn‚Äôt for the wording, I never would‚Äôve guessed it was about me, but T also called me to tip me off that she was mad at me for something. Once again, oblivious to what was happening, I texted her and asked her. Her responses were very short, and she used punctuation every time, which she doesn‚Äôt do normally unless she‚Äôs pissed. We eventually called and she was angry over the phone, saying things like ‚Äúhow could you lie to me? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me this? This wouldn‚Äôt have been a big issue if you told me in the first place, but now I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to trust you again. Our friendship is over, we‚Äôll never be friends again.‚Äù Then she hung up. I was devastated. This was the girl I spend almost all of my free time with. I ended up spending less time with my friends, and through that pushed them away. I had nobody to fall back on but my parents, who I didn‚Äôt want to go to as I knew they wouldn‚Äôt be much help in this situation.

I end up calling the ex, let‚Äôs call her N, that I had broken up with prior to this relationship, and she was extremely comforting. Please let me reiterate, she had a boyfriend, and neither of us was looking to get together. She was there for me while I tried to get my friend group back. We would sometimes talk on the phone if I was crying too much to text, but she also was there to cheer me up. She‚Äôd send me jokes, memes, cat pictures, puns, you name it, and it really did help.

While N was helping me get back on my feet, another friend texted me saying she might know what B was so mad about. She said it was that I lied about who I lost my virginity to. I lost my virginity to N, and that‚Äôs what I had told B when we started our relationship. I later found out that four people (All of which were close friends of T) had said that I bragged freshman year about losing it to someone else. I had confronted B and she said it didn‚Äôt matter as she already had no trust for me, so I got my ex, N, to text her and tell her that she was the one I lost my virginity to. What ended up happening is that N was put into a group chat with B and T. T was constantly shit-talking me to B, in said chat, in an attempt to push her further away from me on the grounds that I was a toxic person. N told B, as to which she replied that she believed her, but B would still not talk to me. At this point, she wouldn‚Äôt even look at me before homeroom

At this point, T was very close with her. All three of us were out in the main hall before homeroom and shared an English period. During which, he made a point to hold her hand or touch her shoulder, or somehow make contact with B whenever I was around. He‚Äôd be sure to make eye contact with me whenever he could.

I tried my best to just ignore that situation, but sometimes it still got in my head. Meanwhile, I had gotten a text from my other cousin, M‚Äôs sister, saying that he and Brittany were hanging out alone, watching a movie. (M is 23, single, and socially awkward. He was known to blow stories out of proportion and lie whenever he could to get an extra reaction out of the stories he has told. This is the view that a majority of my family shares of him. He had a traumatic childhood but finds a way to claim every issue he‚Äôs had, stems from the childhood issues.) I find out that M and B were going to see movies together, and occasionally hang out at his apartment. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what to think given M said that she was not his type and that things would never happen, but then I heard from his sister that he was saying things about me to our family.

One of the things was that she broke up with me because I didn‚Äôt give her enough attention. Another was that I used her for sex. If these rumors were said to friends, I wouldn‚Äôt have cared, but these were said to family. Mainly great aunts and grandparents. I was fuming. Both of the situations with M and T continue until a week or two before graduation. B starts talking to me again and got in a huge fight with M over him blowing things out of proportion, and he was out of the picture for a month or so. T was having his own crisis, so he didn‚Äôt talk to B much either. She also started pushing out people in her life that caused drama or stress. While doing so, we grew closer again, and she had walked back her statement about not becoming friends for years to come.

During this time, I had begun looking for other people to talk to, in hopes of starting a relationship, but I also hoped that I‚Äôd one day get back together with her. Everything was going so well in the first part, and I was hoping that all the drama in the past few months was just from her being stressed.

We graduate, and now we‚Äôre talking once or twice a week for a few hours at a time. M wiggles his way back into her life, playing the victim of everything as that was her soft spot (She wore her heart on her shoulder and offered it to anyone who was in need. I must give her credit for doing that, but it took a toll on her and I, along with her family, could see that clearly). I wasn‚Äôt as worried about M for the time being as they just started talking again, but now B told me that M had asked her out, and threw a fit when B said no.

I was a little taken back by this, for one because of what he told me previously, and two the age difference. I realize that it is not that large, but he swore to never date anyone two years younger than him. After I thought it through, I dismissed it, but then she said it happened again. I was a little upset but didn‚Äôt let it get to me.

I had a few summer parties with friends, and she was invited too, along with N. They got along and I was glad to see that, but some of my other friends looked at me funny for inviting B in the first place. I told them that I was too kind, and that I also still wanted her back.

August 2018 rolls around and I start thinking about what it was like when we first got together. I started to really get feelings for her. We went out that night for dinner, and afterwards we sat in the parking lot of a small park. We sat in silence until I worked up the courage to tell her that I still had feelings for her. She said she knew, and she said that she wanted to try again too, but she wasn‚Äôt sure yet. We stayed friends and had similar talks in the months leading up to December.

December 2nd rolls around and we‚Äôre just driving around with no place in particular to go. We both had fun with that, and it gave us time to talk in private. (It was cold outside, and she shares a small house with 4 other siblings and her parents.) We talked about getting back together and she was scared that she would hurt me again. She told me that she had spent nights crying after we broke up because she was so upset over what she‚Äôd done. She said she was sorry, but that she did those things to hurt me in hopes that it would push me to the point that we‚Äôd break up. I was a little confused as most of the drama happened after we broke up, but I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to that. At this point, I just wanted to be with her again and have a fresh start.

We get to her house, and we got out of my car to sit on the front step. It was like one of those movie scenes. It was raining, dark out, and my car was quietly running in the background. We were both sitting there. She didn‚Äôt know what she wanted to do and she got a little mad at herself and started yelling that she didn‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt want to push it, but I was a little upset too. I said nothing, got up, got in my car, and drove off. I got maybe halfway down her street and I turned around. I came back, parked, and ran up to her. At this point she was in the fetal position, silently crying to herself. I sat there and I held her like I used to when she was upset. She leaned into it and I could still hear her sobbing. We sat there like that for 5 minutes before she mumbled ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it. I want to try again.‚Äù At this point, that was the last thing I expected to hear. I came back because I just couldn‚Äôt leave her like that, but I had given up on trying to get with her. The car ride was my Hail Mary, and I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt try again. When she said that, I asked if she was sure and she said yes.

We‚Äôve been together ever since, but there are still a few things that I don‚Äôt know how to deal with, which is why I‚Äôm posting here, but here were a few things I wanted to reflect on before I ask for guidance.

When we had broken up, I had blamed myself for the breakup. I didn‚Äôt see any other reason why she‚Äôd want to push me away and hurt me the way she did.

When we got back together, the past would sometimes be brought up, and I‚Äôd remind her of what had happened, and she says that she doesn‚Äôt remember half of that happening.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, these were the things I was hoping you all could help me with:

\- My confidence in being a worthy partner is gone and I haven‚Äôt found a way to get it back. How has anyone here done so?

\- I had minor trust issues before the relationship with B but after what had happened, its almost completely gone. How would I go about getting my trust back for her? Is it even worth it?

\- She claimed that she didn‚Äôt remember what she did. I brushed it off on the notion of her concussion causing damage to her memory. Do you believe her or why don‚Äôt you?

\- Should I not have gotten back with her?

\- Any other advice is appreciated. I thought I could figure this out on my own, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure where to go from here.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR ‚Äì My ex had hurt me in our last relationship, gone with the drama against me, and damaged my trust and confidence as a partner. I‚Äôm back with her now, but I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with the emotions/trust issues.

P.S. Sorry for the novel, if you think there is anything I should remove because its irrelevant, please let me know. Likewise for if there is any information that I left out and should be added."

https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/aqe73k/are_you_ready_for_the_ultimate_blackpillsuifuel/

Over the weekend, Chad roommate (CR) invited me to his friend's get together and he and I and 3 girls he had clearly invited to try to bang ended up talking over dinner. One of them, IG, is from my previous story. She was completely drunk, and I mean almost sloppy. She could barely finish conversations and if she wasn't a girl would've been kicked out for basically trying to molest Chad. And no, she wasn't wearing a bra or underwear to try to get lucky. Pity her future husband.

While I didn't get a chance to talk to the 3rd girl, #2, another Indian chick was interesting. She apparently was visiting from India, so not even an Indian-American, but she decided that before her internship was up, she would get laid by as many white guys as she could. Not something she could do back home and she has appearances to keep.

So gentlemen, is this genetic? White washing from Hollywood culture? Why are women who aren't even from the US raised to crave white dick so badly? What does that leave for the rest of us? 

And the sad part is that this girl was a 9/10 bombshell. She would have any Indian superstar she wanted back home. But no, she needs to come all the way here and make it a plan to get laid by an American guy. Because apparently she's still a good girl back home. This sucks. I ended up chickening out and calling it an early night with some excuse about a headache. I couldn't deal with them basically slobbering over him while politely ignoring me. "

**EDIT:** Thank you to whoever gave me that Platinum award. Don't know what to do with it really so I guess I'll celebrate with a Taco Tuesday date with the Latina chick I'm seeing? Lol.

**EDIT EDIT:** I'm not totally against college. Use the GI Bill to it's full potential but I'm saying that if you don't think you need to head to college then don't jump on the bandwagon for the sake of it.

I got out at the beginning of 2018, thinking that I had everything in order. I had been in touch with a small concierge security company that had promised to take a look at my resume thanks to being persistent with editing their training course syllabuses. But when they never replied to my numerous attempts to contact them, I soon found myself like any other typical veteran out there: lost and trying to fill that void that was once my task and purpose, and felt cheated by an empty promise that the grass was always greener on the other side.

Like many level-headed squared away Marines, I could've stayed in and it was definitely foolish of me to leave: I had just returned from going TAD with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency as a team linguist, a billet where the augment managers were pleading and begging me to stay because they badly needed translators for every mission. Looking back, I should've stayed because I honestly felt that in the long run that would've been my calling.

Back on the garrison side of things, I was a Sergeant that was in an Airwing unit in Miramar that was about to reinstate BAH for its NCO's again, and I had a solid reputation overall in and out of work with just about everybody I came across.

But with the Marines United situation, the typical military BS, Terminal Lance mentality, and not wanting to get HSST'ed into becoming a DI or Recruiter had me packing my bags despite the fact that I found what could have been a reenlistment incentive.

Because I really had no contingency at the time, I lived in a pretty sorry state. While I had gotten myself into a cybersecurity veterans program which would've helped to get me certified in any CompTia cert of my choosing, I was living the life of someone without a purpose.

Was I depressed?

Probably but can't say much but think of my life at this point like a veteran's music video for Gary Jules' Mad World.

Asides from leaving the home to go to VA appointments and the occasional shopping trip, I was holed up in a crappy house that was cheap rent, but I hated myself because it was a house with a passive aggressive Asian grandma, couldn't have guests over, and let's face it, the house was straight out of the 80's with dirty carpets, filthy toilets, and an equally passive-aggressive landlord who gave zero fucks about the house.

Why didn't you go to college u/superdduper93 you would ask?

Honestly, I didn't find myself desiring to go to college having enlisted at the age of 20 after dropping out. It'd be a waste of money to sit through General Ed. classes with a bunch of Social Justice Warriors, getting a degree that meant nothing for the field I wanted to enter.

But what field did I want to enter?

I was lost, but I applied for every job under the moon that I thought matched my previous military qualifications. Admin, translating, editing, writing, etc.

Hell, I went as far as applying for work that I clearly wasn't qualified for like Social Engineering.

Slowly but surely, I began contemplating of going back in.

You guys would've seen my track record on Reddit, I was asking plenty of questions about going back in, really accepting the fact that I was going to have to deal with the Big Green Weenie regardless of my rank, and called up a Prior Service Recruiter.

In the meantime outside of the lack of work, I volunteered in a masculinity group, became a top writer on a question-and-answers site, made a cameo appearance on a Vice documentary, and was dating a pretty Filipino chick.

I went through the whole re-up process for the Active Reserve then turned it down when the monitor only offered Louisiana despite getting to retain the rank of Sergeant.

Once again, I felt lost near the end of 2018. It didn't help that I got broken up with by the Filipino chick in a slow fade breakup that was really my own doing due to the lack of direction I had in life while struggling with a PMO addiction.

After witnessing someone getting scammed really bad by an Indian scammer, I then realized that I wanted to become a Private Investigator in the aftermath when the local police and the FBI couldn't do jack to help the victim. Along with this, I developed a passion for financial freedom and the digital marketing field.

I became an unpaid apprentice under a prominent Private Investigator, polished up my resume (along with making different ones), then sent out applications to big private investigation firms.

While this was happening, my savings were dwindling and I was feeling more depressed than ever. This went throughout the end of 2018 all the way to the beginning of this year.

It was great training, but I felt that I still lacked a task and purpose and had to deal with what felt like constant rejection from the jobs I applied to.

After getting turned down for even a Background Investigator position, I saw a post on a YouTube channel Facebook group looking for a social media manager for a startup company that was about to launch. The guy that was holding the position wanted to find someone to fill the position fast on a trial basis and I sent him a message.

Within a day, I was interviewed over my background in personal branding and writing, then got a phone call from the founder of the startup company himself the following day.

The quick phone call with the founder resulted in me sending a portfolio of my Top Writer stuff, thinking nothing was to come of it because I didn't really have social media management experience contrary to what I said. Hey, fake it till you make it right?

Yesterday, after spending almost 13 months unemployed, I got a message from the previous social media manager that I was to be taken onboard and will be receiving the official call from the CEO of the company which I got today.

Tomorrow I begin my internship in the startup company with the hopes of becoming a full-fledged member as their social media manager, complete with competitive pay/benefits if I become fully employed under them.

It pays well at $32 an hour (and no, **they didn't give one bit about me not having a college degree despite listing a Marketing Degree as a prerequisite**), travel reimbursed, and they seem to like me from my writing.

Lifewise, I'm partaking actively in the veteran community in Southern California, live in a better house on the other side of town although I plan to move to another place very soon, and currently dating a hot Latina.

Ladies and Gentlemen, the grass is definitely greener on the other side for sure, but let me end with the following advice:

**If You Genuinely Love Your Job or Found a Passion in the Marines, then stay in:**

If you speak a second language like me and got the opportunity to do meaningful deployments or missions outside of conventional Marine Corps realm, or you absolutely love your job whatever it may be, or because you just love being a Marine in general, then stay in.

Honestly, the Corps needs those that genuinely love their jobs and not the motards that can't do it but pull the Oorah Marine Corps card to cover it up.

The pay might be crap compared to civvie street but at the very least, you're doing something that's absolutely meaningful to you that you simply can't do in the outside world. Who else can make a cameo appearance in a movie like *The Lucky One* or *Top Gun 2*?

Or who else would be able to travel the world on the dime of the Corps (screw DTS though)?

Stay in if you're willing to be the change and for your personal cause.

**If one Enlistment (or two or more) is enough, then make sure you actually start planning at least two years out:**

Find out what your true passion is in life. Do you want to become an FBI agent? Then the stereotypical veteran route of using the GI Bill to go to school to get a degree would be absolutely helpful. Want to jump into doing things like cybersecurity penetration testing? There is a cybersecurity program out there for veterans that allow you to sign up while you're still on active duty.

Make a list of jobs you know you will love, along with having a contingency plan. What happens if you keep getting turned down for that cybersecurity engineer job? What happens if you realized on Terminal Leave that you really liked the Corps?

What will your schedule look like now that you don't have to wake up at 0darkwhatever to PT and not know when you will ever leave?

The better you plan, the better your post-EAS experience will be.

You sure can just use the GI Bill right off the bat to go to school but is that what you really want or are you following the bandwagon?

Everyone has a different path.

**Find something to legitimately do while on Terminal/post-EAS:**

This can be anything from actually trying to make new friends at a local Meetup, meeting other veterans that are also going through what you're going through or doing an activity like hiking or taking up a hobby.

Don't just sit on your ass, looking at the pictures of during your time in the Marines.

Don't let go of any fitness routines or good habits like making your bed after waking up.

If you had a passion like creating a Youtube channel or writing, pursue it to no end. Because having a portfolio of your passion is often times what gets you a job or becoming self-made instead of just a resume that states what you're proficient at.

**Use the lessons you've learned in the Marines to move forward in life:**

Can't say this enough and I'm sure everyone else sees it. You have an acquaintance or buddy you knew in the Marines that was always like, ""Screw the Marines, I hate every single one of you retards, and can't wait till I get out and go work at some obscure blue collar job where I make a ton of money!""

Then you see them at least two weeks post-EAS on social media, they already have a beer gut, a Marine Corps League piss cover a la Grunt Style apparel, posting about how much they miss their comrades in arms whom they ironically hated while in. Then they troll the closest Boot they find about the good ol' days when they were in (which was two months ago). These guys live like their life isn't as awesome as when they were in despite the fact that they complained the loudest.

Yes, I'm guilty of the occasional FB/IG post, but I certainly don't look like a typical veteran nor do I get super nostalgic like Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite.

Whatever you learned from the Marine Corps in terms of the good, like having discipline, being punctual, dressing well, knowing how to adapt, etc. use that to get to where you need to be.

**When the going gets rough, never forget where you came from**

It sounds motard as hell, but when I finally made the decision to get off my ass and build a better life for myself, I always repeated in my head the very last expectation phrase courtesy of the Senior Drill Instructor speech from Boot Camp:

*Never quit and never give up*

That phrase has helped me to stop feeling sorry for myself when I was borderline depressed/after getting rejected multiple times for jobs. It helped me to develop and feel confident once more like I was when I was still in, and it reminded me that even if I wasn't in, I still had a brotherhood to turn to in the roughest of times, and the best of times to share my success.

Yes, I hate the circus for everything it is, but I love the clowns to death.

This knowledge has prevented me from digger deeper beyond rock bottom along with contemplating of turning the gun on myself or jumping off Ocean Beach Pier in the middle of the night.

It's going to be rough, but you will be okay because you got a great support system.

Life isn't perfect no matter where you go, but use the most defining chapter of your life in the Marines to propel you forward wherever it takes you. Just wanted everyone to know that life doesn't end after you get your DD-214, but that it's a new chapter that's waiting to be written.

Have fun, be safe, and eat a crayon 'Rah?

&amp;nbsp;


Karen's love for spontaneity never fully left as she aged. Her and I have been friends since the 1st grade and it was like she was my other half. We both grew up in a rather to-do family, so to speak, and we both enjoyed everything that life threw at us. We eventually graduated top of our class in 2004 and spent the last ten years working on our degrees, Psychology for myself and Law for her. College was simple enough for two budding misfits. Sure, we went to parties and even with a shared apartment we rented together we still had time for ourselves and for dick when the time became available. We were like every other college kid at that time. Alcohol and sex were common even if it was casual and tame to most standards. Luck or fate may have had a hand in our ability to miss out on getting into serious trouble, though there were times where both of us could have potentially ruined any opportunity we would have later in life. Once residency for myself hit and she was working on hitting the bar exam, things seemed to go quiet as we were both highly focused on our pursuit for a degree and landing our dream jobs.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""How did your exam go?"" I asked as she threw her bag on the floor and made her way to the mini-bar pouring three fingers worth of tequila.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


With a quick gulp all three fingers worth were gone.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""If I never see pencil and paper again for the rest of my life, I will die a happy woman,"" she chuckled as she slumped into the couch next to me.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Was it really that bad,"" the concern surely emitted off my words.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Just long and boring. So much to cram into a few hours when you have been studying for a few months,"" she exhaled. ""After all this, we need to take a serious vacation or something,"" she enthusiastically exclaimed.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""My residency is up in three weeks at which time I should be doing my dissertation soon after. I promise, as soon as I get that finished, we will take an extended vacation to the Caribbean to relax and enjoy life,"" I reassured her as I wiped a wisp of hair out of her face.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Good! We both need it. I'm going to take a nap. Wake me for dinner. Anything you want is perfectly game for me,"" she slurred as she made her way upstairs to the bedroom.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Curling back up with my newest book, I switched my focus back to relaxing as this was my only day off this week. I planned to fully enjoy every minute of it and that entailed food, orgasms, sleep and most of all relaxation. A slight gasp of enjoyment escaped my lips as the thought ran through my mind as I turned my attention to the book in-front of me. A short lived second as the all too familiar hum of Karen's vibrator interrupted my thoughts. Knowing she was up there playing with herself always turned me on, even though I am completely straight and the simple fact Karen and I had never done anything, it still turned me on. The slight dampness that escaped between my lips and started to absorb into my panties gave tell to the simple fact, I needed to get off sooner rather than later.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Five weeks after that conversation, Karen passed her bar exam and started an internship at one of the top three law firms in the city. As for myself, well, you can just call me Doctor. Both Karen and I were beyond ecstatic at the news and we were going to hold true to our promise. For several nights following the news, Karen and I stayed up late searching for vacation packages and possible destinations in the Caribbean to fuel our need to relax and party. The only listing that caught our eye, was for a bungalow over the water in Belize. The promise of all-inclusive food and drinks at the resort with the bar within walking distance from the bungalow and the fact we would literally be sleeping in an air condition hut over the water, settled the decision quickly. We were heading to Belize for fun in the sun.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


The resort was the typical island resort with bountiful colors and vegetation surrounding the property. The bungalow featured two bedrooms each equipped with a double bed, tv and mini fridge. The main room had a small couch, tv and a big square glass window to view the ocean under the bungalow. It was small, quaint and perfect for the two of us to spend a week getting into trouble. The first half of the week we spent snorkeling the crystal clear blue waters checking out the coral and reef fish that inhabited the area. We consumed copious amounts of margaritas offered by the snorkeling boat crew and relaxed in the middle of the ocean while they tended to the other snorkelers.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""What's on the itinerary tonight girl,"" I casually nudged Karen as I caught her gawking at one of the guys who had just finished his dive. The sun gleamed off his soaking wet physique that exuded the fact that he had spent many hours in the gym.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Hopefully him, if I can catch him at the bar tonight,"" she playfully nudged me back not breaking contact of her gaze.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""You are such a perverted whore,"" I chided. ""Seriously, what are you doing tonight?"" I questioned.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Like I said babe, that man right there is on the menu. What about you, you can't tell me you haven't at least thought about getting some dick while we're here,"" she snickered.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Of course, but nothing has really caught my eye,"" I shrugged.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Bullshit! Let your inner whore out girl and lets slut it up tonight,"" she pounced as she rolled over me to get up and get another margarita.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Dinner was amazing, filled with lobster tail and filet mignon to your hearts content and plenty of the drinks of the day, which just so happen to be, Hurricanes. Karen had nursed her margaritas all day and decided to skip the drink at dinner to resume her consumption once more when we hit the poolside bar. Sporting her velvet red two-piece bikini with a sarong wrapped around her waist, she strutted her way to the bar. Every barstool contained a person sipping on their beer or fruity drink and left nothing but the lounge chairs by the fire pit open to seating. Sinking into the lounge chairs relieved the days wear and tear on the body and felt like a hundred pounds had been lifted off my shoulders.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Damn it feels good to kick back. How was dinner?"" Karen said as she leaned back exposing as much cleavage as she could muster.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Pretty tasty, but this right here is where it's at. A drink, lounged back and taking in the sites,"" I said as I surveyed the pool, bar and surrounding area for any eye candy.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Have you seen my after-dinner meal anywhere,"" Karen smirked.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Not yet, but let me know if you see dessert for myself. I'd much appreciate it,"" the words giggled off my tongue.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Seriously Alice, I really need to get laid,"" Karen exclaimed.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""I'm right there with you girl. Been way to long."" I pouted.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""How long has it been,"" she asked.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Since before the dissertation. I think about three weeks before that. I have been so busy prepping for that and what followed after, I've just not had any time,"" I reflected.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""And here I was bitching about it having it been over a week,"" she chuckled.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""We all know you're a tramp anyways,"" I said as I shot her a hilarious face.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Very funny you celibate old nanny. You probably wouldn't even know what to do with a cock if it was in front of you,"" she stuttered trying to contain the laugh that escaped her lungs.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Bet you'd love to know exactly what I would do with one if it was presented to me right now, wouldn't you, you pervert,"" I smirked as I took a sip of my drink.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Shut-up slut, there he is,"" she beamed as he walked from around the bar. ""How's my hair look, what about my tits? Are they pushed up enough?"" her voice on the verge of hysterics.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Walking around the bar in board shorts and sandals, stood six feet of lean muscle and ripped abs. His clean-shaven face presented a square jaw which framed a perfect mouth of straight bright teeth. His hair lay atop his head in slight curls from the pool water and he grasped a tumbler which accentuated the forearms full of muscle striations leading from his elbow to his hand. Karen always had impeccable taste in men, but this guy, no, he was a God amongst men. He made his way around the bar which was still full and not a single seat remained other than the two beside us.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""I think he is making his way over here,"" she frantically exclaimed.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""I know, it's the only seats available."" I straightened up as he walked nearer.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Excuse me ladies. Are those seats taken? It seems everyone had the same idea as us and there are no seats at the bar."" His deep voiced echoed off my ears.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Absolutely free for you sir. Grab a seat. The waitress should be right over,"" Karen politely informed while sideways glancing at me and giving a wink. ""This is Alice and I'm Karen. Pleased to meet you,"" she said as she extended her hand.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Pleasures all mine. Names Mark and it's a pleasure to meet both of you,"" his voice tugged at my entrance between my legs. I wasn't expecting his voice to cause my legs to tremble, but damn if his body and voice didn't do just that.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""What brings you to Belize, Mark?"" the ever so curious Karen asked.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Honestly, to just get away from it all. I lost a huge contract with a customer which was a boat load of stress only to turn around and sign a contract worth double what I had lost previous. My stress level was at max and I decided now would be the best time for a vacation. What about you ladies. Celebrating anything or just taking time away from life,"" his ears perked as he waited for our response.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Well, Alice, errrr I mean Dr. Alice over here just got the title and well, I signed onto a top three lawyer office back home. Sorry for the humble brags, but we are both really excited about our hard work finally paying off,"" Karen blushed as Mark's face beamed at what she had just said.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Mark turned in his chair, waved the waitress over and ordered a round for all three of us.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""This round is on me. Congrats you too. I couldn't imagine the years spent doing all that. I got lucky inheriting the family business so my accomplishment is nowhere near what you all have endured,"" he grinned.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Awww thanks doll, that's awful nice of you,"" her words cooed as she smiled.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Definitely appreciate the drink, Mark. That is very nice of you."" I said.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""My pleasure ladies. You all here by yourself or you have a group?"" he glanced around as he asked.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Just us two. Got here a few days ago and figured tonight we would relax and have a few drinks. What about you? You got a group hanging out?"" Karen, the curious, asked.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Just me. With my profession I can be spontaneous whereas most of my working buddies and friends can't be. Here until Saturday and then flight back to Texas,"" he replied.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Marks voice enthralled my pussy with every word that came out of his mouth and I know for sure Karen basically had a puddle under lounge chair while we sat and drank and talked. Conversation was easy between all three of us. Karen always had an innuendo to throw out when the time came and Mark reciprocated with a well-timed rebuttal to counter her.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Look I don't mean any offense, but are you two wife/wife or girlfriends,"" he coyly asked snapping me back to the present.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Oh, honey, we are just great friends. We have been friends since we were little kids. Both of us are single and straight, thank you very much,"" she snickered as she pointed her nose to the sky in a joking manner.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""My apologies, I really didn't mean to offend you, I was just curious,"" he sheepishly leaned back against his chair.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""You didn't offend us Mark and Karen here, is fucking with you. She has skin as thick as leather and likes messing with people."" I laughed.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Good! That makes me feel better. So, you all aren't an item? I would have thought you both were together,"" he stated.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Whatever gave you that idea,"" Karen quipped.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Just being straight forward here, but you both are super attractive and l figured you wouldn't be here alone, just the two of you,"" he stammered.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Nope, just friends on vacation,"" Karen giggled.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Have you all ever, you know, done anything together,"" Mark fidgeted with his thumb.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Actually, no we haven't."" I stated.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Let's change that,"" exclaimed Karen as she grabbed my hand and Marks and led us towards the bungalow.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Through the years that Karen and I have been friends, not once have I ever thought of her as more than a friend. Karen is super attractive with long legs, pert C-cup breast and a bubble ass that makes me jealous. I always thought she was the more attractive one and she definitely displayed herself more than I ever would. The thought of sharing a guy with her instantly soaked my bikini bottom and the fire that grew in the pit of my stomach was beyond anything I could ever imagine. I looked over at Mark beside me as we were led by Karen in front of us and I could see the sheer shock and anticipation swelling in his face. Opening the door to the bungalow, the cool air swept by us as it exited the room. Karen shoved us inside and closed the door behind us.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Alice, you sure?"" she looked at me meaningfully.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


All I could do is shake my head yes as I watched her undo the string to her top and let it glide to the floor. Looking over at Mark, his rock-hard cock protruding from his shorts didn't need an answer as he dropped his shorts exposing the most beautiful cock I have ever saw. With an almost cat like reflex, Karen rushed over to Mark and took his hard rock into her hand and stood on her tip toes allowing her breasts to cave into his chest as he opened his mouth to accept her tongue. Her hand slowly stroked his length while they passionately embraced each other, all the while his hands moved over her shoulders, down her back and with a bit of force to lift her feet off the ground, he cupped her ass and pulled her closer to him. Pulling my tank over my head and undoing my top, I let my breast hang out in full view of them both.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""God Alice you have a nice set of tits,"" Mark exclaimed.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""I don't think I've ever paid much attention till now on how beautiful you are,"" Karen swooned.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Karen reached out and grabbed my hand and dragged me closer to Mark and her. Feeling the heat radiating off them, sent a lightning streak of pleasure throughout my body. Mark reached around to the back of my head and drew me closer to his face. Opening my mouth, I accepted his tongue and felt his lips intertwine with mine. His kiss was sensual, soft but stern and strong. The lust coursed through my veins and my wetness was amplified by Karen's tongue now flicking circles around my nipple. Withdrawing his mouth from mine, I felt Karen pull me closer to her face. Her mouth opened and accepted my tongue as our lips touched. This was the first time Karen and I had done anything like this and my first time with another woman. Mark must have found our kiss sexy for his cock now throbbed against my hip and his hips swayed back and forth under Karen's grip. 


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Releasing her lips from mine and withdrawing her tongue from my mouth, she grabbed my hand and led us to the bedroom. Once inside she grabbed Mark and swung him around so his back was facing the bed. With a quick shove, Mark landed on the bed, face up and his rock-hard cock throbbed in front of us. Without hesitation, she knelt before him and took his whole length in her hands. Using both hands, she stroked his entire length softly allowing her fingers to caress and linger at the head of his cock. Mesmerized at the sight before me, I could feel my essence run down the side of my leg as the adrenaline coursed through me from watching Karen open her mouth and engulf Mark completely in her mouth. Her tongue circled around the tip as her hands twisted around the shaft of his beautiful rock before she stroked downward and his rock disappeared to the back of her throat. Not able to stand another second, I climbed on top of Mark and straddled his face, allowing his mouth to suck the essence I had been leaking out from the lustful sight I had watched. Marks tongue found the groove between my lips and strained against my clit as he tongued my gash. 


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


The feeling of wet silk sliding between my legs ignited the heat in my stomach and built the more he tongued my entrance. From behind I felt Karen's hands reach around and grab hold of my breasts and pull me close so I could feel hers rub against my back. She had no doubt climbed on top of Mark and was riding his cock for all it was worth from the motion of her tits against my back. Her hands were soft and her fingers circled around my nipples which were fully erect from the pleasure between my legs. Mark had thrust his tongue deep inside me and his breathes became shallow as he grunted his cock deep into Karen while she expertly rode him. Releasing his mouth from below I stood up and turned around so I could face Karen and once again straddled his face. I grabbed Karen by the back of the head and forced my tongue between her lips. I wanted her more than I have wanted anyone. 


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Karen bounced on that fat cock while I grinded my pussy on Marks face and allowed his tongue to swap from the bud of my ass to my clit. His thrust became shallow and his hands grasped my legs hard as Karen neared climax. Her shallow exhales through her nose swelled to an all-out scream as her orgasm rippled throughout her body and escaped through her mouth into mine as I slowly kissed her. Mark grunted and squirmed under me until he couldn't hold out any longer and shot his hot load deep in the pussy he was buried in. Karen squealed as his cum filled her up and sent another aftershock of orgasm coursing through her body. Karen lifted herself of his pulsating cock and laid on the bed beside him. I stood up as well to allow their orgasms to complete their course. Mark, instead, grabbed my hand and got up from laying down and bent me over the bed. 


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""You're not finished and neither am I,"" he exclaimed.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Pushing me from behind, I climbed on the bed and spread my legs to allow him to enter me. His glistening cock pushed past my lips and entered me till his nuts touched my clit. His length hurt, but felt amazing to have a man that deep inside me. His thrusts were forceful and his grip was going to leave bruises, but the sensation was beyond anything I've ever experienced and my climax wouldn't take long. Before I knew it, Karen slid underneath me and displayed her pussy to my face.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


""Lick me clean you dirty whore,"" she growled.


 

&amp;nbsp;

 


Lowering my head to her pussy, I plunged my tongue deep into the hole Mark had just filled. The mix of her juice and his cum stoked the fire in my stomach and like a ravaged animal, I buried my face between her legs lapping up every last bit of cum I could. Mark sensed my pleasure and my thirst for Karen's pussy which caused him to pick up speed on his thrusts. The length of his cock sliding in and out of my entrance and with my face between Karen's legs set off an explosion that rippled through my body like an earthquake. The sensation was intense and I could feel my orgasm cover Mark who was still thrusting deep inside me. Exhausted, both Mark and I slumped to the bed in a cum covered embrace with Karen underneath us. My thoughts slowly drifted off as we passed out from the pleasure."
as5td1,9,2019-02-18,How do I (22F) break up with my long term boyfriend (23M)?,silverose96,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/as5td1/how_do_i_22f_break_up_with_my_long_term_boyfriend/,"So for some back story, we have been together since the summer I graduated high school. We've had an overall okay relationship, but I just never felt like he was the one. I've come to realize the reason I stay with him is that he keeps me in my comfort zone and encourages my tendencies toward social isolation because of my social anxiety. He's slowly became the only person I talk to on a daily basis and I've lost a lot of contact with close friends over the period of our relationship which I sometimes feel like he encourages.

There's not a lot of negative things in our relationship and at one point we were really serious and moved in with each other and had plans to get married after I graduated college. I just honestly don't feel like I'm growing as a person with him because he keeps me comfortable and doesn't want me to change as a person because he likes who I am currently.  Which I don't think is much different from who I was when I was 18 and I don't want to be that same person.

I've talked to him about this several times and he always says he supports me and wants me to grow but then gets upset when I try to make new friends because I'm taking time away from us. I had a wonderful internship this summer (my major is wildlife biology) which taught me a lot and all he did was be upset all summer because I worked early hours and had to stay overnight 4 hours away from home a couple times. He was very determined I was cheating on him with my coworkers, which were literally just coworkers.

We've gotten over that but his self confidence is so low he thinks I would just leave him for anyone. I've tried encouraging him to go to college and find something he loves to do but he seems fine with have a part time job forever and sitting at home for the rest of the time. 

My plans for after college is temp jobs around the US so I'm not sure how we will do money wise. We had plans to travel together but now it just seems like a chore. Especially after this internship, I feel like our relationship will just crumble once I finally get the jobs I want. Because they also will be working long, unusual hours and have overnight stays with coworkers because of my major. 

At this point I want to just break it off before I graduate in December and get myself prepared for living by myself and traveling. I'm just not sure how to break it to him, that everything we've been working for I don't want anymore. Or at least I want it without him. 

We've lived together for several years so idk how to do this break up properly without him like freaking out on me. He has some anger issues so I'm worried on how he will take it. We have been together for 4 years and friends for longer. He is very determined that I am the only one for him and if he loses me it will literally be the end of a happy life for him and he won't find anyone else. Any advice for how to break up is appreciated.


TL:DR: I don't feel like I'm growing as a person in my current relationship and need advice on how to break up with my long term boyfriend when we live together, have long term plans built together, and he has some anger issues. "

So I got accepted for CS OOS but I still have a lot of questions about the program and school in general. So if you guys could answer one or a couple of the following questions I have, I would highly appreciate it!!

1. Are there specialization tracks I can pursue within the major? If so, what are they?
2. Are there any job/career fairs for CS students here?
3. Are silicon valley companies such as Google or Facebook recruiting here? If so, how often?
4. How is it getting CS internship opportunities here?
5. How are the classes (like are there a lot of weed-out classes and stuff)?

Thanks guys!!"
as5z4h,1,2019-02-18,I think I'm starting to develop a crush on a girl I met on Omegle. Is this bad?,throwaway5293873,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/as5z4h/i_think_im_starting_to_develop_a_crush_on_a_girl/,"\[18M\] I was feeling extremely lonely on NYE 2018, and decided to browse Omegle just to talk to someone (haha yes some people still use it). I met a really cute girl my age, with similar interests. We seemed to click instantly, but we were both pretty resilient to communicating with each other extensively. Yet, over time things started to gradually escalate and we both started sexting, with both of us asking that it's only a FWB relationship. This lasted for about 2 weeks over Snapchat and we didn't really do much else.

There was one time we were going to have Skype sex, but for some reason I just couldn't gushing over how cute she was. I don't know how to describe the feeling, but I could see that she was thinking the same, and we laughed at how ridiculous we were acting and put our clothes back on. We ended up chatting about the most random things for 6 hours that night.

And now, for almost 2 months, we have been chatting non-stop. We do a lot of stupid things like share new music, play PS4 online or binge-watch movies. These conversations will last for hours, and we both enjoy each other's company. There are some times where we won't talk at all, but will still call for us to both study or do homework silently with each other on a school night. I don't know why, but she makes me feel pretty happy and I assume it's because I'm crushing on her. Problem is, she goes to school in LA and I go to school in NY.

There's an internship opportunity that I can take with my uncle that lives in LA. There's a possibility that while I work with him, I can see her over the summer. But, the big question that keeps poking at me is, even if I spent the summer with her, what would happen next? Would I never see her again?

I'm afraid that this ""crush"" will develop into something more, that will eventually lead to heartbreak when potential circumstances that are not in my control interfere.

I really do think I'm starting to develop a crush on a girl I met on Omegle. Is this bad?"

&amp;#x200B;

i‚Äôm just going to keep this relatively short and sweet considering i‚Äôm currently on mobile and ya girl just wants to get this search thread out there! long story short - i just finished watching spiderman: into the spiderverse and im absolutely dying to do something spiderman/spiderverse related! more details later \^.\^ also, as just a heads up, i only type lower caps in ooc for the a e s t h e t i c. i am literate in the roleplay itself :)

&amp;#x200B;

**what to expect from me**

&amp;#x200B;

\- i won‚Äôt be returning to college until this fall so i‚Äôll be relatively active! i have a day job that fluctuates between part time and full time so all things considering i‚Äôll usually have multiple replies out within the week \^\^

&amp;#x200B;

\- i mirror posts !! i thoroughly believe in quality&gt;&gt;quantity and ifeel the more you try to force something out, the less fun a roleplay might become. so i‚Äôm totally cool with a flux of length and stuff. in general i write like 500+ words lmao :,)

&amp;#x200B;

\- i‚Äôm super into planning and brainstorming and getting excited about our roleplay! i‚Äôll totally make Pinterest boards and Spotify playlists once we get into it omg

&amp;#x200B;

\- the roleplay itself can take place just about anywhere! im fine with gdocs, email, pm, discord, etc etc. in terms of chatting and planning discord is far preferred but again I‚Äôm game for anything

&amp;#x200B;

**what i would like from you**

&amp;#x200B;

\- life totally happens, and i completely understand! i‚Äôm only really looking for at least one reply a week though more would be just fine with me lmao :) more than anything open communication on both sides is ideal!

&amp;#x200B;

\- while I mirror posts, i would appreciate if you were the type to mirror as well! writer‚Äôs voice, detail, inner dialouge, and the likes are things that I definitely enjoy :,) please 3rd person, past tense as well please!

&amp;#x200B;

\- i also enjoy a partner that puts equal energy into the roleplay. let‚Äôs get excited together! plan and plot together! let‚Äôs have a good time!

&amp;#x200B;

\- please be 18+!! main character must be 18+ as well!

&amp;#x200B;

**plotting and other shenanigans**

&amp;#x200B;

so! as a disclaimer! i‚Äôve only seen the andrew garfield spiderman movies and, more recently, i‚Äôve seen into the spiderverse! which i absolutely adored!! scratch that actually, i‚Äôm absolutely obsessed with it. but in no way does the setting have to be in those verses. tbh we could come up with our own verse with our own version of spiderman. in terms of plotting and stuff i don‚Äôt have much in terms of a heavy set plot! but i do know i‚Äôd very much enjoy for it to carry the elements of many good hero movies ‚Äî drama, action, angst, confusion, conflict, good feels, romance, and a melting pot of character/settings. i‚Äôm open for a peter parker x oc or oc x oc type of deal, with the pairing being m x f with myself taking the female role.

&amp;#x200B;

**some loose ideas!**

&amp;#x200B;

**idea one** actually loosely followed the plot of into the spider verse! essentially your character is one of the many spidey's in one of the many spidey-verses. in said universe, our two characters were adorable lovers, until my character's life is cut to an end. however, in a different verse, my character is the one that survives and yours is the one that perished. and, eventually, she ends up become the spider'woman' of that verse ‚Äî just as your character is sucked into her dimension.he finds her, ecstatic to see her living once again but, for a reason i haven't quite figured out yet, she can't remember him. in much like the movie, the two are paired up ‚Äî an experienced spiderman and a confused/beginner spiderwoman ‚Äîto try and take down the baddie and save the universe. we can totally involve lots of subplots and stuff, as well as lots of character/villain arcs! maybe as they grow closer bits and pieces of her memories of him come back? etce tc

&amp;#x200B;

**idea two** has nothing to do with 'verses' and moreso follows two best friends that recently graduated highschool and are doing an internship at a prestigious research facility. one of them decides that the day is much too boring for their taste and the two decide to push their luck by exploring an 'unused' part of the facility. where they both end up getting bitten by the spider(s). they both have to help eachother understand the meanings of their powers, how to use them in the first place, battle neighborhood crime, and eventually take on the big masked villains.

&amp;#x200B;

**idea three** is pretty much a peter parker x gwen stacy type of deal. or maybe even a spice of drama, peter parker x gwen x mj love triangle. peter and gwen ending up together would be the ideal situation."

No one is going to fucking believe you. Why would they? Why would your boss‚Äîa gorgeous, successful woman with a family at home, fuck a young, stupid little intern like you?

But she *did*.

You thought it was just a normal work trip. She asks interns and executive assistants to go along on things like this all the time‚Äîyou didn‚Äôt think it was weird. Not even when she brought you to a small island in the Caribbean. She‚Äôs an executive producer on a lot of different films‚Äîone could‚Äôve been filming there. Even when she just has you spend the day on the beach, lounging in the sun in a speedo she bought for you, you just think she‚Äôs being nice.

It‚Äôs when you wake up after dinner, groggy and impossibly aroused, the bitter taste of the drug she put in your drink lingering in your mouth, that you realize what‚Äôs happening.

There is something in your asshole.

It‚Äôs her fingers‚Äîfuck, it‚Äôs her entire *fist*‚Äîsquelching in and out of you as your cock drools on the sheets. You hear this distant sound of moaning, and you realize it‚Äôs *you*. ‚ÄúYou like that you fucking slut?‚Äù You hear her giggle, a thick, unmistakably large shaft brushing against your thigh. ‚ÄúYou want more?‚Äù

Kinks: anal, oral, pegging, futa, sugar mama‚Äôs, feminization, nipple play, transformation, fisting, big dicks, large insertions, cumflation, non con, dub con, forced bi, cheating, incest, ageplay, beast, sounding, mpreg, spanking, lingerie, weird insertions

Limits: scat, watersports, snuff

2) Single Motherhood

The first time you met me was when I broke into your house. You're a pretty deep sleeper, so you didn't hear me break the window. As a matter of fact, you didn't wake up until I was stuffing a vibrator into your asshole.

You screamed and moaned into the pillow at first, you tried to fight me off, but I was too strong. After a little while I rammed my cock into your asshole, and that was the end of you. My firehose of a dick reduced you to a whining, drooling mess, twerking back against me. I came in you so many times that you fainted from it--and when you woke up in the morning I was gone, but your stomach was still swollen with cum.

I broke in three more times in three weeks before you started leaving your window unlocked. Eventually you just left a key out for me to take. During the day you're a manly, high powered lawyer, but at night you're a little bitch, whining and clawing at the sheets while my cock turns your ass into a pussy.

After a couple of months, however, all of that started to change.

Your asshole started getting a LOT more sensitive--so much so that you cum just from me rimming you, and you are in *ecstasy* when I fuck you with my cock. After that it was your nipples, getting soft and puffy. On top of that, you were ridiculously horny--all the time.

You finally go to the doctor for it, and congratulations, you're pregnant! Are you going to beg me to take responsibility, or do you want to be a single mom?

3) Man Boobs

For some reason I‚Äôve always been turned on by the idea of a big, muscular man with a perky set of tits and ultra sensitive nipples. Now matter how much you work out they won‚Äôt go away‚Äîyou have to wear compression shirts and bras to hide them.

Maybe we go to the same gym and I notice you, and I follow you to the locker room and learn your secret? Maybe we‚Äôve been dating for a while, and you finally start to come clean? Or maybe we‚Äôre siblings and I walk in on you changing?

Either way I love the idea of fucking you with a cock or a strap on while your tits bounce and you moan like a whore. Maybe they get stiffer and bigger the longer you go without cumming? Maybe you need to breastfeed to make them go down? The possibilities are endless!

My kinks are anal, futa, titty fucking, gaping, nipple play, nipple fucking, breast feeding, forced bi, whoring someone out, fisting, pegging, face sitting, public free use, cumflation, huge insertions, and a lot more!"
as7tvb,21,2019-02-19,I'm Happy Again,The-Fool-Arcana,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/as7tvb/im_happy_again/,"To all of y'all out there in your feelings and dealing with the devastation from your BU I understand the pain, envy, sorrow, and everything else thrown into that BU

8 months ago I was with someone who I honestly thought I would marry. We were in college and things that were once well were falling apart. And I frantically tried to keep things together.

My codependence and insecurities kept me from seeing the reality that I was in a dead bedroom relationship with someone that didn't love me anymore and was just using me to fill a time slot before she could vacation and went back to her university since we went to separate schools.

I moved out of my home right after the break up, my new place that was gonna be so much fun to build with her was an empty room with a bed and desk. I saw no potential in it compared to weeks before when we were still together.

I stalked her Instagram and was upset she was living a life I could never afford or honestly be comfortable being around. The person I knew changed and I was spiteful, so so spiteful. 

Right after the break up I did all those dating apps and had so many bad experiences but stuck with it because of my codependence. It was a leech and I met girls that were either hurting like I am trying to sleep away their pain when, much like I, didn't have the heart to even get physical. Not even out of spite. I went floating around like a ghost never making a meaningful encounter assuming that if I found one it would in fact fix me.

Months went on of being upset and feeling uncomfortable in my skin, which I've always been self conscious of but was made worse when she told me one of the reasons she was leaving me was because she wasn't physically attracted to me anymore.

I hit a wall. Emotionally and physically. I didn't want to go to the gym or go to on campus activities. This girl that I built my life around didn't want me so I didn't think anyone would ever like me again.

I started from scratch again in many ways. New place, single on campus and it felt fresh since I never lived on campus before, I used to commute. I had gained weight and I always thought about her wanting to take me back, constant fantasizations of her coming back.

Months into last semester I worked on myself. I focused more on school so my grades improved significantly.

I worked on my relationship with my higher power and became more in tune spiritually.

I lived one day at a time in my means and slowly but surely was growing, but the best growth takes time and pressure. I had undergone a lot of pressure so now all I needed was the time to use that pressure.

I went yo the gym and slowly but surely got fit again.

And the days when I was so sad and upset about my BU thay I couldn't do everything in one day I tried to do one good thing for myself that day so I could at least feel like the entire day wasn't wasted.

Christmas and New Year's came and went so I hopped onto the New Year New Me train thay everyone loves hating. I was one of those haters.

But I actually worked harder and fruits of my labor slowly but surely grew in front of me. 

The best one was becoming financially stable and interviewing for paid internships that are for my degree and can hold weight on my resume when applying for careers out of college.

I could fit into old clothes and my friends and family were telling me how good I looked and that I looked slim.

My grades continue to improve as well as my work ethic.

I joined a music group on my campus too. And music was a huge part of my life. Having had been with my ex performing kinda just stopped. But I'm back at it!

I catch girls on my campus staring at me too, that blew mind.  Pretty girls, ones that could blow my ex out of the water and I say this now with no emotion toward her, that my ex was pretty. I'd see girls looking at me and when I realized that it was at me I laughed when I walked back to my apartment. Thinking of how she said she wasn't attracted to me. I could laugh and not hurt.

That it the most important part. Laughing. I love to do it. And smiling. I can smile and mean everything that my smile brings. I'm not doing it to get the girls on campus to look at me or for better grades or for any outside issue. I can smile because I am happy.

I'm happy to be single and by myself. I'm happy that I know myself more now and my boundaries and emotions so much more.

I'm happy to wake up and smile because I love myself more than my ex ever could. And I'm happy that I can be myself again.

The old fantasies of her wanting me back are gone too. If I think of her again it's a thought I wave away, like if I see her again I'd rather not speak with her. I don't hate my ex I just rather not be around someone who hurt me the way she did. Not just with the initial BU itself but what led up to it. 

Whatever you're going through I can honestly tell you that you can get past it. Don't look at your ex and their social media. Focus on you, if your Sad listen to that song you cry to. Do things you like. Heal in a healthy way. 

You will get past it. And when you do you'll be so focused and happy with who you are that dating won't seem scary anymore. And seeing your ex won't shatter you. Most importantly you did it for you not because of or for your ex. You did it for You.

Diamonds start as coal. All it takes is time and pressure."

18FNY wanting to start a medium length hot RP with any literate person of any gender or age (18+) so I can get super wet and touch myself! Yay!

So without further ado, here‚Äôs my description:

My petite body, shaped like a pear‚Äî small nearly everywhere with the exception of my heart shaped ass‚Äî stands at 5‚Äô2‚Äù, thin waisted with a D chest. Generally, I‚Äôm designed head to toe in light, neutral tones: pale skin, grey eyes, platinum-blondish white wavy short hair, with the exception of my sweet young face with rosy lips, high cheek bones, light and barely distinguishable freckles, and lastly a Marilyn Monroe mark (a beauty that seductively sits just above the left corner of my lips). ‚Ä¢ For more clarity on how I look, just ask me for further details ‚Ä¢ 

Premise:

It‚Äôs an office themed rp, and you can choose whatever position in the office you please, so long as it has at least some power in the company. You can, in edition to this, use third person to control any other man in the company. This is a mostly male dominated company, but if you prefer to use a futa character, that undoubtably works as well, though you would be the only woman of power in the company. Conceptually, this office/company is a place of extreme misogyny and sexism. I will be a bubbly teen intern (18) in her senior year of HS or taking a gap year to work here. As the men in the office, you do what you can to either trick me into doing what you want (ig. unplugging the printer so when I try to print documents and go to get them, I end up bending over trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with the printer, allowing those behind me to stare at my ass or my thong, or to trick me into getting in trouble so that you can have a chance to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù me how you please) and sexually harass, take advantage of, and rape the ditzy intern etc, making her into the slut you want. If you are into bimbofication and/or mind control, you can do something like put something in my water that will slowly make my brain go dumdum!

You can do whatever your fucked up brain desires!

Kinks: Rapelay/non-con/force, gangbang, abuse, public degradation/humiliation, exhibitionism/voyeurism, perversion, misogyny fetish, mind control, buttplugs (especially in public), cum/bukakke, free use, pet play, cute/slutty costumes (especially to humiliate me or entertain the dom), when men act perverted and creepy or say it or think perverted/fucked up shit and act like they have no control over their animal instincts because of the way i look, and knowing I turn someone on, trying to hide boners, bulges/hard-ons in clothing, glory holes, corruption, intelligence loss, bimbofication, clothing/speech/eye contact control

limits: bestiality, incest, furries, and impregnation
I like anal for abuse or humiliation, but not if its over-done, and I never want my other holes to get jealous of my ass üòä

kik username: Datamembrain 

Final Note:

I tend to **ignore messages that just have one or two messages saying ‚Äúhey I read your prompt, want to be my [slut/fucktoy/bimbo]‚Äù or just one sentence.** If you want to ensure I read yours and answer, try to include your kinks, fetishes, and limits as blatant and honest, and probably a char description. **DO NOT just dive right in and send me an introduction without having even discussed our interests and turn ons beforehand. I will ignore those messages.**

Straight up. I‚Äôm back to basically the lowest mental state I‚Äôve been in since early fall of 2016, and it seems like this hole is even harder to dig out of. I freaked out and almost committed suicide when a relationship didn‚Äôt work out, and I felt unlovable, disgusting, worthless. I got help, because I knew that wasn‚Äôt the whole story, and over the next 18 months, I had a pretty great recovery. I felt like there was hope going forward because I was finishing college and had a long term relationship that was going well. 

But now, I‚Äôm 8 months out from college and I work at a pizza joint. I make $12 an hour as a college graduate. I have a legit degree that is actively sought after. It isn‚Äôt CS, but it is listed on 75% of the jobs I am interested in. I was told getting a degree meant I could at least get a foot in the door. I‚Äôm not asking for a manager position, I‚Äôm not even asking for an entry level position at this point, I‚Äôll take a fucking internship. But no, apparently I must be doing something horribly wrong because after 200 applications, 5 different resume formats, dozens of different cover letter formats, 10 networking coffee/beer meetings with people who were gung-ho to help find me a job, nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. 

I‚Äôm a pizza driver. I‚Äôm fucking worthless. 

I went into a placement agency two weeks ago and they told me it‚Äôll be realistically be about 18 months until I find a legitimate full time career-job. 18 months. I‚Äôll nearly be 27 in 18 months. My parents were making $50K (in today‚Äôs money) at 27, and I‚Äôd be ecstatic to be making $35K at some point. Fuck this. If I have one more comfortably paid person over 40 tell me to be patient, I‚Äôll get a shot eventually, I swear to god I‚Äôll kill them. They say that they had rough jobs at first but it was worth it. Yeah, I get that, but I don‚Äôt have a rough job, I work at a pizza shop that gives me no valuable applicable skills or experience for the positions I want to eventually work in. I‚Äôd happily take a shitty job that gives me experience because then I can actually feel like I‚Äôm accomplishing something. Whereas with this pointless job, when I walk home with $10 in my pocket after cleaning some heroin addict‚Äôs shit out of the toilet in our bathroom, I don‚Äôt exactly get the satisfaction of feeling like I‚Äôm moving forward in my career, and if anyone says I am then they can go fuck themselves. 

When I vent about this, I feel like an entitled shithead, because I realize there are a lot of people who would be/are happy to work for $12/hour at a pizza shop, but I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs not that I think I‚Äôm better than my coworkers, I don‚Äôt, I think some of them are really smart, capable people who could add a lot of value in other fields of work. I just don‚Äôt derive any satisfaction from working there. Every time I screw something up there, I just get deeper into the hole of self hatred, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pathetic you can‚Äôt even be competent at a pizza shop, this is why you‚Äôll never be shit. This is why nobody even responds to your emails or applications. This is why all those people who say they want to help never end up producing anything that actually helps, because they know your dogshit and are just humoring you because they pity you.‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt handle going to another networking coffee where I tell the person exactly what I‚Äôm looking for, then telling me they know someone else who they‚Äôll put me in contact with and then never hearing from that person, despite reaching out. It‚Äôs the constant rejection. Just having my own internal hatred reaffirmed application after application, rejection after rejection.

Every time I see a job that is listed as entry level, that requires 2-5 years experience in the industry, and experience with industry tools that are hundreds of dollars a year with a corporate account, I just get more and more dejected. I apply to internships that require experience, but what‚Äôs the fucking point in spending the hour reworking my cover letter and resume to fit that position when they just throw the application in the garbage as soon as they see my lack of experience?? 

I constantly deliver to the companies I want to work for, and when I walk in, I immediately just feel like crying because I am in the places I want to be, but I just know I‚Äôll never be there as one of them. I‚Äôll always be an outsider. I get to walk through these offices, and just get to see exactly what I‚Äôm missing, the meetings, the creativity on display, the collaboration, the fruits of somebody‚Äôs hard work being seen by others and being able to say, ‚ÄúI thought of that, I made that.‚Äù Then I drop off their pizza, get tipped 5% and go on my merry way to contemplate how best to kill myself on the drive back to the shop. 

I‚Äôm just tired, and angry. I‚Äôm losing sight of the horizon, and I just want to curl up in a ball and make the pain, the self hatred, and crushing disappointment and worry go away. It‚Äôs manifesting in an unshakable anger that is just so hard to hide. I don‚Äôt feel dangerous, but I feel unstable. It just feels so shitty to feel worthless and angry, because then my anger feels so petty and small, which makes it even worse.

I just want to go out to the woods and blow my brains out. I‚Äôm just done, and I don‚Äôt know what to do."
as9j2n,1,2019-02-19,What should my next step be to improve my career path?,TheFrameGaming,Wordpress,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/as9j2n/what_should_my_next_step_be_to_improve_my_career/,"I started off self-taught, no college. I got myself into a paid internship making WordPress brochure style websites with limited functionality.

After a year, I was able to land an office job as a web developer which had no WP sites. I only really knew CSS and HTML -- in fact, I'd say that's still true, for the most part. However, I knew how to BS it and learn everything I needed on the job. By the time I left this company, I had become comfortable using Git + BitBucket, PHPmyAdmin, an awful mass email system known as Cheetah (or Experian?), making email templates, and just became more familiar with very simple web development outside of WordPress.

I moved to a new job, working from home as a WP developer. I've been here for a year, but the hours are painfully skimpy. This is mostly due to the fact that I can only dabble in PHP, Javascript, jQuery. I pretty much don't know any of these, but I can jump into a project and usually Google simple answers where it's needed.

Right now I'm on a task where I'm pulling FileMaker data from a database to a WP site, and it involves XML and all sorts of dev things I'm not familiar with. It's killing my hours and my momentum because I just don't know how to do anything. I'd love it to be a learning experience -- and it will be -- but it's just so far out of my range that I don't think I can really grasp it.

I now have probably about 120 websites I've worked on, and some which I've built from scratch, about half being WP. Lots of Multisite experience.

So, my question is... What's the next step? I'd love to just find a job with at least somewhat steady hours, working from home is great too, but it seems like right now I still fall into the ""Web Designer"" category, and finding web designer jobs is not easy compared to the high demand for web developers.

I'd like to stay on the path of WordPress. Should I really dive into PHP? Should I learn Javascript? Should I advertise myself as a WordPress Project Manager (since I have experience in managing teams for my websites, and this might be a good approach for my ""handyman"" type knowledge -- knowledge and experience in many areas, but not a deep understanding of actual code)?

I know this is subjective, so I suppose I'm asking what would YOU do if you were in my shoes?

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks."

asax7i,1,2019-02-19,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/asax7i/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! 

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

I asked my AGM and he gave me a number that sent me to someone that sent me to another automated voice line. The internship is in Issaquah but I live in Atlanta, Ga. I was curious to see the amount they would pay because they do not provide housing and I know the housing in Seattle or around Issaquah is quite expensive. I want to be realistic with this because it will provide a great opportunity and so if anyone can give me a phone number or help me find more information that would be great! "

One day in September, my brain just started racing with thoughts like how I left all my friends and family, was having trouble making new friends, feeling like I wasn't good enough to be in Law School, feeling like I had no idea what I was doing, and many other thoughts. These thoughts started spiralling very quickly in my mind and I felt severely overwhelmed; I felt like I wanted to cry and I didn't know what to do. For lack of a better word, at that moment I felt crippled. I had to sit down and do some deep breathing exercises to calm down.

It happened again in October while I was trying to fall asleep. That time, every time I shut my eyes, it felt like my mind was being squashed with the spiral of thoughts. It felt worse. It happened again in twice in November and once again in December while studying for finals.

During winter break I went home. I realized I needed time to myself so I told myself I would relax. I had planned a trip with some friends to go to a resort in Denver and relax, spend time with my mother, and just enjoy time with my girlfriend. That didn't exactly happen. What ended up happening is my girlfriend broke up with me (she spent two weeks in Belize while I was taking finals and it was life changing for her so she came back and decided that she wanted to work towards travelling the world and didn't feel like she could do that while in our relationship) and on Christmas my grandmother (maternal) in India had a stroke so my mother flew to India to be with her (so my mother wasn't at home. I couldn't go with my mother because my passport was back in Law School and I felt helpless). A week after break was over (and I was back in the semester), my other grandmother (paternal) in India passed away. Last week my grandmother (maternal) went back into the hospital and is now in need of a pacemaker.

Since I got back to this semester, the intensity and frequency of my overwhelming mind spirals have drastically increased. They happen about twice a week and now they include thoughts about what I did wrong in my relationship, how I feel helpless about my grandmothers, am I losing myself and who I am, whether I will actually get a summer 1L internship, am I cut out for this, feeling as I am not learning the same as my classmates, etc.

I starting seeing a University provided therapist a few weeks ago but I feel as though it's only getting worse. I don't know what to do and I honestly feel scared. My mind constantly feels pressed now and the spirals aren't getting better. Does anyone have any advice that could help me? I appreciate any advice that you may have!"

My name is Natalie, and I'll be your tour guide this evening."" Oh great, *Natalie* was here tonight. Not that she was bad or anything, quite the opposite. She just knew so much about the exhibits that the guests would be spending far more time than usual at each one. ""If you look over to your right, you'll see our first exhibit here, the disobedient maid."" There were a lot of *oohs* and *aahs* from the crowd, as well as the sound of pictures being taken. I couldn't see from my current position, but I knew it by heart. It was a woman wearing a sexy french maid outfit entirely made of latex, with her hands bound behind her back and a feather duster sticking out of her mouth. ""As you can see here,"" Natalie went on, ""Alice here has been very naughty lately."" It was bullshit. It was just the shift she'd been asked to work. And honestly, she wasn't even the one that drew the short straw. ""Alice is stuck in this enclosure until she dusts off every single item in that room."" Typically there was a full bookshelf, a table with some ornaments, and a leather chair. A couple of times per evening the maid would ""accidentally"" knock over a chalice or decoration from the table, though sometimes it was deliberate. The crowd loved it anyway, looking on from the other side of the giant glass window.

Sure enough, Natalie spent ages answering stupid questions from the guests. Honestly, I just wanted them to move on. Eventually she did, although the next part was just as bad. ""Moving on, exhibit B here is known as the playpen."" I still couldn't see them, but I could hear the squeak of rubber and their (partially) exaggerated pants. There would be two girls in there, trussed up in latex bitchsuits that kept them down on all fours. I wasn't sure who it was tonight, but I knew they were both wearing ring gags that kept their tongues hanging out. Once again, the crowd cheered and took plenty of pictures. I knew the only exposed bits were their pussies and their tits, so their mouths would be busy tonight. The biggest variable was whether or not they were blindfolded or if someone had been given a strapon. Once again, Natalie took her sweet time speaking with all of the guests.

""Finally, we have the last exhibit in our tour tonight. And this one's a rather special one."" I gulped. I had been waiting for this for a while now, but I was still nervous. Not that there was much I could do anyway. ""Exhibit C, also called the decoration, is a personal favourite of mine."" That part was actually true. While Natalie spent plenty of time at all the Exhibits, this was one where she always got personal. ""Yes, there is actually a woman inside underneath all that."" I couldn't see the crowd, but I could feel them staring up at the wall. I was fully encased in a vacuum sealed latex prison, unable to move a muscle. My outline could be clearly seen by anyone. Despite the fact that my face was fully covered, I had a ball gag and blindfold underneath my bondage. ""As you can see here, this is one of our interactive exhibits."" Natalie pressed a button, and the dildo in my cunt started slowly vibrating. I screamed into my gag and writhed in place, much to the amusement of the crowd. My buttplug stayed still, so she must be saving that one for later. ""Don't worry,"" she told the crowd, ""you'll all get a chance to use the remote. Also, unlike the last ones, this is a hands on exhibit. You're welcome to get up there and feel any part you like."" I let out a groan at this point, both from pleasure and annoyance. It was going to be a long night.

I never should've taken an internship at the fetish festival.

***

Hi everyone, thanks for reading through that massive wall of text. As you can tell, I'm looking to be a toy for others to play with tonight. If you want I can be in one of the other exhibits, or if you have any new ideas, please let me know! You're welcome to be the tour guide, the people in the crowd, or the manager coming down to see how things are. Who knows, maybe you can be another attraction that gets to interact with the other exhibits?

If your a fan of latex, hard bondage, public, and orgasm control, send me a message. My limits are incest, scat, beast, and underage. Pretty much everything else is on the table. I look forward to getting some orange envelopes.

I think the Secret Shop will be something, that we will have between events forever as its coming back for a while now

And it seems like they are adjusting it every once in a while. At first i got the same packs every time it returned. Now it seems like it's rotating

Due to crowdsourcing on reddit there is a pattern tho: the higher you V level, the lower the chance to get suits below a certain amount of value

My concern is, that i will never have the chance to purchase cheaper suits (intern miko) because of my V level (8) and that i and alot of other player have to miss out on them. I'm also not going to buy all the suits just to get the cheaper ones

That's why i thought that we could contact support about this. Suggest that we wish a rotation that opens the possibility to purchase suits from all price ranges!"
asc2w6,11,2019-02-19,My at a loss over what happened with my (M28) wife (F28),burneraccount1995,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/asc2w6/my_at_a_loss_over_what_happened_with_my_m28_wife/,"I‚Äôm writing this because I am so sad this week and confused. I keep thinking what the hell happened. 

My wife and I dated for two and half years before getting engaged. Overall we had a great relationship. She struggled with depression at times and it was something we worked together through when she was sad. 

After we got engaged - everything changed. Her and I decided to move into my parents house while we were engaged to save money for our future. We live in one of the most expensive places in the country. She was in graduate school and had a non-paying internship and I was working at a startup so I could not afford to support both of us at the time. It is also worth noting that my family and fiance got along great. She spent a ton of time with them and I was so happy they all got along well. 

It is worth noting at this point that my family did a lot for my fiance. Celebrated her birthday, job promotions and graduate school acceptances. They cooker her dinner almost every night and if they were making something she didn‚Äôt like then they would make her something that she did. They helped support us a lot. 

My fiance slowly started to turn on my family while we were living with them. She would accuse my mother of comparing our wedding plans to my sister wedding that happened three months earlier. I did not see it this way and simply saw them using it as a reference. For example, my fiance would ask my mother, ‚ÄúHow much does a DJ cost?‚Äù and my mother would reply along the lines of, ‚ÄúWell when we were doing research for \[insert sisters name\]‚Äôs wedding we found that they cost around 2K.‚Äù My fiance would then get upset because that my mother brought up my sister wedding. 

I did talk to my parents about this and through my eyes they did seem to stop bringing it up less but my fiance did not see it that way. I understand that I cannot hear everything. She eventually just completely stopped talking about our wedding in front of my parents. 

My family offered to pay for the flowers for the wedding and told my fiance at the time that she could hire anyone she wanted to within the budget, but they didn‚Äôt want her to use the same florist that my sister used for her wedding because she did an absolutely terrible job and got everything wrong. My family explained they didn‚Äôt want to see that happen to my fiance and didn‚Äôt want to pay the lady again. 

My fiance then went and meet the the florist behind everyones back including mine. She eventually told me and my family. My parents were upset, but if she really wanted to hire her they said she could. So my fiance hired her. She then invited my mother and grandmother to help her pick out flowers and they were both excited. 

A month later my grandmother died unexpectedly. It crushed me and my whole family. Especially my mother - they were best friends. 

Two months later when it came time to pick go pick out the flowers my fiance ditched my mother and went to the appointment. My mom even saw her that morning and asked what she was up to that day and she said just studying. My dad saw her as well and she lied to them also. It wasn‚Äôt until my family say my fiance mom outside of the house unexpectedly (her family lives 4 hours away) that they found out she was ditching my mom to go to the florist. 

My mom wasn‚Äôt upset that she got disinvited she was more upset about her blatantly lying to them after all they had done for them. Honestly, if my fiance would have told my mom, ‚ÄúDo you care if I go with my mom instead.‚Äù My mom wouldn‚Äôt have had a problem with it. 

Anyways my mom goes off on my fiance yelling at her and saying some mean things. My mom did not handle her mother's death well and wasn‚Äôt in a good place. I started yelling at my mother sticking up for my fiance. Our wedding was in 30 days at this point. They both apologized the next day and agreed to move forward, but my wife could not. 

We moved out 7 days later. 

After we got married my wife wanted to nothing to do with my family - she didn‚Äôt see them or talk to them for seven weeks after we got married.

My mom hosts Sunday dinner twice a month that last about an hour. Those dinners are important to me. After about seven weeks I asked my wife if she would go to a family dinner and she went off on me. 

She told me we should have never gotten married. That she hates me. And marrying me was the worst decision of her life. 

I was devastated to say the least. 

Eventually she comes around and apologized. And agreed to go to a family dinner. Then a very clear patterned started to emerge. 

1. We would go to family dinner 
2. My wife would only speak when spoke to (unusual for her) and would never continue to the conversation. 
3. After the family dinner she would have a melt down on me told me how she hated my family, wanted to divorce me and a bunch of other extremely hurtful things. 
4. Fight for 24 hours to 5 days 
5. Repeat every time there was family event 

She eventually got diagnosed with depressions and got on some meds. Things got better for about two and half months before the same cycle started to occur. She eventually wanted me to stop talking to my mother. 

After about 15 time her threatening to leave me and months of therapy. I decided I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. 

I would never leave someone because they didn‚Äôt like my family it was the fact that she would verbally attack me afterwards or stone wall me for days after being with them. 

Also, I did a lot a support her over the years and never asked for anything in return. My only ask was that she just did look completely miserable at family dinners, but she couldn't do that. It was apparent she was hating every minute of it. 

I moved out for three weeks. I came back and decided to give it another go. Things were better for about a month and she didn‚Äôt freak out at much when she saw my family. 

During this time I found out she was texting another guy. It wasn‚Äôt sexting, but it was definitely not appropriate for being married. She had the guy listed as a women from her work in her phone - it even had the work as her place of employment. 

I took this as a sign from god and left the relationship after 16 months of trying to make the marriage work - we were in therapy since month one. 

Before we got engaged things were so great and after it all crumbled after the engagement. 

I still can‚Äôt believe how bad it was and it all blew up. I‚Äôm not sure what I did wrong but I‚Äôm devastated and miss her a lot.

aschyz,1,2019-02-19,I Feel Like University Is a Waste of Time For Me,DoneWithSchool153,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/aschyz/i_feel_like_university_is_a_waste_of_time_for_me/,"Hey all,

I'm a 20 year old college student studying economics at a prestigious University in my country. I've always been smart, and have always done school by virtue of that - not through hard work. That doesn't mean that I don't work hard though, during the summers I work two jobs (70+ hours/week) in order to save enough to travel and trade stocks throughout the year. Usually I work in Restaurants and Bars, traditionally hard jobs but I don't mind - the pay was better. 

I have been obsessed with money for a long time, though not as a means of buying things (I think that's idiotic), rather on travel and as a means to make more through investing. For me it has always been about freedom, money gives me the means not to have to work and to see the world. 

I made quite a lot trading this summer (more than many of my friends made in a month!) and that's not to mention the fact that I outworked anyone else that I know at my age. At school I work 20 hours/week at an internship in my chosen field (Real Estate) that I obtained through cold-emailing and persistence, and I'm starting at another job (bussing) working a few nights a week to supplement that income as I've began to get restless. I spend nearly all of my time reading about Real Estate or finance, and I'm starting to prepare a launch for my first business. I'm not completely money obsessed though, I also read non-fiction (mainly History) as well as some fiction sprinkled in. 

My problem is that I'm required to spend way too much of my time studying/doing homework, where I feel like that time could much better be used doing what I'm good at. I do well in my internship, and because of how small the firm is I'm able to work on every aspect of the industry. What working has made me realize was that literally nothing that I learn in school is applicable to what my eventual career will be, and those things that have been somewhat useful (mainly Excel) I've had to supplement through teaching myself through online resources.

 I waste countless hours doing assignments and learning theorems for the sole purpose of regurgitating that information unto a page for a grade. I don't do super well (solid B-C student) but to not fail requires more effort than I feel is worth my time. And I do all of this for what? A stupid piece of paper. 

I don't want this to be taken as a criticism of University, I'd hope that our Doctors, Lawyers and Engineers (to name a few professions) would be highly educated. For people like me, who would rather hustle and live in the real world than to spend countless hours in a library though this entire process is torturous. I have 2 years left and I think about how much money I'm leaving on the table because I can't be working instead. My parents have gotten mad at me because I don't take my studies seriously but I do not see any point in them other than getting a higher imaginary number and a distinction on my fancy piece of paper. 

My peers have made the experience harder to bear, the vast majority come from massively privileged backgrounds, with work experience ranging from camp counselor to a bank where their dad works. They are oblivious to how the world works (I don't pretend to be an expert - though I'm certainly not as naive as many of them are) and study for the sake of it. They can't articulate why they're in school beyond the fact that it's the next step, and many of them don't have to worry about jobs anyways because their parents will get them something when they graduate. 

I want to drop out - the only thing keeping me here is the guilt in knowing how much my parents have spent on me so far and the fact that I know that not having a diploma could hold me back in the long run. The entire experience has disillusioned me with society and the education system and I feel like I'm turning into a much more bitter individual as a result. "

https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/aqe73k/are_you_ready_for_the_ultimate_blackpillsuifuel/

Over the weekend, Chad roommate (CR) invited me to his friend's get together and he and I and 3 girls he had clearly invited to try to bang ended up talking over dinner. One of them, IG, is from my previous story. She was completely drunk, and I mean almost sloppy. She could barely finish conversations and if she wasn't a girl would've been kicked out for basically trying to molest Chad. And no, she wasn't wearing a bra or underwear to try to get lucky. Pity her future husband.

While I didn't get a chance to talk to the 3rd girl, #2, another Indian chick was interesting. She apparently was visiting from India, so not even an Indian-American, but she decided that before her internship was up, she would get laid by as many white guys as she could. Not something she could do back home and she has appearances to keep.

So gentlemen, is this genetic? White washing from Hollywood culture? Why are women who aren't even from the US raised to crave white dick so badly? What does that leave for the rest of us? 

And the sad part is that this girl was a 9/10 bombshell. She would have any Indian superstar she wanted back home. But no, she needs to come all the way here and make it a plan to get laid by an American guy. Because apparently she's still a good girl back home. This sucks. I ended up chickening out and calling it an early night with some excuse about a headache. I couldn't deal with them basically slobbering over him while politely ignoring me. "
asec8b,1,2019-02-19,Keep My Day Job or Go Back to School and Work Nights,uptocode,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/asec8b/keep_my_day_job_or_go_back_to_school_and_work/,"Hi Reddit.


I am a 23 year old male who currently has a decent sit-down office job making ~$38k a year at a company with a nice culture and benefits package.


I come from a large family, and I still live with my parents. However, I provide most of the financial support for my parents and seven siblings (five of which who still live at home). I regularly (at least every other month) pay the full rent of ~$2500 dollars. I also buy groceries, and do a fair amount of cooking. My father is self-employed and has a home business that partial provides for us. However, he cannot shelter the full cost of living for my family alone.


I am concerned because, while I like my current job, I am never going to break past $40k a year. There is not a lot of upward mobility at all. My parents are also aging, and I cannot depend on them to financially always be there for me. But at the same time, I also want to continue providing financially for most of my family.


I went to community college for two years. I am debating going back to school to help my career long term. I think having my first bachelor's degree might help me attract a better job and help me later in life.


I want to go to school for computer science. I was formerly employed as a front-end developer at a previous work experience. So, I am not completely new to the field. I also had internships back from when I did go to college that have given me some real-world experience.

So, here are my options as I have researched them:

**1)** Continue working decent office job in an unrelated field. Job pays $38k, has full benefits, and a small tuition assistance program. Do not go to school at all. Focus on developing career.

**2)** Work day job. Go to a reputable full-online BS in Computer Science program from a local university with a decent program and minor name recognition. Take advantage of work's tuition assistance program.

**3)** Go to school full time at a different local university with more name recognition and a better program. Get a night job at Amazon or UPS.

**4)** Go to a great university in Chicago. Move away from family in suburbs. Find night job in the city. I have a sister in the city that I could temporary live with.


I am hesitant to move away from my family because I have a younger sister in middle school. I am her world, and until she is old enough to handle it, I am really all she has. My family situation is not the best. I want to be a pillar for my family members for them to rely on. Would it help them best to try to go to school young while I can?


I really need some advice here, Reddit. Please feel free to ask me questions if more information is needed.


---


**EDIT:**


To give more details:


* With the exception of one sibling, the five siblings that live with me are all adults. They just work sporadic jobs, and they do not contribute regularly.
* The $2500 rent is for a house we share. So, this is just the housing cost for my mom, dad, my siblings, and I.
* My mom is unable to work much due to a formally diagnosed illness. She just works on the side which hardly covers her car payment.



I plan to have a sit down with my parents come spring, and tell them that the other siblings need to financially contribute as well. That said, I still really could use advice here Reddit. Please help. Any advice is really appreciated.


I realize my family's finances are pretty fucked Reddit. I just don't want to make a bad move here and make things worse.

Edit:  

Thanks for all the advice guys, I see a lot of comments regarding the IRA account earning 2.2%, so I figured I'd a few more details. It's a Roth IRA through Ally Bank which was advertised to earn 2.2%, you can read more about it [here](https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/online-savings-account/). Digging deeper, it looks like it's actually just another saving accounts with IRA benefits. Luckily I'm not too deep into it financially, so I can move to a better strategy. Would you guys say I should just do 401k exclusively or do you have suggestions for a better IRA plan? "

For those of you familiar with posts on JNM, I‚Äôm Maharani‚Äôs DIL, and my DH is usually dear, often delusional, once in a while damn. 

Kind of verging on damn here.

[I've just posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/asgmb3/maharani_has_been_guilting_the_shit_out_of_dh/?) about an issue that's closely related to this and I sort of see it as background to this one... I would so appreciate it if you checked it out! Please feel free to address the issues concerning my SO from that post in the comments here, as I feel this post is deeply related. I‚Äôm probably not going to be adding any GIFs here since this part has me a bit heartbroken and I‚Äôm sort of not in the mood after writing such a large post.

I‚Äôve been purposely vague in my posts about timelines and such for plausible deniability reasons. Either way, you should know that DH and I live about 1-1.5 hours away from his parents and my mother, while my dad lives about 400-600 miles away. My dad (a JustYes) is the only one we haven‚Äôt seen since we got married, which was more than six months ago but less than a year. 

Dad is coming to stay over with us for a weekend soon, just him (he's divorced and kids are with their mom). BIL2 calls and asks to stay over that same weekend because he has some sort of conference he‚Äôs attending (he‚Äôs in college and it‚Äôs relevant to his field). We don‚Äôt have the space, but instead of telling BIL either a) ‚ÄúSorry bro, but BariBahu‚Äôs dad is staying with us, so we can‚Äôt,‚Äù or b) ‚ÄúLet me get back to you,‚Äù he tells his brother that my dad is staying over but he‚Äôll see what he can do. I should note that BIL2's college is less than an hour from our city by train. It's very common for people from that college to do internships in our city, waking up as early as BIL would have to, and doing so for months. Basically, DH later tries to say ""Oh, but he'd have to wake up at 5:30AM"" and I'm like ""Tough titties, that's life.""

I hope it‚Äôs alright if I bullet point here again because I‚Äôm just so shot and not up to trying to make everything here totally cohesive. 

* Important info: For the past few years, BIL has been an asshole to us and it only got a bit better after we got married. (I have my theories on why but that's a whole other rant.) Despite our attempts to spend time with him, to support him and get his uber conservative Muslim parents to accept him as the proudly feminine gay man that he is, despite telling him that we have his back when he decided to come out to his parents about the fact that a highly esteemed community member (and his mother's ex-affair partner) sexually abused him, he would still mock us and put us down and treat us like shit. I used to text BIL2 to see how he's doing, and he ignored every text. I was the one who drove over an hour and a half to see BIL2 in the hospital after he had an alcohol overdose since his parents couldn't make it on account of it being the same day as BIL1's college graduation (which I missed and was a big deal for me because the keynote was a **HUGELY** famous figure that I had a very large interest in seeing.) DH has always been a third parent to BIL2 and done a *lot* for him too, and in spite of all this... in the words of my best friend, ""he's a total dick to you guys."" Also of note: despite the fact that he's a total social media attention whore, BIL didn‚Äôt make one post about our wedding that didn‚Äôt only focus on himself whereas even BIL1 (who is social media illiterate almost) made a long ass post talking about how happy he was about having me in the family. (People say social media is BS and doesn‚Äôt matter. It does. Much of society has made it matter, and with a college-age kid constantly posting about his ‚ÄòBFFs‚Äô on social media, this omission has not been lost on me. I know him well enough to know it means he doesn't give a shit.) 

* Only a couple months ago, we had to leave our apartment at 2AM to rescue a very drunk (and very underage) BIL from a bar in our city because he threw up everywhere and put him up on our couch. DH had work at 5am btw. The entire time we were headed there and back, BIL told multiple lies (that I caught him in but didn't say too much) including telling DH that there were strange men offering him money for sex outside the bar and that all his friends got arrested after we left. On the one hand, he has a personality disorder that results in this kind of attention seeking and constant drama, but on the other hand, it's exhausting and thankless to deal with this.

* So after he hangs up with his brother, DH *tries* to do what we talked about and ask me what I think, but he very clearly was not giving me a choice. I told him we can't since my dad is coming over. He suggests I sleep in the bed with my dad while he and his brother take the couch. This is a no-go because 1) our coach isn't big enough for both of them and 2) I don't fucking want to. He basically gives me no room to say no to this. 

* I tell DH I'm upset that he just assumed I'd be okay with this if my dad wasn't around. He told BIL that my dad was here, but he'll figure something out... but he should have asked me first, period. DH turned this on me and guilted me, asking ""Wow, so you really wouldn't want him here if your dad wasn't coming over?"" No, I kinda don't, and fuck you for making me feel bad about it.

* DH also 1) doesn't think BIL2 has been that big of a dick to us and 2) doesn't think it's a good enough reason to not have him stay over.

* I asked DH if *any* reason was a good enough reason, in his eyes, for me to say no. He basically said there wasn't... only if we physically couldn't.

* DH also thinks that because his brother being an asshole doesn't bother him, it shouldn't bother me. I'm being made to feel like I'm a petty asshole that's holding a grudge when I honestly just don't want to be around people who make me feel shitty or anxious.

* DH *always* tries to compare it the other way around. He tries to flip it on me. ""I'd never have a problem with you having your family over."" What I want to say is ""That's because my family doesn't fucking suck... even my narcissistic mother is amazing to you."" What I actually tell him is that he doesn't even know what it's like the other way around, because I never let it *happen* the other way around. I have strong boundaries with my family, and they know how to behave. (They also don't make as many demands as his... another thing I can't be blunt about.)

* I got DH to admit that a huge part of his insistence that he figure out some way to accommodate his brother is because of the guilt **his parents** will rain down on him if he doesn't. As much of a dick as BIL2 has been, he's gotten better *and* he would understand something like the fact that we can't since my dad is here. 

* DH sees nothing wrong with this. I told him this is why I'd like him to consider therapy... that his dynamic with his parents *can't* be as healthy as he thinks it is if it affects us this much. He said he has no problem with his family depending on him like this, and that he doesn't want to change. He heavily implied the problem is with me.

I cried, y'all. Like, I fucking bawled. My therapist helped me figure out that my mother prioritizing her affair and her second marriage over me is the reason I get *super* triggered when DH prioritizes his parents and siblings over me too. I was extremely triggered by our whole conversation ‚Äì which included a lot of DH being condescending and then claiming he wasn't being condescending ‚Äì and I couldn't stop sobbing and having that shitty feeling in your chest that you get when you feel like just giving up. 

When I'm in that state ‚Äì anxious, upset, devastated, lost ‚Äì I tend to forget the specifics of the conversation later. But after an hour of our tortuous conversation, DH backed off, I guess? At first, he said ""Fine, I'll tell him no"" but in that way that's meant to make me feel guilty, but I called him on it. I begged for a timeout (something our therapist suggested when one of us gets too heated or upset), but I couldn't stop crying during said timeout and had a really hard time calming down. He eventually couldn't take it anymore and started telling me how he wished I'd understand that, while this stuff is triggering for me, it's also triggering for him when he feels like I'm trying to keep him from taking care of his family. (Not exact words, but you get the gist.)

I told him I was tired of walking on eggshells with him. For most of our friendship and relationship, he's gotten all the support from me and I've always prioritized him. He was actually a terrible friend to me growing up (in part because of his mother) and even recently he's had a hard time coming through for me when I needed it... and I'm just tired. I've done a lot of forgiving and swallowing bullshit and trying to be mindful of his needs without getting any of the same courtesy back when I need it most. DH has no problem being a fantastic husband... when it's convenient. When it gets hard, he fails. And I'm so tired of it. 

After the whole conversation was over and DH started making me breakfast, he did ‚Äì totally on his own ‚Äì say ""BariBahu... I wish my mom didn't guilt me so much."" So there's a crack in the armor, it's there. And I did get to reiterate a bit of what I had already said without him getting upset with me. But I feel like we'll have to start over again next time.

I'm sure I left out a lot. Please know I *am* in this relationship for a reason, and DH is fantastic in many ways. This past weekend finally had a 3-day weekend where we both had off at the same time, and he took me for all these amazing things and has been doing his best to look into better mental healthcare for me. But I'm tired of his own childhood trauma and hang-ups encroaching on our relationship, and I'm tired of him thinking he doesn't need help. There's so much I've probably left out here because I'm very, very frazzled and upset... but thank you, if you have read all of this. This sub is one of the few things keeping me sane."

I'm a recent Auslander based in Hamburg and I graduated last year. I have a bachelor in Mechanical Eng. and a master in Aircraft Systems. I did my internships in other countries and my master thesis in Germany. I'm looking for jobs mainly in Hamburg and I'm very close to land a job in this city. Accordingly to the hiring managers feedback, I have feeling that I will have two job offers in two different companies in the Aerospace industry any time soon. I did my research and asked my friends (also Auslanders) who already found jobs in this industry and others such as energy or automotive. Based on the data I gathered, my conclusion is that the salary range for an **entry-level** job in **Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering** is around **40-50k bruto per year in Hamburg**. I already narrowed down to 45-50k when I was asked about my salary expectations in the interviews.

The **1st question** is: Do you have any objections regarding my conclusion? Basically, how much I should earn, guys?

The **2nd question** is: How open the companies in Hamburg are to negotiate salaries for entry-level job positions? I want to have at least two offers in order have a leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance."

I am planning on getting my NASM certification again and giving this a second shot.  On their website they have am all inclusive package that gets you an internship at a gym after you pass the exam.  However, the price for this package is twice as much as the package I originally was looking at.  

My questions to you guys are: How long did it take you to get a job at a gym after you got your certification?  What was the job search process like for you?  Did you have any experience training people before you found work at a big box gym?

I had zero success even landing an interview when I first got my certification.  I assume it was because I didn't have any experience training people.  This is why I am considering spending twice the amount of money to get the all inclusive for NASM, because at the very least it will help me get internship experience at a gym.  What I fear is getting certified and spending many months looking for a job and not getting anywhere.

Any advice or input is appreciated.

asiilw,1,2019-02-19,Is my mother a narcissist?,Esupanitix,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/asiilw/is_my_mother_a_narcissist/,"I've been reading posts on this subreddit, and I've been seeing some stories that are way worse than anything I've ever experienced in any way. However, among those complaints, I saw personality traits that reminded me immensely of my own mother:

* When I was a child, whenever she took me to family gatherings, while she didn't sugar coat anything, she bragged and bragged and bragged incessantly about me (apparently being able to spell and do basic math as a toddler is a huge deal) which, while nice for my ego, was *really stupid* for trying to raise someone to be humble.
* The house was making easily $80k/year (basically $50k/year with my ngrandma's medical bills and delinquent student loans that matured by something like 2200% by the time she died), which is far more than enough to *not give a sixth grade child six cans of Coca-Cola per day before taking two years to attempt to set up a soda limit per day that was never enforced*. I was 200lb at age 11.
* Whenever I have/had grievances (even those that were idiot teenage me being an asshole), she fully dismissed them, made fun of me, gritted her teeth and yelled at me, told me to move (I'll get to this one later because it's a particular case), has threatened me on multiple occasions (was *way* too lazy to actually enforce punishments, by the way, causing me to currently suspect *myself* as a narcissist)
* She puts on a completely different personality in public than at home:
   * She completely ghosts the shit out of her dad, and while my grandfather is a closet case by himself (Alcoholism, bitching about my mom to his sister on the phone, refuses to work more than part time and has done so, footing his daughter with the majority of the bills since she was 16 despite her being on the tail end of a miscarriage), he's been doing his best in his old age (considering his past) and has been better emotional support than the person who ""birthed and raised you"" and ""gave you everything you ever needed or wanted right down to the roof over your head"".
   * She's manipulated my stepmom into hating her dad despite the two never having had an actual conversation together other than maybe my grandfather chewing my stepmom out for forcing a different policy on dishwork (she's an RN and a complete neat freak to the point of completely revamping the way I'm supposed to handle laundry, and for the better), which *definitely* didn't turn into a fight.
   * She got drunk last August (*not* an alcoholic, at least not yet) and gaslighted me into believing that she told me I wasn't autistic as a lie to protect me from using my Asperger's as a crutch (I went to my family doctor -- I was cleared as *not autistic* in fourth grade) and let it keep going for a full three months while I stewed and vented about her *very loudly about personality issues I could have sought support for fixing as a minor or financial aid I could have applied for with my diagnosis* before she cleared it up herself, saying ""lol no I never told you that"" and laughing at me for making an ass of myself, like being angry at the person who formed herself in an image of God Himself, graceful is He (purportedly) lying to you after saying she doesn't sugarcoat shit with you and never did isn't just unreasonable but extremely ungrateful.
   * In public she's lovey-dovey-spoil-the-shit-out-of-me kind, in private she's distant and acts like I'm avoiding her because apparently not liking the same type of comedy she does and dealing with it for hours on end just to spend time with her.
* She called me into her room one night to talk about my program at school, acted like she had the program advertised to her as that my academic advisor would set me up with an internship (her s/o's program did exactly that and she assumed that my program would be the same) / co-op, and expected me to sit there and take the person who's essentially been my therapist through all of this being insulted by some know-nothing jerk who wants to feign personal involvement in my life after doing everything she can to push me away aside from kicking me out, responding to me calling her a manipulative hag after telling her that ""If you had gone to any of the informational meetings on the program, you'd know that finding a job was firstly and foremost *my responsibility* and that I'm getting exactly what I agreed to pay for with loans that *I'm taking out*, not you"" with ""You have three months to find a job and six months to get out of my house"", responding to pleading for mercy with ""two months.""
   * Funny thing: I was up until 5 AM crying before attempting to get ahold of her the following morning as she went to work (she was trying to ghost me), started panicking and applying to shitty minimum wage slave jobs the next day, came home crying to my mom to ""please don't kick me out"" (one of the places I applied to in person laughed me out for speaking funny and it broke me), and she had the fucking gall to tell me ""I didn't mean that. Just don't talk to me like that again"" as if I was the only one at fault for anything.

Is my mom a narcissist or am I just a massive drama queen? I think I might not be giving enough information."
asivvs,8,2019-02-19,EM Gets Mad I Can't Let Her Use The Employee Microwave,FluidBunny,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/asivvs/em_gets_mad_i_cant_let_her_use_the_employee/,"So, this was happening when I worked in fast food a few years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked in a place that mostly got older people or large families, and I had dealt with a few parents before. Some were kind. Some were rude. But this mother was something else entirely. When the party ordered (about 6 people) I was asked if there was a microwave a customer could use. When I said no, she seemed annoyed. Then this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

EM = Entitled Mom

&amp;#x200B;

G = My coworker who was in the front with me

&amp;#x200B;

Me=...me

&amp;#x200B;

EM - What do you mean you don't have one?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - We don't have a microwave for customer use, I'm sorry but none of our food is microwaved.

&amp;#x200B;

EM - Well is there any way that we could use the employee one? My baby's milk needs to be heated.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when G took over.

&amp;#x200B;

G - I'm sorry, but the only microwave we have is for employees. I'm going to have to ask you to move so that we can help the next customer.

&amp;#x200B;

EM - Just let me use the stupid microwave! It's for my BABY!

&amp;#x200B;

G - I'm sorry, if you want, I can go get the manager to talk to you while FluidBunny helps the next customer.

&amp;#x200B;

EM - Fine.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker goes to the back to get the manager while the EM stands to the side. There's a place that customers who carry out can ask for sauces and usually check for food next to my cash register, so I keep an eye on her as I ring up the next group of people. Now - a little explanation on how my job worked since it plays into why this woman got her own Reddit post about 3 years later. When a customer ate in, we handed them a card with a number and we would bring out their food to where they sat and would then take the card back to be reused.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the EM's food with her party is ready, and I put everything on the trays and look to see that I can see where the family is sitting so I can actually keep an eye on EM while I give out the food. The place they sat, in fact, was the first two tables in the dining room, pushing them together and making the two rectangular tables into one square one. Not too big of a deal, just annoying since that's usually a sign of people who leave the hot sauce bottles on the table and throw food on the floor. I walk over, place the two trays it took to carry the food out and grab the card. The only moment she was out of my peripheral and I couldn't see her was when I grabbed the card, which only took about 2 seconds. When I looked back up, she was gone. I thought to myself ""What the..."" and then I heard a ""Who the hell are YOU?!"" coming from the kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

I rushed back and saw that the woman had sneaked away while I gave her family food to try and find the employee microwave, and instead of heading straight back and to the left where it actually was, she had tried to find one in the kitchen, where the cook for the night had seen her and yelled. The manager came up, saw the woman, and asked her what she was doing. He had it handled and more food was ready, so I went back to my job, putting the food on a tray and prepared to take it out. The EM had been told to go sit down or be banned and left before I had my food ready, so I just went to go give to the couple that had ordered after EM's Party their food. Remember how EM's party was at the front of the dining room? The couple was in the back, and I would have to walk past EM to give them their food. 

&amp;#x200B;

And, after I thought that the fiasco with EM was over, she tripped me. Like a school kid who got told on for stealing crayons, this adult with a baby and, I'm guessing that one of the 4-year-olds with her party might have been hers as well, acted worse than the toddlers I work with at a Pre-School. I fall down and start to scream in pain. I have horrible ankles and have been in and out of wheelchairs my whole life, and the speed I was walking and the angle of this woman's foot combined actually DISLOCATED MY FUCKING ANKLE. The couple sees this woman trip me with their food, and runs over to help me up (honestly some of the nicest people at this place, not gonna lie) and they see that my ankle is clearly not okay. My manager, who know about my ankles, runs over and sees my ankle and calls 9-1-1 due to the company procedure with workplace injuries.

&amp;#x200B;

M = Manager

&amp;#x200B;

M - Okay, FluidBunny, can you tell me what happened?

&amp;#x200B;

Me - I was tripped as I tried to get the food out to these two lovely people (I gestured to the people who had helped me up)

&amp;#x200B;

EM - No you weren't! You just fell and now you're acting like a baby for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

She said this at the wrong moment, G, who is actually still my friend, happened to hear this and came over.

&amp;#x200B;

G - I'm sorry Ma'am, but FluidBunny here has a reason to scream because their ankle just got dislocated due to being tripped. And, from watching the security footage from our cameras during this incident while I was in our office, it was clearly you who tripped them.

&amp;#x200B;

EM - Well I never! How dare you accuse me of such a thing! I don't even see a camera in here.

&amp;#x200B;

M - Well, it is pointed directly at this table, (pointed out the camera) so, we can watch it back.

&amp;#x200B;

EM - She's just making up lies because she doesn't like children!

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Ma'am, I hate to be rude, but that is wrong. I have half a dozen baby brothers. I'm currently in an internship for education and I'm surrounded by children for two hours of my day.

&amp;#x200B;

It was then that the paramedics arrived. They set my ankle back and some police also arrived. My manager spoke to them privately, as well as the couple I had been getting food out to since they had seen the whole thing. They finally spoke to me and basically said that with the footage and the couple's statement and since I was injured, I could press charges on this woman. I decided not to since I feel like that would be making a big deal out of a situation I didn't want to be in, and just went back to doing my job. EM did get a life ban for her and her family from ever eating at the restaurant ever again."

I am not happy living where I am, but I am very good at procrastinating important life choices. I‚Äôve never had an official job in my life, the closest was an internship. I also don‚Äôt have a liscence cuz I‚Äôm terrified of driving.

I am currently going to a school that is right by four convenient things:
1- my dads work
2- my gym
3/4- two places I‚Äôm thinking of, and am likely to get a job at
Here‚Äôs the issue:
I‚Äôm extremely overweight. It‚Äôs not life threatening, but if I don‚Äôt do something soon, it‚Äôs well on it‚Äôs way to being. I can‚Äôt really diet properly, because I‚Äôll have a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù day and then I‚Äôll just throw it all out the window. So I figured, hey, I‚Äôll start going to the gym after school, I get out of school at 3:40 and my dad doesn‚Äôt get out of work until 8. That‚Äôs plenty of time to work out.

But then I remembered my plan. My dad is very mentally and emotionally... I‚Äôm hesitant to say abusive, cuz I know other parents are worse, but the cold and the flu are both sicknesses, just different levels of severity with different symptoms, you know? I‚Äôd like to move out when I‚Äôm 18, almost exactly a year from now, since my friend is also in an emotionally abusive house, so we can move out together and just eat away from all of that. I need /money/ for that. And I doubt anywhere will hire me for like one hour on some weekdays. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, weekends, right? Not an option ether. I have terrible trouble sleeping, even with sleep aid and all my devices turned off, and I kicked caffeine. The weekends are my time to catch up on sleep.
And ANOTHER issue: therapy. I‚Äôm trying to get into therapy, and also a psychiatrist, and see my doctor more regularly. And a lot of my issues come from my body image.

So
Sleep, school, money, mental health, and physical health. They all play a part in each together, and yet, it seems I can only have 3, MAYBE 4 if I push a FULL shedule. What should I do? "

I dunno if I'm just a piece of shit or if something else is going on, but I can't bring myself to give a shit about school or applying for internships or anything that I have to do. The worst part is that I'm barely even worried, whereas a couple of years ago I woulda been a nervous wreck. I have this vague sense of all this coming back to bite me in the ass in the future, but that's about it. 

I don't enjoy my major whatsoever and find it dreadfully boring, but I really don't think that's a good excuse. Plenty of people hate their majors/school and still push through despite their apathy. I just don't really care for whatever reason. 

I lost my health card and have to get a new one, but I can't bring myself to care enough to go get a new one. 

I should be studying for my exams during this reading week, but I've just been pissing my days away doing whatever. 

The only things I really enjoy are driving around and listening to music, going to the gym, and talking to this girl I have a really weird borderline relationship with. I know that it can never work out for a number of reasons and I know that once she's gone, there'll be this massive void that'll probably make this whole problem so much worse 'cause I actually love her. 

I feel really dissatisfied and bored with life for some reason. This sense of unfulfillment (probably not a word but whatever) is just looming over me. I'm 20 and it's been like this for a couple of years now and I'm scared that I'm running out of time to do something with my life.

From the very beginning I knew that there were differences between us that would lead to our demise. I didn't care. I cared about her, I wanted her in my life, I wanted to be happy and I wanted to be the person who would make her happy. It was selfish, I was naive...

&amp;#x200B;

And it was the best year and a half of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I fell head-over-heels in a few weeks that felt like days. We'd known each other for over a year by the time we started dating, we were very good friends and we had been involved for a while as well, it just felt right. She obviously felt the same way, since she was the first one to say she wanted to be together. I initially declined because I wasn't ready, I didn't know if a relationship was what I wanted, so we went our separate ways. I missed her every day that we were apart. After a month ---

&amp;#x200B;

\--I actually don't want to tell the whole story. It's long and nobody wants to hear it. I made this account because I just found out about this subreddit and I wanted to give it a shot. I've been holding a lot of this in and I don't want to. I have a therapist through my university, shes great but we only see each other once every two weeks and an hour never feels like enough time. --

&amp;#x200B;

Over the year and a half we were together, we met each other's families, took trips together, made beautiful memories and had incredible times. It was the longest, happiest, and healthiest relationship I've ever had. And I've been in a few of those. She was my rock, my safe place, my own personal heaven that was always there for me. And I threw it all away over a feeling that I couldn't make go away. The same voice that told me it wouldn't last at the beginning. That I had silenced for so long never stayed buried. I fell in love with the most amazing woman I've ever had in my life, but some part of me always knew that I was using her. I hate myself every day for it. 

I finally acknowledged my feelings and I ended it. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I have missed her every single day for three months and two days. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has been the hardest three months of my entire life. I'm surprised I've even made it this far. It has been a very long, very dark road without the only light I had in my life. I miss her so fucking much.

&amp;#x200B;

We go to the same university, different colleges/majors. Her building is almost on the complete opposite end of campus, so we haven't run into each other by accident yet. My place of work is in between our two buildings, and the nearest parking garage to my job is right behind her building. I've avoided that garage for weeks and today I decided to park there on the way to work. I just got off work. Now I'm sitting in her building, crying over my laptop as I type this. 

I know I won't run into her here at this time, it's almost midnight. I just needed to be somewhere that felt like I was close to her. I don't know how else to describe it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I made the right decision in breaking up with her. I don't even know why I'm writing this here. This doesn't even feel like a satisfying description of what I'm going through. I just wanted to tell somebody that I'm here, in the fucking Psychology building, crying and hoping that she's doing okay without me. I hope she's doing better than I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying really hard to be productive, to become the man she would've deserved to be with for all that time. I'm waiting on an internship, I got two research jobs, I'm just trying to figure myself out. To be the best version of me that I can be. 

And I'm trying to convince myself that this is for me. I know I shouldn't hold out hope that she'll take me back one day, that ship has most certainly sailed. I don't even know if she *should* take me back, if I'll ever deserve it. 

I just hope she's doing well for herself. 

I hope this stops hurting soon.

And I hope my room mate is home"

I ended getting the right answer but I‚Äôm worried she thought I needed help too much or asked too many questions. I asked her what her favorite project is and what the best part of the job and she gave me enthusiastic answers. Then she gave me her email to feel free to ask any questions. I asked her how I did and she said I did great! The second part of the interview was a man who asked me what I was hoping to get out of the job and what I see myself doing after college and in five years. I stuttered a lot because I was nervous. He talked a lot about his experiences as a tester. He really explained everything in detail of what his job was like. That went on for about 40 minutes. Then the last part I had a conversation with a man where he discussed a lot the software they were doing and using. This went on for the remaining of the two hours. He showed me the technology they have implemented and the things that past interns had done and how the work environment was. At the end he told me he would have the other software engineer(recruiter)who wasn‚Äôt present that day contact me with next steps in the process. I then asked for his business card. 
askigr,11,2019-02-20,How much hope is left?,jacksarewild907,IncelsWithoutHate,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelsWithoutHate/comments/askigr/how_much_hope_is_left/,"I am unsure if I am seeking advice or just the fact that I am not alone in my struggles. This is my first post, and here is my story.

I've struggled with romance my whole life. I am 32 years old now. I will be 33 soon. College has come and gone. Though I have more coursework to do for a career change, virtually everyone at university is at least 10 years younger than me.

This sub caught my attention as it appears to have many mutually struggling people here and the ""without the hate"" creed aligns with my values.

I've glossed over the incel community before because I saw some similarities with my situation but was shy about participating. Most here in this sub seem quite friendly and are also hurting and looking for some mutual respect. As am I.

""Involuntary"" celibacy suggests there is an immutable aspect working against someone who desires a physical relationship. For me, my neurotype cannot change; I am forever autistic. I am also just under the average height for men in the U.S., and even modern surgery cannot change that. I carry genes for clinical depression and anxiety as both run in my family. It is not surprising I have faced many challenges.

Here are some ""highlights"" from some of my attempts to make a romantic connection. Readers, feel free to skip it for brevity, but for the sake of experience, I encourage to follow:

***
   In my late teens, I changed universities and crushed on a girl with whom I took a science course at my old school. Facebook was a new thing then and I tried communicating with her, but due to my autistic tendencies (I was undiagnosed at the time) and my poor social skills, I interacted a bit too much with her social media. I thought I was benignly showing interest. When I found out she was moving to my city, a dropped her a DM confessing my feelings. Her friends accused me of cyberstalking and said she was scared. Very cringeworthy.

   In my early 20s, I got hooked by the PUA culture and dropped about $100 on an ebook plus a $20/month subscription for dating tips on audio CDs by mail. I had a crush at a student job and I tried some of the tips from the media to get a Valentine's Day date. I nearly got fired. My employer kept me because I was one of their best employees and I demonstrated willingness to take responsibility for my actions. The young lady ended up quitting her job, dropping the French class in which we were classmates, and moved out of town. I managed to can the PUA subscription, but I still get spam emails from them to this day.

   I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (now considered part of the autism spectrum) at age 23. This gave me some insight into some of my challenges and years of therapy at the university helped me build some limited social skills. But it seems it wasn't enough.

   In my mid 20s, I worked at a bookstore. There was a cute young woman who worked with me there. She looked absolutely gorgeous in a red sequined dress she was wearing to a blind date one night as she left work. I was haunted by my previous failures, but I figured I'd give it another try.
   We seemed to click. We spent some time together in the break room after work and talked about video games. We browsed comics and manga; one of the other coworkers even called us ""you two"" during that encounter. I took her to the hospital once as she was facing a medical complication; she thanked me and said she owed me coffee. At the coffee shop, we compared dreams and aspirations. She wanted to be a psychologist and settle down. She dreamed of keeping a greyhound.
   Then, as the weeks went by, she mysteriously seemed to give off different vibes. It would be quiet and awkward in the break room. She mentioned along the line that ""Boyfriends are too much trouble,"" and I didn't get the hint. Hindsight is a bitch, isn't it?
   Things went downhill from there. Through the holiday season, whenever I started thinking about her, a panic attack would strike me, even while on the clock. After New Year's, she left for an ""internship."" The manager called me into his office during one of my panic attacks and said something along the lines of ""We don't care about [her name]!"" At this point it became clear my infatuation had been discussed by management behind my back. I was told to get my shit together. I put in my two-weeks-notice the next day.

   I haven't worked a paid position since.

TL;DR: I've screwed up with women over and over again for more than a decade.

In the years that followed, I've had fewer chances to connect with anyone. School was done. Work was scattered and limited. I don't have many friends.

My politics are liberal. When I started going back to school off and on seeking a career change in medical work, I got involved with a feminist student club right around the time there were renewed political attacks against Planned Parenthood. I think I might have found my niche. We cried together when You-Know-Who got elected. I've volunteered with the group for a few years, but I was quickly starting to realize that I am that weird old guy who's 10 years older than everyone.

I'm sure you're scratching your head at this point, what the hell is a feminist sympathizer doing here, why is he considering identifying as incel? Isn't that a paradox?

Here's why. These facts are working against me:

‚Ä¢ I am autistic, so I can't tell if a girl is into me.

‚Ä¢ Eye contact more than about 750 milliseconds terrifies me.

‚Ä¢ I am diagnosed with depression, so my self-esteem usually isn't that great.

‚Ä¢ I am also diagnosed with anxiety, so my confidence takes a huge blow. Women can sense my fear for miles.

‚Ä¢ I'm in my 30s, but almost everyone I know are in their early 20s or younger.

‚Ä¢ The only people I know my age are people from high school. They have all moved on, married, and started families.

‚Ä¢ I am 5' 7 1/2"" (171 cm), shorter than what many women consider attractive in my geographical area.

‚Ä¢ I am 250 lb (113 kg), making me obese.

‚Ä¢ All of my family and I struggle with weight. (My mother tells me ""I carry my weight well,"" but of course she says that; she's my mother).

‚Ä¢ I have above average body hair...except on my head.

‚Ä¢ I wear glasses.

‚Ä¢ I like video games and Pok√©mon.

‚Ä¢ I'm broke and live with my parents.

‚Ä¢ My social circle is very limited.

‚Ä¢ I live in an area where manly outdoorsy alpha males get all the women.

‚Ä¢ I am nonreligious and a firm believer in Darwinism, and I realize the cruel irony that it's working against me. Even science doesn't have my back.

‚Ä¢ I've considered suicide a few times in my life. I've been hospitalized four times.

‚Ä¢ I am moving somewhere where therapy might not be available.

On the other hand, could these facts potentially work...for...me?

‚Ä¢ I like reptiles and have snake handling experience.

‚Ä¢ I like animals.

‚Ä¢ I volunteer very regularly, at least a few times a week.

‚Ä¢ I have an interest in space and astrophotography.

‚Ä¢ I like books.

‚Ä¢ I like the arts. I sometimes write in my free time.

‚Ä¢ I am interested in world languages and can speak some Japanese and a little French.

‚Ä¢ I have a university education.

‚Ä¢ Despite my depression, I strive to care for myself enough. I almost never have a ""neckbeard.""

‚Ä¢ I work out 4-5 days a week, mostly long brisk walks of around 8 km. Pok√©mon GO really keeps me motivated.

‚Ä¢ I recieve therapy where I can hone my social skills.

‚Ä¢ I am soon moving somewhere that is more diverse and inclusive than where I am now, but it will be somewhat rural. There is a college town nearby.

‚Ä¢ I have a worldview that treats women as equal, not greater or lesser. I support reproductive rights like access to birth control, even though that doesn't directly affect me.

If you're still with me, thank you for taking the time to read my story. There may be a little hope, but I feel that my age is working against me.

Is it over? Or will it begin someday?
I guess only time will tell. Share your thoughts."

What would be the difference between working an internship at ESRI, as opposed to Google or Amazon? 
I haven't thought about applying, because I would prefer the academia route, but the academia route is starting to scare me a bit, so I was possibly looking into a back up plan to intern somewhere and then maybe get a full time position.

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"
asl4ut,2,2019-02-20,Need advice after tough breakup,NickNickNickx3,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/asl4ut/need_advice_after_tough_breakup/,"I (22m) was with my girlfriend (23f) for 6 years. Everything was great until she went to college in a different city while I was still in high school. She met a co-worker (Guy1) that I quickly sensed there was something going on. I noticed everything about her changes; how she talked to me, treated me, etc. I expressed my feelings to her about him, but she said they were just friends and she had no feelings for him. This is where the trust issues started. She was so reluctant to let go of this guy for our relationship. (Key note: She would go back to talking to Guy1 throughout the years.) We played Xbox together and met some people doing so. One guy, in his late 30's at the time, started coming onto her. She worked overnights and I found out this guy got her number/snapchat and was texting her while she worked. This dude went the whole 10 yards. Bikini picture off my gf's Facebook (from when she was like 15) as his wallpaper and everything. I told her my feelings, she was reluctant at first but then ended up ghosting him. Fast forward some time, she decided to get job where I worked for some extra cash. There was a worker who everyone knew was the ""ideal"" fuck boy (Guy2). This guy brags about how he sleeps with so many girls and says relationships are overrated. Should I mention this job was at a K-8 Catholic school? My sister has worked there many years before. Turns out, he has tried to sleep with basically every female who had ever worked there. So I reached out to some of them and they all confirmed that he tried to sleep with them. Well, he gets my gf's snapchat and number and starts doing his fuck boy stuff. Obviously, knowing this guy, I didn't like this. Told my gf, and she was reluctant to ghost him. I leave for a two-week family vacation to Michigan and my gf decided not to go because she needed the money from work. My family decided to come back early. I decide to not tell her; I was going to show up at her work (restaurant) and surprise her. I show up - she is not surprised, she looked scared or something. She runs to the back and then comes back and says she needs to talk to me outside. We go outside and she tells me she invited Guy2 over that night to MY house; she claimed it was to play Xbox. I asked to see her phone and the only text was him saying ""Are you going to be a good little slut to me tonight?"" (She deleted the rest). She came home after work and we talked. I don't know why but I ended up believing her that her intentions were to play Xbox. Yes, I am stupid, I know. Even before this point of the relationship, trust was already non-existent. Throughout the years, I had always held onto these three situations. Every time we argued, I would bring it up and she would hate it (more to come). Five months later, I was going out of state for an internship. At this point, the relationship was at a low. We 'mutually' decided to take a break (limit contact and such) while I left and then we would reevaluate when I got back. I knew I wanted to be with her but she didn't know if she wanted to be with me (shocker). This was the first time I was going out of state alone and it was the first time in 5 years I wasn't able to talk to her (we talked basically 24/7). After a few days, it was killing me and I ended up regularly talking to her again. I find out she reached out to Guy1 the day after I left. I confronted Guy1 and he ended up on my side (we're actually friends now). He tells me that she told him not to worry about me when he asked why she was contacting him and that they went on a date two days after I left. I asked my gf about this and she lied, not knowing Guy1 told me the truth. She said it wasn't a date and that they were just ""catching up"". Guy1 ended up ghosting her since ""she was a snake"" and he doesn't want those type of people in his life. November 2018, 3 months after I get back from my internship, I get the same feeling about a new co-worker (Guy3). I expressed my feelings, again, and she was reluctant, again; even more so this time than the previous 3 times. Since that day, we started getting into arguments left and right over the dumbest things. Towards the end of January, she left me. Although the relationship was at an all time low, it was actually very sudden and unexpected. Two days later, she gets drunk and makes out with Guy3 - getting two hickies on her neck. By the way, Guy3 has a baby on the way. She also reaches out to Guy1 who instantly ghosted her. Two days after that, I contact Guy1. Turns out, my gf went to him every time her and I had a relationship issue. He proceeds to tell me that she admitted to him, on the date they went on, that she cheated on me and had sex with Guy2. I end up going to my gf and telling her what I was told. She tells me she had sex with Guy2 twice and the night I came home would've been the third time. Today, I happened to be able to read a live conversation she was having with a co-worker(Guy4) that worked with her and Guy1. She was trying to get Guy4 to contact Guy1 and get him to talk to her because ""I miss him so much"". According to her, her and Guy1 liked each other when she moved there for college but neither wanted to leave their relationships for each other. She said he was her best friend and that he knows her better than anyone (seriously?). She also said that he would go to her apartment and watch movies until 3AM.

Thus, I have learned more truth in the last 3 weeks than I did the last 4 years of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

We would bring up many times that the first two years of our relationship were amazing and that it sort of plateaued or declined from there. There was trust, loyalty, respect, appreciation, etc. issues - for the most part, caused by her. Now it makes sense though, right? It was because she met Guy1 and I was wary of this for 4 long years. For a year and a half, I always wondered if she actually cheated on me with Guy2. I love and care about this girl with my whole heart. She was my best friend and lover. Although, I never got the same feelings in return after year 2. Thinking back, she treated me awful for the greater part of our relationship. I didn't feel loved, cared for, wanted, etc. Was I blind? So blinded by love to see what was actually happening? Afraid to be alone? Everyone tells me I am better off without her, but I still want to be with her, as stupid as it sounds. What do I do from here? I am living through a roll coaster of emotions. One second, I want the worst revenge for her cheating, and the next, I want to be with her. How do I recover from this? I now question what love even is. This is because I loved this girl with everything I had and this is what I get in return. What is love? Why did this happen to me? Where did I go wrong? What do I do? There are so many questions I don't have answers for."

I recently had a stroke of luck and opportunity and aquired an outstanding internship this upcoming summer (starts in May) in Japan. While the company I'll be working for speaks exclusively in English, I know that I should learn as much Japanese as possible to get the most out of the 90 days I'll be spending in Japan. 

I was wondering what the recommended path would be to quickly learn enough Japanese to not be totally lost while staying there for such a long duration. I'm currently going through Duolingo and going to look into purchasing Genki I + workbook.

Is there anything else that'll help me learn as much as possible in such a short time?

Should I look into finding a class nearby and go that route?

Thanks for a advice.

He thought it was really sad. It brought up some memories and I can't stop crying now.

I've been depressed since I was younger, it probably started when I was around 13 or 14. I never recognized it as depression and thought I was a difficult teenager, but I never felt worthy or good. I started cutting myself around that age and someone at school noticed. They called it a scream for attention and called my mom. She said I was making her looking bad, like a boogeyman and I should stop immediately. 

My depression only became worse. I escaped an abusive relationship that cut me off from all my friends and left me with an eating disorder. I think I just wanted to be self destructive in a different way. But I just walked right into the next abusive relationship. I went to a college that was horrible, there were literally no qualified teachers and they just opened the year I started. I only went there because it was close to home and my parents didn't have to pay for me to travel there. (College works a little different here, I was only 16 when I started)

My self esteem hit an all time low, but no one saw it. I dreamed of killing myself a lot. Luckily I got out of the relationship when my ex tried to cheat on me. School came crashing down on my because of the anxiety I got from it, I couldn't even go there anymore. I finally told my mom everything and we went to my GP, who gave me an urgency referral to the psychiatric ward in my hospital. It took a while to get a diagnosis, but it was extreme depression, they kinda feared for my life, and anxiety.

I started treatment. I talked with a psychiatrist, a therapist and had group therapy. Just with a bunch of young adults like me, some had issues with their self esteem, some were pathological liars, or had insomnia. None if them had a depression and I didn't fit in, so I just started to fake it.

I also had a session with my parents 'family therapy'. Oh they were awesome there. I cried so much when I told them everything was just too much, I couldn't do it anymore. They said it was gonna be okay, they understand. But when we came home, I still had to go to school and they were pushing me to also get a job. They never understood how it was too much.

My mom got an intern at her job. She was a distant relative and had depression. Oh how kind she was to that girl. Told me she understood her, how she knew that some days she couldn't come in, that she needed my moms help. I felt so lost in that moment, because she said all the things I needed to hear but about someone else. 

Therapy didn't help at all. I couldn't open up, I stopped going. I got medication from my GP that helped a lot, but they were only temporarily. He didn't want me to become reliable on the medication. When I stopped, I still really wanted to kill myself very much. It just felt different. But the depression came back a few months later.

I do have an amazing boyfriend. He's sweet and not abusive. The depression is still here and he told me once we finish school and get a good paying job, he will send me to a good therapist to help me out. And it got worse again, we finished school and got jobs. I had a team leader at work who was very extrovert, while I'm very introverted. He didn't like that, said he can't read me. He doesn't like the way I work, while everything I did was great. He just didn't tell me how good I was doing until he got to my self esteem and told me how much better I did in the past. Constantly asked me if I really wanted this job and that there were so many other jobs out there. I tried to please him, doing extra stuff to show him I'm here and I want to be here. 

One day I just called in sick because I couldn't go anymore. My mom and boyfriend asked me how I was doing, but I couldn't answer. Their next question was 'when are you going back to work?'. It feels like that's all they care about. Well, I'm supposed to be a functioning adult, but I wish someone would interfere and help me, because no one will and I just can't do it myself. I've made so many plans to die in the last few months. My boyfriend is sad for other peoples depression, but when I tell him about mine he tells me he doesn't know how it feels and he doesn't know how to help me. It is also my own fault for not asking for help. 

TL;DR: I've had depression since 13/14 am now 26 and no one really cares, while they care for others and I don't know how to ask for help because I need to be a functioning adult "

I debated even DMing you for a few hours, I even asked my roommate if I should, he urged me to. We talked for a few weeks, I got your Snapchat, we talked there for a few more weeks, I asked you for your number, I knew if I didn‚Äôt when I did, I never would. We talked, met up between classes a few times. You mentioned wanting to start watching my favorite show. I kept my cool and didn‚Äôt get excited. I told you we should watch it at your place that night. We spent more time talking and getting to know one another than we did watching the show. This went on for a week. You started to ask me to come over instead of me asking if I could see you. We talked about deeper things, you came and sat with me while I worked on homework. My friends adored you, said we made a cute couple. I told you I had feelings for you and you said the same, I brought up is dating and you said it was bad timing, the year was coming to an end and I was going to be at an internship out of state for the summer. That same night, you asked me to stay the night for the first time and you made a move. We slept together for the first time. I was hooked and you knew it. I had gotten rid of any hint of tinder or any girl that would cause a problem. I wanted you and only you in my life. I practically lived at your apartment for the next month. You paraded me around your softball games, the local bar on thirsty Thursdays, and at my theatre shows. To everyone but us, we were together... I left for my internship and hated it, you weren‚Äôt there. I didn‚Äôt even give it a chance. You drove 9 hours to stay a weekend with me and I cleared everything to spend it all with you. You left and I was working my ass off to come home to you. I realized that the feelings I had for you weren‚Äôt that of lust, I was in love with you. I made plans for after graduation this year, I was willing to do anything if it meant I got to keep you in my life, I wasn‚Äôt going to lose you. 

4 days from coming home, you told me that you no longer had feelings for me. Never mind that you told me a week before that you were pissed a girl at my internship was flirting with me, you had hated the idea that I had close female friends. I reassured you every step of the way. After telling me you didn‚Äôt have feelings, you let it slip that there was someone else and that he had been around for months. I was lost, I finished work, came home in a daze, and just waited for school to start back. I made the mistake of remaining close friends with you. I got a million apologies from you and none of it mattered. My mental health deteriorated, you started using me as a shoulder to cry on when your new boyfriend treated you like shit. I was an idiot and went with it. I started to have suicidal thoughts, you could tell I wasn‚Äôt okay and asked what was wrong, I broke down and told you how you had destroyed me. For almost a year, led me on and dropped me as soon as your bed no longer had me in it. I didn‚Äôt tell you about my thoughts because I still didn‚Äôt want you to worry. Weeks went by and I got scared. I was driving and thought about just ending it. I immediately reached out to a professor I trusted and she made sure I got help. I told you about it a week later once I was released from inpatient care and you told me I needed to grow up, that I was selfish, that I was emotionally draining, and that I should have just done it. I decided there to cut contact with you. I haven‚Äôt spoken to you since. I still think about you every day and I hate it. I want to be done.

asmyt5,2,2019-02-20,Out of an odd relationship and I'm having a hard time understanding and reflecting on it.,ifnotdefine,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/asmyt5/out_of_an_odd_relationship_and_im_having_a_hard/,"\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :

I was in a relationship with a girl who said she had just broken up with ex who was controlling and deceptive. After a month she went back to him and nearly denied all she said before. I'm trying to understand why? (based on the details and the magnitude provided in the text.)

&amp;#x200B;

I wanna thank you up front for reading this long text that's most likely full of errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl who said she just got out of a relationship.

At the moment I didn't know much about her ex, but she said he was controlling. I got into a relationship with her. We broke up after a month, and she told me things that I probably should have known before getting into a relationship with her. Regardless, this is my story and my question of what happened to me and what I learned later on.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21 yo college student. This text is about me, a 21 yo girl and her 23 yo boyfriend in the same college.

&amp;#x200B;

Her boyfriend was deceptive. He was lying about pretty much everything (where he was or what he did, ....). He is controlling as well. He would stalk her physically, showing up to places where she might be meeting guys. He had all her social media, school, and primary email passwords. She told me they have been together for three years. I naturally asked why she would stay in such a relationship. She said because he was with her in her ""low points.""

&amp;#x200B;

The girl I'm talking about is at the moment fit and athletic but used to be overweight. She looks great, and she works out a lot. However, she is extremely insecure about her body. She has an eating disorder(chewing and spitting). She says she hates herself and when I said I liked the way she looked she said I have low standards. She ranks people based on being good looking. She said she wants to bring justice to the world and ""justice is when people are treated based on how good they look"" and by becoming good looking, she was going to establish it. Through those years she said she begged her boyfriend to call her beautiful (he didn't). She came to the conclusion that because she's fat, she has to be called fat. She begged him to call her fat. He called her fat once out of force, and she said that gave her pleasure. She said she asked him to have sex with a skinner and fitter girl in front of her (didn't happen).

&amp;#x200B;

These were her low points as she described and she said he was with her all the way. She also mentioned that her parents are abusive. They hit her, make fun of her weight, and nothing is ever enough for them. She said she wants to escape with her BF when they graduate. One specific behaviour from him that she was mad about was that he said she should have a private Snapchat and make money while they're gone together because his parents wouldn't give him money since they don't approve of her. Another behaviour that was not understandable to me was that she gave him money to spend when they would hang out so that he wouldn't spend money. Then they would get into fights because he would keep some of the money and deny she gave it to him. This happened while her boyfriend's parents are actually wealthy. He owns two cars back in his town. When I started talking to her, he found out, and he basically lied to her about my life and my whereabouts. He said that he saw me being with multiple girls. He said I applied to the company he interns in and that my resume/cv was horrible and he rejected me. He said he wants to deport me from the country. Such things seemed so childish to me, but she cared a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

When we got together, she said she's just out of a relationship, and her ex will only come to some events because he already has tickets. In our relationship, which lasted about a month, I felt that she is mostly concerned with the sexual aspect of the relationship. She would continuously seek admiration, and she would repeatedly compare to her ex, saying how he was horrible at this and that. This was odd to me because I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about my past relationships with someone I am currently with. She would bring up her ex almost in every conversation. After a month, she said she needs spaces and that we shouldn't meet for a while. I got concerned, and she ended up telling me most of the things I mentioned above.

After not talking for a couple of days, I messaged her asking what she was doing and how her life has been. She said that why would I wanna know and I said because I care. She said that I'm checking on her because I'm jealous of her boyfriend (her ex) and that she's back with him. I asked her about the past, and she denied all of it. She said he just loves her too much and that now he's no longer jealous or insecure because they are together. She said he wasn't lying and he has proof that for example, I was cheating on her. I said I wasn't and I asked for evidence. She said she won't give it and that she trusts him. I stopped talking to her. Another friend of her said she has given up all her passwords again and their relationship is back as usual. It took me a week or two to recover from this. However, it's still a mystery to me why she would stay with this guy and why was she lying for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this sounds too bizarre but it did happen to me and it did hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm (M 21) here for some help at my relationship. Everything's going really really nice with her (25), but looks like some past problems arent letting me enjoy it rn.

Here's some BG:

I've got a lot of trust problems in my yet short existance. Starting by a missing father, who leave me when i was only 5, to a once supporting family  since his departure, but whose also turned their back for me since my soccer career went downhill, letting me literally alone (some healthy problems allied to more trust issues, like my ex-agent trying to steal my future contracts money). Besides my father situation, a lot of those things came in a really short space of time. 

And most because all that, after some tests, it was pointed out by doctors that I've devolopted a deep depression alongside case, alongside anxiety. Started the treatment with medicines and theraphy sessions, but atm i thought it wasnt enought, I wasnt feeling myself better, like it wasnt worthy. Attempted the worst at 2016 Christmas eve. 

After wake up when it went wrong and recovered a little bit, some change-live thoughts went like a thunder. Proceeded to call one of my best friend asking for a place to begin my restart, he and his mother gently received me and then things started to click.

Started to work at a pharmacy, while got back to college (Journalism) and proceeded to, with some saved money frow work and soccer days + some good decisions investing, buy my own apartment. In top of that, I‚Äôve a little bit lucky turning a half-time internship in a radio station in a full-time job as a sports commentator, being the main man in a daily program and at live games also.

And in the middle of all that, i meet her. She was the head pharmacist at my old work and we started to become closer after she suffer a heist at our pharmacy. At the time she was in the middle of a 5y, non-productive and some kind of relationship with a almost 30 guy. We became really close friends in the purest and nicest way possible, talking about everything, openly talking even about my histories going out and meeting other girls in bars/parties etc. 

But we started to became closer, learning and caring about each other. In this process she started to talk openly about break up with that guy, and I handled it in the most fair way I could, even thinking with myself if i was starting to fall in love. Never rushed about break up things quickly, only helped her to figure if it was that what she really wanted it, if it was the right way, all that kind of stuff. 

Some weeks after she got it done, I was already out of the pharmacy, but we keep in touch texting and she told almost every single day how it was fun we had back in the days, how much she missed it. So we proceed to go out, eat something, but then she wanted to see my new place (that new apartment). There we got some beer, music and a lot of really nice talk. In the end of the night, she was sleeping on my leap (nothing happened), and i finnaly realized I was in love, even if i was not that confortable in that situation.

From that beyond I became more evasive about me when texting her, always poiting about she still being young even after a long relatioship, free to enjoy single‚Äôs live. The days passed and I started to fade more and more, trying hide my feelings. When i didn't answer her for almost a entire day, she asked me out invinting me to a Rock cover concert at a club. I accepted it because 2 work friends of us were going also and, in the end of the day, I was already missing her. In that night I got the confirmation about my feelings, couldnt hold then anymore. At the same time, I was also thinking about how good to her would be meet some people without anything holding back, really enjoying go out again. When I figured it out and decided that, with her, a one-night stand would definetly not be enought , and was about to leave, she grabbed my arm and told me about her feelings about me. For my luck, they were the same as mine's.

From that day beyond, things are working really really well. Her parents love me, and I've meeted the rest of the family on this past christmas/new year's eve holidays. We spent a lot of time together but it still a pretty healthy and nice relationship. We‚Äôre making progress together and in our individual challenges, helping each other. She was a very important part in my work-change and in that kind-of early sucess in my area (even when we were just friends), while she proceeded to go back to studies and pursue her real dream of being a english teacher. And allied with a complete change of mood (for a better one, at last is what her mom told me), and a lot of studies to the vestibular (Brazil's colleges admissional tests), she got approved here in our city and her classes are about to start. We already adopted a puppy and got some plains about live together.

So, as you can se, its everything close to perfect in this 8 months, but sometimes i still thinking about possible cheating, trust betrayal in general and sometimes, even with her not giving me any sight of something like that, i caught myself looking at my past problems as a heads-up to not let my guard down again, suffering in antecipation. But it kinda hurts me because I really love her and want to be more easy going about that subject to enjoy even more of that good time. Most important, that's unfair with her, being actually nothing short to the most amazing person i've meet in my life. She's really helping me in all the means, and looks like really love me also, while i‚Äôm always happy and plasured to help her also mas see her strive and achieve a better life and her dreams.

But what i have to do? Broke things up before it become even serious and take care of it alone? Use that experience to keep pushing me out of that thoughts? Let myself go cuz she's the one? I‚Äôm really confused and any advice would be nice.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm in a amazing relationship and really love my partner, but sometimes catch myself thinking about past trust problems w other people (including close family, agents while i was playing soccer, leading to problems w/ depression and anxiety). It makes me feel really really sad and i didn‚Äôt know what to do.

I'm sorry to write that much, even if i took a lot of things out but felt like it was needed to explain al the history behind. I'm open to ask any questions about it and also to future updates if needed.

aso2mw,7,2019-02-20,Traumatic palliative care (tw: death),venonathalie,StudentNurse,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/aso2mw/traumatic_palliative_care_tw_death/,"I'm a second year nursing student in Switzerland, so I don't know how the course is organized in other countries, but we have a 6 week internship per semester, my last practical experience was on a private surgical ward and I had opportunites to see and do a lot.

But with all the good I had, there was also bad. I had a patient who had terminal cancer, he was 68. One day he was fine, and two weeks later he was on his deathbed. I looked after this man, did my best to keep a brave face when he begged for the sweet release of death, begged me to kill him. One morning he got his wish, he died at 6h45 exactly 12 days ago.

The situation already touched me very deeply for personal reasons: my father has cancer and is in his 60's, it's as if I got a sick preview of what my father will have to live through, what I will have to live through. When I looked at this man, all I saw was my Dad.

I know from a professional stand point it isn't ideal, no longer empathy but compassion, putting my in a compromising position. But that isn't all. I helped take care of the body, get his stuff, take him to the morgue. It felt like his eyes followed me around the room, I swear that I could see him move from the corner of my eye. But I know he's dead, his body cold, waxy and yellow, the sickely smell of death in his room. This is my first confrontation with death head on, no casquet between me and the desceaced, a puppet without his puppeteer.

I did what needed to be done, and I went on with my day. I thought that was all.

But I still have nightmares, reliving every second of his pleading for the end, his eyes following me round the room, seeing is vacant face as if it was burnt into my retinas, the smell... Everything.

I don't know why this man haunts me, why I can't shake this. Has anyone had any experience with dealing with palliative care or has lived through the same kind of experience? I'm tired and need to let this go, I just need to know how to do that.

Thanks for your time"
asocov,2,2019-02-20,Coworker constantly following me,bellabella28,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/asocov/coworker_constantly_following_me/,"Let‚Äôs call him R. I recently started an internship, probably the biggest company I‚Äôve ever worked with. 
Everyone was so nice, including R. As a personality, he comes off extremely shy and awkward but comfortable enough to crack jokes with his coworkers. Everyone and i mean EVERYONE loves him as a person since he‚Äôs so shy and nice.
I noticed that at least 3 times a week, he would leave work the same time i did. Now, he does it everyday. As soon as i pack up, and believe me I‚Äôve tried to do it quickly, he packs up and leaves immediately after me. So for the past few weeks he has been leaving as soon as i leave. 

When I tried to walk directly to the bathroom after leaving and hide in there for ten minutes, he waited behind the GLASS DOOR to wait until i leave the bathroom and once again leave the same time as me. 

This is where it gets annoying. 
Yesterday, I THOUGHT i was successful in running away from him. I left so quickly I was able to leave work alone without him catching up, or so i thought. As soon as i leave the building i look to my left and he‚Äôs next to me. I walk slowly and watch him go inside the train station. 
When i see him do that, i walk to Target retail store next to the station. A minute later...... he‚Äôs next to me in the store going ‚Äúoh hey!‚Äù.....

I tried to confront him and told him, ‚Äúwhy are you here? I just saw you go in the train station.‚Äù 
He walked away awkwardly. 
Today, despite being somewhat confronted (i guess he didn‚Äôt get the idea) he still leaves at the same time as me. 
Am i being dramatic? I know this is just a crush and he doesn‚Äôt have any evil intentions. But it‚Äôs creeping me out and invading my personal space.
ALL my coworkers love him, and I‚Äôm the only girl there. My coworkers are for the most part sexist, and tend to blame the woman in situations like this. 
Do i confront him? What can i say? Or am I overreacting and this is just a crush on his side?

asojvk,2,2019-02-20,German M.Sc Clinical Psychology - Entering US job market?,Koerogi,clinicalpsych,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalpsych/comments/asojvk/german_msc_clinical_psychology_entering_us_job/,"Hello friends, I am a dual citizen and possess both American and German citizenship, passports etc but have lived in Germany for basically all of my life. I am currently getting my B.Sc. in Clinical Psychology in a German college and intend to get my M.Sc. in either Clinical Psychology Or Psychosocial Counseling directly thereafter. So I have a few questions that I hope some of you might be able to answer please as I would like to move to the United States once I have completed my education. My dream is to one day own my own psychotherapists practice there.

1) What would be my chances of finding a clinical internship in the united states with either degree as a total outsider? I have work experience as I have completed a three year vocational training previously in Germany as a Media and Information specialist, but nothing closely related to the field of psychology itself.

2) Will I get anywhere with a masters in either case or do I explicitly need a doctorate first to become licensed in the states?

3) If I want to become the stereotypical cartoon therapist with a long brown couch for patients. Would you recommend Clinical Psychology or Psychosocial Counseling? They seem to overlap each other somewhat in their capacities.

4) Are there any hurdles I might be unaware of?

Thank you very much!"
asoljx,1,2019-02-20,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/asoljx/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! 

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"
asonmj,1,2019-02-20,"My friend needs advice. Please, help me help her.",LovingRamen,veterinarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/veterinarians/comments/asonmj/my_friend_needs_advice_please_help_me_help_her/,"My friend, a 21 year old University student in her 3rd year, needs advice from experienced ex-alumni.

A short backstory: as you can imagine, she's wanted to be a vet ever since she was a kid; she's great with animals and she loves the researching aspect of working with them, specifically animal behaviour. She's worked with vets and worked for some time at a Manatee Conservation Center; she's gone on a couple of internships and she's always motivated to learn more. Her major problem is the classes. For some time, she's struggled with a few classes in her concentration. Most recently, she decided to retake Zoology after passing with only a C last semester. Thing is, she's also taking microbiology and some other class about artificial insemination plus two laboratories and working for extra credit in the Zoology lab.

  


The main situation right now is that she got a C in her last microbiology test and found out today that she got a C in the Zoology test. I can imagine you understand her struggle. In her own words she's ""done"". She's failed one too many times and it's taking a toll on her mental health. It's not like she's not going to commit suicide but she is depressed.

  


I want to help her. I'm the only friend she has nearby this semester but I have no idea how. I'm a slacker, I never cared much about my grades until this semester so I don't have any way of really understanding her problem. I thought maybe I could show her some advice from the vets that went through the University experience. 

  


What was yours like? Can you relate to her? If so, how did you cope? What can I do to ease her pain? Anything would help.

  


Thank you."

For several reasons, I'll be working/doing an internship in this semester of my CS Master (General track)...

aspq5s,9,2019-02-20,Is technical writing right for me? Am I ready to enter the field?,paintballer2112,technicalwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/aspq5s/is_technical_writing_right_for_me_am_i_ready_to/,"Hello /r/technicalwriting,

I'll try to keep this brief.
I'm a recent grad with a BA in English (journalism and professional writing). For the last two years I've had my eye on technical writing as my field of choice. The work seemed like it matched my experience and what I liked doing (communicating complex info to diverse audiences). Despite this, I have pretty much zero familiarity with IT-type concepts, computer programming, engineering, etc. I'm willing to learn but I feel really behind where I should be. I've read numerous times here that I should begin assembling a portfolio and doing documentation for open source projects to gain some experience, and I plan to but I feel like I'm not cut out for this in the sense that I am actively applying for TW jobs right now, without having this vital skill. I've done what my school called a technical writing internship, but I never did technical documentation similar to what is talked about on this subreddit. (It was almost entirely just taking complex jargon from my city's comprehensive master plan toward sustainability efforts and translating it in to plain English for public audience.)

Now I'm wondering if I should put a career in TW on the back burner, and instead focus on finding another writing job (content writing, report writing, etc.) to gain transferable skills and also use my downtime to prepare myself for breaking in to TW down the road. I don't know which is a better choice for me.

In summation, if I have all the necessary skills of a TW *except* knowledge of IT-related concepts, can this be learned as I go, or should I put a job in TW on hold until I have a better familiarity?

Alternatively, are there TW jobs in other industries (other than software, engineering, etc.) that would not require so much technical knowledge of computers and coding?

What's my best course of action? TIA for your help!"

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older. 

‚≠ê‚≠ê Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

5. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

6. When you message me, please write more than ""hi"" or ""saw your post"". Tell me which post you are coming from and any ideas you have. You do not need to write me a book, just give me more than two words. Poor introductions will be ignored.

7. I am looking for my character to be tfed, NOT tfing other characters. If that is a deal breaker, you have been warned.

I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+. 

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or:

Kik: N1njastar28

Thank you for reading, and hope to hear from you soon!"
asqsmw,7,2019-02-20,First term passed. Two (maybe one...?) to go.,karisgood,wgu_devs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wgu_devs/comments/asqsmw/first_term_passed_two_maybe_one_to_go/,"Hey all,

I'm just about to finish up my first term and wanted to give a little run down of my experience.   I came into this program with a couple Associate's Degree's from the local Community College in my area, and I have been working here for about three years as a developer.  I was a student, turned into a help desk extern, followed by a student development internship that turned into not just a contracting position, but then a salaried full time position.   I started WGU with the goal of finishing within one year, so obtain my BA in SD and try my hand out at a teaching position here.  

&amp;#x200B;

For my first term, I started with 60 TCU, and had 62 to complete my BA.  I started off easy, With C777 Web Development Applications.  I wasn't too dedicated and took me about a month to practice and pass.  The same went with C773 User Interface Design, about a month of non dedicated studying.  Then I got to the C393 IT Foundations and C394 IT Applications.  These were beasts, especially if you are not super into hardware.  I have taken these classes in community college, but passing the actual Certification was not required back then.  It took me some time, and a lot of procrastination because at the time most of the operating system stuff is the intracacies of Windows systems from last generation.  CompTia has updated the exams (now) to the 10 series which does away with Legacy Windows BS and focuses more on Windows 10, Linux, Mac and Mobile OS's which are really the way of the future.  But I digress, those course filled out the remainder of the term.  

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to start strong on March 1st, with C176 Project Management.  I've activated the course and am going to spend the next ten days prepping for that, and I plan to knock out (hopefully!) a course a week.  I would like to get that, C188 Software Engineering and C170 Data Management Applications done within the first month of term 2, and that will set my projection on path to complete in just two terms.  I still have 8 more classes after that though, but I'm praying that the Software classes will be cake (I'm a c# developer currently so that is the track I plan on using), UX Design, the DREADED Oracle SQL class, a Software Qa and an Org Behavior and Leadership course, the Mobile App Development course, and finally the Capstone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having serious doubts that I will be able to complete the rest of my work within this term, especially being a full time Dev,  Mediocre husband and Father of 3, all while choosing to medicate without pharmaceuticals.  But either way, only one or two more semesters and I'll be done.   Feel free to ask anything about the journey so far..."

In prezent lucrez la o multinationala in (terminat A.S.E. FABIZ) contabilitate si nu sunt deloc multumit de ceea ce fac.

Acum 3 luni m-am hotarat sa fac o aplicatie pentru android asa ca am inceput sa invat Java, Sql si Android studio prin cursuri [udemy.com](https://udemy.com) .

Intre timp am realizat ca aplicatia pe care vreau sa o dezvolt este mult prea complexa pentru a putea sa o fac in intregime singur si am renuntat la idee.

Am zis ca daca tot am invatat putina Java, poate pot sa ma angajez sau sa prind un internship insa de curand am aruncat un ochi pe anunturi si am vazut ca sunt foarte multe cerinte. 

( EX. din anuntul unui internship:

 \- Skills required: PHP, Javascript, Java;  


\- Other skills desired: Linux, HTML, Kanban, Agile development, SCRUM, Java EE, MySQL; )

Chiar trebuie sa cunosc toate aceste tehnologii?

Momentan urmez un curs pentru a trece testul de certificare OCJA, m-am gandit ca asta ar fi cel mai bun traseu.

Ce as putea sa fac in continuare pentru a putea sa ma angajez ca si developer?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Am invatat putina Java pentru a face o aplicatie dar am realizat ca nu o pot face singur; Acum lucrez pentru certificarea Oracle; Este asta cel mai bun drum? Ce ar trebui sa fac/invat pentru a ma putea angaja sau macar pentru a incepe un internsip?"

asrl2x,1,2019-02-20,"Trying to cut Ex+Best Friend (M) of several years out of my life, not sure if i'm making huge mistake?",castaway4359,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/asrl2x/trying_to_cut_exbest_friend_m_of_several_years/,"I apologize if I'm vague, I do have an actual reddit account but I made a throwaway because I don't want to give away my identity. 

My ex was my best friend before we started dating. We dated for almost four years, almost moved into an apartment together, had talks of marriage, then he broke up with me. We both considered the friendship important still, so we stayed friends for two years after the breakup. 

Things were okay, but over the past few months he kept escalating fights with me. Little things that I thought normally wouldn't bother anyone or seem so controversial he would start to pick fights with me over, and when I refused to side with his opinion that I was wrong he would say things along the lines of ""I'm not getting into a fight, this is over"" despite being the one to start the argument. He kept calling me aggressive and I pointed out that he was the one instigating the fights, and that if he didn't want to fight then just don't start one in the first place. And when I do mean little things, I do mean little things, IE: one time I posted about how I only want to date financially stable people. He accused me of being prejudiced against poor people if I only wanted to date """"rich"""" people, despite the fact that I came from a single mom who struggled. He also kept accusing me of being aggressive, despite that he was initiating fights I was constantly trying to stop. He also got annoyed when I went to friends to ask for advice about our fights, saying he was ""disappointed"" if he found out I talked to someone else, since he was so embarrassed about our fights he didn't want to tell anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last straw was after a dayjob, chronic health issues and a death in my family, I finally got good news-I got an internship of my dreams at a company I adored in my field of work. And the instant I excitedly told him, he broke down in jealousy. He apologized after, but every time I tried talking to him about the internship after I could sense jealousy in his voice. Or he demeaned the hard work I did to earn it, like one time he referred to it as a ""luxury""--as though it was a fortune I was handed, not a job I applied and was interviewed for. I told him that was a disrespectful and dismissive way to refer to it, and he apologized and said that wasn't what he meant...but what else could you gleam from calling something a luxury?

&amp;#x200B;

I've dealt with his jealousy issues as long as I've known him. He always told me it was beyond his control and he couldn't help it, and when we were dating he got so jealous of the attention my posts would get that I would desperately try to boost his posts in hopes that they would get more noticed. But he would just get mad if my posts still got attention. I would get anxious when posts of mine would blow up because it would inevitably mean him getting jealous of me. I was naive back then and thought it was beyond his control, but I realize now that everyone feels jealousy to some degree, the only difference is how we control it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started pulling back from him because I had important deadlines and a meeting with my internship, and when he noticed we weren't talking he asked why, and I told him I had important deadlines coming up and I was avoiding stressors. He told me he didn't know he was a stressor and would leave it up to me to initiate contact. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't talked with him in almost two weeks now. I know that doesn't seem like too long, but to me it is when it was someone I used to talk every day with. And the reason it's been so long is because I noticed I didn't miss talking to him and didn't want to reach out. I talked and hung out with my other friends, I worked on my projects, and I had nice time to go out and do what I wanted. The day he snapped at me over my internship, it felt like a light switched off inside of me. I had been so supportive and encouraging to him in all of his endeavors, and the instant something good finally happened to me he couldn't be happy for even one second for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to work up the courage to break off from him because the universe (and my friends) seem to have kept giving me signs that it isn't right to keep him in my life. I looked back at one of our old conversations, and he had apologized for how his mental illness was affecting his friendship with me, and it made me feel guilty...because maybe he will change? Is it the right choice to cut him out of my life?"

It has had a profound emotional impact on me, bringing a deep bitter-sweet sense of melancholy and nostalgia.

I was born in the 80's, and grew up with MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and witnessed the dawn of the internet.  I think it's brilliant to have a show about this transformative time.

In addition, my father worked at IBM during the 70's and 80's and told me stories about things like the ""clean room"" implementations that rival companies created to compete with IBM.  The mixture of fictional characters set against a realistic historical backdrop is what I find so compelling.

I've been working as a software developer since 2004 and have witnessed so many changes.  For example I remember an early internship I had at Westinghouse where one of the engineers still swore by Netscape Navigator, and Java was the new kid on the block.

In a way I feel lucky to have been alive during that time and to have a context for how rapid things have changed (despite feeling really long in the tooth sometimes).

As a final note, the score is really excellent to work to (for me that's specifically programming), I highly recommend it to anybody that enjoyed other well known ""programming scores"" like the Tron Legacy Score, and the Social Network Score."

I moved here when I finished undergrad, and about a year and a half ago I met my current SO. on tinder.  We were about 45 minutes apart for the first year, and back in August she moved closer for the job she got and we are currently about 15 minutes away.    

In May I will be graduating with my masters degree and moving 16 hours away because I took a job elsewhere with my current company.  I have never been truly happy where I currently live and the new job is much closer to family and an area of the country I am in love with.  Obviously, that kind of distance is making me question my relationship and I am hoping for some advice so here are the details.  

My SO is finishing up her internship year of graduate school and will be looking for a full time job in a school in May.   
 Unfortunately since her internship is paid, the state we live in mandates her to work in the state for a year, so her moving with me isn't an option.  She has depression as well as bi polar disorder which has put some strain on our relationship.  She started seeing a therapist a few months ago which has helped, but she gets upset over little things and I end up on the phone with her or in person and the demand for my time with school, work, and trying to be social outside of our relationship has been stressful.  

Her current plan is to move in a year so we can be together, but the way she describes it implies that we will move in together.  I am not ready for us to move in together now, and I have no way of knowing if I will be ready in a year so that has also been stressing me out.

Finally, this past Sunday she called me in tears and had no idea why she felt like she did, but we spent 2 hours on the phone when I started to realize that this was a problem.  I have been doing this almost bi-weekly for her for months now, and it has made me feel like I am her only source of happiness and like I haven't really had my own true personal time in quite a while.  I know relationships are not easy, and yes I do love her, but I don't think this will work long distance.  

What do you think?  Should I give it a shot?  Talk to her about it?  I don't know what to do and I have felt awful all week thinking about it.    "

My first post",kriskonfused,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ass6ya/my_intimacy_addictioninfidelities_and_bpd_my/,"Hello all my name is Kris and I am 33 years-young.I've been married to my husband for 10 years with with few infidelities sprinkled in there because I just don't understand monogamy(or the deep feelings that others have for that matter) and why it's such a big deal. Anyways, whenever I found someone who was nice to be I'd fall for them almost instantly and be obsessed and addicted to them attentions and the intimate feelings I had for them always made me want to take things to the next level. I don't really feel pressured to have sex, it just feels more complete once I have, like I know them in a way and can be a better friend and lover to them. It ends up ruining more than it helps and I always feel the need to have those people around 24/7 to feel validated...so I stalk them online and try every way to get their attention when they start to think I am too extra and crazy.

My husband has been a good sport about up until this point and since I got my correct diagnosis of BDP two weeks ago has been nothing but loving and supportive. He has done a lot of research and wants to take a class to be the best at assist me through my healing process...But being the self loathing turd that I am finding that I don't and I don't feel like I am worthy of his help and keep pushing him to divorce me and move on with his life without me as romantic connection...which would be all good and fine if we didn't have three young daughters(whom I love very much) to be there for as well. I don't end know where to start with them and the selfishness I have been feeling with trying to better myself and not feeling like I am good enough to be their mom because I want to with someone else who isn't their father. 

I had previously been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and for years that didn't feel right. I cold turkey stopped seeing my Dr. because I didn't feel as though she was helping me and I also got pregnant with my twins and was afraid of the medications might do to them. After the twins were born and I had little time to think things through I decided in anger and resentment that I didn't wish to continue seeking any sort of mental health help because my husband refused to do it as well(get therapy) and I didn't want to be the only one bettering myself in our marriage. My husband is now getting seen weekly by a therapist and I was being seen biweekly but I decided that wasn't enough(she was also an intern who didn't have a specialty) so I start with a new therapist who has been a therapist for 7 years today and will be seeing her every week.

My biggest struggle this week will be attempting to get over my most current lover who has now blocked me on every form of social media and even changed his phone number just to avoid my obsessive ways(so much for him being my support person). I have known this one for 4 months, I met him at my first full time job ever(I know I messed up by shitting where I ate in the first place). He was so kind to me and sooo understanding. FML! I ended up running away from home and my family just to be with him and stayed at his place for a month. It felt great being there(I still went to work and made money) , away from all my responsibilities and stresses. My husband kept bothering me the whole time though which lead me to end up leaving my lover and going back home, which was both a good thing and a mistake. I started therapy and new meds and all but I feel all alone even with my family supporting and loving me because I don't have the love and support of the person I want to be with(I abandoned him and feel fucking awful for it). My husband assures me this is just another phase in the my circle of self hatred and destruction but I am having issues wanting to end trust one word from his word(he hasn't always been the best husband and have flip-flopped on behaviors in the past).

I am positive that the road of my healing from BPD is going to be a fucking loooong one."

I've been in a relationship for almost 4 years now, I wouldn't call her my SO (f24), but she's attractive and caring and I love her. However, the sex, is as dead as it can be. I have a few kinks (anal play, submissive,...) that I'd like to try so that I can explore myself and my sexuality, my gf on the other hand is not open to any of those and it took me a long time and courage to open up to her. We've talked about it a number of times and the same discussion keeps popping up every few months, the result is always the same: I need to be patient in order for her to open up to me. Now I've been waiting for three years for that to happen, still, nothing has really changed. To make matters worse, she has no kinks, she's very ""vanilla"" oriented and her sex drive is not at all as high as mine, I realized that we're not sexually compatible. I care about her deeply however, as she's my first real relationship and the thought of leaving her and the uncertainty that follows scares me. 

I've been going to a psychologist for about six months now, I'm in a self destructing stage of my (short) life where I sacrifice my own well-being for that of others, to the point where I don't know what I want for myself since I'm doing everything for people around me, but not for me. The therapy is helping, but my gf remains an obstacle. She's very insecure about herself, her body and her capabilities, both inside and outside the bedroom.I've always been there for her, supported her and told her that If I did not care about her, I would just leave. She's obviously more emotionally invested in this relationship than I am. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like I sacrificed so much of myself for her well being. Friends and family say that it is showing. 


At the moment, I'm on an prestigious internship on the other side of the globe for a period of 15 weeks, I'm halfway through. Though I missed my gf in the beginning, and we were all over each other with the distance, the sexual frustration is building up and it's starting to have an impact on my feelings, which are started to go away, I think. The fact that I'm so far away from everything I'm used to really helped me for this short period of time I feel like I'm rediscovering myself. I'm taking initiatives for me, going out, going to the gym, visiting, actually working on some projects, it's so satisfying and it feels great to not be trapped by the needs of others for once. My friends and family who know the psychological issues I have are telling me that I should enjoy myself and completely give in to what I want and my feelings, no matter what happens. 

Girls are very direct in the country I'm in, and I've met this girl who was very straightforward to me about what she wanted, I found out she had the same kinks as me. At that point I told her that I had a gf, but I also told her about the sexual frustration that I had for quite some years. She said I had to decide for myself what I wanted, but pointed out that I should enjoy myself here before I leave.

I know that in a relationship communication is key, so I immediately texted my gf and told her that if she wanted our relationship to work the sex needed to change, not in three months, not in a year, but when I come back. She told me to go fuck myself. We called each other the next day to talk things over. I told her about the girl I met and how I could easily satisfy my desires. I told her this for the sake of honesty and so that she understands why this is urgent, and that I was really tempted to go and look elsewhere. This time she seemed to understand the urgency and she was more explicit about what she expected from me in order for her to open up, I felt disappointed for having that responsibility but I understood her perspective. However, she also told me that there were things she would never do, like being 'used' like an object, I understood but I realized that this was a deal breaker for me. 

I hung up the phone feeling disappointed as this wasn't really what I had hoped to hear. In the meantime I still texted the other girl and the messages became heated. I couldn't help but feel turned on, excited and genuinely happy about feeling desired but also not being ashamed for what I wanted. We decided to go for a drink next week, though I believe we both know how this will end up. I felt like I 'deserved' this' after everything I've been through psychologically (sorry if it sounds exaggerated). Whatever happens I don't plan on telling my gf. But whatever I do I feel like I'll regret it. If I don't go for that drink and what will eventually follow, I'll regret it because it's not something I'll ever do with my GF whom I care about. If I go for that drink however, I feel like I'm gonna feel guilty, since I would never want my gf to that. But I will try everything to make it work, which I feel like she hasn't done over the course of three years. 

I expect some comments telling me not to cheat and you would probably be right, but I was honest with her and told her that I hung op the phone feeling disappointed. I guess I'm just looking for that one person telling me that she understands and that she would just tell me to go for it. "
astols,9,2019-02-20,General thoughts during the Peace Corps application process?,SantaFeSocialWorker,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/astols/general_thoughts_during_the_peace_corps/,"I‚Äôve combed through many posts over the last month- after receiving an email saying I was under consideration for a position as a health volunteer in Cameroon, I was so excited to just be considered. 
It seems like everything I‚Äôve read paints a totally different timeline so I don‚Äôt anticipate that mine would be much different. 
I have applied once, directly out of college (this was almost two years ago) I really felt that I had some solid experience. I worked in geriatric social work, child protective services and worked with other organizations on issues surrounding emancipated students on my college campus, andddd- denied very early on from the peace corps. Of course, I was upset but nonetheless - 
I‚Äôve wanted to join the peace corps... well I guess for as long as I‚Äôve known I wanted to be a social worker (that‚Äôs been most of my lifetime) 
After I touched base with two different recruiters this go round, I quickly realized that my resume and mission statement had been a disaster. I revamped everything and reapplied, in the mean time, moving across the county, working a residential internship in a homeless shelter and then becoming a case manager at a family shelter (which has been the absolute best experience of my life) 
So, here I am finally having been placed UC- and I‚Äôm just thrilled that someone is even looking at my resume! 
And, because I was denied once I‚Äôve already resigned myself to- if I am denied again, I‚Äôll just reapply. 

I recognize it is incredibly early on but, Any thoughts from returning/current PCV‚Äôs about this process, and how you felt re-applying a second or maybe third time? 

Edit- I‚Äôm incredibly hopeful to get an interview but just looking for some more insight, if it‚Äôs out there! 

Thanks "

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

Bonus points if your character looks like Keiran Lee, he has the perfect cock.

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins more bonus points

Look forward to playing, obviously all stuff will be 18+ on the ages x"
asuoay,404,2019-02-20,PsychoHam,Idkwhat2write,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/asuoay/psychoham/,"Hey everyone, long time lurker here with a doozy.

So I am a female Latina finishing up my master's degree to become a therapist. Graduating in May and super excited. Part of completing the degree is working as a therapist intern for a year. I do groups sessions and individual sessions at a site that treats people with more severe mental health diagnosis. Things like schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression, etc. It has been really amazing working here and I have learned so much. My supervisor is very supportive and nice. 

Let's start at my first week there. I was greeted warmly by everyone there and was told that I would spend my first 2 weeks just shadowing other clinicians and getting to know the ropes. Cool, pretty standard. After the first week, my supervisor asked how I felt about stuff and I said I was fine and excited. She asks if I want to just start my groups and I said yes. The next week I have to ask one therapist for a curriculum for a grief and loss group, let's call her Psychoham. Because we are state-funded we have to cover certain topics in order to keep our funding. But we still have lots of freedom and it allows the group to be run in a therapeutic manner. So I ask Psychoham for the curriculum and she points to some binder in the corner and won't even acknowledge me. I say thank you and again she doesn't show basic manners but whatever I guess it's cool to be rude to the lowly interns. 10 minutes later I hear her talking shit about me in Spanish to another therapist, ""she doesn't even want to do groups, when I started here I did groups on my first week."" Now I'm Latina but blonde and look pretty racially ambiguous so I have caught people doing this before in the past. I already hate her, such an unprofessional pussy who won't complain to my face. Also, I never said I wasn't going to do the group I specifically asked you for the curriculum you whale. Whatever, kept it profesh and did my groups.

A few months later she starts critiquing my lunch and saying that my salads are not going to fill me up and saying omg how can you not eat meat blah blah blah I have to eat my mcgriddles and tall frappe every morning. She even told me that replacing soda with water makes you retain water weight which makes you gain weight. Mind you she is a least 350 pounds middle-aged and single living with her mom and preteen son. I'll pass on the advice homie. She is either gorging herself on 5 piece popeyes meals and large coke or bringing in a tiny lean cuisine and shoveling out terrible diet advice that no one asked for.

Back to the therapy. When I came onboard I was transferred one of Psychoham's individual clients, let's call her Carolina. Carolina is in her 20s and has a history of abuse and struggles to regulate herself emotionally. She has loud outbursts and curses people out when she is frustrated but is never violent. Unbeknownst to me Carolina and Psychoham had beef. They have a very toxic dynamic that didn't allow for them to have a good therapeutic relationship so she was switched. Very unprofessional, I will be saying this a lot. Psychoham is no longer her individual counselor but Carolina still attends her group sessions. They do small things to each other like Carolina won't put her phone away during sessions and Psychoham responds by scolding her in front of the group and asking her to leave. There are rules to group sessions but putting on your best cranky mom voice is not how a therapist should do things. This all escalates to Carolina calling Psychoham a fat bitch to her face. This breaks Psychoham and she files hella complaints, calls HR, demands a meeting with the director. Wayyyy too much hoopla for this one event. In a different setting this makes sense but in our program, there are times where clients are not going to be the most polite and will curse us out. I have a paranoid client with Schizophrenia who somedays says go away don't talk to me I hate you and other days he asks me about the weather. It happens, taking a job with this population means you have to expect this.

My client is suspended and forced to apologize to Psychoham and if she doesn't then she can't come back. It is very forced but I thought it could be a good way to make peace with each other. Cut to this meeting with me, Psychoham, supervisor, and Carolina. Carolina warmly apologizes and Psychoham just stares at her and walks out of the room. Poor Carolina is crushed and is given a terrible example of behavior and states that she can tell she hates her. At our next individual session, Carolina states that the last time she had a group with Psychoham she audibly sighed at her and rolled her eyes. She let other people talk over her and didn't acknowledge her at all. My client doesn't lie and I believe her. I go to my supervisor and voice my concerns because I can't let her get stomped over. The power dynamic is so toxic. And it puts me in a terrible position because I'm just an intern and now forced to snitch on a therapist.

My supervisor believes Carolina as well; she even said that last week Psychoham came to her and said she refused to work with Carolina. When asked why she just said she couldn't and didn't have a big reason. So fucking terrible. My supervisor then asks me to type up what I said verbatim in an email for her own documentation purposes. Say less. She says some people are overly affected by the things clients say to them when they get upset and we need to work on our professionalism. Awesome. I sent that over last week and Psychoham hasn't turned up for the last few days. Let's pray something was actually done to her."

Hi, graduating this spring with a BS in statistics and a minor in actuarial science. Looking for feedback on how to improve my resume. Hoping for just about any kind of entry level position right now that will help me gain some experience. Hoping to use Python, R or other languages on the job. I feel like a data analyst role might transition nicely into the field.

Some weaknesses I‚Äôm already aware of: 

- No GPA listed, I don‚Äôt have a very competitive one at 3.1

- Lack of internship and related work experience

- No extracurriculars, awards, etc.

- All projects are academic

Additional comments/concerns:

- How‚Äôs my career focus line? Eventually I‚Äôd like to work a data science role, or even pursue the actuarial exams that I neglected in college. I‚Äôd like to pursue my masters when I can afford it and after I‚Äôve gained a little experience to help narrow down what I‚Äôd like to do.

- I plan to add a statistical learning project using R to predict housing prices under the projects section once I have completed it this semester. 

- I‚Äôm employed by [Company A], but contract for [Company B]. All of my supervisors work for [Company B], that‚Äôs who I complete work for. I honestly I have very little to do with [Company A] , however they are my employer, and where my paycheck comes from. Is it correct to have their name as sort of the header, or should it be [Company B]? Should I make the position title the header, and then the company as sort of the sub-header?

- I have a little space at the bottom of the resume. Should I bullet point the proficiencies?

- What types of positions should I keep an eye out for?

Any feedback at all is appreciated. Thanks for your help!"

Lt. Eugene Riddick of the Caswell County Sheriff‚Äôs Department advised that animal trainer Ashley Watts reported separating the 14-year-old lion named Matthai into a section of an enclosure at the Conservators Center in Burlington on Dec. 30, according to the report first reported on by WRAL-TV. But Watts said the gate that secures that section was blocked by a large ball and the lion entered the area that Watts, 22-year-old intern Alex Black and a second intern were cleaning and attacked Black, the report states. Watts tried to separate them, but before she could close the gate, Matthai bit Black‚Äôs ankle and pulled her into the enclosure.

Riddick advised that fire department personnel used a firehose to separate the lion and Black without success, according to the report. The lion dragged Black around the enclosure by her neck ""for an extended amount of time."" After attempts to sedate the lion with darts failed, deputies shot the lion eight times, killing the animal and ensuring Black‚Äôs body could be safely recovered, the report said.

The initial assessment showed Black died from multiple deep lacerations to the neck with significant blood loss, according to the report. It lists the probable cause of death as ""Mauling by Animal.""

In a statement provided to WFMY-TV, the center disputes reports that the gate was obstructed by a ball, saying that is ""neither accurate nor plausible."" However, the center does not explain how the lion was able to reach the three.

The attack occurred less than two weeks after Black, a recent college graduate from New Palestine, Indiana, had begun working at the nonprofit wildlife facility. The center, described recently as a ""community zoo"" by its executive director, was founded in 1999.

USDA inspections in 2017 and 2018 found no problems at the center, according to government reports. A government inspector counted 16 lions among 85 total animals in 2018.

The center stresses in its statement that as an intern, Black wasn‚Äôt responsible for the accident and that ""all credible evidence"" indicates that she was ""killed almost instantly"" and first responders were ""conducting a recovery not a rescue."" The center reviewed safety policies and procedures and re-trained staff, and said it‚Äôs confident that, when followed, those existing policies and procedures are sufficient.

Lt. Darrell McLean, a spokesman for the Caswell County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, declined comment Wednesday.

Eugene Riddick of the Caswell County Sheriff‚Äôs Department advised that animal trainer Ashley Watts reported separating the 14-year-old lion named Matthai into a section of an enclosure at the Conservators Center in Burlington on Dec. 30, according to the report first reported on by WRAL-TV. But Watts said the gate that secures that section was blocked by a large ball and the lion entered the area that Watts, 22-year-old intern Alex Black and a second intern were cleaning and attacked Black, the report states. Watts tried to separate them, but before she could close the gate, Matthai bit Black‚Äôs ankle and pulled her into the enclosure.

Riddick advised that fire department personnel used a firehose to separate the lion and Black without success, according to the report. The lion dragged Black around the enclosure by her neck ""for an extended amount of time."" After attempts to sedate the lion with darts failed, deputies shot the lion eight times, killing the animal and ensuring Black‚Äôs body could be safely recovered, the report said.

The initial assessment showed Black died from multiple deep lacerations to the neck with significant blood loss, according to the report. It lists the probable cause of death as ""Mauling by Animal.""

In a statement provided to WFMY-TV, the center disputes reports that the gate was obstructed by a ball, saying that is ""neither accurate nor plausible."" However, the center does not explain how the lion was able to reach the three.

The attack occurred less than two weeks after Black, a recent college graduate from New Palestine, Indiana, had begun working at the nonprofit wildlife facility. The center, described recently as a ""community zoo"" by its executive director, was founded in 1999.

USDA inspections in 2017 and 2018 found no problems at the center, according to government reports. A government inspector counted 16 lions among 85 total animals in 2018.

The center stresses in its statement that as an intern, Black wasn‚Äôt responsible for the accident and that ""all credible evidence"" indicates that she was ""killed almost instantly"" and first responders were ""conducting a recovery not a rescue."" The center reviewed safety policies and procedures and re-trained staff, and said it‚Äôs confident that, when followed, those existing policies and procedures are sufficient.

Lt. Darrell McLean, a spokesman for the Caswell County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, declined comment Wednesday.

I had some questions and was wondering if any previous applicants had any insight?

&amp;#x200B;

This is my estimated point breakdown by 2020.

23 points - Age 25

32 points - Computer Science M.S. from the U.S.

0-1 point - Less than 100 million won in tax

26 points - KIPP Level 5 Completion

0-1 point - Professional Experience abroad, between 1 year and 2 years

1 point - Volunteering for 1 years

2 points - more than 20 million but less than 30 million won annual salary

Total: 79-81 points

&amp;#x200B;

1. I currently have a TOPIK 1 Certification (Level 2) which places me at KIPP Level 3. I haven't started KIPP yet. Is it possible to finish Level 3, 4, and 5 of KIPP within the timeframe? How hard is KIPP Level 5 to pass?
2. How many hours of volunteering do I need to obtain 1 point for domestic volunteering activities for the 1 and a half years that I am here?
3. If I paid any taxes at all, even if it was extremely minimum, less than 0.2 million won for the entire year, should that still give me 1 point? Would it be unwise to submit a residency certification that exempts me from paying Korean income tax if I wish to obtain this point for the F2 visa? At that point, I would only pay local taxes and the money taken out of my paycheck for my pension.
4. Do full-time short-term internships (3-4 months) or part-time work count as professional experience abroad?"

I‚Äôve struggled with depression and severe anxiety my entire life (I am almost 24 now). Up until I started dating my boyfriend 3 years ago, I never disclosed this to anyone. I‚Äôve always been a big mental health advocate and pushed everyone else to get help, but I wouldn‚Äôt do it for myself. I don‚Äôt know why. Over the past few years it‚Äôs gotten increasingly worse. I‚Äôm in grad school getting my MSW and in my final semester. I work as a counselor for my internship and I was tired of feeling like a fraud. I spend all day counseling clients and hearing them talk about their success with antidepressants, but I still kept putting it off myself. I‚Äôve always said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do something about it one day‚Äù but always found an excuse. 

Last week after a particular tough two days, I had a breakdown in my office. A full blown panic attack - I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Then I started thinking about three of my young clients. It took courage for them to seek help and I‚Äôm so proud of the progress they made. I realized that I needed to take all of the advice I give others to heart, so during my breakdown I sent a message to my doctor requesting and appointment and let her know exactly what it was for so that there was no way out of it. I went into that appointment today, still nervous, but let her know everything I‚Äôd been feeling my whole life and that I needed help. She was shocked to find out no one knew, and that she didn‚Äôt even have a clue. I‚Äôve known her for years (and my mom is her manager), and she said it was just something she never expected based off of all of our conversations, but she said she was proud of me. 

I picked up my medication after the appointment and took my first dose today. Other than my doctor and my boyfriend, no one in the world knows this. I‚Äôm so proud of myself and I wanted to share. I figured this would be the best way since I can type out my thoughts but it‚Äôs still anonymous. I never thought this day would come. I know antidepressants aren‚Äôt a cure all and I do practice the strategies I teach (anxiety management, relaxation techniques, positive coping skills, etc.) but this is the first step in the right direction. It‚Äôs gonna be a long road ahead but I‚Äôm proud of myself for finally taking this first step. "

However, he is leaving to go to a different state in May for an internship. He thinks that the best thing for us to do is to break up because he wants to focus on his work and I agree, but when he comes back after 3 months I want to continue but hes not sure and doesn't want to hold me back while hes gone. I really like him, but I just don't understand why we can't try to make it work. I just feel like every guy I ever like will keep leaving me.

Someone give me advice on how to stop being dumb? I'm so sad right now I know I shouldnt thinking about it right now because its still a few months away and I want to spend as much time with him as possible so I can be happy. I just need advice on how to deal with this.

I have never done that before. Somedays I just get up and dont feel like doing anything at all. I‚Äôm going through a lot (maybe for me, I do not want to be selfish and I know that many people suffer from really worse things). My parents  are ‚Äúfighting‚Äù over money now, because neither of them have enough to deal with my college expenses, health care and etc. They divorced in 2012 I guess and that keeps coming over all the time.  I have to confess that I‚Äôve always lived a high class life, with trips, nice clothes, nice houses and a nice college, but now I‚Äôm really scared of the future. My father is trying so hard to get a job, but its difficult. Hes spending all of his reserves daily and the money isnt comming in. My mom has never worked, and always took care of me and my sister so well. I love her so much. But shes scared as well... my father doesnt have more money to give to her, and we are selling our house and trying to move to a cheaper one. She had some stress crisis and is in a lot of pain and sadness. I think her depression came back and I hate to see her like this.  I dont have any true friends to ask help, and I often feel lonely. In my group of friends, I dont think anyone REALLY likes me. They never ask to take pictures with me like they do with other people. I think I do not deal well with other people, even from my family. In my professional life, I work in a big company making not so much money (its an internship) and I dont really like the things I do and to work there but I‚Äôm way too scared to risk ir all in another place.

asy7ie,1,2019-02-20,I will see you in August,throwawayletter143,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/asy7ie/i_will_see_you_in_august/," A, 

The last time we spoke it was dead day for you and just another day of high school for me. Your college brought in dogs to help with the stress of exams. I saw you petting one in front of the fountain outside. No, I wouldn‚Äôt go get you: that would look desperate. We weren‚Äôt dating after all. But minutes passed, and fear got the best of me. You were there, right in front of me! I knew I would be kicking myself later if I didn‚Äôt talk to you one last time before you went home for the summer, so I went outside and tore your attention away from the dog. You followed me back inside the student center, and we sat down in a cluster of chairs near a TV. I told you that I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to the summer, being home with my parents all day. They will make my life miserable with their harsh punishments and disregard for privacy and freedom, I said to you. I can‚Äôt remember what you said back. I can only remember you noticing the Rocket Mortgage commercial that appeared on the TV behind me. When I stood up to leave, you stood up too and hugged me. You told me warmly, ‚ÄúI will see you in August.‚Äù

Well, August passed, and a second August passed, and so did a third. I still haven‚Äôt spoken to you. If I had known that day in May would have been the last day I would have spoken to you in two-and-a-half-plus years, I would have locked every moment in my memory. 

I cannot begin to tell you how dearly I have missed you in the past nearly three years. The emotion comes in waves. On some days you hardly cross my mind, and on other days I search for any shred of possible communication from you. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that I have scoured Reddit looking for a post detailing our relationship, in hopes that maybe you still cared enough to vent to internet strangers. I don‚Äôt even think you use Reddit. 

How have you been these past couple of years? What have you been doing? I hope you enjoyed your semester abroad in Hong Kong! I saw that you graduated college. I‚Äôm so proud of you, especially since you graduated on time even after changing your major late. Your Facebook bio says you took a job at an automotive manufacturer. I know you always wanted to work in the automobile industry. Do you like your job? What is your role? 

I have so much that I have longed to tell you, to share in my joys and fears with you. College was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. Turns out being the valedictorian and making a perfect ACT score doesn‚Äôt really matter here. Shortly after starting college my parents discovered that I had been texting your sister. I couldn‚Äôt work up the courage to text you. They confiscated my phone and deleted your entire family from my contacts list, my Facebook, my Instagram, and my Snapchat. I screamed and I cried at them. My mother cried too, and she let me follow you on Instagram at least because you‚Äôre ‚Äúsweet.‚Äù I wonder what you think happened when I suddenly disappeared off of your Facebook. I wonder how long it took you to notice. I had an internship at an automotive consulting firm (ironically serving the same company you work at) last summer that I absolutely loved. I enjoyed the work and liked the people I worked with. Now I‚Äôm planning on entering the consulting industry and getting an MBA. I also discovered that there is something wrong with my liver. I had to get a liver biopsy the day before the first day of junior year, and I got diagnosed with some disease that hardly anyone has ever heard of. The week between the liver biopsy and learning what the disease entails was the scariest of my life. I was afraid I was going to die young or need a liver transplant or both. I accepted an internship in Austin this summer, and before I live in a different city for the first time ever, I‚Äôm spending three weeks in France. 

I saw on Monday that you have a girlfriend now. I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say I was shattered. Of course I don‚Äôt expect you to just remain single forever. I know your dream is a wife and kids. I want the best for you, but it breaks my heart that *I* couldn‚Äôt be the best for you, largely through no fault of my own. What‚Äôs more, though, is I fear that now that if I ever saw you in public, it would be considered intrusive on your new relationship for me to even approach you. I should have talked to you when I saw you from afar earlier, but I felt like I would be a horrible daughter if I did. If you ever see me, please, at least say hello, let me know that you are loving life as you should be. I promise I will let you and her be.

Love always,

M"
asy8mb,0,2019-02-20,I am better than my best friends,Lhatesyou,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/asy8mb/i_am_better_than_my_best_friends/,"This is my first post, so sorry it's so negative. Also I don't know if this should be here or the rant one, so let's see how long this is up for. 

I know that this is going to make me sound like an absolute egotistic, self-praising, toxic loser, but I just need to get these thoughts off my chest because I've been getting more and more frustrated these days. I understand that everyone has their own journey in life and they take it at their own pace, but I have all this negative energy pint up and I don't want to explode at them.

I am better than my best friends.

I (22/F) actually have a job that pays and is adding to my skill set. Granted, it's a part-time job that's not in my desired career field. But at least I have a job that funds the lifestyle I want, and I don't sit on my ass all day, watching YouTube videos and reading fanfics on Tumblr (nothing against the sites, I actually like to procrastinate on YT). 

Friend#1. You did't even go to college! For 5 years, you didn't get any valuable job experiences, and the internships you got, you wasted with little effort and passive writing. Get a part-time job somewhere! Yeah, customer service sucks but it's something that you should do and experience so that you can sympathize and stop being a bitch to servers. And you're expecting a full time career to just fall into your little lap with no experience in anything? Ha. You expect the world to hand you things. You criticize others' successes by saying that they have it easy because they have other people working for them, when they actually had to work their asses off to get to that point. Your blog was shit because you didn't put in the work to build your persona, you ignored advice to add uniqueness to your posts and writing, and you refused any help from the people around you. You give up every time a little bump in the road happens, then blame life/the universe or your ""laziness"" when you should blame yourself and take action into your own hands. Stop talking about a life that you want, and start moving towards SOMETHING. You're so dependent on your dad and others that it drives me crazy when you talk about wanting to be independent and have a luxurious lifestyle. Get off your flat ass, stop acting like you're an all-knowing adult, and actually put in the work to be grown.

Friend#2. Dude. Seriously? Why are you even pursuing an art degree? You hate almost every class you take. You're stressed about every project you do. I know that you don't actually like art that much, and you're only going for it because 1. your sister majored in it, and 2. you grew up with people saying you're good at it. I KNOW that you're not passionate about it because you refuse to talk about it when we get into our deep talks, and you haven't even started on your portfolio and you're in your 5th year of college. So why are you wasting your time, money and resources on a career path that you're not even getting ready to pursue?? You're already in a tough financial situation, so put your parents through more debt? So you can follow your ""passion""? Girl, be honest, you don't want this life anymore, but you're used to the classroom structure. You know that you SHOULD be following this lifestyle, but do you want to? I know I didn't follow my ""passion"" major, but that's because I don't have one and I chose one that I wouldn't mind and would have an opportunity to a stable life. You're an art major. With no art.

Lastly, the most pettiest rant. I am way prettier than they are, and it frustrates me that they don't put in the effort to look nice. They prioritize comfort over fashion, when it could be BOTH, but they refuse to accept that. They always say that people pay attention to me more, and it's because compared to you guys, I look waaayy better. So if you guys even tried to look good, then WE could get more attention. Friend#1, your style is cute, but you buy things twice your size and your shoulders are so broad that you lose your figure!! I hate that you hide your body... I hate that both of you hide your body because y'all look good and I want US to look good. You guys just make me feel terrible because I want to show off my body, but your insecurities bring out mine because if you think you're not skinny enough, then I'm definitely not. But also, I sometimes think that life would be funner if I had prettier friends.

I know that this is toxic thinking, but these girls are my best friends and I love them to death (seriously, I have a ride or die personality) but they just irk me sometimes and it's getting too much lately. Feel free to roast me, I deserve it."

He was rich, but distant--he would pay for the finest schools, clothes, and cars, but he never spent any time with you. You watched one mistress after another walk into his life, humiliating your mother in the process. You resented her for putting up with it, all of the secretaries, interns, 'massage therapists'. 

But Uncle Frank, he was always there for you. He was your father's business partner, but in reality he spent more time in your home than the man who owned it. He couldn't make up for your father never being around, but he did what he could, where he could. That always meant the world to you. 

Of course time went by, you grew up, you went to college--and things started to get out of hand. You started binge drinking, going to parties every night, fucking any girl willing to open her legs for you. You barely showed up in class at all, spending most of your time floating from one house party to another. It was finals week of your first semester that everything fell apart. 

You were leaving a frat party, and you were dumb enough to get in a car and start driving. You didn't make it off campus before you got pulled over with DUI charges. And it wasn't even your dad that picked you up or bailed you out of jail--it was Frank. He showed concern for you, for the path you were going down--but you lashed out. He wasn't your \*real\* father--he was only reaching out like this because he pitied you. 

But Frank decided that you were out of control--and the only way to take care of you...was to bring you to heel. So he's going to fuck you. He's going to make you choke on his cock, tears streaming down your face while he fucks your throat.

The same part of the year where I force myself to go to as many career fairs as possible. Career fairs are great because if a recruit likes you, you can form a human connection with them and they'll boost you through the hiring process. And when you're in a field where you can send out 200+ applications and end up with no position, you reach desperately for any help you can get.

But the trouble with me is that I'm just not likable. I have very low energy. I don't have (any) enthusiasm when I speak, and I don't really care to talk to anyone, much less recruiters. Much less people I have to pander to just so that maybe I can get an email telling me that I got rejected rather than being flat out ignored.

I can code all day. Ever since I started this degree I've been better than most people I've worked with at using code to solve problems. But none of that fucking matters. All that matters is how believable is your best fake smile, and how well you can fake interest in mundane conversation about the same surface level bs over and over and over and over. It's about how many layers of fakeness you can add to your persona before you completely depersonalize.

Well guess what, I'm not an actor. I've tried and most people can tell I'm acting since I'm just so shit at it. What you see is what you get. Why don't I seem interested in you talking about how you almost got a speeding ticket trying to buy some new kitty litter? IT MIGHT BECAUSE I DONT GIVE A FUCK.

aszfu6,8,2019-02-21,Advice needed... use tax return to wipe out Credit Card debt or save for rent money? (Moving to Boston for a 6 month internship),SilentSnowOwl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/aszfu6/advice_needed_use_tax_return_to_wipe_out_credit/,"**TL;DR:** What would be the better thing for me to do?

I currently have: -$2900 CC/Line of Credit Debt, ~$2900 cash, 1 Line of Credit+1 Credit Card totaling $4,000 available when nothing is charged to them, fairly low interest rates (Paying them down would reduce all of my debt, aside from Student Debt, to zero), and am going to have to pay at least 1 month's rent to move to Boston for 6 months.

* Wipe out all of my debt, live off my CC/LOC and probably withdraw funds from them to front moving costs later

* Pay debt down to a lower level (e.g. throw $1000-$1500 at the debt, place remaining tax refund money into savings)

* Make a very small payment on the debt ($500), keep up on my payments for the next few months (Which total out to maybe $50/mo after paying both of them), keep ~$2400 saved to ensure I have enough money to move.

If you have any other suggestions I'd be willing to hear those as well :) (Am trying to get enough enough in school to pick up a part time job if I can)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background info:**

So I'm a college student, with a $30/hour internship lined up to start this summer that will last until the end of the year.

Currently though... I'm sitting on ~$2900 of Credit Card debt. 

I filed my taxes and will be getting back a little over $2900 back total from Federal+State. I live at home so my living expenses are fairly cheap right now, I shouldn't accrue much more debt until summer if I pay this down. However I know I'm going to need upfront costs for moving into my apartment for this internship.

I'm going to be living in Boston, where I imagine a ""best case rent scenario"" would be finding 3 roommates and splitting rent so we pay ~$500/mo each plus some utility costs... however I'm afraid of a worst case scenario where I will have to live on my own and pay an atrocious rent over $1200 or something. I'm not very familiar with the COL in Boston.

I don't have an income currently due to the workload I have at school. So this is the first real money I've had in months and will be the only money I have (outside of my Credit Cards) until I go to Boston. If I can manage to pick up a part-time job between now and the summer I will, but this is my current situation.

What would be the best thing to do here?

The Labor Act categorizes the breaches of employers to be easier, harder and harder, and depending on which category of offense is involved, a fine is imposed on the employer.

https://i.redd.it/wcbehs3obvh21.jpg

Therefore, for easier misdemeanors, a fine is imposed on the employer legal person in the amount of 10.000,00 to 30.000,00 dollars, while for the same offense the employer is the physical person and the responsible person of the legal person shall be punished by a fine of 1.000,00 to 3.000,00 dollars.

The law foresees only two lighter offenses, in the case where the employer concludes an employment contract in which the probationary contract has been contracted for more than six months, and concludes a contract of employment in which the internship is contracted for more than one year.

For more severe violations, a fine is imposed on the employer's legal person in the amount of HRK 31,000.00 to HRK 60,000.00, while for the same offense the employer's natural person and the responsible person of the legal entity will have to allocate HRK 4.000,00 to 6.000,00.

For the most serious violations, a fine is imposed on the employer's legal person in the amount of dollars 61,000.00 to dollars 100,000.00, while the same person and the responsible person of the legal entity for the same offense shall be punished by a fine of dollars 7,000.00 to dollars 10,000.00 .

For all three categories of offense, if the offense has been committed in relation to juvenile, the amount of the fine is increased twice.

**Most common offensesOf the more severe violations, the most commonly found violations were:**

The termination of a fixed-term employment contract for which there is no objective reason or if the duration of all consecutive employment contracts concluded for a fixed period, including the first employment contract, lasted for more than three years (unless it is necessary to replace the temporary non-abandoned worker),on the inability to use a pause, daily or weekly rest.**Of the most serious violations, the most frequently found violations were:**

Omitting to keep records of employees and working hours,to notify employees of a written confirmation of a contract of employment prior to the commencement of work when the employment contract is not concluded in writing or if the worker does not submit a copy of the application for compulsory pension and health insurance,overtime work, and to non-delivery of debts, unpaid salaries, salaries or severance pay, or if the bill has no prescribed content.

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

**2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you**

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) You are paying me to sleep with you (at least at first) which is both surprising for someone of your fame and beauty and also just a bit illegal

7) Some combination of the above... most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

I'm a 20 year old college student. During this last fall/winter I took an internship across the country and took a semester off to pursue this opportunity. I left behind all of my friends and family for three months, and expected things to be pretty much to be the same when I got back. Well, I've been back for almost 2 months now. Besides my roommates all of my other really good friends don't talk to me any more. We all share a common hobby of playing smash, so I see them at tournaments and they act like nothing is wrong. But ever since I've been back I haven't been invited to do anything or go anywhere with them. They'll invite my roommates, they go to one of my friends house to play smash all the time, but I just seem to get left out. At first I thought it was maybe just coincidental but it happened again today. I came out of my room and nobody was here. They had left to go the friends house and didn't even tell me. 

So I guess my question is if I'm just letting anxiety get the best of me, or is something really going on that I'm missing? Also where should I go from here?"

I have some questions regarding the creation of a public Wifi system i'am trying to do atm.

Here's what i have and what i want to do :

1. Two NanoStation Loco M2 which allowed me to create two differents SSID working on the same router.(i know it would be better to use only one device to create those SSID, but that's the only thing i have at the moment. Any advice on the best device i could buy regarding my needs ?)
2. I'am currently trying to setup a captive portal with PFsense.
3. I want to be able to setup vouchers on one of these wifi network (which will act as a public Wifi) while the other remain used for an application only and i have no clue how i can do that.
4. As one of those networks will be used to do some public wifi, i need to setup a way to get logs and to keep them for one year in respect of the law in my country. Any hints on how i could do it ?
5. I also have a DHCP server which is not Pfsense, so i was thinkink of using the service DHCP Relay of PFsense and point my DHCP server adress with it. Is it the right way to do ?
6. QoS : I also want to be able to do some QoS on those devices, to be sure that the wifi network used for the application can always work optimally .

&amp;#x200B;

I know most of these things can be done with PFsense, but i would gladly take any advices regarding the matter. I'am in an internship at the moment and i lack some knowledge regarding the matter.

I am trying to look every intersting videos on Pfsense and all the tutorials i can found, but I am wondering if i'am walking in the right direction.

  
Thanks in advance !

at112y,0,2019-02-21,How a feminist destroyed my life,[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/at112y/how_a_feminist_destroyed_my_life/,"I'm not good at this, but I'll try my best.
English is not my first language, please be patient.
Some background:

I'm a 31yo male, I live in Brazil, I used to work on a Telecom company for about 3 years, selling smartphones and monthly Internet plans, one day I attended two clients, mother(50yo more or less) and daughter (30yo more or less), I've always dated older woman my whole life, that's my personal taste for woman because I feel like they're atittude are more mature and calm.
Shortening the story, Me and the lady exchanged glances and smiles, and late that day I messaged her, I was very polite as always, asked if it was okay to talk to her and try to know her better because I liked her, and she said she liked me too, we talked for about an hour, getting to know each other, then it was time to go to bed, we compliment each other and we say how nice it was for us to know each other  and  etc, then we said good bye and went to sleep.
 The next day when I woke to go to work, I saw that I was blocked by her in Whatsapp app, So I think to myself ""Well she probably regretted talking to me because I'm younger or something like that, guess that's that, I'm moving on, then I deleted the whole conversation and her contact (big mistake)""( her daughter blocked me when she saw our conversation). One day later when I arrive at work, my boss came to talk to me and say that I was harassing an old woman that her daughter called the company to report me and posted on Company Facebook page my whole name( my whole name was in the contract of the monthly plan I sold to her mother) saying this things, saying that I was sexually harassing her mom and lots of stuff( when the truth is we just talked about common stuff, the closest thing was me saying that she was beautiful, and she saying I was handsome too). Then the boss of my boss called the store and said lots of bad things to me, called me a rapist(wtf) and that my life has ended. I got fired, had to delete all social media, never got a job again, it all happened January 2016.
You may be asking why I didn't defend myself, why I didn't tell what really happened, because I deleted the whole conversation just when I saw she had blocked me, I couldn't prove anything, so I just listened to the accusations with my mouth shut, I never thought that kind of thing was going to happen in my life. 
I was crushed, there was nothing I could do.
Why I decided to tell this now? I'm studying IT(free technical school, I'm in the second semester of four) I did an interview for a job last week in a great company for an internship, I was so positive that my life will get better, but I didn't get approved on the interview, so my depression hited me hard,( I've been fighting depression since when I was 12yo). Lots of things was in my mind, since 2016 I can't live like a normal person, my only pair of shoes have holes, my underwear is loose with holes, I have only one pant to go everywhere, I've gained 44 pounds, I'm not homeless right now only because I'm living with my sister who pays rent and food, I'm only studying because it's free and the bus is free too because my student pass, we are in a bad spot when it comes to money, (one year ago I discovered that I'm very likely to be autistic( which will explain a lots of situations that happened in my life, I talked to a doctor and he said that I have lots autism symptoms, and he thinks that maybe I have Asperger's syndrome but to be sure I need to go to other doctors to have a full diagnosis). Sometimes I think my life just ended and it's pointless to keep trying, I really don't know what to do, I just wanted to have a job, to be useful, to get better, I don't know what else to do.
I'm sorry for the long post and the bad English.
PS: when I got fired I saw the daughter post on the Facebook company page before I deleted my account, and saw her profile, she is a feminist and I think in the US she is what people call a ""SJW"".

edit : thank you all, after reading all the answers, I came to the conclusion that I really do not deserve to live anymore, that an unethical attitude is worse than a crime, I've been struggling for the past 3 years to have a life again, without success, things just got worse every day, so here I say goodbye, I can't go on anymore.

at1jvn,13,2019-02-21,Experience with M2 club,ThatChilGuy,shanghai,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/at1jvn/experience_with_m2_club/,"I've just arrived one week ago as a student doing my internship in Shanghai. Today some friends I've made here were contacted by some promotors and we're planning to go to M2 club tomorrow (Friday)

We are getting a ton of free alcohol which I know is most likely going to be fake but I still wanted to hear from some people if they had any good or bad experiences here. Any things I should or shouldn't do?

I'll give an update Saturday myself.

Edit: My personal experience with M2

I arrived early at around 22:30 to the club. Some of our friends were afraid we would lose our table if we didn't show up before 11pm. This is probably a scare tactic from the promotor but whatever. After saying the name of the promoter that got in touch with us we received a blue wristband at the door and were given the house rules. Normal stuff: don't touch anyone elses bottles and if you do, you pay for them (I suppose this is because many tables order bottles just to be displayed as you'll read later on).

We are sent upstairs through an elevator with a screen in its roof to make it seem like you are warping through space. When the doors open you are greeted with a hard beat of whatever commercial edm pop remix is going on and with even more screens that display planets, moons and stars. You are asked to hang your coat away (which you don't have to do if you have a table). They ask 15rmb for this, which is outrageous, coming from a place where this usually costs a quarter of that price. Nevermind, I sucked it up anyway because I was feeling it.

When you get in you can go two directions. One to the lounge and the other to the tables and 'dance floor'. The beat plays louder and louder and when you walk through the double doors the flashy lights will blind you just enough. When that first impression wears off you get to see what it's like inside. Tables, tables, tables, tables and you guessed it, more tables. We were guided to our table and were greeted with an empty bucket of ice. I decided to hit the bar immediately as my hands got uncomfortable and wanted to hold a bottle of beer. Big mistake.

Coming at the bar I asked for a beer. The bartender looked down on me as if I was the bastard son of a dirt poor Peruvian coffee farmer. ""a beer? Seriously?"" ""yes, I'd like a beer"". He showed me a small bottle of tsingtao, one of the most common and cheaper brands I got to know. I was holding a hundred RMB and nodded to assure him that that would do. The bartender must've seen the bill I was holding and decided on the spot that was the price. I was shocked. But I sucked it up anyway, because I was feeling it.

So the alcohol arrives at our table. An opened bottle of grey goose, some unknown brand of whisky accompanied with some questionable juices in a container and a couple of bottles of tsingtao. The look on people's faces when I told them that I payed 100RMB for something that's on our table for free only three minutes prior. Had a laugh about my stupidity and continued with my night. The alcohol smelled foul. There's just something off. When you get a gag reflex you know it's not OK. So I just did not touch it.

Decided I wanted a proper drink and took the advice of a friend and asked for the menu first, just so they don't pull the same trick as before. This comes on screen shots on a tablet. I don't know but I'm pretty sure they have a western menu with different prices. I pointed at the thing I wanted and ordered a classic gin tonic. Nothing to complain about here. It tasted nice and was a nice refreshment of the beer. If you plan on drinking the free beers you'll receive you might have a bad time as they only bring in a batch about every half an hour/every hour.

Music wise it was fine. Commercial EDM remixes with a casual techno feeling. The dance floor is laughable. I would say it is about 25sqm/270sqft and is placed in front of the dj and in front of the front row tables which are reserved for the Chinese. Starting to get bored, most of our group immediately went to the dance floor and some locals followed. The music was fun at the beginning but I just got tired of the ""three two one go"", quick silence and drop. Decided to head back at the tables and absorb everything.

I didn't notice a dresscode. Most kids were dressed well, but a lot of Asian guys had the 'American soundcloud rapper look'. If you're not sure what I mean here, just look up SCXRLXRD, you'll know what I mean. I looked at other tables and everyone was on their smartphone. Can't blame them, there's no way to talk really. 

It also seemed like a show off contest. ""who can get the most expensive logo on their table"", that's what it would be called because they don't touch the bottle/box when it arrives. Dom perignon and Armand de brignac at the front and the level of expensiveness fades out the more you move towards the back.

I have something else to mention as well. About 10 minutes after we arrived a group of 5 Western people started standing close to us. Not talking to each other, just standing there bobbing their head. Normally I wouldn't think anything of that but they were standing there in a way that weirded me out. They followed us to the dance floor and stood there as well. No clue what's up with that.

Later on the evening some Chinese youngsters seemed to have taken over our table. I didn't mind, really. I was fine with it as we got it for free and I was about to leave anyway to check out another club. I decided I would let this guy have his evening of balling and spending money.

Edit 2: I just noticed I received Korean money as change from the club. Beware of that and check it. 

TL;DR: Alright club, got scammed out of 100rmb which is my fault, asked 15rmb for coats, gave shady alcohol which I didn't touch. Catchy music that gets old quickly. Nice locals that get the courage to talk to you after some drinks. Weird group of western people followed our group. Drinks price: 50RMB and up

at1llc,56,2019-02-21,Wanna attack my friend? Respect from everyone gone.,GreenParadoxx,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/at1llc/wanna_attack_my_friend_respect_from_everyone_gone/,"Hi! I'm extremely new to this subreddit, but I thought of a story that happened about a year ago now and decided to share it. \[TL;DR at the bottom\]

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of backstory: This happened while we were still 17, but the tension between me and this person had been going on since we were 14 as freshman in the same high school. We had even dated in the 3-4 years we went to the school. We'll call her ""Alexa"" from this point forward just to keep the privacy. She had also been a straight up bitch to me for junior and senior years of our high school career, but I stayed her friend because nostalgia. Also, we both had interned at a ***police call center***, our senior year, since our high school specialized in law enforcement and criminal justice. The friend in question that was 'attacked' will have her named changed to Chill, since she is chill. (keep the call center in mind, it'll be important later.)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's begin. So as our senior year started, I was already in a not so good mood, since I trained and worked all summer long for the internship, had a general shit summer, and Hurricane Harvey flooded my apartment (everything was fine, we just were without power because the wire had gotten water damaged). This didn't stop from Alexa starting our first day of school by basically screaming and jumping around greeting everyone telling them how much she missed them, then she came to me trying to hug me. Reluctantly, I hugged her back, as I was too tired (I consistently woke up @ 5:30 every morning to catch the bus as I lived quite a distance away from the school) and I already had a headache from her early greetings, so I didn't feel like fighting it. This routine went on for **months** as we had half our classes together since our internship took our last 2 spots for the end of the day leaving us to train the next group of kids and get to work on time. 

&amp;#x200B;

But everything really started to go downhill when 2 different events happened later on in the school, if I remember correctly, within the same or the next month of each other. The first was an annual banquet our teacher held in order to give thanks to the people who make our organization possible (our internship is unique as it is the only program of its kind in the United States). We had been planning for the event for 2-3 months prior to it taking place, with us constantly stating to dress professionally since our literal founders and supporters will be in attendance. This girl shows up in a skin-tight, half-thigh length, short-sleeved dress, literally standing out like a sore thumb because she looked like she was gonna go clubbing, ruining our reputation. If her style of clothing wasn't bad enough, the dress was so tight you could see her panties and bra as well as every single curve in her body. She was literally pulled aside afterwards and told if she went to work like that after the event like that, they would have to give her some serious consequences. Later, our second event came up, and she was more appropriately dress this time. This was another banquet-like event that was honoring our some of our officers, and when we arrived, we were given specific instructions to separate 2 at a table to allow us not to be constantly talking to each other instead of making possible business contacts. Most of us followed the rule given to us, except Alexa. Alex joined sitting with my best friend and another mutual friend that were already sitting there. Chill saw this, and obviously want to keep everyone out of trouble, so she walked over and reminded Alexa of the rule. Alexa snickered at Chill while telling her that there was an open seat, so it didn't matter. Chill let this go simply because she would have our teacher resolve this the following day (our teacher had left early due to some school thing). After the event, we all were talking in a small group while Alexa instigated the whole event blowing it out of proportion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obliviously pissed, Chill left the area while everyone was staring at Alexa in a way that said ""really?"" The sad thing is that Alexa involved my best friend, who was a sweet and innocent guy until she forced sexual tension and dangled the carrot in his face as if there was a chance she would sleep with him. The next day, Alexa had told the teacher what had happened and had my best friend lie to my teacher about what happened. Thankfully, the rest of the class stood behind Chill when she was called in and asked about what had happen. I devised a plan with Chill destroy her image, which she held so valuable in her mind. We began to slowly spread rumors that she was cheating again on her boyfriend, and we made sure everyone knew about her lying and trying to mess up Chill's reputation. This immediately plunged her image down the drain, but the straw that broke the camel's back was when I revealed to the teacher that I heard rumors at the call center of Alexa sleeping around with men that were older. (Remember, at the time we are all mostly underage.) He went on secretly investigating, and lo and behold it was true. He found out she was sleeping with men there and pulled from work for a week. He said he would've taken a way more drastic action of firing her, but there was about only a week and a half left. So he didn't want to ruin the program's image by firing a girl with less than 2 weeks left. After that, only my ex-best friend, at this point, was the only one talking to her while everyone in our graduating class of 75 gave her the cold shoulder for trying to ruin Chill's image for trying to keep Alexa out of trouble. Eventually, Alexa found out I was the one who told she was sleeping around and tried to guilt trip me, but I simply smiled and told her in the most sincere and polite voice I could muster, ""Fuck off."" Since then, she's moved out of the city going to a university over 80 miles away. Needless to say, she still doesn't have any respect from our graduating and made entirely new friends because no one even associates with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

My ex was a mean bitch who screwed me over for all my high school year then ruins a program's, I am associated with, reputation, and attacks a friend's image because she wanted to be in the right, so me and my friend ruin the last few months of high school by exposing her for a cheating lying woman who thinks she's entitled.

So I chose this environmental biology company in my country that brings students out on field trips for learning. 
Because it's set up by internationals, most of the staff there are internationals, there were only 2 other of my own country people. 

So it was probably a combination of us not really being able to click due to different wavelength, and me being more introverted, and also me being afterwards diagnosed with dysthymia(persistent depressive disorder). 

I felt super anti social and withdrawn and I can't help it. I didn't expect it to be like this at work. Perhaps back in university we had a lot of free time and I wasn't around people a lot of the time. I didn't really have friends but I made a really good friend in lab. 

I'm not sure how to go ahead with life. Yesterday was a really bad day, I just woke up feeling moody(I record my emotions everyday). And then it indeed was a bad day, all my colleagues could tell.  I felt suicidal like my life can't ever be normal because of this mental illness. 

I know that people say it can be treated. But it's gonna take a long time isn't it?

On the positive note, I have a fiancee who really loves and roots for me despite knowing all these. He is the only reason why I can hold on for so long. "

Now I'm familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, Python, SQL, and Ruby, but I am currently on an internship where I HAVE to know Postgresql and Ruby on Rails. I've started so many tutorials, and I'm finding that the ones I find either have a million outdated gems, which would not be so bad if it only took me a little while to fix dependencies, but they usually take me hours, or they assume I know alot of things about the framework before teaching them to me.

Not a single tutorial I've found so far has also EXPLAINED the code you're typing or what it does. It just wants you to MAKE something. I get that we can learn alot from making new things, but I have just been tasked with building a web app that will be used internationally internally at our company, and I need to have something working and on the table too. Likewise, if anyone knows of any similar videos for Postgres, that would be appreciated.

at297m,2,2019-02-21,"HELP ME PLEASE! I lost my focus, and memory,I became DUMB!!!!",Soukyama,productivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/at297m/help_me_please_i_lost_my_focus_and_memoryi_became/,"Hello Reddit ! PLEASE PLEAAAAAAAAAASE PLEAAAAAAAAASE HELP ME WITH MY STRUGGLE, I AM GETTING LOST !!!!

So here is my story:

In last couple of months, or to be more precise, in the last 3 years, I completely lost my ability to focus, concentrate on anything really. 

I am actually in an engineering school. After my preparatory classes (and basically my first long holiday in a while), I bought a smart phone for the very first time. I started discovering YouTube and social media more. Knowing that my family was struggling money wise, so I didn't travel, all I did for 3 months straight is watching Youtube, listening to music non stop, going to Twitter, Reddit, and other websites. At first it was fun, really fun. But when my engineering school started, that's where the trouble began. 

At first, I was holding my phone throughout all my classes. Non stop! All my classes. 

The professor would be explaining things, and by the end of the class, I learned 0 information. The worst part is, I wasn't even bothered, nor concerned. It didn't bother me at all. 

Then, after 3 months, there was an exams week, and I have failed most of the classes, though I managed to pass some of the exams, either by cheating (I know, this is terrible), or by learning by heart in the night before (after pulling an all-nighter). The problem is, even during my all nighters, I used to still take my phone and check on Twitter, YouTube, etc. 

I kept saying to myself: 5 more minutes, 10 more minutes. And before I know it, it was already 3 am in the morning. 

2 and a half years later, the problem got worse, I always counted on other people to explain the most obvious things to me: 

For example, we would have a good professor, and I'd be thinking that I am focused, litterally I'd be saying in my head: YOU ARE FOCUSING, KEEP GOING, then 10 seconds later, I'd have the feeling that he is just moving his mouth, but I have no clue what he is saying. And by the middle of the class, I'd be thinking about how fucked up my brain became, and how much of a loser I became, after being such a good smart girl back in highschool (I even participated in the national mathematical olympiads, and was ranked 2nd best girl of the country in 2014, and I was in the top 30 students in Physics nationwide at that same year).

Now, all I do is lose time, think about how much of a loser I am, I know for suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure that I can't think as good as other people, all people to me are smarter, way smarter. Even in normal social discussions, I am too dumb to even come up with replies. Sometimes people would be talking to me and I'd be staring at them, bacause I didn't process yet what they have been saying to me.

I have a terrible memory as well (to make it worse). Being in an internship abroad right now, all what my tutor tells me, I forget it right away, so I end up asking the same question twice or even more. Now, litterally everyone is considering me the dumbest one here. I know that people dont even look at me when they talk, you know the feeling when people avoid looking at you, so that you'd not talk to them and be awkward with them ? yes, that is exactly it. 

And btw, even my professors, my tutor at my internship, ... made me some remarks about this. My professors told me many times that I am the latest one when we have some project to deliver. I have a reputation for always being late, sleepy, dreamy in class, etc. That even people start to joke about it. I am always the one who does not understand anything, etc.

I tried doing to-do lists, so I end up writing let's say a list for 2 days, and 2 weeks passed by, I didn't do A SINGLE TASK on it. NOT A SINGLE ONE :( This was happening for the last two years.

I tried watching motivational videos, I end up watching them than going to sleep. 

I just... DONT KNOW WHAT THE F IS WRONG WITH MEEEEEEE :(((((((((

The thing is, I know that one of the main reasons of this is actually my smart phone. But I need it since I am abroad, so I need to talk to my parents on Whatsapp, and check on my e-mails, etc. 

But at same time, I am litterally watching myself becoming may be the dumbest person on earth, no joke. I am going downhill, and being the one who is supposed to support my family (I am the oldest child, my dad has a salary of 200$ per month, which is less than the minimum salary of the country, and my mom doesn't work, both have never been to school, so growing up in such a hard social and economic condition, I HAVE TO get better to be able to work, elsewise I'd be kicked out, for being so dumb and actually useless :( (This is making me tear up at work, but I don't know what to do :( I hope you guys would help me :( )

&amp;#x200B;

Last month I posted a story on r/entitledparents where I talked about how I had my internship at an employment agency and that I had more stories from that time, so here is another one hope you enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

There aren't many characters so it should not be confusing:

S: my colleague and the victim

JB: Jobbeard and his nasty smell

Me: me....

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened a week ago in the afternoon so everything is still very fresh in my mind.

I was just doing my usual work: calling people who are interested in a job, making appointments, checking the work schedule all that stuff when JB entered the office. He was almost a typical neckbeard: fat, long greasy hair, sweatpants, a shirt with a reference I didn't recognize and of course a poor excuse for a beard. I walked up to him and asked what I could do for him, he told me he had an appointment with S so I told him she was on her way from lunch and that he could wait on a bench.

S came in 10 minutes later and said hello to JB, JB's face lit up when she walked in, he jumped up and followed her like a lap dog. They sat down at her desk which is right next to mine and when I sat down myself I almost gagged because of his smell I can't quite put my finger on it but he smelled like sweat and expired milk combined, when he opened his mouth I could see a row of yellow/brownish teeth. I saw that S was uncomfortable but got down to business really fast. JB was here because he had gotten a serious complaint from one of his co-workers and was fired on the spot because of this complaint, S wanted to talk to him about it. When she brought it up JB was visibly upset.

S: ""JB why did you do that? You know that is uncalled for.""

JB: ""I didn't do anything, she (person who filed complaint) is lying, I would never do that in my life!""

S: ""JB this isn't the first time you've gotten a complaint like that and you always say that they are lies, the first time I believed you but this is the third time and you've lost my trust.""

JB: ""But I'm telling the truth I swear on my life!""

S: ""JB please stop, there is nothing I can do to help you.""

JB did not like this answer, so he decided to try and haggle his way out of this situation.

JB trying to sound cool and 'suave': ""Is there anything I can do to make it right? I would do anything to gain your trust again. Anything.""

He gave S a wink and went to hold her hand, S didn't expect this but was quick enough to pull her hand away.

S: ""JB please don't do that it's only making things worse.""

JB: ""Don't lie to me, I can see you want it, I can see you want me.""

S: ""Stop JB please, I don't want you or anything from you. I'm not interested.""

JB: ""Come on I can make you feel good and then you'll never want anyone else.""

At this point I've had enough and stood up to help my colleague, I pulled her chair back a bit so that I'm in front of JB.

Me: ""JB she asked you loud and clear to stop, she may have the patience to ask you a third time but I don't, so please stop harassing her or I'll have to remove you from the office.""

JB's face turned red with anger and he stood up and tried to make himself look buff. I wasn't intimidated by this at all and walked around the desk right up to his face.

The smell was horrible but I resisted gagging.

Me: ""Last chance JB please leave.""

JB said nothing and spat in my face, normally I'm not a violent guy but I wasn't in a good mood that day and that pushed me over my limit. I wiped of his spit and hit him straight in his shnoz, he goes down easily so with a lot of trouble I drag his bloody ass outside.

S asks me if I'm ok and I tell her I'm fine and go back to finish my work. Once my work was finished I went home earlier because I had to go to the hospital to visit my mother.

When I went outside I saw JB sitting in his shitty car with a tissue under his nose, he stared me down but I just ignored him and went to my bus.

A week later S told me JB came back in the office when I left and tried to get me fired for attacking him, our manager called the cops and he was arrested. Later I found out JB was fired because he was caught jacking it in the women's bathroom.

I am here looking for advice from any students whom have experience studying in HKU. I have mainly three goals of studying in HK and I am trying to clarify my thoughts here.

1. Firstly, to study reputable CS courses. How is the CS courses there in the field of software engineering? In terms of teaching, exposure and interaction.
2. How do the CS courses there compare to CS courses in Nanyang Technological  (Singapore)?
3. Secondly, to improve my Mandarin capability as to future-proof my career in Shenzhen. What are the chances for me to meet mainland Chinese students in CS field for me to practice my Mandarin? The statistics shows that HKU has lots of mainland students but I do not know whether if it applies for CS field or not.
4. Thirdly, to meet more international students (in particular, from Canada and America) as to gain more ideas and thoughts. What are the chances to interact with Canadians or Americans in technology or other fields?
5. What are the extracurricular activities there? (I know that exchange students are unable to work part time or take up internships), hence what are the recommendations for exchange student like me to spend my remaining time?

&amp;#x200B;

I could not study in China because I am trying to complete my units via English medium instructions. Hence, in my opinion, I think HK fits my aspirations. My exchange university options are HKU, CUHK and CityUHK.

What do you think? If possible, please give me more detailed information, advises or recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------Below is my exchange plan-------------

I am planning to do two exchanges in total. First to Singapore (NTU), then to HK (HKU). I know that in terms of academic (computer science / technology courses), NTU does better than HKU, but the down side is that Singapore will be a boring place to interact. On the other hand, in terms of experience, exposure and interaction, HKU does better than NTU, but the down side is that HK is not a technology-savvy place. Hence, I decided to balance out between academics and experience by doing two exchanges each to Singapore and HK. Is experience or academic (courses), which is more valuable? Could anyone comment on my plan? I am trying to create the best possible plan to fit the three goals above. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

at3w6q,11,2019-02-21,My husband keeps saying things that really bum me out. I know he‚Äôs not trying to bum me out though.,DingleMomMcGee13,beyondthebump,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/at3w6q/my_husband_keeps_saying_things_that_really_bum_me/,"When I had our son we stepped back and looked over our life again. As it turns out I‚Äôm not cut out to be a stay at home mom and he hates the workforce. Luckily I dream to be an engineer and he‚Äôs a big homebody, so we complete each other in the opposite ways we thought haha. Obviously we decided to switch sides, but we also decided first I‚Äôd go to school and be there for my son in the early times (breastfeeding and all) while I do school and such. 

Ok backstory time over. 

So lately, as you‚Äôd expect, we chat a lot about the exciting future where he stays at home and keeps the home while I work, god willing we can afford it. But lately he keeps saying things like ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm at home we‚Äôre gonna have an awesome and healthy weekly menu‚Äù right after we notice I didn‚Äôt get anything good for dinner and we have to eat pizza. Or ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm at home the laundry will be organized so much better since I‚Äôll have so much time‚Äù after we see the giant pile of laundry on the couch. And to top it off he really wants to homeschool our son, which we argue about a ton. 

By the time I graduate my son will be 5 and he‚Äôll be out of the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù phase, so maybe it will be easier for him. But when he says stuff like that I just feel so crappy. Like yeah sometimes the laundry piles up. And yeah sometimes the dishes aren‚Äôt all done. But I have a lot on my plate...I do school AND home life, I‚Äôm constantly driving (to and from the school and my moms house to drop off our son) AND we‚Äôre trying to re-build our relationship foundation after a bit of a rough patch. 

It doesnt sound like much but it‚Äôs stressful... and in general I‚Äôve always been a crap ‚Äúhomekeeper‚Äù. I‚Äôm not a good cook. I never clean the ‚Äúright‚Äù way. I even forget to feed and water myself without a reminder every few hours. 

Ok here‚Äôs the rant

The thing that makes me feel like a bad person is how I think he‚Äôs gonna do just as ‚Äúbad‚Äù as I am and he just doesn‚Äôt realize it. He boasts about having a perfectly greased home under his rule but I know him. On days off, or even weeks when he‚Äôs on vacation, he‚Äôs incredibly lazy and unhealthy. When he has a weekend he doesn‚Äôt usually get productive, he usually lays around and plays games because it‚Äôs his only ‚Äútime off‚Äù. But you don‚Äôt get ‚Äútime off‚Äù when you‚Äôre the homekeeper. Parents don‚Äôt get vacations. And he thinks he‚Äôs gonna have this perfect little home on a perfect little street with his perfect little homeschooled kid and everything will be great. 

Am I just so inept that I can‚Äôt do that? He‚Äôll, I was a ‚Äúhomekeeper‚Äù for a few years before our son was born and I struggled. WITHOUT a child in my life it was rough. Granted, I was heavily depressed through that time but my husband is extremely stressed 24/7. He almost cried when he spilled his cup of water twice in a row the other day. An anxiety disorder might make it even harder for him than it was for me with depression. At least my heart rate was low most of the time. 

Idk I just feel like he‚Äôs biting off WAY more than he can chew before he even has a plate. Like, we‚Äôre YEARS from him being a homekeeper and he‚Äôs already sooo underhandedly boastful about how *great* he will be in comparison to garbage DingleMom. He never explicitly says I don‚Äôt do good enough, but he‚Äôll ask me to pull my weight more or make small criticisms towards what I HAVE done. Then later he‚Äôll say how well it‚Äôll work when HE is in charge of it. 

It just makes me feel like absolute crap. 

Ok /rant. 

I know he doesn‚Äôt mean it in a mean way when he says these things. He‚Äôs just excited to be a more homey dad and out of the workforce. But it just makes me feel so upset. I‚Äôm probably being sensitive because I‚Äôm stressed about school. My financial aid basically says I HAVE to finish school in 4 years or less so I‚Äôm taking classes through the summers and I literally will not have a break unless I finish early. Then he talks about how great it‚Äôll be when I work and when I say I want to find an internship in my senior year he asks ‚Äúwill it be paid? Because then i could quit even earlier!‚Äù And I‚Äôm SO STRESSED because I can‚Äôt support our home AND finish my senior year all alone!! I‚Äôm so stressed about it :(

Ok, I‚Äôm done ranting. I‚Äôm just so high strung lately and I take everything wrong. We argue about that sometimes too, and he often says I‚Äôm just plain mean in the way I say things. So I‚Äôm trying to find a counselor but I‚Äôm taking a LONG time because of all the stress, and that makes us argue more because I haven‚Äôt gotten a counselor! Ugh. So stressed. 

It‚Äôll be easier at the end of this semester. We have a Disney trio planned with my parents and it‚Äôs gonna be such a sweet escape from life. "

First time making a post on Reddit so forgive any sort of editing issues.

My partner (PGY1-FM) is extremely burned out right now and it is affecting all aspects of his life and therefore my life as well.  He's exhausted, he hasn't had a day off in almost 3 weeks, when he comes home all he wants to do is mess around on reddit for an hour or two and then go to bed.  I have no issue with this, to a degree, that's what helps him chill after a stressful day.  But, this exhaustion and withdrawal into himself is spilling over into our relationship.  We have spent very little quality time together lately and what we have had, we usually get into a small silly fight.

How have you guys helped to break your partner out of a major funk?  A large part of it is circumstantial, sure.  Being an intern is the worst, and it's cold and dark all the time.  We're a little more than halfway through but it sure doesn't feel like it.  I also am a nurse and my non-traditional hours make it even harder for us to have time together.  I wish I could just help him focus a bit more on the positive...like yesterday, due to weather he was sent home early and had the whole afternoon off.  It felt like such a gift to me but to him, it seemed like all he was able to focus on was how he was still so exhausted even with the extra time.  I'm not trying to take that away from him-I know he is exhausted and he is overworked.  But I wish he could just let in even just like 10% more joy and happiness and positivity into his life.  

I'm not acutely worried about his mental health-he has (re)started seeing a therapist and goes to the gym to manage his mental health.  I just wish he could find a little more happiness in the day to day and I didn't feel like I was being dragged down with him.  

Any thoughts? Thanks for listening to my rambling. "

at5rqy,6,2019-02-21,Introducing myself and looking for wisdom and advice,superdduper93,RPChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPChristians/comments/at5rqy/introducing_myself_and_looking_for_wisdom_and/,"Quick stats on myself:

26M, lean physique, bodyweight oriented man (think Alex Honnold), devout Catholic.

Cradle until high school, Red Pilled last year.

**Story:**

I was born and raised to be a nice guy, who can blame me? Asian households tend to emasculate boys and turn them into people pleasers that love their Mother. My parents lived vicariously through me whether it was making me learn the piano, violin, being an Altar Boy, etc.

Growing up, I soon became addicted to PMO as a form of escape and it became a major problem. In this time I didn't realize that I was betaing myself so to speak.

In high school however, things slowly changed. I became a cross country runner that was great, but struggled when it came to academics. The Church I attended was only two blocks away so I soon found myself going to the Chapel to pray. It soon led me to do everything to find a closer relationship with God.

For a short time in high school, I abstained because I focused on academics but for the wrong reasons; to please my parents.

I graduated high school and went traveled to Europe for World Youth Day. That was where I began to get out of my shell that I was in. While I was devout to my Faith, I wasn't devout to myself as a Nice Guy, being shy and hoping that someone would notice me. This would all change when I was put out of my comfort zone, having me resolve that I will get out of my shell and make a better version of myself. 

A year later after attending college at the conclusion of World Youth Day, I traveled to the East Coast for Church Group training. I knew no one and no one knew me but I made friends quickly and met a wonderful girl who loved pickup lines.

We soon began talking over FB and texting and fell in love over the course of the summer. But lo, my PMO addiction fantasy came back and soon I was subtly displaying being needy and clingy. She decided to end things which left me depressed.

This was around the time I was fed up with college because I felt it was impractical, dropped out, then realized I was a nice guy all this time. I hated myself for it and resolved to find a way to become an actual man for myself. Not to please Mommy and Daddy, but because I wanted to better myself.

That came in the form of the United States Marine Corps where I enlisted. Being from the West Coast, I was soon thrown into Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego where I felt that it was a personal purgatory of sorts. At the time, it was a men's only environment and it subtly peeled away the Nice Guy attributes that was ruining my life. I found myself growing close to God just to survive all the trials.

When I came out, I felt more masculine and energized thanks to the environment that was a blessing in disguise. But like any typical Marine out there, I emasculated myself without knowing it through PMO behavior. It didn't help that it was a normalized deal in military life.

Four years later with no real game or plan per se, I got out of the Marine Corps, feeling like I got cheated out. What I didn't realize was that the military wasn't there to make me into a man, in fact it was far from that thanks to the politically correct environment that it was now. In terms of relationships, I was being unintentional despite being a gentleman and wearing an attractive uniform, and found myself getting dumped.

Everything changed when I watched The Dating Project which made me realize that I needed to be intentional and that I needed to stop with the PMO behavior in addition to going to Church daily.

I began to see a pretty girl that lived two hours north of me and for a good minute we dated. She was a devout Catholic that wore a veil and preferred the traditions over the modern Church as I was and I felt that she was the right woman despite a past.

But once more, my PMO addiction got in the way and she pulled a sudden breakup. Back then, I felt she was the stereotypical sanguine, being bored after a certain period of time and being passive aggressive but let's face it: I betaed myself through PMO, didn't have a task and purpose in life, and wasted my life force as a result of the PMO problem which made me look beta, needy, and clingy all this time.

That was when I rediscovered God once more, realizing that he wanted me to better myself instead of just continuing on the Beta road through my PMO problem, and to become an actual man. Not just gentleman, but a primal Alpha man who wouldn't take trash from anybody.

I started with NoFap, abstaining from PMO and while challenging has made me respect myself more instead of just binging through having accountability. That would lead me to Semen Retention which made me realize that I needed to stop wasting what made me a man through my addiction and that sexuality is for human procreation and actual pleasure with real people instead of just pictures on the computer. This would soon lead me to the Red Pill to which I have been ever since, that has led me to working an internship that pays well, and where I am seeing a Latina woman.

While it's painful having to endure a breakup and realize all of this which has made me hate myself for not realizing how I was making myself into a Beta without knowing it, I'm thankful that I am now here on r/RPChristians where after reading a lot of posts, I feel at home.

What I seek is for further wisdom and advice on how to better myself as a man in a Biblical context, be the Alpha Male in a Christian context, and to keep myself in check and taking ownership of self.

I haven't spoken to the ""real"" version of you in a year and a half, and even though she pretends not to, she knows why. I have never felt supported by her, especially in my school/career life. She tried to sabotage my education so I would come home and enable her self-destructive nature, her emotional manipulations, and her self-medication. After my other mom killed herself (my bio-mom's ex wife who I was much closer to than I was/am to my bio-mom), she didn't call. And when she did months later, it was to tell me how horrible I am and how stupid I am. But this isn't about her. For once, this is actually about me.

These next paragraphs are full of a bunch of stuff that I have wanted to tell you about for a while. It's all stuff I don't really get to talk about because I don't want to bore people. If you find it boring or excessive, I get it, video games/video game careers aren't everyone's cup of tea.

I'm in my final semester of college, and my chosen path is pretty niche. It's Narrative Design for interactive media (a.k.a. all the story/dialogue/writing that goes into video games), and at this point it's a career path that doesn't have all the support lines set up for it that other creative fields have. I even created my own major at my school that would allow me to focus on this career that I am **very** passionate about, and I think I've been doing pretty well. I have good grades for the first time in my life. A few of my professors actually seem to like me and support me. One of them even asked me to do narrative design work on a game he's making, and I'm now doing a one credit Directed Study class with him where I get to do all these awesome things for the game and learn a lot along the way. I've been feeling pretty great about where I'm heading, but now that I'm almost done with school, I'm starting to panic. Especially because of this internship that I applied for recently.

There's this internship that I applied for 11 days ago at one of my absolute dream studios. When I talk about where I would want to work, this place was always one of the four I listed, and it always seemed like such a pipe dream to get to work there. Seriously, if this were TV, this would be like getting to work on the next season of Game of Thrones. It's really that awesome. And last month, that studio posted what is literally the **only** game writing internship I have ever seen. Telltale has had one before, but they only did it a few times (as far as I know), and they're gone now anyway. Studios will have design internships, art internships, programming internships, sometimes even audio internships, but they *never* have narrative design internships. So when I saw this opportunity, I was over the moon. It's 8 weeks, full time, paid, *and* it has a housing stipend. It's literally the dream, and the game industry is notoriously difficult to get into if you don't start with an internship. So I was overjoyed.

The posting said they wanted someone with either a game design related major or a writing related major, and I have both due to my interdisciplinary major. Along with that, I actually have some portfolio work now that I'm proud of and that speaks to my skillset. I'm also lucky enough to have a paid writing job right now (it's through my school, but I get to write and get paid for it, so I'm not complaining at all). To be frank, I thought it was pretty much guaranteed that I would get an interview, and I though I had a pretty good chance at getting the actual internship. God, that's so painful to write in retrospect.

I know you can probably see this coming, but it's been 11 days since I applied and I haven't heard anything. Their site says that they respond to qualified candidates in 7-10 days, and I know I'm just barely out of that window, but I just feel so broken. I thought for sure I could get an interview. I thought that after all this work I've done, I would see at least a bit of it pay off. I just wanted a tiny bit of reassurance that I'm not on the completely wrong path. I want to know that I'm not making a big and obviously stupid mistake by going after this career. I really thought that the studio would like that I've committed myself to this path in a way that many don't. I'm the only person in my school doing this, and the department is not insignificant. We're apparently one of the best game schools in the country. And, *god damn it,* I thought I was a good writer. It took me a long time to get to that point since I'm insecure about a lot of things, but I was finally feeling confident. I finally felt like I could call myself a writer without fear of being scoffed at or pitied.

I know this one is only one job. This is literally the first ""real"" thing I've applied to in my field, and I'm going to have to get used to rejection. I know this probably doesn't mean that I'm unskilled or untalented. I know there will most likely be other opportunities. But *jesus christ,* this really felt like the one. This just seemed like it was made for me. It's incredibly hubristic, but it felt like a reward for getting through these incredibly difficult years. It felt like a boon was being granted after I got through losing both of my moms, one to suicide, and the other to her refusal to change. It felt like I was finally going to feel capable, smart, wanted...

Mom, I just really need you to tell me that it's going to be okay. Right now I feel stupid. I feel like I did in high school when I couldn't get my GPA high enough to graduate with my friends. I feel like an imposter who's been pretending to be smart while everyone knows she's just getting by on pity. It's been hard here, mom. People talk down to me. People assume I don't understand the technical aspects of game design when I genuinely do. People have offered to let me copy their code or do my work for me like I don't belong here and couldn't *possibly* know what I'm doing. I know I belong here, but *fuck,* I just feel so useless right now. I feel like a fool who thought she was somehow special. What do I do, mom? What should I do if none of this works out?"

This past summer I interned at a tech company and I fell in love with it. I loved my job, coworkers, culture, environment, my mentor, CEO, just loved everything. As my internship came to an end in August, I decided to apply for a full time position in another department that I had little to no experience in. It was a cyber security position, prior to that I was on the network engineering team for the internship. I ultimately ended up being rejected because they wanted someone who basically had more experience and I also was required to take a cognitive test (CCAT) and they said my score was just a little too low but HR reassured me that the score wasn't the only thing that dictated their decision. Anyway, I tried to apply for a few other positions more suited for my xp level (Tech support, software dev, etc) &amp; I was rejected to move forward in the hiring process for all the positions. I ended up moving on and I landed a job as a front end developer at a start up company. Worked there from about a week after my internship up until last week. I wasn't happy there and the commute was taking a toll on me. So two days ago I saw an opening for tech support expert at the company I loved and I actually got a chance to move forward this time. I had to take that CCAT exam again online and I got an invitation to come in for a face to face interview and I will have to take the CCAT again but this time proctored. Anyway, sorry for the long back story but I am just nervous. This is my dream place to work and I feel like this is a second chance for me to be an employee again. I feel like I have an advantage because I was an intern there in the past and have a pretty solid resume. I also am still close with my mentor from that company who would love to give me a good recommendation. I also already know about the company and their products and technologies. But any tips to ease my nerves would be hella appreciated. Also if anyone knows about the CCAT I could use tips for that too."
at7fcr,0,2019-02-21,22 [A4A] Fandom Transformation Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,DirtyKIKRoleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyKIKRoleplay/comments/at7fcr/22_a4a_fandom_transformation_romance/,"Hello all! Today I am looking for someone to make my Christmas wish come true and tf my original male characters into hot girls. But the twist is it will be fandom based! You will play a fandom guy that initiates the transformation!

Here are a few ideas I had:

Pokemon:

Professor Birch gets a new lab assistant that's a man. He's been testing a serum that will turn anyone who drinks it into a hot woman. My character drinks it and slowly transforms into a woman. From there, Birch makes the newly tfed intern into his hot assistant girlfriend and the two begin a relationship, exploring the region and working in the lab.

My second pokemon idea would be Brock grows tired of being rejected. He finds a ray that allows him to tf my character into a hot girl. The two begin travelling together as pokemon breeders.

Yugioh (Original) idea:

Rex grows tired of being alone, so he decides to use a special dino card to change his rival into his hot girlfriend.

Yugioh GX ideas:

Chumley never was able to get girls. When he finds a card that allows him to turn people into hotties, he uses it on my character. The two start dating and dueling, confusing the gang but they're happy.

Bastion uses his knowledge to craft a ray that turns guys into hotties. He shoots it at an intelligent guy in order to get a girl with brains and looks.

Dragon Ball Z:

Tien uses the dragon balls to transform my character into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two travel the world and train together.

Legend of Korra:

Bolin is tired of striking out the girls. After finding strange spirit water, he gives it to one of his earth bending students, turning him into a hot girl that he claims as his girlfriend.

Avatar the last Airbender:

The Boulder seems to always strike out with the ladies... So when he finds an old spirit scroll, he decides to use it on his pupil to turn him into his hot fiance.

Mario:

Bowser gives up on chasing Peach and uses a magic spell to turn a handsome prince charming into his hot beautiful queen.

Total Drama:

DJ is tired of being alone. He uses a family recipe to transform his friend into a hot girl that he makes his girlfriend. The two play with animals together.

Rodney is over being rejected. He recites a magic love poem that changes his friend into his new hot girlfriend that he spoils.

Chris grows lonely on the island, so he decides to transform an intern into his new hot girlfriend.

After his breakup with Bridgette, Geoff decides it's time to move on... And turns an intern/producer into his new hot girlfriend.

Star vs the forces of Evil:

Tom is tired of being rejected by Star, so he decides to steal her wand and cast a gender change spell on a prince.

TMNT:

Being a mutant turtle makes it impossible to score with the ladies. So Mikey steals Donny's gender ray to turn one of April's classmates into his new hot girlfriend.

These are just some ideas, I am open to yours too! All characters, regardless of age in the show, will be aged 18 or older. 

‚≠ê‚≠ê Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course). I don't expect you to write me a novel but please give me a reasonable reply length on average.

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

5. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

6. When you message me, please write more than ""hi"" or ""saw your post"". Tell me which post you are coming from and any ideas you have. You do not need to write me a book, just give me more than two words. Poor introductions will be ignored.

7. I am looking for my character to be tfed, NOT tfing other characters. If that is a deal breaker, you have been warned.

If you are interested, you can shoot me a PM or:

*****
&gt; The Future Engineer program&amp;#039;s goal is to bring computer science courses to more than 100,000 underprivileged kids in 2,000 low-income high schools across the U.S. It also awards 100 students per year with four-year $10,000 scholarships and offers internships at Amazon.

&gt; The U.S. high schools will offer the Intro to Computer Science and AP Computer Science classes through the curriculum provider Edhesive, says Amazon.

&gt; While Amazon obviously has a vested interest in ensuring the next generation of engineers are learning its own technologies, including AWS, investments like this help to level the playing field some by offering more students the opportunity to study computer science - which can lead to their ability to get into higher-paying jobs down the road, including those outside of Amazon.

&gt; The Amazon Future Engineer program itself is part of Amazon&amp;#039;s larger $50 million investment in computer science and STEM education.

&gt; Amazon notes that there will be 1.4 million computer science jobs available by 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, but only 400,000 computer science grads with the skills needed to apply for them.

&gt; Computer Science is also the fastest-growing STEM profession, but only 8 percent of STEM grads are earning a computer science degree.

The loss of Brian Flores is a BIG DEAL.  Much bigger than the loss of Patricia, whom I saw as nothing more than an intern whom Belichick promoted way too early.  This year's defense was one of the most consistent I've seen (and I've been an avid fan since 1974) .  I know it wasn't statistically their best defense, but it was certainly the most consistently coached since BB himself held the reigns.  Especially in-game consistency. 

BB was livid when Mangini left with a lot of NE's coaching staff to go to a team within the division.  Some of that, I believe, was compounded because they lost the AFC championship that year, but I think it will have as big of an impact.  Flores did an exceptional job, and while I'm not too concerned about Miami supplanting the Pats in the AFC East, his contributions (and those of the staff he's lured to a divisional foe) will be missed.  At some point, BB's going to express his concerns about this, as he did with Mangini.  I'm very concerned about how they'll go about replacing him."

atatds,0,2019-02-21,Not sure if I [26] will spend the rest of my life with my girlfriend [25] but I don‚Äôt have plan B,wonder999ful,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atatds/not_sure_if_i_26_will_spend_the_rest_of_my_life/,"I have been dating with my girlfriend for 1.5 year. This coming summer I will relocate to a city that is very close to my girlfriend‚Äôs. She is very happy and wants to move in with me. I said yes to her but then had a second thought. I am not quite sure if moving-in together is a good idea or not. 

I feel like that living together is a very serious step towards a marriage. In the past years, we spent a lot of time together, but we always have our own homes. One exception is last summer. She got an internship in some other place and I was free, so we rented one place together and stayed together for two months. However, that is also sort of a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù thing. Just for the summer.

The reason why I am worried about living together, is that my girlfriend is great companion/partner to me, we have a lot of fun together, but I don‚Äôt know if I wanna her to be my life-long partner. I like her, but I may not be really into her to spend the rest of my life with me.

I tried to ask girls out before meeting my current girlfriend. They all failed. TBH the girls I am interested in are way out of my league, though I am willing to spend my entire life with those girls. After numerous awkward moments and embarrassement, I knew it is impossible to date them. I gave up. 

Then my current girlfriend shew up. She liked me. She asked me out. It was she, instead of I, who pushed our relationship moving forward. Then we became boyfriend and girlfriend.

I like her. We have a lot of fun together. It is just she is not as gorgeous as those girls I tried so hard to get. I know she is perhaps the best girl I can get. Based on all I have (appearance, personality, career, all those factors), she might be the best match I can ever get. I asked myself, if I lose her, then who I will end up with? I don‚Äôt have plan B.

I felt very lonely before she becoming my girlfriend. I have very few friends. I have a bad relationship with my parents and other family members. Occasionally I became sad and blue because I had no one to talk to. I was really appreciated that I had a girlfriend. To me, it is more than a girlfriend. She is also a friend we had a lot of fun.

If I am not going to marry her, then maybe we should break up as soon as possible. It is kind of I am wasting her time. She is in a love with me, and she may want to be my wife. But this is the best age for her. If she gets older, in a sense she will be less ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù in the ‚Äúmarriage market‚Äù. I think for her good, I should never let her waste more time in me, if I not going to marry her.

But without her, I will have nothing. Yes I have a decent job. But again I will be lonely, with very few friends, and find no one to talk to.

Thanks for reading all these. I don‚Äôt know what I should do."
atbbzb,5,2019-02-21,"How do I [23] break up with gf [23], and live with her until the lease ends?",wake-n-rest,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atbbzb/how_do_i_23_break_up_with_gf_23_and_live_with_her/,"So my girlfriend of almost two years and I have felt pretty unhappy about each other in the last several months. The relationship has gotten rotten for lack of a better term. We've spoken about it once not too long ago, and agreed that even though we've recently been living with each other for 8 months, we've been feeling quite lonely. The writing is on the wall, and I'm certain I don't want to continue on with this relationship not just for me, but for her too. I love her, but I hate what how this relationship has changed my mood. I think she knows there's an end to us. The complex part about all of this is that our lease ends in 4 months, and I am in a logistical and emotional mess.

 

A quick backstory:

She and I started dating right before the summer (2017) of our last internships with the companies we are currently working with. After that summer, we would both have one more year in college, and then go into the work force.

For that summer, our relationship was sort of long distance. What created an interesting situation was that by the end of this summer, after only dating for a couple of months, our respective employers asked us if we'd like to work for them. Only gave us a week to answer back and pick a location to work in. Her employer is based near her hometown, so she didn't have a choice where she'd work. I however, had multiple locations to consider in our state (Florida), including near my family and where I grew up. Because I am a sucker for love, I chose to work in her area and live with her.

I don't regret that decision. Even though we were kind of forced to make a future decision like that at an early stage in our relationship, I still think you should always take a chance on love. Until we actually started working, we were doing alright. I won't say amazingly, but we were in love. No doubt about that.

 

Fast forward to now, our lease ends in June, I don't know really have any friends in this area besides her, I kinda hate my job and want to quit (but have to wait after my lease is done so I can keep my bonus), aaaaaand we'll still be living together if we break up now. Now, I don't doubt that we could be civil and even friends through the process, but shit's gonna get emotionally straining, I think. I just have so much to worry about. Living with my ex for 4 months and finding a short term lease for after June so I can either find a job back home, or go back to college for my masters (which is something else I still need to figure out).

I guess I'm just writing this for any sort of advice. You get pretty lonely when you're away from your family and friends, and there's emotional distance between you and the person you live with who is also your only friend.

Has anyone been in a similar situation before? What first steps should I take for a breakup where I'll be living with my ex? How do I pick myself up from this? How the heel can I find a short term lease?

Also, I'm sure I missed some details or fucked up explaining my situation because I'm a terrible writer and organizer of thoughts, so feel free to ask me follow up questions."

atcaoe,8,2019-02-21,CS master's thesis with company?,ru0holahti,stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/atcaoe/cs_masters_thesis_with_company/,"I'm currently a CS coterm (AI track) with 4 quarters left till I graduate. Doing a master's thesis with a company is pretty standard in Europe, but it seems to be relatively unknown in the US, so I'm wondering if anyone at Stanford has any experience with this? I'm interested in applying what I learn from the AI track to tackle a business problem.

Mainly I have two questions.

1. **How do I arrange this with Stanford/the CS department**? I do see that the CS department gives [instructions](https://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/mscs/classes/planning/#dir) on how to get a ""distinction in research"" for master's, so I assume I just follow those instructions to pitch my idea to faculty? The CS department seems to be more industry friendly than my undergrad department, so fingers-crossed I will be able to find a faculty willing to advise me.
2. **How do I arrange this with a company**? In Europe, the process is fairly standardized, but a cursory search on LinkedIn for ""master's thesis intern"" or ""working student"" positions in the Bay Area yields no results. I guess I just reach out to individual people at companies then? I guess smaller companies would be more amenable to me using their data sets and such.

Please excuse my grammar, english is not my native language. Also I know it might sound silly or obvious, but I do feel conflicted.

For some context: Cisco (28M) and I (26F) met at university and have been good friends for about 5 years now. We did our first internship together and when we graduated, we both started working at the same building. He is a pretty amazing person. He has driven me to the airport, hospital, took care of my drunk ass, helped me move. Good friend. I had a crush on him when we first met but he had a gf so I never really pursued it.

January of 2017, just before he broke up with his gf we got really drunk together and hooked up. We were both complete messes at the time and I know it was wrong. We remained good friends and hooked up a couple times more (after he broke up) but nothing more than that.

I met Betty (26F) at our building because she and Cisco were going out for a while. A few months later she and I became friends, hanging out a lot. I never mentioned Cisco and I hooked up, as far as I knew they were no longer going out and I never felt I needed to tell her.

Early this week she invited me to a party and mentioned Cisco might come and that they would still casually meet, but she didn‚Äôt really know how he felt about her. She was into him.

At that point, I felt I needed to ‚Äúwarn‚Äù her. Yes, he‚Äôs sweet and all but to please be aware he would not take it any further (his previous relationship lasted 8 years). He told me multiple times he was not planning to be in a relationship anytime soon and was going out with a few different girls. And that he knew the way he treated said girls led them to think he wanted more so he was clear from the beginning. I told her all that over text. She kept asking me questions and I kept telling her some stuff I knew about him. Later I realized I overshared and told her ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt think ill of him. It was all complicated and we can talk more in person‚Äù.

I wake up today to a huge text from her. She pretty much called me a terrible friend, ‚Äúspilling‚Äù his secrets to others and that she didn‚Äôt know what my intentions were but she thought it was mean that I told her about him and I. That i‚Äôm not trustworthy and that she only kept me talking to see how far would i go on ‚Äúbetraying my friend‚Äù, which felt like plain manipulation. She said we shouldn‚Äôt be friends anymore and told him the same, that she didn‚Äôt want to associate with ‚Äúthat kind of people‚Äù. She went on about us hooking up last year. It was harsh.

I later called him, explained and apologized. He didn‚Äôt care a bit.

To me, it was girl talk with a trusted friend. She didn‚Äôt see it that way. She thinks I was on some kind of agenda.

Am I The Asshole?

TL;DR: I told my friend the guy she fancied didn‚Äôt want a relationship. I went on and overshared stuff about his life bc I‚Äôm friends with him. She thinks I did it make him look bad and cut ties with both of us.

I'm 23, my gf 22.
The relationship was 3 years, and since the beginning we have problems (my best friend try to touch her), she tell me nothing happen, he was drunk and she didn't want, we cut ties with the friend.


But I think this make me insecure, since he was my best friend of 12 years, I feel now betrayal can come from everyone, and time have teach me lies and cheat is easy.

I always have fear of her cheating every time she is with some dude.

The relationship was good, and I ironically thrust her more than everyone, she's in med school and she going to go 2 years to another state to make her service and internship. And I'm totally okay.

I want to go back to her and make the relationship work even in long distance. 

But I can't control my insecurities and I don't now what to to. 
We fight many times and she decide it was enough of me been like this, she told me she didn't want but was necessary and until I chance we will stay like friends.
I will go to see some help/therapy.

But the last thing she say was, that she meet a boy in a party 5 months ago, and they began to be friends, she erased her messages and hidde him until we broke because she doesn't want to go with this. 
Today a friend in common told me she even go out with him while we where together and I'm angry and upset because she hidde this to me.
¬øIts OK to be angry?
¬øHow can I manage my insecurities?
Thanks reddit."

So I decided to start writing one on my own.*

*BUT!*

*I wanna giive you a fair warning before I start getting into the story 'cause I feel like you all deserve it, since I don't want to waste anyone's precious time.*

*1 - This is my first time writing a full¬†story, so it is highly possible that it will be convoluted and lead to nothing.2 - English is not my first language, so it's probably not gonna be an excellent piece of art, especially if¬† you are someone who enjoys literature.3 - The most important point. If you expect this get to the ""kinky stuff"" immediately,¬†don't get into it. I like to take things slow and have that sweet characters development.*

**CHAPTER 01**

""And why on Earth would I need an assitant again?"" John Jefferson, 28,¬†was 3 when he was diagnosed with a very rare disease that affects both muscles and bones, making them fragile; while it wasn't lethal on its own, it made it impossible for him to put any muscular mass by weight lifting, and also forced him to be cautious with his eating habits, since his legs might fail his structure him if he would have become overweight. On top of that, he was also on the shorter side, so being a 5'3 very skinny man, he surely wasn't the bossiest looking dude in the office.¬†Although his problems, he's always tried to get what was best for him and tried to give himself some authority. He grew a nicely shaped beard, he became witty and, contrary to most people in his position, he would always go to work wearing a suit and a tie.¬†

""First and formost, it is a cost efficient solution. Our new employee is a promising intern that will work here for free for the next six months. If she, as I expect, will turn to be good enough, we will hire her with a full-time job, so I need someone qualified to teach her. "" Ever since Mrs.¬†Thompson retired, Janna Prickles, a 51 years old unmarried men hater became his new boss and things only started running slower for his career; it was bright as the day that Janna had a partiicular taste in torturing him. And the hate was mutual. Short and plumpy, she always used to wear overly coloured outfits that made her look like a knock off version of Queen Elizabeth. Fitting for her personality, John taught.¬†

John rolled his eyes and sighed ""In other words, I have to babysit."" but Janna blocked him with an evil grin. ""I took care personally and decided for her amongst tons of other students who signed for this position. She's a quick learner, don't worry. Also, there's a second reason why I needed for you to have an assistant:¬† even though you're better at your job than I like to admit, you're still an annoying little prick who needs to learn how to be organized, so she will take charges of your time schedules from now on."" Truthfully, his office looked like a mess, and his schedules were all over the place, he couldn't argue with it. But there was more. ""Oh I see now. It's about the Grav√©neux fiasco! Look I told you already it was not my fault if Jack went through my stuff and mixed 'em up lik-"" ""I know and that¬†is why he had been¬†fired. But let's be honest for a second here. Just coincidentially it wasn't your fault this time. It was surely not the first time your pig habits got in your way. I know this is more about pride than anything else, but you DO need help. And you can be helpful yourself."" That didn't sound very convincing at all,¬† and she knew it; so, sighing and looking down, she continued her speech. ""Fine, I knew it would have come to this. I've already hired her, as a matter of facts, she's already waiting in your office, as of now. Since I know that you need something to be motivated, here's your goal: in the next six months I want to have someone who is just as good as you doing your job,¬†and you are the only one who can teach her. Make me proud, and you'll get a 6% raise."" Finally she was talking business, he taught. John was a very proud and goal oriented person, and this seemed like a good deal, which he closed by shaking hands with his boss.¬†

He walked to his office and opened the door. His new assistant was standing there, right in front of him. &lt;HOLY SHIT&gt; was all he could think of, but he limited himself to think it, and open his eyes wide.

I would really like to get to know him better, but he lives a few states away. However, he's actually coming to the town I live in pretty soon, so I'm pretty sure we'll get the chance to hang out! I'm thinking after we get to catch up in person we might continue talking more even after he leaves, and form a deeper friendship... then maybe more :)

My question is this-- am I kidding myself? Does it make sense to pursue a guy who lives 500 miles away from me that I don't know that well? Or am I being too idealistic?"
atekei,1,2019-02-22,AITA for not wanting to see my dad or ask him for money?,dluwu,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/atekei/aita_for_not_wanting_to_see_my_dad_or_ask_him_for/,"So to start off, my parents divorced when I was two and I was put in the care of my grandparents from my dad‚Äôs side. Growing up, I‚Äôve come to realized that my father had always lived off of my grandparents well into his 40‚Äôs. 

He met my stepmom back in 2008 and remarried around that time. I lived with them for a while. They were both working and we were financially stable. When I was about 13, I moved in with my mom and stepdad. I was able to see my father every weekend and holiday. Until last summer 2018 I had my first internship at 16 and my father was opposed to it because I wasn‚Äôt seeing him as often. My summer weekdays would be at work and weekends at his house. I emphasized how important it was to me and how it could help me for college. He didn‚Äôt care and refused to drop me back to my mom‚Äôs house when my first day of work was the following Monday. My mom was extremely frustrated with my father so she did not let me see him ever since. But I do face-time him occasionally. 

When my dad and stepmom divorced in 2016 my dad was forced to move out of his house and lived with my grandparents for a while. He hasn‚Äôt gotten back on his feet ever since. My grandparents went back to Asia for retirement and sold the family business and house. My dad then had to move out of that house and is currently renting a small room. I spoke to him and he hasn‚Äôt been eating proper meals because he can‚Äôt cook in that house and my stepmom filled for child support for my half brother. My mom has gotten over what happened last summer so I could see my dad over weekends again if I wanted to but she doesn‚Äôt think I should stay over considering the living situation.  I agree with her.

Overall, my father is not financially stable (he should and could be but I think he his spending his money on other matters...) regardless, If i go back to see him I won‚Äôt have a place to stay. I could stay over at my step mother‚Äôs place but I‚Äôm not comfortable with the living situation.

Adding on to that, I‚Äôm a senior in high school and there are numerous finances that need to be taken care of. My mom has helped me with most of my expenses, my internship check from last  has covered some of what I need but there are still some concerns regarding college and other senior dues. I asked my mom for help, although she is willing to help pay for me, she was mad at me for not asking my dad for help. She told me it was unfair that she has to cover so many of my expenses whereas my father hasn‚Äôt acted like a father towards me since... well quite a while. She says the least he could do  for me is help pay for some of the expenses. However, I just feel so bad for my father because of his financial situation and instability. (Take note that he did put himself that situation for reasons I‚Äôm too ashamed to name)

So, AITA for not wanting stay with my dad over weekends again &amp; feeling bad for asking him to help me cover some finances considering his situation?

(A version of this originally appeared in the Philanthropy Magazine, Winter 1996, under the title,
From Ideas to Action: The Role of Universities, Think Tanks, and Activist Groups.)
Universities, think tanks, and citizen activist groups all present competing claims for being the best
place to invest resources. As grant-makers, we hear the pros and cons of the different kinds of
institutions seeking funding.
The universities claim to be the real source of change. They give birth to the big ideas that provide the
intellectual framework for social transformation. While this is true, critics contend that investing in
universities produces no tangible results for many years or even decades. Also, since many academics
tend to talk mostly to their colleagues in the specialized languages of their respective disciplines, their
research, even if relevant, usually needs to be adapted before it is useful in solving practical problems.
The think tanks and policy development organizations argue that they are most worthy of support
because they work on real-world policy issues, not abstract concepts. They communicate not just
among themselves, but are an immediate source of policy ideas for the White House, Congress, and
the media. They claim to set the action agenda that leaders in government follow. Critics observe,
however, that there is a surfeit of well-funded think tanks, producing more position papers and books
than anyone could ever possibly read. Also, many policy proposals, written by ‚Äúwonks‚Äù with little
experience outside the policy arena, lack realistic implementation or transition plans. And all too
often, think tanks gauge their success in terms of public relations victories measured in inches of press
coverage, rather than more meaningful and concrete accomplishments.
Citizen activist or implementation groups claim to merit support because they are the most effective at
really accomplishing things. They are fighting in the trenches, and this is where the war is either won
or lost. They directly produce results by rallying support for policy change. Without them, the work of
the universities and policy institutes would always remain just so many words on paper, instead of
leading to real changes in people‚Äôs lives.
Others point out, however, that their commitment to action comes at a price. Because activist groups
are remote from the universities and their framework of ideas, they often lose sight of the big picture.
Their necessary association with diverse coalitions and politicians may make them too willing to
compromise to achieve narrow goals.

Many of the arguments advanced for and against investing at the various levels are valid. Each type of
institute at each stage has its strengths and weaknesses. But more importantly, we see that institutions
at all stages are crucial to success. While they may compete with one another for funding and often
belittle each other‚Äôs roles, we view them as complementary institutions, each critical for social
transformation.
Hayek‚Äôs Model of Production
Our understanding of how these institutions ‚Äúfit together‚Äù is derived from a model put forward by the
Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek.
Hayek‚Äôs model illustrates how a market economy is organized, and has proven useful to students of
economics for decades. While Hayek‚Äôs analysis is complicated, even a modified, simplistic version
can yield useful insights.
Hayek described the ‚Äústructure of production‚Äù as the means by which a greater output of ‚Äúconsumer
goods‚Äù is generated through savings that are invested in the development of ‚Äúproducer goods‚Äù‚Äîgoods
not produced for final consumption.
The classic example in economics is how a stranded Robinson Crusoe is at first compelled to fish and
hunt with his hands. He only transcends subsistence when he hoards enough food to sustain himself
while he fashions a fishing net, a spear, or some other producer good that increases his production of
consumer goods. This enhanced production allows even greater savings, hence greater investment and
development of more complex and indirect production technologies.
In a developed economy, the ‚Äústructure of production‚Äù becomes quite complicated, involving the
discovery of knowledge and integration of diverse businesses whose success and sustainability
depend on the value they add to the ultimate consumer. Hayek‚Äôs model explains how investments in
an integrated structure of production yield greater productivity over less developed or less integrated
economies.
By analogy, the model can illustrate how investment in the structure of production of ideas can yield

3 of 6 10/10/14 11:16 AM
greater social and economic progress when the structure is well-developed and well-integrated. For
simplicity‚Äôs sake, I am using a snapshot of a developed economy, as Hayek did in parts of Prices and
Production, and I am aggregating a complex set of businesses into three broad categories or stages of
production. The higher stages represent investments and businesses involved in the enhanced
production of some basic inputs we will call ‚Äúraw materials.‚Äù The middle stages of production are
involved in converting these raw materials into various types of products that add more value than
these raw materials have if sold directly to consumers. In this model, the later stages of production are
involved in the packaging, transformation, and distribution of the output of the middle stages to the
ultimate consumers.
Hayek‚Äôs theory of the structure of production can also help us understand how ideas are transformed
into action in our society. Instead of the transformation of natural resources to intermediate goods to
products that add value to consumers, the model, which I call the Structure of Social Change, deals
with the discovery, adaptation, and implementation of ideas into change that increases the well-being
of citizens. Although the model helps to explain many forms of social change, I will focus here on the
type I know best‚Äîchange that results from the formation of public policy.
Applying Hayek‚Äôs Model
When we apply this model to the realm of ideas and social change, at the higher stages we have the
investment in the intellectual raw materials, that is, the exploration and production of abstract
concepts and theories. In the public policy arena, these still come primarily (though not exclusively)
from the research done by scholars at our universities. At the higher stages in the Structure of Social
Change model, ideas are often unintelligible to the layperson and seemingly unrelated to real-world
problems. To have consequences, ideas need to be transformed into a more practical or useable form.
In the middle stages, ideas are applied to a relevant context and molded into needed solutions for
real-world problems. This is the work of the think tanks and policy institutions. Without these
organizations, theory or abstract thought would have less value and less impact on our society.
But while the think tanks excel at developing new policy and articulating its benefits, they are less
able to implement change. Citizen activist or implementation groups are needed in the final stage to
take the policy ideas from the think tanks and translate them into proposals that citizens can
understand and act upon. These groups are also able to build diverse coalitions of individual citizens
and special interest groups needed to press for the implementation of policy change.

We at the Koch Foundation find that the Structure of Social Change model helps us to understand the
distinct roles of universities, think tanks, and activist groups in the transformation of ideas into action.
We invite you to consider whether Hayek‚Äôs model, on which ours is based, is useful in your
philanthropy. Though I have confined my examples to the realm of public policy, the model clearly
has much broader social relevance.

atfig5,0,2019-02-22,[M4F] The Kindly Mentor (Cuckolding in Indian cultural context),lookingforagoddess,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/atfig5/m4f_the_kindly_mentor_cuckolding_in_indian/,"Setting:

&amp;nbsp;

There was once a young man, very fierce, strong, bold and confident. Several inches over six feet, naturally strongly built, with a very significant endowment. From relatively humble beginnings, he rose high in the world, gaining power and gathering wealth.

He had many exploits, especially sexual ones. Fighting over women, seducing them. He reveled in his quest to make reluctant, or head strong women, to submit to him as his, total sluts. Gaining their trust, their affection and finally adulation, through his intensity and virility. 

Taking them away right from the arms of their loving husbands. Fucking many, many women, both single, and otherwise. Fathering several bastards. A true Alpha Male.

This lifestyle could not be sustained after he hit his mid-life. His trophy wife tolerated his dalliances and affairs, and remained distant, but his growing power and obligations meant he could not fuck anyone he wanted, or destroy marriages as he liked. The more he came into public and social limelight, the more it affected him.

So he started to establish long term relationships over the city. From college sluts, to 50 year professors, he quietly gathered a harem of women to meet his needs.

&amp;nbsp;

But one such college ""slut"", one who worked in one of his firms as an intern, had a fiery spirit and soul that matched his own. After a long while, he felt truly challenged in his quest to dominate women. And though each time he came out on the top, he loved his struggle with her. Soon, she became his confidant, and even a friend. Her bold spirit were outmatched only by her beauty and intelligence.

However, after she graduated, they started experiencing a distance creeping between them. They did loved each other, but their relationship was hardly conventional. He could never divorce his wife, or fully commit himself to a single woman, especially one who is several decades younger.

She confessed to him that she felt a hollowness that their relationship could not fill. Indeed, his drive to dominate her has left her feeling weak, tired and sometimes used and unloved. He tried to remedy that, but found he simply didn't had the time or energy, or even felt the motivation, to administer the care he should be, after fucking her and dominating her. Even her spirit had started breaking.

Moreover, her indian, hindu family had started pressuring her to get married, one her community, of their choosing. Defying them meant loosing many things, her family, social standing and support, her inheritance, and even the option of actually opting for arranged marriage as a fall back option.

Alpha did not wanted to lose his favorite slut. But somehow fate itself bends itself to cater to the strong.

&amp;nbsp;

In one of his surprise audits of his many start ups, he came across a young indian male, though he subconsciously deferred from calling him a ""man"". Too light skinned, slim, with slightly effeminate featured, he was a surprise find for the CTO of the firm, being surprisingly talented. However, his talent was largely masked by his nervous demeanor, and anxiety. He was too shy, and introverted. A Wimp, to be exact. 

The Alpha decided to take the Wimp under his ""mentor-ship"". Despite the Wimp's hesitation, he could not rebuff the Alpha's advances, and shared his number. And from their, through long chains of texts, the Wimp opened up to the Alpha. Not something that the Alpha had not done before, gaining the trust of someone, and gradually he got into the Wimp's head.

He would often share the details of his own exploits with many women, how they fawned over him, how easy it was for him. He would casually mention about how his own physique and allude to his significant endowment. He sowed and deepened each insecurity in the Wimp's mind. 

He casually kept dropping the term ""Cuck"" and ""Cuckold"" in his conversations. How brave they are. How such marriages are much more stable, as women are able to get most of both worlds.

If his plan works, then he would be able to get a Cuckold for his favorite slut. So that he can date her openly, fuck her and finally breed her with absolute impunity, while the Wimp provided for her in ways he could not find himself to.

&amp;nbsp;

Idea:

&amp;nbsp;

So the idea is that this ""Mentor"" sets up two people as a couple under him. He gains the trust of a much younger male, becomes a father figure to him, and cuckolds him fiercely, slowly breaking him with his lover. He soon becomes a chief of their household, fathering many children with his lover, and a grandpa to them.

And the woman is able to enjoy the best of both worlds, sating the exhilarating addiction of the Alpha, while having someone to love her and tend to her weary heart and soul after he takes off.

&amp;nbsp;

Storybuilding:

&amp;nbsp;

So! My apologies for the long description of the setting.

Essentially, I am looking for an indian, female partner, i am an indian guy myself. I am looking to play the role of ""the Wimp"", and building the story from our perspective as this powerful ""Mentor"" shapes our lives.

I have many kinks, but my hard limits are :blood, underage, any bodily waste/unsanitary stuff, incest and any kind of anal stuff.

I am also looking for storybuilding, rather than strictly roleplay. The difference, in my eyes, is that we will build our collective biography, together, spanning over many years, focusing on meaty parts closer to roleplay style, and a narrative style over the rest of it.

I am also open to playing other plots, or making changed to this one. This largely covers what kind of stuff i am into. 

I look forward to hearing from you."
atfijx,1,2019-02-22,I'm so tired of myself,sureguide,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/atfijx/im_so_tired_of_myself/,"I'm so tired. I'm a 24 year old guy, and I've been dealing with depression and no self-esteem/self-worth for 8-10 years. I've always felt out of place, but it started to escalate when I started in high school.  

I fee like life is shitting on me all the time. My grandma died 2 days before my birthday in the summer. I wasn't that close to my grandma, due to uncomfortable experiences when I was younger (which my mom called bullshit). I just felt really sorry for my mom, because I know she deals with a lot.

Then after spending a weekend with my gf of 2 years and her family in september, she broke-up with me, as she said she needed to find herself and that she was probably depressed.

The last thing she told me, was that if this hadn't happened, then it could've been amazing and as she walked out my door, she told me she loved me.

I went no contact straight away. After a month I broke no contact, as I was a huge mess. Crying everyday for hours, going home early from school, going home early from work. 

We met up and talked, and she seemed so over it. I asked how she was doing and she responded ""I hate seeing you like this"". I asked if we could work this out together - I'd do anything for her. We could not. 

Could we be together in the future? She had no idea - wouldn't be fair to have me waiting she said. 

We hugged goodbye, and now it's been 4 months of no contact. 

I get that I have to keep doing nc, and I've been doing so, and I've done no stalking or anything, yet I keep longing for her, and I just miss her so much, I just hope she gets better. 

I also get that it's probably the best for me, to not be in contact with her, but how can she just not give a fuck for 4 months? Why is it so easy for her? Why do I have to be sad over someone who doesn't want me? Should be rather simple that I should just not care, if it is that easy for her.

I've been seeing a psychologist for 3¬Ω months every 2 weeks (paying out of my own pocket which is tough). Luckily he seems like a good match for me. I trust him, feel comfortable and enjoy our sessions.

I've been doing the mindfulness/meditation exercises he suggested I did, almost every single day. I've done the other small tasks that I should do, and yet I still feel stuck.

He said he could see and hear progress in me, which in the moment actually made me quite happy.

I've been going to the gym 5-6 days a week, for the past 2 months. I've gained muscle and weight, and gone up in kilos in every exercise.

I landed a killer internship, which I'm really proud of.

I spoke to my mom yesterday, and she told me due to her health she'd have to put down our dog of 10 years, because she has gotten her 4th herniated disc. 

She lives alone now, and both me and our brother moved out, and I live 2 hours away, because of my education. 

I think it's so unfair to put him down, and I got so overwhelmed yesterday. 

I don't even know what to type anymore. 

I'm tired of me feeling so ungrateful and full of self-pity. I have an amazing support system. Friends that loves me, family that loves, hell even colleagues that loves me, whom have gone out the way to make sure I was alright, feeling well at my job, and even covering for me, the very few times I had to skip on work because I couldn't stop crying.

I know there are so many people in this world, that would probably switch places with me in an instant. And I know I don't actually have a lot of problems compared to other people, and that makes me think even less of myself. Why do I have to whine so much?

I fantasize about suicide almost every single day. I could never do it to my mom, dad or brother - I love them so much.. But the idea of not having to deal with anything it's just so calming and tempting.

Thanks for reading."
atgayf,23,2019-02-22,"What if Reggie Fils-Aime, President of Nintendo of America, was forced to ""retire"" because of the 2015 Nintendo World Championships?",RabbitSong,SamandTolki,https://www.reddit.com/r/SamandTolki/comments/atgayf/what_if_reggie_filsaime_president_of_nintendo_of/,"I've thought about what would have happened if Cosmo had won NWC in 2015. I know a lot of people think that if Cosmo hadn't suffered that humiliating loss to John Numbers, Narcissa would have never happened. But what if it did anyway? I've realized that Nintendo dodged a major bullet there.

There have only been like 3 or 4 winners in the history of that thing, so if you happen to be the winner of one of those, your name becomes attached forever to the history of Nintendo. People, kids, parents- they google them, they check who they were and what has become of them, I know I have. Media sometimes loves to do pieces about where they are now, and interviews. That could have been Narcissa. Our Narcissa... but Nintendo's Narcissa instead.

Nintendo of America is practically 95% a marketing firm for Nintendo of Japan (the real Nintendo), and that's what NWC is: a marketing event. They don't give a shit who the best Nintendo gamer is, they just want to get people hype about their games. Reggie was in charge of that, and as Trihex explained once, he let some Nintendo Treehouse intern suggest they bring in speedrunners to the competition without realizing how degenerate some of them can be. Even Bananas thinks she's some kind of anime girl.

It's already bad enough that Cosmo got to second place and the legend of how John Numbers humiliated him and turned him into a crazy woman has been growing and growing through the years, popping in more and more videos on YouTube. I'm pretty sure that already more info pops up online about John Numbers, Cosmo, and Narcissa than any of the other NWC winners as it is. You can tell that in the following event they held in 2017 they corrected that error and decided to have more casual competitors, like children and their parents, and SJWs. You could even tell they were almost trying to shake things up so that John Numbers would get knocked out and not pull a repeat. Like I said, who gives a shit who wins, it's all about marketing, but Reggie fucked up in 2015.

Have you seen Narcissa's video where she explains how far she can put her glass dildo up her own asshole? I think the Japanese have seen that video. They saw it and they thought: *""THAT could have been OUR beloved Nintendo World Championships trophy up that man's rectum!""* Indeed a video of Narcissa explaining how far that golden Mario can disappear up her bumhole would not have been a good look for Nintendo. I mean come on, you know Narcissa would have had that shit on stream with her all the time as she shaved her pubes, farted in bed, did her crying, her drugs, and her weird dances. Remember the time she had that medal on her neck all the time?

It would have been a major PR disaster for a child friendly company such as Nintendo. The Japanese understood that pizza boy Reggie Fils-Aime, as good as he may have been in the past, had put their brand and Mr. Miyamoto in jeopardy by failing to vet the contestants of NWC 2015. And thus, as an honorable Japanese company would, allowed him to save his honor by falling on his own sword."

Attention: Wall of text.,Yep_Here_We_Go,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/athf0p/its_stuck_on_my_chest_and_i_need_to_feel_lighter/,"It is a wall of text, you are advised, sorry but i have to write this cause it's stuck in my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

This start of the week, Monday, I was having my regular shift for my internship on a company in my city, the offices i was assigned are like the southest side of the city, it's a big city, and so as usual I spent 6 hours there.

There is a park nearby where a lot of kids play and I used to go there back then. So i sat on a bench for an hour and relaxed. Then it was going to be dark so I decided I would head back home. While walking the pathway I noticed a slender and tall girl that was smoking, I'm a man, I can't not take a look, it is instinctive. Her hair were long and curly, a blonde that was really familiar, but i passed by. Then I heard her voice, she was talking with her little brother that was playing there, i believe they were heading home as well. So I stood and waited to see her face, she sounded so familiar, as if I knew that voice for a long time. But then I just gave up and was about to go back home when I heard the little boy shouting my name. So i turned back and I saw her. Again. She was my ex girlfriend, I can't tell you her name, but i will type her name as \*Kiaa\* since I always called her like that. Kia didn't really change that much, always tall, almost as tall as me, and I am 175cm, long beautiful curly blond hairs, here grey-green eyes, that wonderful mouth and her angelic nose. She was with her younger brother, I used to babysit him a lot when we were at their place, He was just a baby. But i was quiet, I was just looking at them, so she was, I'm not sure but both were surprised or shocked, I can't really describe. But it was his younger brother that approached me, it is incredible how kids memory can last. He grabbed me by my arm and asked me if I remember him, I answered him that I do, indeed, and that I couldn't recognize him as first, he was much taller, he is now 8 and indeed changed. But Kiaa, she was still the same, as radiant as ever, though her voice was a little bit hoarse. I kept talking with kiaa's brother for about half an hour, actually he was the only one talking.  She was quietly staring at me, I wasnt sure what she was thinking but her expression..she had no expressions, I don't know the correct english word. Then I told him that I had to go and before I could make a step, Kiaa said \*Stop. Don't go\*. It took all my courage to stay there, I knew I was going to do something I would regret, I could hear my brains exploding and my heart was pumping fast, I believed my blood would fill my head for a moment. So I stopped.She brought her brother to their home, they live nearby, they transferred, last time they were on the other side of the city. I was waiting there on a bench, telling myself that I'm just a stupid boy, countless times.She came back and sat next to me. We didn't talk for the first 10 minutes I think. I was looking at the field, the trees on that park, touching my neck, adjusting my necktie. She was just looking down, holding her hands.

So i just broke the ice by saying that his brother grew a lot. Then I started saying things I don't even remember, and I talked, and talked. And talked. It was a monologue, my soliloquy. I realized it only after long that she was still there looking down and holding her hands. So I just stopped, took a heavy breath. And let my body slip on that bench and I was looking at the starless night.

Then she kissed me on the cheek. She whispered to my ear that she missed me. And on that exact moment i remembered the first time she said that to me, It was I believe the second year of high school and we were at the same class, I was chosen with a few more of my school to do a cultural exchange with a school in germany. We were away for 3 weeks. And the first morning when I came back to school, she was waiting to our group hangout at the entrance of the school, I was always the first to arrive and wait for everyone, cause I lived nearby, but that time Kiaa was the first. She smiled to me, gently cherised me and whispered to me she missed me.

At the moment my mind was blank. So we kissed.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back home that it was 9 pm, I usually come back at around 5 pm, enough time to do house chores and prepare dinner. I was really late. I even forgot to buy some takeaway food. But it was not needed, my girlfriend prepared everything. She was wondering why I was so late, so I had to find an excuse and I told her the one of the company engineers teached me some cool stuff. I couldn't eat the soup Gil, I'll call my partner as Gil, prepared, I just could not. But I forced myself to eat it and smile, as if nothing happened that day.

I met Kiaa in elementary school, we weren't really friends, we didn't really talk much, until mid school, we were on a school trip in strasburg, and like teens used to do, we and other classmates did the bottle game, where there would be couples that would exchange rooms, a boy with a girl, it was really hard for use to not have the teachers discover it, but thankfully one of our classmates sacrificed himself to entertain the teachers whenever it was needed. So the bottle choosed me and Kiaa. We had to sleep on the same bed for the 3 nights we were staying in Strasburg, but just for those nights. We didn't really do anything beside chatting until late night, giving some sweet cares, cuddling, hugging and listent to the other's breath under the blanket. And we could hear each heartbeat.It had to be just those 3 nights. But we ended up growing some feelings as the days passes. We went to the same high school after graduation, the first year we were on separate classes, and on second year onwards we were together.

We were together almost always, when it was possible, my parents are strict and hers were just absent. We traveled a lot together walking miles or waiting hours sitting side by side on a train. We shared our first time. She teach me how to iron clothes and I teach her how to cook.

We would make love when we were together alone, and kiss, and chat, and hug, like those 3 nights.

But things went bad on the last year of high school.

I was focusing on having the highest grade at school. At my high school there were rankings, where the top students would get scolar ships, of about 1500 students, only 10 were chosen, the selection was really strict, average of 9.5 out of 10, outstanding behaviours, accomplishments outside school, and I was into it. I was both forced and wanted to be on the top, I was doing it for me, the other competitors were as fired as me, merciless, some would even boycott you, I could not allow it. I had to.

Kiaa though was just a careless girl, that simple girl with no what-so-high inspirations and dreams, but just wanted to live her present.

I also started working around 3rd year, there are  5years, of high school, this then lead to us having less time to share.

I knew Kiaa had friends, I was okay with it, it is good to have friends, she would hang out with them when she was not with me, and it was fine with me.

&amp;#x200B;

But around mid term, things went worse. I was closer to be at the 1% of the school, actually I already was, but I wanted more, I wanted to be the one. And when I was with her, I noticed she was further than always, didn't really talk with me that much, she would just look at me, smile at me and sometimes cares me on the cheek, than a kiss and she would fly away. \*Give your best\*. She used to repeat that a lot.

One day I saw her on the school playground talking with some dudes under a tree, I did not know them, but it seemed like they were having fun so i let it be, but then I saw someone was clinging to her, and tried to kiss her, but she was rejecting me, but he grabbed her arm and she had that scared expression on her face, so I rushed there and punched that guy, he didnt even bulge or stand, lifting boxes full of fruits and vegetables for years actually my my hands harder is seems, he didnt stand up, but there were other 3 of his friends there and they beat the crap out of me, but hopefully my classmates where there smoking nearby and noticed the fight that was going on, and it quickly became a huge fight, mostly thanks to my classmates, those were that type of teens, the \*all muscles no brains\* all tall and huge, at least they did a great job I heard.I was brought to the principal after a few hours, I was forgiven, I didnt even know how, I was basically there sitting in front of him with a purple eye and a lip that exploded, he just said that I was one of their best students, that I mean a lot to the school that he was a teen once and he knew how i feel and why i did it, so that episode would not affect my scores, but i would have to help clean the courtyard for a month, so i did.

The night after that episode I was heading back home, I remember I was hurt everywhere, and Kiaa run to me, she hugged me crying, said things I don't even remember, then she was looking to my face, I wasnt looking to her, but then our eyes met, I only remember we went to my big brother apartment, and no one lived there, but I stole the keys from my parents and I used his place as place to play alone the ps4, and we made love, it was maybe the best sex I ever had. And it was the last.

&amp;#x200B;

After that episode, we had only few moments together, just to have the usual \*hi, how are you\*, we did not even kiss anymore, and it all happened so fast that I could not even feel it.

During graduation, I was awarded second student, I did the ceremony speech, and other stuff. During the party I was looking for her, she was wonderful, she wore a dress I bought her, a long pink bordeaux dress that match with her hair and eyes. And she was smiling, she was beautiful. It was like the time stopped while I was looking at her. Then i was walking to her but she was approached first by another guy, I did not know him, some good looking guy. And they kissed.

I was really mad that day, I remember I was punching something hard and some of my classmates found me and convinced me to drink with them, so we drank and I was drunk.

The next day I was standing on the waiting line to partake the entrance exam of my university.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I was still confused, I woke up at like 6 am with Gil sleeping on my arm, and I was nervous as fuck, when my father is nervous in the morning, he always take a shot of tequila and a nespresso, I did the same. That morning my stomach was burning. I had breakfast with Gil. Then I headed to my intership, I took a different route that time, I didn't want to bump into a certain someone. Hopefully that day I went straight to home. During that night I kissed with Kiaa, we didn't really talk of anything, we were just listening to each other's breath and heartbeat, her head was laying on my shoulder and that's all we did, but we didn't talk of an \*after\*, I left here there since it was becoming too late.

When I came back home, Gil asked me to accompany her to her university since she had to sign some papers, she just came back from erasmus in paris, she studies law, so i accompanied her. After that we went to take a drink at our usual bar, she was toying with my necktie, she took a mojito and i took a glass of whisky, she noticed it, I only order manhattan, which is whicky too but mixed with other stuff, and she knows i only take whisky when drinking with friend or i was anxious, but there were only us there, so she thought I was anxious, in fact I was, but I could not tell her, so she just laugh at it.

&amp;#x200B;

I met Gil when I was still living by my parents in the centre of the city, Gil's university is in the centre too, I was wandering around that university because there was an event about astronomy, space stuff always fascinated me, and I noticed this sexy lady with pretty brown eyes and fancy glassesthat was sitting on the stage with some others, apparently she was assiting that event that day, she once told me.

All i did that day was watching her adjust her glasses, her hair, watching the agenda she was holding, or script, or whatever that was, and sometimes she would look at the crowd, and have her eyes open wide, then i always tried to not cross eyes with her. But I wanted to do something stupid that day, i don't know why, so during the Q&amp;A session, I asked some stupid things that were hopefully took as a good joke and everyone laughed, also Gil. At the end of the vent Gil approached me and complimented my lack of knowledge of physics. We ended up getting a tea together and talk. I discovered she partecipated to the mathematic olimpiads of our country the same year i did, altough none of us passed, as i was about 33rd of my region and she was around 60th, we had a lot to talk about.

We started hanging out together then. After some time we dated and now we are together. She is so smart, and strongwilled, actually I never met anyone with her will, when she decides she would do something, she will never stop until she made it. She is wonderful and always smiling, she also gets upset easily, but she can control herself somehow. Even my parents like her which is rare to be honest. And her parents are cool. We even made a trip in asia, we went to China, Japan and Korea in a 2 months trip.

She now continues her study of law, I'm done, I got my bachelor but I'm not sure if I should go to switzerland to continue my studies and get a mastership, or just keep working, but she always tell me that there is no matter that would separate us. I once visited her in paris during her last days of erasmus, I was worried of her security, there were like some troubles in the city that time, those yellow jackets and stuff and she had an apartment like 20 mins of walk from the tour eiffel, so i checked if everything was alright and it was, she even became my tourist guide for a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I told Gil about Kiaa, I mean I already told her about her, that she was my ex, we were together for like what 8 years? And everything that happened back then, I didn't hide this to her, but I didn't tell her that the last night we kissed, I only told her that i encountered Kia and her brother on my way back home. And she was happy that I found an old acquitance, it looked like she was actually excited, i'm not sure. Maybe Gil wants to strangle Kiaa? Idk.

I mean Gil is a really chilla nd outgoing person, she even suggests me weird things like have thressome with her bestfriend and stuff like that but im like \*i dont do those things\*, but I love her anyway, this is actually what I love of her, her being herself. But things went shit when she wanted to accompany me to my internship, and I don't know why it had to be that moment, like why it had to be exactly then, that we crossed patch with Kiaa.

Gil didn't know Kiaa's face or appaerence, she only knows her by my descriptions, and she was surprised that Kia was actually one hand taller than her, and being a really good looking girl. And it was awkward, they greet each other, and talk about i know not what as I was too busy thinking what would I do if they ever question me. But hopefully Kiaa went away quickly as she had to go to the supermarket and I would have been late if I stood there.

Nothing else happened, just usual stuff. But I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how this will evolve, I'm afraid Gil would be mad if she discover I kissed Kiaa and leave me I don't know. I'm fucked.

It's been getting worse every year starting with my fingers and knees during elementary school. In high school, I started to have pain in my elbows. Then in university, my lower back started to have pain. Now 2 years after university, every joint is still affected. 
I've been seeing doctors and therapy since I was small and have been taking many prescription drugs. I still have offdays where I feel horrible.

I'm not too excited about the future. My parents are nearing 60 and I have always relied on them for help with physical tasks I can't do myself. I can't even drive since my knees and elbows always became swollen after every time I tried practicing learning to drive. I don't even have a job yet after 2 years of applying with a degree in computer science. I can only apply to positions near me since I can't drive and I can't apply out of state since I rely too heavily on my parents. Entry level positions seem saturated in LA that I feel like my degree was a waste. I've been getting phone and in person interviews over the past 2 years, but I still couldn't land an offer. I wasn't even able to land an internship during university.

Time is moving by so fast and I feel so useless. My dogs are getting old (14 and 8). My parents are getting old and I want to help them as much as they helped me. I'm getting old and my condition feels like it's getting worse each year. I'm just a huge burden right now that I wish I can change faster. I can't imagine myself in the future without my parents. "

Rough, dark, corruption, and so much more.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/atifot/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood morning DPP. As the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

That‚Äôs mostly because she was promoted due to the previous lead leaving the company for freelance purposes.

The company is sizable (100+ employees), but the department she is in, which is quite an essential one, is just her and 2 freshly hired interns. The nature of the work there makes it so the interns cannot do a majority of the work that is coming in due to sensitive information.

Needless to say, she was hit with 3 projects this week, all being communicated to her that they were of ‚Äúutmost priority.‚Äù

She‚Äôs an incredibly hard working person, but has been pulling 12 hour days, and was on ‚Äústand-by‚Äù throughout the day yesterday for one project. She was told she‚Äôd have to stay up til midnight to receive edits to one project. Those edits didn‚Äôt come in until 2:30am.

I trust that she will get through this and that this hard work will reflect positively in her career, but it is putting a huge strain on her own personal physical and mental health. So, I want to find ways that I can best support her during this time and I‚Äôm not sure where to begin."

I decided to start seeing a therapist last July for some anxiety issues. I called a local psychiatric center and went through their intake process. At the time, I told them that I had Cigna. The intake person told me that they only had a few therapists who accepted Cigna, so it would be about a month before I could see anyone, and they set an appointment for me.

I saw this therapist four times, one appointment a week, and paid my copay each time. Shortly after my fourth appointment, I started receiving Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms from Cigna. They showed that all of these appointments were being billed under a different provider, one who was out of network, and that I would be responsible for an additional $100+ for each of the appointments. I called Cigna right away to try to figure out what was going on. They confirmed that the provider that I had ACTUALLY seen was in network, so this must have just been a mistake, and that I couldn't be held liable for any additional money, since the clinic had billed incorrectly. The Cigna rep actually called and left a message for the billing department at the clinic explaining all of this, and I called the clinic and cancelled all upcoming appointments, just in case.

Well, shortly thereafter, I received a bill from the clinic for $400.50. I went to the clinic and spoke to the person who had done my intake, who was very confused about why I was being billed as well. He said he would take care of it, and would call and let me know if there were any problems. I never heard anything, so I assumed we were good.

30 days later, another bill. This time, I sent a certified letter to their billing department outlining everything and asking to be contacted if the situation could not be remedied. No contact.

Again, another bill. I called the billing department and spoke to someone who confirmed it was a mistake and said he would take care of it right now. Phew, all good, right? 

Well, no. Another bill comes. I try calling the billing department and receive no answer. I leave several messages over the span of a week and get no call back. Then someone from the clinic (not the billing department- they're separate) calls me and tells me I have a past due balance. So I tell her the whole thing. She says she will look into it. That was Tuesday.

Wednesday, I had an appointment (different doctor, same place, no billing problems), so I speak to this person. She comes out with a file documenting every time I had called, a copy of my letter, a bunch of emails about me... so they have been discussing this for months, but no one ever decided to call me back. So she explains the full situation to me. The therapist I was seeing was an intern (which I was never made aware of), and the person that the claims were being billed under was his supervisor, who was not in network. Cigna apparently doesn't cover treatment by interns. And FUN FACT, they have two providers with the same name in the office, so when the Cigna rep said my provider was in network, it was the other one.

So I ask, ""Well, I called and said I had Cigna, and I was told this person accepts Cigna. To be blunt, this looks like your mistake. I'm not seeing how I'm responsible for any more money.""

She tells me that yes, it was their mistake, but I signed something that said that I would pay anything not paid by insurance, and the service was rendered, so I have to pay it. Best they can do is set up a payment plan.

So the question is, do I have any recourse here? I don't exactly have a spare $400 laying around to throw at someone else's error. Again, any guidance would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I've been stuck on this issue for about a week now and I feel like it's been long overdue to ask for help.

Here's my current dilemma, I'm in the process of creating a web application for my internship and I have almost everything basically finished except for one portion. I am launching a window with a specific URL in an Iframe in my page. The reason as to why I'm using an Iframe is because the window that is opened in the Iframe receives HTTP traffic from a server. My web app (a client) will need to grab a JSON file that's in the body of a POST request. I've done numerous amounts of research and I've come to the conclusion of Javascript alone cannot access the POST request. I'm basically in need of help to brainstorm ideas, or possible solutions or workarounds to approach this problem.

I should also mention that the POST request that has the JSON information that I need is sent out after someone interacts with an external device. I cannot always know when the POST request is arriving and I'm not sure if that's even relevant information about my problem because I have no idea as to how to solve this.

I've already tried to possibly running a node.js server in hope that the HTTP requests will be somehow be available to interact with. I've also tried using WebSockets (socket.io, built in WebSocket function), and as little information as I have about them, returned no solution.

Is this even possible? I'll be glad to reply to anyone with further questions about my situation but if anyone has ideas or solutions, please and kindly reply. Thank you."

Hope you‚Äôre having a lovely friday evening :) Just wanted to share a success story today.

for almost a year i have wanted to get a consulting internship with one of the top firms. Last August, they did offer me a position but I was unable to take that up. 

This January, they called me for an interview.
When I got to the interview, i was baffled. There were over 180 candidates competing for 10 slots! And it was the strangest interview, we played games and solved cases on the beach. I honestly did not have much hope, considering there were so many other qualified candidates. 

The representatives from the firm mentioned that they would be letting everyone know within a week. Two weeks flew past and a friend of mine received a rejection. But I was still hopeful. 

Just a few days ago I was thinking ‚Äúoh how nice would it be if i received the (dream internship offer)‚Äù. Today, I just thought to myself ‚Äúah, f*ck it, i‚Äôll apply to more places this summer.‚Äù And then i sent out 3 or 4 CVs hahaha! 

The funniest thing is, within an hour, I received a call! It was an unknown number so I googled it, it was a random recruiting agency so I didn‚Äôt answer. The person kept calling, I finally picked up and guess what? I GOT IT! My dream internship! 

Funny how the universe works!! sending yall love &amp; abundance! xxxx"

Hierbij bied ik de antwoorden aan op de schriftelijke vragen gesteld door het lid Van den Hul over Duitse wetgeving ten aanzien van bindende ketenverantwoordelijkheid. Deze vragen werden ingezonden op 13 februari 2019 met kenmerk 2019Z02800.

Antwoorden van de minister voor Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking op vragen van het lid Van den Hul &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; over Duitse wetgeving ten aanzien van bindende ketenverantwoordelijkheid  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht op Business Human Right.org waaruit blijkt dat de Duitse overheid wetgeving in een vergaand stadium aan het ontwikkelen is, gericht op bindende ketenverantwoordelijkheid? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Sinds wanneer bent u ervan op de hoogte dat de Duitse overheid wetgeving aan het ontwikkelen is op het gebied van bindende ketenverantwoordelijkheid?  Heeft u hierover contact met uw Duitse collega? Zo ja, met welk doel? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het wetsvoorstel betreft voor zover ik weet een intern document van het Duitse ministerie van Ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Het stuk was mij niet bekend.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Nederland houdt de ontwikkelingen in andere landen op het gebied van vrijwillige en bindende maatregelen om ketenverantwoordelijkheid af te dwingen nauwlettend in de gaten. Ik verwijs daarbij graag naar het onderzoeksrapport Strategie√´n voor IMVO, die uw Kamer eveneens toegaat en Kamerstuk 26 485, nr. 257.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 20 en 21 februari 2019 organiseerde de Duitse overheid &amp;#40;het ministerie van Ontwikkelingssamenwerking&amp;#41; een conferentie over duurzame waardeketens, inclusief de rol van bindende maatregelen daarin. Uitgangspunt van de conferentie was het exploreren van elementen die deel uit kunnen maken van een ‚Äòdoordachte mix‚Äô van maatregelen. Een delegatie van het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken nam aan deze conferentie deel om zich te laten informeren en ervaringen uit te wisselen over verschillende beleidsinstrumenten gericht op ketenverantwoordelijkheid. Bij die gelegenheid en ook desgevraagd in bilaterale gesprekken is geen nadere informatie gedeeld over het genoemde interne document.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Erkent u het belang van bindende ketenverantwoordelijkheid op een Europees niveau, ook ten behoeve van een gelijk speelveld voor bedrijven?    
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het kabinet pleit voor een Europese aanpak voor Internationaal Maatschappelijk Verantwoord Ondernemen &amp;#40;IMVO&amp;#41;. Het is van mening dat een geharmoniseerde Europese aanpak van IMVO een gelijk speelveld bevordert en meer impact cre√´ert dan individueel beleid van de EU-lidstaten, dat tot versnippering leidt. In mijn beleidsnota Investeren in Perspectief en in de Staat van de Europese Unie die de minister van Buitenlandse Zaken recent naar uw Kamer stuurde, komt dit ook terug als strategische inzet voor de komende jaren. Het kabinet zal aan de hand van diverse evaluaties en studies verder verkennen wat voor maatregelen, al dan niet bindend, op nationaal of op Europees niveau, wenselijk zijn.    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Deelt u de mening dat Nederland achterop raakt als na Frankrijk ook Duitsland vergelijkbare wetgeving in voorbereiding heeft? Welke consequenties heeft dit voor Nederland om invloed uit te oefenen op dergelijke wetgeving in relatie tot de wens om dit uiteindelijk op Europees niveau te organiseren?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wetgeving als zodanig maakt een land niet tot een voorloper: doeltreffendheid van beleid gericht op ketenverantwoordelijkheid, al dan niet bindend, is belangrijker. Nederland verdiept zich in de voor- en nadelen van diverse instrumenten die onderdeel uit kunnen maken van de ‚Äòdoordachte mix‚Äô van maatregelen die de UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights voorschrijven. Dit betreft zowel nationale en internationale, als bindende en niet-bindende maatregelen. Internationaal wordt Nederland gezien als voorloper op het gebied van IMVO. Nederland wordt veelvuldig internationaal bevraagd op zijn bevindingen op het beleidsterrein van ketenverduurzaming. Ik deel de mening dat Nederland achterop raakt dan ook niet.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Hoe verhoudt de stap van Duitsland om ketenverantwoordelijkheid wettelijk vast te leggen zich tot uw aanname dat alle Nederlandse bedrijven de OESO-richtlijnen naleven? Heeft u feiten die staven dat Nederlandse bedrijven het inderdaad beter doen dan Duitse bedrijven, en dat om die reden hier dergelijke wetgeving niet nodig zou zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nederland verwacht van internationaal opererende bedrijven dat zij de OESO-richtlijnen naleven en heeft tot doel gesteld dat 90 procent van de grote bedrijven in 2023 de OESO-richtlijnen onderschrijven &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 26 485, nr. 271&amp;#41;. In het jaarverslag Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking 2018 zal gerapporteerd worden over een nulmeting van het aantal grote bedrijven in Nederland dat de richtlijnen momenteel onderschrijft. In 2019 en 2021 zullen er tussenmetingen plaatsvinden om te bepalen welke voortgang op deze doelstelling is gerealiseerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Duitsland heeft in zijn Nationaal Actieplan Mensenrechten en Bedrijfsleven het doel gesteld dat 50 procent van de grote bedrijven in 2020 gepaste zorgvuldigheid toepassen. In het huidige Duitse regeerakkoord is vastgelegd dat wetgeving wordt overwogen als deze doelstelling niet wordt gehaald. De resultaten van een eerste tussenmeting in Duitsland worden zomer 2019 verwacht.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De doelstellingen zijn niet √©√©n op √©√©n te vergelijken, omdat er andere criteria worden gehanteerd. Feit is wel dat zowel Nederland als Duitsland proberen inzicht te krijgen in de mate waarin bedrijven in beide landen ketenverantwoordelijkheid nemen. En dat beide landen deze informatie willen gebruiken als input voor eventuele aanvullende maatregelen op het gebied van IMVO.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Kunt u toelichten wat wetgeving buiten Nederland op het gebied van bindende ketenverantwoordelijkheid voor consequenties heeft voor Nederlandse bedrijven? Bent u bereid hierover met hen in gesprek te gaan en de Kamer te informeren of dit tot een verandering leidt in het denken over het ontwikkelen van dergelijke wetgeving in Nederland en/of de Nederlandse positie ten aanzien van dergelijke wetgeving in EU-verband?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer Nederlandse bedrijven buiten de grens opereren, dienen zij zich ook aan de lokale wet- en regelgeving te houden. Als die wetgeving iets anders vraagt dan in Nederland, kan dit leiden tot meerwerk en extra kosten voor bedrijven. Dit is √©√©n van de redenen waarom Nederland ‚Äì op diverse terreinen ‚Äì Europese of andere internationale regelgeving prefereert boven nationale wetgeving. Gesprekken hierover vinden al plaats, bijvoorbeeld binnen de Commissie Multinationale Ondernemingen van ondernemingsorganisatie VNO-NCW.

I interned at a tech company last summer (June-August), graduated with a BS in comp sci in May. I fell in love with the company and wanted a full time position after the internship. Long story short I did not get a full time position and started another job immediately after. I saw a job posting for the company I love and thought I would be a good fit so I threw my resume out there and they invited me to the interview process. First I had to take the CCAT then I was invited to the next step which is a face to face interview at the office and will be retaking the CCAT. I do not want to blow this opportunity and I really need some reassurance/tips. I have wanted a full time job here since my first day of my internship and now I finally have my foot in the door for this interview.

atl5e7,325,2019-02-22,"I don't work with you guys anymore, and I haven't FOR THE PAST 5 MONTHS",doray,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/atl5e7/i_dont_work_with_you_guys_anymore_and_i_havent/,"Hi everyone, first of all: English is not my first language, I know this might not be the normal IDWHL story but I guess it fits, if not feel free to remove it, mods.

This happened a year ago or so and this needs a lot of backstory: I'm a music producer and audio technician. I was working with an ad agency doing original music, audio things and voice overs, I wasn't really happy with my salary or the staff, and I heard from a friend that she needed a voiceover talent for videos for her new VR ad agency, so I got in touch with her, her boyfriend and the other shareholders and worked with them in some videos as a freelancer.

I was laid off that Christmas from the Ad Agency but I was feeling so much better working with the VR agency so I got in touch with them and asked them for a job position, which they gladly gave me: I was the one to manage all the sound mixes and voice over things in the VR videos, as well as manage the creative side of the agency (I was the only guy that had any knowledge in creative industries in the company , the other guys (shareholders) were administrators and a psychologist). I was offered a minimum wage pay (it was the same as the other agency, and it was my first job after Uni, so I took it out of necessity) and a services contract which I stupidly accepted, as I didn't know the difference back then (this is basically a freelance contract, but they expected me to work like it was a full contract)

Things started alright, but then I noticed that I was the ONLY guy in the company that had any sort of knowledge in technology and IT stuff (which is mandatory in a technology based company), and the other guys were focused on sales, so I proposed to do some powerpoint presentations explaining them how the work flow should be done (post production stuff has to be really organized, otherwise it can be hell).

My contributions were gladly accepted but there was always a general feeling towards me that they knew better how to do stuff, which was frustrating but I let it pass since I was happy working with them. Also, they ordered me to go to their co-working space (provided by my uni's ex alumni association) and work from 9 to 6 (I had a freelance contract, so I didn't have to comply with any schedule whatsoever) even though my studio is home based, tried to force me to use my ex alumni account to pay for some stuff and allow visitors inside the offices (as my guests), put me in charge of video editing (I don't even know how to do that properly), had me do a lot of HR stuff, had me contact clients, providers for their VR visors, deal with lots of IT and programming stuff, forced me to take a Oracle Seminar designed specifically for IT experts (didn't understand a thing), left the Go Pro Omni in my place and tried to use my room for storage purposes, had me search for interns (with no payment for them, of course), design a VR helmet for them, make measurements for their VR Google certification, etc. IT.WAS.HELL. they were really disorganized.

At the end, I had a disagreement with one of the shareholders who had the audacity to come to my house and insult me because I didn't know how to batch transfer movies from an Omni Go Pro (which is a fucking pain in the ass) so I resigned in July 1st (they even tried to make me refund them my last paycheck because the guy in charge of the payroll didn't know he paid me at the end of the month, not month upfront). I tried to stay in good terms with them because my friend was one of the shareholders. When I resigned I gave my friend back all video projects I had done (she was the ""creative director"", even though she's a psychologist and has no experience working in any creative industry job), along with the audio and music that I had done for the company, a hard drive and a video card, I also told them that I would be deleting the backup I had from them.

Fast forward I got a WhatsApp message from my friend in December, M= Me, F= friend.

F: hi doray, how are you? I need you to send me all the videos you have from the company right now.

M: hi F, I don't have anything.

F: what do you mean you don't have anything? What about x video? or the youtube videos that you worked on?

M: well F, as I told you I don't have anything, I gave you back the hard drive that had all videos and audio from the company. You can still download a copy of the video from YouTube if needed.

F: but you were the last one that worked on that video, you must have it (as if digital media can't have multiple copies)

M: I'm sorry F, but I gave you everything I had. As I said before, you can download a copy of the video from YouTube, I can help you if you want.

F: but you must have it, you need to send it to me now

M: for the last time F, I don't have any video or media from your company, I deleted everything after I gave you the backups in the hard drive, I specifically told you to check if there was anything missing and you guys didn't say anything. I'm in no way responsible for any lost media or anything to do with your VR agency, or your disorganization regarding your very own product storage.

F: WOW, You can't talk to me like that, I demand respect, I can't believe you're being so rude to me, you have problems 

M: no, you're the one being rude, demanding stuff from me after I resigned 5 months ago!, I don't have to do anything for you guys, I'm not your employee.

F: word of advice, you need to check that attitude, otherwise you're not going anywhere in life.

M: word of advice, if you're a so called Creative Director you should be more organized and stop losing videos that clients have already paid for.

F: I feel sad for you, I hope you get the help you need.

I blocked her, for obvious reasons F and me are no longer friends.

Edit: fixed some grammar stuff and added a few things I had forgotten from the chat (YouTube video download). Also added the last part of the conversation."
atlal9,4,2019-02-22,Should I take a co-op and graduate in six years?,Raspyy,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/atlal9/should_i_take_a_coop_and_graduate_in_six_years/,"I am currently in year 3/5 in college. I switched to chemical engineering, and I have to graduate in 5 years now. There's no regrets here, and I feel like I made the right decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an internship for this summer. Next summer, I have to take a required class for my major during half of the summer. The company I will be interning with has mentioned they are willing to take me back next summer for half of the summer. So, if all goes according to plan I'll be graduating with 1.5 internships for my work experience.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that co-ops are important especially for chemical engineering at my school. It's valuable experience, good money, and it seems that everyone in my class has them. One professor even said that co ops are more valuable than internships. I definitely want to do one, but in my case it seems like graduating in six years is a bit overkill.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think it is worth it to graduate in six years and co op for a semester or two? Would companies look down on someone who graduates without a co op? What about someone who takes a whopping six years to complete their degree?"
atlkkj,170,2019-02-22,DH tells BIL that he can't stay over the weekend that my dad is visiting and Maharani sticks her nose in anyway,BariBahu,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/atlkkj/dh_tells_bil_that_he_cant_stay_over_the_weekend/,"[All links are GIFs unless indicated to be a 'link' to a previous post.]

*****

I [recently posted over on JustNoSO](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/asgnlr/dh_sees_nothing_wrong_with_how_much_he_gets/) [link] about an issue DH and I were having that was tangentially related to Maharani. 

The TL;DR of it is that my dad (whom we haven't seen since our wedding... more than six months ago but less than a year) is visiting us soon for a weekend. BIL2 happens to have a conference on the same weekend in our city. BIL2's college is about an hour away by train, and it is very common for students from said college to get up early *every* day to make it here for internships, let alone for just a day or two on the fucking weekend. DH was all of a sudden *very*... upset isn't the right word, but clearly frustrated and concerned, wanting to figure something out for his [\(technically\)](https://media1.tenor.com/images/58312a2739c0a58127e459b36733a524/tenor.gif?itemid=12683009) adult brother. He kept saying shit like ""Man, why'd it have to be the same weekend?"" My reaction was basically... Um, it's not that big of a deal? Homie can wake up at 5:30 am for once in his goddamn life [if this is so important.](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Hlwkwp7hOrBlH0c/giphy.gif) (I didn't say that, but I was thinking it.) I felt like his response should have been ""Sorry bro, we're busy. No can do."" Instead, he tried to push me into acquiescing by suggesting that my dad and I could sleep in the bed while he and BIL2 took the couch.

I ended up breaking and informing DH (gently but matter-of-factly) that BIL2 has been [a complete dickwad](https://media.giphy.com/media/6RoOocJxK3Ypq/giphy.gif) to both of us for the past few years, only recently becoming a bit nicer... and he has also shown in multiple ways that he does not respect me or particularly appreciate the many times I've gone to bat for him with his parents or come through for him when he's fucked up. Like, I'm not awesome for the sake of appreciation, but I also don't want to be treated as less than awesome when I've really[ proven otherwise, you know?](https://media.giphy.com/media/dkGhBWE3SyzXW/giphy.gif) 

Anyway, check out the other post if you'd like more details since our focus here is [Maharani.](https://media.giphy.com/media/vd9p3wCCistr2/giphy.gif) I realized from the way that DH was acting that he seemed to have an almost sort of anxiety over this... I felt he was acting irrational, but he was *so* convinced that he was being totally logical that I started to doubt myself. Still, DH's refusal to hear me out, *right after* we'd had a couple weeks of me crying and going into a depressive spiral over his prioritizing his family's wants over my needs... it just felt like he was preemptively having his guilt buttons pushed. And I kind of said so... and in the same conversation, DH did make *one* small comment about having to answer to his parents, but other than that he kind of didn't acknowledge it and just focused on the faaaamily of it all.

Lol sometimes he forgets he married me *because* [I'm not stupid.](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oAt2dA6LxMkRrGc0g/giphy.gif)

Just a couple days after this blow out, Maharani calls. She said that DH's parents were going to pay for a hotel room for BIL2 (once again babying the shit out of this overly entitled monster [that they have created](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xGocUH8RYoDKKs/giphy.gif)) but that she still wanted to know whether it was possible for BIL2 to stay over. DH told her no and why, and she tried to needle a little, giving suggestions about BIL sleeping on the floor or whatever.

[DH still said no.](https://media.giphy.com/media/doUu2ByZDbPYQ/giphy.gif) The conversation was pretty short, so I don't even think he JADEd that much. When he relayed it to me (I only heard a little bit because I didn't want to eavesdrop as I just get frustrated), he tried to paint it like she backed off after just one suggestion but I know her. I even called him on it, and he didn't deny it.

Now, by South Asian standards, this would be considered BEC. Many of my desi friends and family wouldn't find this odd at first because our parents are definitely culturally too involved in their grown children's lives... but the more I think about it, the more I'm sure that if I actually asked any of my friends or cousins to think about whether or not their parents would do what Maharani did in this situation, all of them would say no. Desi parents might stick their nose into our business about what we name our kids or where we live, but when it comes to small shit like this and dealings with our siblings, none of the other parents I know would get involved. Except my mother... who is a diagnosed narcissist. 

It's a small thing, I guess, but I'm just super tired of her thinking she has any say in what we do or how we conduct our lives, especially over small shit like this."

He was hiding in the closet, tears streaking down his face as he tried to avoid Garfield. ‚ÄúJonnnn‚Ä¶ feed me‚Ä¶‚Äù Garfield's voice was lethargic and overpoweringly malevolent, echoing through the small closet. Jon bit off his racking sobs as the voice grew louder, paralyzing him with fear. ‚ÄúJon‚Ä¶‚Äù Jon's eyes grew wide as the voice halted, right in front of the closet. ‚ÄúI can smell you.‚Äù Jon screamed as the door was ripped from its hinges by the monstrously powerful feline. ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's too late, you should have fed me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait, I'll make you lasagna right now! Just don't kill me, not like you killed Odie!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, Jon.‚Äù Jon's screams would have sent the neighbourhood dogs howling, if there were any left.


‚ÄúMr. Tyson, I found something‚Äù ‚ÄúThat's Mr. Degrasse-Tyson to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, sorry sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo worries, it's a common mistake. Hey, did you know that if you nut in space it will propel you?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo! Is it true?‚Äù ‚ÄúGo try it.‚Äù Neil smiled as he watched the intern pull his cock out while climbing into his personal spaceship. ‚ÄúOkay, this is epic.‚Äù Ben Shapiro stepped into the room. ‚ÄúBenny, find anything new about the murder?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I think it was a ghost. ‚ÄúWhat makes you say that?‚Äù ‚ÄúFacts and Knowledge.‚Äù Been Shapiro's high voice pierced Neil's eardrums, but he ignored it like always. Ben's other‚Ä¶ endowments more than made up for his voice. ‚ÄúWell, let's see the corpse.‚Äù As Neil stepped over the disfigured corpse, he grimaced at the damage. ‚ÄúSomething violent, obviously. There's blood all the way on the ceiling.‚Äù ¬†‚ÄúExcuse me, who the fuck are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Neil stood and looked at the man in the front doorway. ‚ÄúThis is a police crime-scene! Who the fuck are you. ‚ÄúDetective Neil Degrasse-Tyson, WEONTV.‚Äù ‚ÄúW- What?‚Äù A gunshot resounded through the house. ‚ÄúDead cop and dead victim, balanced as all things should be.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat's how mafia works‚Äù said Ben as he stepped over the corpse. ‚ÄúHey now, save some for me.‚Äù Without a word Ben pointed to Jon's corpse. Neil grunted as he pulled a needler out of his anal cavity and proceeded to tea-bag Jon's corpse with the vigor of a horny fifteen year old beating their meat to Cortana in Halo 4. 


Garfield purred as he licked the kitchen floor, blood crusted onto his face. He growled as he heard the sound of knuckles rapping against the wood of the front door. ‚ÄúMrs. Arbuckle-Wilson? We have questions related to your husband.‚Äù Garfield remained silent, refusing to betray his presence. They found Jon. Jon and Liz had separated after she found him fucking her father. She should have fed me. Why do they never feed me? When Liz had tried to run, Garfield had been forced to kill her. He had already eaten all the food, and would have to feed again soon. Garfield growled and crawled out the window.


‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know. I saw something move.‚Äù ‚ÄúLet's check it out.‚Äù Neil pulled his BFG-9000 out of his shoulder holster and stepped into the Kitchen. He slowly advance, foot by foot, wary of any foe. ‚ÄúNeil, I-‚Äù Ben screamed as the lights went out. ‚ÄúBen!‚Äù Neil spun and tried to find Ben, but could see nothing in the darkness. ‚ÄúShould be light from the hall, it's still day.‚Äù Neil lunged to the side as a demonic screech erupted from behind him. He dropped his BFG, knowing it would be useless, and rolled into attack position squatting on the ground. He convulsed his anal muscles, fighting to remain silent. ‚ÄúYou're alone and unarmed. You should have fed me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm black. I'm never unarmed.‚Äù The room was lit up as Neil fired his M16, revealing his leather Jacket and Beret. Garfield hissed as he was riddled with machine gun fire. ‚ÄúBlack Power!‚Äù shouted Neil as he fired his M16 with only one hand, his other holding a Molotov cocktail. Garfield's spider legs gripped Neil's muscular leatherbound shoulders. ‚ÄúFEED ME!‚Äù Neil knew he would die if he could not feed the beast that held him in it's grips. He convulsed his anal muscles one last time. He slumped to the ground when Garfield released him He gasped and pulled himself to Ben's headless corpse as Garfield fled with the fried Chicken Neil had stored in his Anus. ‚ÄúBen‚Ä¶ I'm sorry.‚Äù 


‚ÄúThe beast is more powerful than I ever imagined. We need to stop him.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh my God, it's Michael Jordan, from Space Jam!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat? What the fuck, I did more than Space Jam.‚Äù Michael Jordan was clearly on the verge of punching Neil. ‚ÄúYou did?‚Äù Neil's confusion played across his face like Ben's three peni used to. ‚ÄúGo fuck yourself.‚Äù Michael Jordan, after being paid 3.5 million dollars to cameo, walked away. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck just happened.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know, but I have the answer to your problems.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh my God, it's the communist guy from the 50‚Äôs!‚Äù A look of disgust enveloped Stalin's face. ‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù Neil was unphased. ‚ÄúSo you know the answer?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes. To defeat Garfield, you must penetrate his ass and cream him so hard that he is destroyed.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it that simple?‚Äù Stalin looked Neil in the face. ‚ÄúWhile playing Despacito.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know. Soyuz Nerushimy Respublik Svobodnykh.‚Äù The sounds of our glorious Union echoed through the night. 


Neil pulled a shotgun shell apart with a pair of ghetto makeshift pliers, emptying the pellets onto his desk. After he had several shells prepared, he grabbed his bucket of watermelon seeds and measured out precise amounts to fill the shells. ‚ÄúI'm not gonna be the only nogga seeing stars tonight.‚Äù Neil loaded a magazine of Chicken nuggets into his Desert Eagle as he stared into the distance, playing out the scenario in his mind. Once all was prepared, Neil settled down to pray. He bowed his head over his stacks of crusty hentai and prayed for guidance. ‚ÄúSenpai, give me strength.‚Äù


Neil closed the door to his car with a certain finality that only a man who knows he is going to die can achieve. He held a sawed off shotgun in his left hand and a bucket in the other. The sound of his footsteps echoed through the neighborhood. Neil's swift kick brought the door down with ease, it's crash resounding through the house. ‚ÄúGarfield!‚Äù Neil looked through the room, still splattered with blood. ‚ÄúYou've returned. Are you here to feed me?‚Äù Neil smiled a sadistic grin. ‚ÄúI'll feed you my cock.‚Äù Garfield choked as he heard Neil's proclamation ‚ÄúHold up nigga, I ain't no fag.‚Äù Neil recoiled at the unnecessary homophobia and responded with a quick retort. ‚ÄúI meant chicken!‚Äù He spilled his bucket of fried chicken all over the floor. Garfield lunged for it and swallowed the first leg whole. 


‚ÄúOr did I!‚Äù Neil tackled Garfield and forcefully slid his cock through Garfield's layers of fat and began to thrust into Garfield's ass. Garfield twisted around in an attempt to free himself in a ferocious effort. His resistance soon subsided and his howls turned to moans as he realized he liked it. Neil's massive cock slid smoothly against Garfield's prostate, almost causing them both to ejaculate. ‚ÄúOh! Oh‚Ä¶‚Äù Neil's face puffed up as he rode Garfield like his Twitter rides on his face alone. Neil slid off of Garfield, his hand a blur in an attempt to maintain his own pleasure. He gripped Garfield's folds of fat and rolled him onto his back, exposing his barbed phallus for Neil to gawk at. Garfield's massive spider limbs enveloped Neil and placed him on their driving mechanism and manipulating him up and down. Neil eagerly rode Garfield's rocket, spewing his juices all over. But Garfield wasn't done. After Neil's asshole was more destroyed than Elon Musk's Twitter, Elon Musk himself stepped in. ‚ÄúYou mentioned rockets.‚Äù Neil, naked as the day of his birth, spun to face the door. Elon leaned on the doorway, his sexy South African accent ringing in Neil's ears. ‚ÄúOnly as a descriptive term. Wait, how the fuck are you-‚Äù Elon interrupted Neil without seeming to care. ‚ÄúI'm only in your head. I'm here to give you the endurance to slay this beast.‚Äù A single tear rolled down Neil's cheek. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Elon smiled and faded away. 


Neil turned to his task without another word. He huffed and he puffed, and he blew his load several times. Garfield, too high on sex to notice his peril, was taken by surprise as Neil hit play on his shitty phone. He screamed as Despacito penetrated his brain, purging the world of his presence. His eyes glowed with the light of reactor number four, and his pained screams scraped Neil's ears. ‚ÄúNo! You found my only weakness! Despacito!‚Äù Neil grimaced as Garfield withdrew form his anus and crumpled into a ball. ‚ÄúI will return!‚Äù Garfield's final words would echo through Neil's head for months to come.


3 months later


Neil stepped over the corpse and grimaced as he saw the blood. ‚ÄúI'm telling you, Garfield has returned!‚Äù Angela Merkel exclaimed to Neil Degrasse-Tyson, who remained silent. After a moment, he said: ‚ÄúNo. I destroyed him.‚Äù Angela grimaced. ‚ÄúFine, waste more innocent lives on wild goose chases!‚Äù Without another word, Germany's Chancellor stormed from the room. Neil sighed and went back to examining the crime scene. With a ridiculous abruptness, Neil heard a scream. ‚ÄúAngela!‚Äù He rushed out the front door, seeing only the orange fur lying next to the corpse of Angela Merkel. ‚ÄúNo! He has returned! Why didn't I listen?‚Äù Tears ran from Neil's eyes for no other reason than the dramatic effect, and for the same reason it began to rain. Neil's tears dried, and his eyes became hard. ‚ÄúOnly I can stop him now.‚Äù


Neil sat in the front room of the Arbuckle house next to the rotting corpse of Jon, who had never been removed. Neil's sleeves were rolled up, and his hands white with chalk. ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù He sat back and stared greedily at the pentagram he had inscribed upon the floor. ‚ÄúNow for the candles.‚Äù Neil grunted as he pulled was from his ears and he twisted his hair into a fuse. He placed the five candles at the five corners before rising. He gripped a lighter in one hand and his book of incantations in the other, and lit the candles with the former. ‚ÄúUnholy spirit, I summon thee to my sanctum, and command thee to obey.‚Äù Wind rustled the pages of his book and blew the flame from the candles. ‚ÄúYou summoned me?‚Äù The Scottish accent was almost orgasmic to Neil's ears. ‚ÄúYes, Lord Shrek. I need to defeat Garfield.‚Äù Shrek smiled and placed his great ogre hand on Neil's muscular shoulder in a display of affection. ‚ÄúIf you wish to destroy him, you must destroy the source.‚Äù Neil raised his head to stare into Shrek's eyes. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù ‚ÄúFind Will Burke, and destroy his drawings in the only way that is final.‚Äù Neil was about to object, and them stopped as comprehension dawned on him. ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù 


Neil stood outside the door to Will Burke's house, trying not to look like a stalker. He looked up into the light as the camera panned out Ward, ripping off the scene from The Exorcist. Neil walked to the door and, hoping to be silent, kicked in the door. He was unprepared for the darkness that greeted him. ‚ÄúWha-‚Äù A deep chuckle drove shivers down Neil's spine. ‚ÄúYou cannot destroy me that easily.‚Äù Neil rolled forward to hide himself in the darkness. ‚ÄúThe dark is your element, but you can't find me cause‚Äô I'm black!‚Äù Neil's gleeful cry was cut short by Garfield's snarl. Neil wisely shut up, knowing no one on Twitter wants to hear his shit. Wait wrong platform. Neil knew that Garfield could find him by the sound of his voice. He quietly creeped along the floor, before stepping on a creaky board and being besieged upon by Garfield once again. Neil knew he would have to distract Garfield while he destroyed the drawings, so he prepared his black magic (no racism intended (this time (I definitely meant it the other times))). Neil wiped the sweat from his brow as his eyes forlornly searched for some trace of light, any trace of light. Suddenly, Neil saw the light that came from Will's book, the light of God. Neil slowly worked his way closer and closer, before being in arm's reach of the light. He looked to either side and saw nought but darkness. Garfield recoiled as light suddenly erupted and Fried Chicken appeared from thin air and Neil's call. 


Neil collapsed as all his energy left him to create the Chicken that would spare his life. He panted and pulled himself up to sit against what he assumed was a wall. He slowly turned his head to see the light. He was overcome by such dedication that he pulled himself to his feet and stumbled to the light. ‚ÄúI must‚Ä¶ Destroy‚Ä¶ forever!‚Äù Neil whipped his stiff cock out and began to furiously stroke it. His wrinkled hand slid over his wrinkled and veiny phallus with the speed of my life evaporating beneath me. His bony fingers provided all the more stimulation, running over his cock over and over again. Neil faltered from fatigue, and felt the terror of failure. ‚ÄúDon't fear, I'm here.‚Äù Neil felt reassurance at the sound of Shrek's voice. ‚ÄúYou need energy and you need cum. I can't nut for you, bit I can give you my ogre nuts.‚Äù Neil smiled as Shrek faded away, and he felt himself reinvigorating and his balls reinflating. He gripped his cock and began to stroke all the more furiously. He moaned as wave after wave of jizz poured onto the pages of Will's work, destroying Garfield forever. Neil collapsed with the knowledge that he had destroyed the orange menace. As tears flowed down his face and he faded like a more wrinkly Yoda, one thought resonated through his mind. Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life.


Riley gasped as he woke from his nightmares. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did John just write for me?‚Äù

Been lying in bed for an extra 30 minutes in the morning, getting irritated quickly and lashing out at people, neglecting meals here and there, among other responsibilities as well. It's my 4th year in college and I won't be graduating for another year's time, plus I haven't made any friends while here, so maybe that's whats getting me down.

Anyways I've been trying to remind myself each day that regardless of how I'm doing now that I know how to manage my depression I just need to keep at it. Last year around this time I was 22 without a driver's license, job, or any friends, and constantly in danger of losing my financial aid along with my apartment. And I felt like a failure. 

Fast forward to today and I drive almost every day, got an internship lined up for the Summer, made contact with some old friends and opened up about my depression to some of them, and I'm making straight B's in all my classes. But I still feel like a failure, even though maybe I'm not at this point and maybe I never was.

A comforting thought is that maybe me from a year ago would be happy to see where I am today, even if it's not a drastic change. So I'm taking the time today to pat myself on the back in a way, and remind myself that any progress is good progress even if I'm not 100% there in terms of mental health yet.

Anyways idk just ramblin at this point, hope anyone who reads this has a good day today."

However, I have a semester co-op remaining but would like to work during the summer.

ato184,5,2019-02-22,Don't trust Kelvin,joshuaandrew1985,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/ato184/dont_trust_kelvin/,"I had the pleasure of being Callie's training supervisor for her first day at Simon &amp; Williams. She was young but her education was excellent and her aptitude tests were off the charts.

I knew I would have to play my cards right to keep her since all of the senior management would want a piece of her.

But, ultimately, we had a job to do. I started off with the usual tour. I showed her the restrooms, break room, conference room, etc. to start off with.

Our company covered 3 whole floors of the skyscraper we occupied. Running over a letter to another department could easily get a newbie lost. So I was careful to point out landmarks wherever possible.

We were standing next to Susan from accounting's office when Kelvin first appeared. I had been pointing out Susan's door as a helpful landmark since it was always decorated with a festive wreath no matter what season it was.

Kelvin had a knack for stepping out seemingly right from your own shadow. He was standing between Callie and I for a split second before either of us noticed him.

Kelvin adjusted his glasses, which always seemed to hide his eyes in a glare, and introduced himself with a warm smile and friendly nod. Callie was barely startled with his sudden appearance but was quickly disarmed by his amicable nature. 

She returned the smile and they chatted briefly about how exciting Callie's first job would be. And then Kelvin made a convincing excuse and bowed out to disappear around the nearest corner.

Callie looked at me as though to say, ""What's next?"" but I had an obligation to warn her. I smiled at Kelvin's retreat but told her, ""Do not trust him.""

""Oh, uh, what?""

""Don't trust, Kelvin.""

She nervously chuckled as she pretended to understand, ""Ah, don't worry. I can handle myself.""

""Well, you don't have to worry about him in groups or while conducting business. Kelvin is a consummate professional. Just don't trust him.""

Callie clearly had more questions but, at that moment, we were swept into a team meeting. I directed her to take notes and we went over them later while I deciphered exactly what had been discussed. Before long, it was time for lunch so I treated her at the restaurant located 10 floors below us.

While there, she eventually steered the conversation back to Kelvin. Because of his casual dress, she wondered if he was in the IT Department. I slowly sipped more of my drink before responding seriously, ""Don't forget, curiosity killed the cat.""

She stared at me for a moment before laughing. She continued, ""No, seriously. I'm intrigued. Who is Kelvin? Everyone else I've seen has been in a suit or dress and he's just walking around in ripped blue jeans and a hoodie?""

""Honestly, I have no idea what exactly Kelvin does for the company.""

""Well, who's his supervisor?""

""He doesn't have one.""

""That's impossible? Isn't it?""

""Not for Kelvin.""

""I've been keeping an eye out all morning. He looks like he's my age but walks around like he owns the place. Does he? Is he the owner's son?""

""I really doubt it. All I know is that Kelvin was there when I was hired and the guy who showed me around said the same thing.""

Callie thought about this in silence for a moment before breaking it with, ""You're serious, aren't you? This isn't just a haze the new girl prank?""

""I'm serious.""

""Why would you tell me not to trust him? Has- has he hurt someone?""

""I guess you have to better define what it means to hurt. He has definitely hurt careers. There was one hotshot manager who was here for 1 week. He decides he doesn't like Kelvin at first sight and tries to tell him to go home and change. They both go into the H.R. Manager's office and the next day we're informed that the new manager was fired.""

""And he was fired because of Kelvin?""

""Maybe. All I know is that no one ever saw him again.""

""Well, I'm going to ask demystify this Kelvin. I'll just ask him directly what he does.""

""Suit yourself, but just remember. Don't trust him.""

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the afternoon breezed by but Callie was a little distracted. Whenever she saw Kelvin out in the cubicle farms or down the hall, she'd excuse herself and try to corner him. But no matter how quickly she stalked after him, he always seemed to vanish after she turned a corner after him.

I wondered if she ever noticed, during these chases, that Kelvin never seemed to make any audible footsteps. Maybe she had because, as soon as returned from one escapade, she collapsed in the chair in front of my desk and asked me bluntly, ""Is Kelvin a ghost?""

""I don't think so.""

""He sure does a convincing impersonation of one whenever he turns a corner.""

""Kelvin knows these hallways better than anyone. He knows which doors go all the way through to another hallway. And he knows exactly when a wide eyed assistant is sneaking up behind him.""

""I guess I haven't been very subtle.""

""No, not really.""

""Well, let's get back to work. I'll just have to wait for Kelvin to come to me.""

""You don't have to wait long. He's been right behind you for about 30 seconds now.""

Callie jumped out of the seat and squeaked a scream that she had just barely failed to control. Kelvin just stood there. Grinning as usual. He rocked back and forth for a few seconds with his hands in his pockets. Waiting. Finally, he took out his hands and spread them in Callie's direction while asking, ""Well? Did you want to ask me something?""

Callie started to stammer so I stepped in by saying, ""Callie was just curious what department you work in. Maybe you can educate the both of us?""

""I don't work for any specific department. I just float around. Doing whatever is necessary.""

Callie had found the time to calm down and confidently asked, ""No offense, but it seems like you get to spend a lot of time chilling with coworkers. How do I get your job?""

Kelvin's glasses seemed to glow with an extra intensity as he answered, ""You'll have to fight me for it.""

We all chuckled. Then Kelvin abruptly turned and left.

I repeated my warning, ""Don't trust him.""

&amp;#x200B;

We worked late into the evening, Callie eager to show off her dedication. We got a lot done but I also told her a few more stories I had about Kelvin. I told her how Kelvin was actually a great friend to have in the workplace. He was quick with a joke, compliments, or whatever else you might need at the moment. I had never, ever seen him not smiling.

But I also told her about how there was an intern named Erica who had gotten close to Kelvin. They were inseparable for a time and then she just disappeared. Kelvin insisted that she was fine and just decided to quit one day and not come in. H.R. couldn't get a hold of her by phone or email so they relied on Kelvin to get her office keycard back. He brought it in the next day.

I also told her how I once mistakenly called him Kevin. That afternoon, he brought over a large bowl full of individually wrapped candies as a gift. It was very generous but at the same time I was struck by the murderous rage emanating from behind those glasses. I examined those candies carefully and found each and every one had a tiny hole through the wrapper. As through a syringe had been inserted there.

So, I concluded by once again saying, and with her echoing, ""Don't trust Kelvin.""

We finished everything we could accomplish and I told her to go home. I finished a last email and turned off my lights before exiting to the hallway where I could still see Callie standing at the end. I caught up to her and saw why she hadn't gone any further yet.

Kelvin was standing at the end of the hallway that led to the elevators.

Just standing there.

Smiling.

I strode forward while beckoning Callie. I tried to reassure her by saying, ""It's OK, nothing bad will happen as long as we keep moving towards him.""

Callie followed and confessed, ""I feel really silly for being afraid. He's just acting like he wants some company in the elevator after all.""

""No, you did the right thing to wait for me. We'll be fine as long as we head towards him but we can't cross him. We'll have to head down one of these other hallways and go around him.""

Callie looked confused as she whispered, ""You sound like you know even more about Kelvin than you've let on.""

""Of course. It's your first day. I didn't want to scare you.""

""If that was your goal, to avoid scaring me, you've done an absolutely terrible job of it.""

We made a sharp right turn down the nearest big hall and Callie immediately yelped in surprise. Kelvin was at the end of this hall too. 

Just standing there.

Beckoning.

I opened a door to a nearby conference room and quietly told Callie to go inside. We exited out the opposite side but Kelvin was also just down this hall. Callie started to run down the hall in the other direction so I yelled at her to stop. She raised her head to see Kelvin was now waiting for her on this side.

I told her, as calmly as I could, ""Don't run. Walk with me down this hall just a little bit further. There is a supply closet here that Kelvin can't enter.""

""What- how do you know that? What is going on?""

""You'll have to trust me for now. Scenarios like these are the reason I work late at night. This closet here is safe.""

I opened the door and she practically jumped inside. I entered close behind her. There was a pause as Callie waited for her eyes to get used to the dark. I already knew my way around so I slid behind her and grabbed the chains as the door opened again and Kelvin entered that small dungeon.

That's when I gave Callie my last piece of advice.

""You shouldn't trust me either."""
ato9ql,127,2019-02-22,[FM] I got caught fucking my boss by his wife,homewrecker95,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/ato9ql/fm_i_got_caught_fucking_my_boss_by_his_wife/,"Last summer I was interning at a law firm. It is fairly small but prominent. One of the partners is a handsome Latino man. He is 40 with broad shoulders and a great smile. I noticed him instantly as did most women with a pulse. 

A few weeks into the internship, he started paying more and more attention to me. I noticed him checking me out when I walked by. I am pretty curvaceous so even when I dress conservative there is still plenty to see. I loved the attention even though he is married. A few times I caught him looking and gave him a smile back. 

One day a the end of work, he asked me into his office. He gave me this speech about how he takes mentorship very seriously. A partner's number one job is to develop the future partners of the firm. He asked me if I would like to get a drink and we could discuss my future plans. 

Now I am not stupid. This wasn't my first rodeo. I knew exactly what he was after and I was all for it. I said yes. He said great. He asked me not to mention anything to the other interns so they wouldn't get jealous. He also asked me to leave now and get us a table at the bar a few blocks away. I am pretty sure he didn't want to be seen leaving the office with me.

When he got there he started asking me about my plans and school. What classes was I in. Was I in a sorority? Did I have a boyfriend?

To the last question I said ""No I don't have a boyfriend. College boys don't interest me much. So immature."" That was a half truth. I had been fucking around with one of the other interns but it was a casual summer thing. I also love college boys. Either way he took the signal. One of his hands was working is way down my back and the other was one my knee. 

I asked if there was somewhere less loud we could talk. He said he condo was only a few minutes away and no one would be home for a few hours. His wife had a dinner meeting and wouldn't be home until later.

We got to his place and it was amazing. Money might not be able to buy happiness but it can buy one hell of a view. He poured us some wine. He took me out on the balcony to show me the view. He pushed himself up behind me to point to something. I leaned back into him. He leaned in to kiss me. I broke a wine glass but he didn't even notice.

We went back inside and he pulled me on top of him while he sat on the couch. As we kissed he undressed me. When I tried to start unbuttoning my shirt, he slapped my hands away and said that was his job. He took off my shirt and skirt. I still had on pantyhose, underwear, a bra and my shoes. 

He had me stand up. He told me to spin for him. I did. He told me to face away and bend over. I did. He felt up my ass and told me I was a ""fantastic specimen."" 

He stood up and told me to kneel in front of him. He told me to take off this belt, then his pants and then he told me to hold the top of his underwear. He asked me if I wanted his cock. I said yes. He said say the whole thing, I said, ""I want you cock. I want to suck it. Please let me suck it.""

He said go ahead. I pulled down his underwear. He was fully hard. I kissed his cock from head to base. I sucked each ball. I licked it up and down. I kissed the tip and slowly let it in my mouth. I bobbed up and down the shaft until I took the whole thing then I held there as long as I could. He was loving it. I couldn't stay there long because he pubes were tickling my nose. Then I gave him the best blowjob I could and I take pride in my work.


He was loving it. He stopped me eventually and led me to the bedroom. He slowly removed the rest of my clothes but asked I put my heels back on. He lead me to a low dresser. He told me to bend over it and place my hands and elbows on it. I did. He got behind me and slowly pushed his cock in. He built up speed. He would pull my hair and slap my ass.


I love doggystyle so this was working for me. He found the right tempo and made me scream and I came.


He led me to the bed. I laid down and he got on top of me. We started fucking in missionary. He was holding my wrists so I couldn't move my arms. I was moaning. He had his faced buried in my tits. Suddenly I heard, ""ROBERT!""


I looked over and his wife was in the door way. She said something like, ""Not again"" or ""Not another one."" I'm not sure because I was trying to stop existing. He still hadn't let go of my wrists.


He said, ""I'm sorry honey. I don't know what happened. She just came on to me and I don't know."" 


She walked a few steps into the room and he turned a little to keep looking at her. He was still inside me so when he turned his dick moved deeper into me and I involuntarily grunted.


She shouted, ""Are you still fucking her? Jesus Robert! Well finish up and get her out of here. I have guests coming at 9:00."" Her tone this whole time wasn't angry or hysterical or anything. More annoyed and frustrated. This obviously wasn't his first rodeo either.


She closed the door. He turned back to me. I could tell he was unsure if he should finish or get off me. I was humiliated and not in the good way so the mood was ruined for me. I told him to get off. It was a bummer because up until that point it was one of the best sexual experiences of my life. 


I cleaned up and got as dressed as I could in the bedroom. He sheepishly said he was sorry and went to the shower. I slowly snuck out of the bedroom. I didn't see anyone in the living room where my clothes were so I went in. I found my clothes neatly folded on the arm of the couch. I started throwing them on as fast as I could. 


""I am sorry he put you through this,"" she said from the doorway to the kitchen with a glass of wine in her hand. I didn't see her and I almost jumped out of my skin. This bitch was stealthy. 


""He's awake man and can't control himself. I provide him certain freedoms as long as he keeps things out of my life but he can't even manage that.""


I do NOT know what to say to this. This is way too much exposition way to soon after having a dick inside me. 


I apologize and she says it's not my fault, but asks that if anything ever happens again make sure if doesn't happen in her house. I say ok and flee the scene.  


I keep my mouth shut at work for my own good. I don't want a reputation. Things are kind of awkward between Robert and I but it was functional enough for work. Near the end of summer I found out from another of the interns that she'd been fucking him most of the summer in hotel rooms. I don't tell her anything but I do notice that she and I both have red hair as does his wife and at least 2 other younger women in the office. 4 of us 5 are also pretty curvaceous so evidently Robert has a type and has dipped his pen in the company ink (or at least tried) quite a few times.

Long story short, guys, don't fuck your side piece in your wife's bed if you're married to a stealthy fucking bitch."
atoy68,2,2019-02-22,Need help,NickNickNickx3,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atoy68/need_help/,"I (22m) was with my girlfriend (23f) for 6 years. Everything was great until she went to college in a different city while I was still in high school. She met a co-worker (Guy1) that I quickly sensed there was something going on. I noticed everything about her changes; how she talked to me, treated me, etc. I expressed my feelings to her about him, but she said they were just friends and she had no feelings for him. This is where the trust issues started. She was so reluctant to let go of this guy for our relationship. (Key note: She would go back to talking to Guy1 throughout the years.) We played Xbox together and met some people doing so. One guy, in his late 30's at the time, started coming onto her. She worked overnights and I found out this guy got her number/snapchat and was texting her while she worked. This dude went the whole 10 yards. Bikini picture off my gf's Facebook (from when she was like 15) as his wallpaper and everything. I told her my feelings, she was reluctant at first but then ended up ghosting him. Fast forward some time, she decided to get job where I worked for some extra cash. There was a worker who everyone knew was the ""ideal"" fuck boy (Guy2). This guy brags about how he sleeps with so many girls and says relationships are overrated. Should I mention this job was at a K-8 Catholic school? My sister has worked there many years before. Turns out, he has tried to sleep with basically every female who had ever worked there. So I reached out to some of them and they all confirmed that he tried to sleep with them. Well, he gets my gf's snapchat and number and starts doing his fuck boy stuff. Obviously, knowing this guy, I didn't like this. Told my gf, and she was reluctant to ghost him. I leave for a two-week family vacation to Michigan and my gf decided not to go because she needed the money from work. My family decided to come back early. I decide to not tell her; I was going to show up at her work (restaurant) and surprise her. I show up - she is not surprised, she looked scared or something. She runs to the back and then comes back and says she needs to talk to me outside. We go outside and she tells me she invited Guy2 over that night to MY house; she claimed it was to play Xbox. I asked to see her phone and the only text was him saying ""Are you going to be a good little slut to me tonight?"" (She deleted the rest). She came home after work and we talked. I don't know why but I ended up believing her that her intentions were to play Xbox. Yes, I am stupid, I know. Even before this point of the relationship, trust was already non-existent. Throughout the years, I had always held onto these three situations. Every time we argued, I would bring it up and she would hate it (more to come). Five months later, I was going out of state for an internship. At this point, the relationship was at a low. We 'mutually' decided to take a break (limit contact and such) while I left and then we would reevaluate when I got back. I knew I wanted to be with her but she didn't know if she wanted to be with me (shocker). This was the first time I was going out of state alone and it was the first time in 5 years I wasn't able to talk to her (we talked basically 24/7). After a few days, it was killing me and I ended up regularly talking to her again. I find out she reached out to Guy1 the day after I left. I confronted Guy1 and he ended up on my side (we're actually friends now). He tells me that she told him not to worry about me when he asked why she was contacting him and that they went on a date two days after I left. I asked my gf about this and she lied, not knowing Guy1 told me the truth. She said it wasn't a date and that they were just ""catching up"". Guy1 ended up ghosting her since ""she was a snake"" and he doesn't want those type of people in his life. November 2018, 3 months after I get back from my internship, I get the same feeling about a new co-worker (Guy3). I expressed my feelings, again, and she was reluctant, again; even more so this time than the previous 3 times. Since that day, we started getting into arguments left and right over the dumbest things. Towards the end of January, she left me. Although the relationship was at an all time low, it was actually very sudden and unexpected. Two days later, she gets drunk and makes out with Guy3 - getting two hickies on her neck. By the way, Guy3 has a baby on the way. She also reaches out to Guy1 who instantly ghosted her. Two days after that, I contact Guy1. Turns out, my gf went to him every time her and I had a relationship issue. He proceeds to tell me that she admitted to him, on the date they went on, that she cheated on me and had sex with Guy2. I end up going to my gf and telling her what I was told. She tells me she had sex with Guy2 twice and the night I came home would've been the third time. Today, I happened to be able to read a live conversation she was having with a co-worker(Guy4) that worked with her and Guy1. She was trying to get Guy4 to contact Guy1 and get him to talk to her because ""I miss him so much"". According to her, her and Guy1 liked each other when she moved there for college but neither wanted to leave their relationships for each other. She said he was her best friend and that he knows her better than anyone (seriously?). She also said that he would go to her apartment and watch movies until 3AM.

Thus, I have learned more truth in the last 3 weeks than I did the last 4 years of our relationship.

‚Äã

We would bring up many times that the first two years of our relationship were amazing and that it sort of plateaued or declined from there. There was trust, loyalty, respect, appreciation, etc. issues - for the most part, caused by her. Now it makes sense though, right? It was because she met Guy1 and I was wary of this for 4 long years. For a year and a half, I always wondered if she actually cheated on me with Guy2. I love and care about this girl with my whole heart. She was my best friend and lover. Although, I never got the same feelings in return after year 2. Thinking back, she treated me awful for the greater part of our relationship. I didn't feel loved, cared for, wanted, etc. Was I blind? So blinded by love to see what was actually happening? Afraid to be alone? Everyone tells me I am better off without her, but I still want to be with her, as stupid as it sounds. What do I do from here? I am living through a roll coaster of emotions. One second, I want the worst revenge for her cheating, and the next, I want to be with her. How do I recover from this? I now question what love even is. This is because I loved this girl with everything I had and this is what I get in return. What is love? Why did this happen to me? Where did I go wrong? What do I do? There are so many questions I don't have answers for."

I will try to make the background as quick as possible, so please ask me if anything is unclear. My dad was quite absent when I grew up and had anger issues. After his divorce with my mom, he remarried a woman I loved at the beginning but who slowly turned emotionally abusive. My dad completely enabled her and let her berate me, accused of being a toxic manipulator since I was a child, I‚Äôm told I will always be an awful person and I can‚Äôt be happy. I was suffering from depression and despite my treatment I would still cry easily, they accused me of faking it and using my tears to manipulate them. Every single one of my choice was made about them, and how it reflected how great they were and/or how terrible I was, yada yada, it‚Äôs all very r/raisedbynarcissists (cross-posted there by the way). 

I end up sending them a letter asking for familial therapy to fix our relationship, they reject it and tell me the only problem is me, so I go very low contact with them at 19. 


Because of the divorce settlement and how the law works in my country, my father is obligated to give me a monthly allowance as defined in the divorce judgement and support me financially until I finish my studies or find a job. 

I live in a part of Europe where almost no one takes student loans, it‚Äôs common for parents to pay for college and support you until you find a job because of culture/high unemployment rate for young people even overqualified/high cost of living. My father is also very wealthy (think top 5% in our country), his wife also works, and they don‚Äôt have any debt. 


My father had always pushed me to take a gap year between my two years of Master‚Äôs degree to do some internships, and I decided it was actually a good idea and I took that gap year. He complained a lot about the cost of me adding one year to my study, even though there is basically no tuition for this year and I found a paid internship so I need a lot less financial support. He guilted me into meeting with him, and we agreed he would support me less financially during my gap year but would support me until the end of 2019.


That was technically illegal, as my studies wouldn‚Äôt be finished yet and I won‚Äôt have a job, but my last year of tuition would be covered by that point and I‚Äôm supposed to intern for the spring semester of 2020 so I thought I would make it work.

But now he has changed his tune. Three weeks ago, he sprung on me that he‚Äôs stopping any financial support in July 2019, and what‚Äôs my plan for financing my last year of Master‚Äôs degree, can he see my financial report and know how much I‚Äôve earned, but anyway he‚Äôs not paying, and if my mom wants to continue to help me that‚Äôs fine but she‚Äôll do it alone. I was shocked, but thanks to years of conditioning into accept his word as ultimate truth I just told him that wasn‚Äôt what I understood of our agreement but I would make it work anyway. 


Then he sent a message to my mom telling her his intentions and basically asking her to validate his choice : my mom earns a lot less than him and finds it completely unfair that she‚Äôd have to support me on her own, so she told me we should sue him because what he‚Äôs doing is illegal, and a judge would make him respect the divorce settlement.


So now I‚Äôm here, emotionally exhausted by this situation and by years of financial blackmail (it‚Äôs already getting long, so I can‚Äôt talk about everything). Basically, I see two options for me at this point: 


- either I send him a message telling him I‚Äôd like us to see the relevant legal authorities so they can say what‚Äôs our responsibilities and where his financial support can legally stop. But that means starting a legal operation, it won‚Äôt cost me anything but it will take time and he will take it as a declaration of war, so I‚Äôm exposing myself to his verbal abuse and manipulation at least until a judgment is delivered


- or I just choose to disengage completely, I take a student loan for next year, and I take this as an opportunity to go no contact for real. Part of me is just so tired of this, I want to end any ties with him, I know that whatever I choose he will see me as a gold-digger anyway. But that means that I will have to pay for a student loan while he‚Äôs legally obligated to support me. If I get a decent job right after I graduate, I‚Äôve calculated it will take me 5 to 8 years to reimburse my loan, and I‚Äôm afraid I will regret backing down and I‚Äôll be bitter to be stuck repaying a loan because I was too coward to make him fill his legal obligations.


What‚Äôs your opinion, what should I choose ?

My application in a nutshell:

* 524/4.0 at Ivy League studying Math and CS
* ORM, NY Resident
* 300 hours of research in computational chemistry lab, pending 2nd author paper (unfortunately might not be published before I apply)
* 500 hours part-time working as a medical assistant
* Summer internship at healthcare tech firm
* TA for theoretical CS course
* 100/50/150 hours clinical/school/community volunteering, clinical is unfortunately over the course of a summer
* 75 hours shadowing
* Unique ethnic instrument (some of my volunteering comes from this)
* Unique online language-based extracurricular

I'm aiming for research-intensive/T20, but I'm a little worried about my volunteering. I'm also thinking that it may be a red flag that all of my clinical experience/community service is all in my home state (I go to school close enough that I can go home often). 

Anybody have ideas on specific schools which may be more forgiving about my lack of superb volunteering, or especially like tech-heavy applicants? I've heard about Harvard HST and Stanford  (for CS-friendly), but I really have no clue (and those are definitely extremely competitive)."
atryfv,7,2019-02-23,Relationship is getting more turbulent but I‚Äôm (28F) so afraid to breakup with my SO (28) because I‚Äôm afraid of loneliness.,Dnkadjdnmd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/atryfv/relationship_is_getting_more_turbulent_but_im_28f/,"28F 28M (‚ÄúTom‚Äù) 1.5 years. We are both PhD students. 

My relationship with Tom has gotten very rough in the past few months, with daily arguments getting triggered by the slightest of things, and very poor conflict resolution between the two of us. Our relationship has had soaring highs; I‚Äôve never known such a relationship where I love someone so much but can get so exasperated by his passive aggressiveness and terrible communication skills. In any case, I‚Äôm finally forcing myself to face the facts that we are not compatible long term. 

This is where I‚Äôm not certain what to do. We are each other‚Äôs best friends, and we both have very few friends as we moved to this small city for our PhDs. Furthermore, our respective labs (we don‚Äôt work in the same department) are really isolated, so it‚Äôs been very difficult to make friends. I tried very hard to make friends for 1.5 years when I first moved here before meeting Tom, and am dreading the thought of long and incredibly lonely evenings.

 Lastly, as we are both grad students, we‚Äôre not just best friends, but confidants and study buddies. We help each other stay on track on work, career advice, how to deal with difficult supervisors, discuss research papers together, proofread and look over our work, keep each other staying focused and prodcutive, etc. it fills me with panic to think of losing this person because I would not only lose my love and emotional support, but the rock that keeps me holding onto this difficult PhD. If we broke up next week I think I would be incapable of doing even 10% of the workload I am shouldering right now, because I would be so emotionally devastated, and with several paper deadlines coming it would really jeopardize my standing with my supervisor. 

So I KNOW the right thing to do is to breakup when you realize there isn‚Äôt long term potential. And I feel ashamed to admit that I‚Äôm so afraid to break up, despite realizing this, because I‚Äôve come to depend on him on so many ways. I know the right thing to do is to wean off dependence and be more dependent again, but it scares me so much because I‚Äôm already so worn down. 

I haven‚Äôt been this frank with him, but I‚Äôm 99% certain that he feels this way as well. An additional thought I have thought of was to suggest breaking up in the summer, once this term is over, as we will be going on separate internships and will have more of a break to relax emotionally. But I feel scummy to suggest such a thing, and wonder if it‚Äôs ethically wrong to even think so. 

Please give me advice, encouragement, your stories, anything - I‚Äôm so desperate. 

Thank you. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm (28F) so afraid to breakup with my SO 29M of 1.5 years because he‚Äôs my best friend and emotional rock for my PhD "
atseuh,4,2019-02-23,My mid-transition partner might start at my workplace and I'm worried,sneakish-snek,mypartneristrans,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/atseuh/my_midtransition_partner_might_start_at_my/,"So there's a woman who works with my boss that I think my partner would get along with very well, and they are applying for a summer internship with her. The process is going very well and she's been really supportive so far. I think they have a really similar nerdy sensibility and she'd really appreciate their passion for chemistry since she's surrounded by biologists all day. And she's very kind and supportive which is a pretty rare find in the field of chemistry. I'd also be around to support them if they get anxious, which they will. And we only have one car so working in the same building would be very convenient. AND we've worked in the same lab when I was in college and it was great.

&amp;#x200B;

Our plan for internships/job apps is generally that they'll be in boy mode for interviews, and we're not sure about work yet. They aren't on hormones quite yet and they are very tall and broad shouldered so passing isn't really an option... They have long beautiful curls and carry themselves in a very feminine way so they don't give off ""man in a dress"" vibes at all, yet they will not be mistaken as a cis woman for a long time. Just being in boy mode the whole summer might be an option but it's not an ideal one. (This is really selfish, but I like them less when they're pretending to be a boy. I guess other people find it really charming, which is bizarre to me--boys are gross and pretending to be something you're not is super gross so it's a really grating combination. I obviously won't mention my personal preferences as we discuss it, I strongly suspect that pretending to be boyish indefinitely is a difficult notion for them as well.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Our problem is that my lab, like most academic labs, is a really conservative place situated in a really liberal institution. Official institution policy is aggressively pro-trans. A lot of the people I actually work with are 60-80 year old men. You see the dichotomy.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think bathroom stuff will be a problem. The building they'd be working in doesn't have gender-neutral bathrooms or those little ""all gender identities are welcome"" signs next to otherwise cis-ish bathrooms, but the adjacent building does. And the adjacent building also has a sweet free coffee/tea set up so I already do most of my peeing in there. I think they could adopt my ""peeing on the way to free coffee"" routine as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not worried about the PI they'll be working under. She's young for a PI, very sweet, and a woman in a very liberal city so it's hard to imagine her being especially transphobic. I'm more worried about the people I'll be working under... they've been in the lab dressed a little effeminately before and gotten a lot of stares. (Some of the stares might be from the kid tech bringing her ""boyfriend"" into the lab... but it's really circumstantial. If you promise pizza at a meeting and don't buy enough pizza to feed everyone ""boyfriends"" will be by with food. If you give me so much work I have to be here until creepy-ass hours to get it done ""boyfriends"" will be around to protect me, then slowly spend so much time here after hours that they get really awkwardly comfortable dropping by in the day time. That's just life.) Basically I don't think their boss would judge them for being a girl but my boss would judge me for being with a girl. We already have a problem where he respects me a good amount as a proto-scientist but very little as a person. I'm younger than and in some ways very similar to his kid, who lives at home and isn't allowed to date, so you can sometimes tell that my ""lifestyle"" bothers him. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'll already need to be a lot less affectionate than we've been if we're to work together which will already be a difficult conversation. (As the youngest person in the building I get these ""oh teenagers"" eye rolls when they drop by. I mean we've been sharing a tiny apartment for several years but whatever assume my relationships are frivolous and naive.) It's already hurt them when I've asked them to be less affectionate when bringing food by. And of course being near their little nose and not giving it kisses is a terrible burden. I also don't want to hurt their feelings more by making them think I'm ashamed of them. And of course we'll talk and I'll say I'm not ashamed of you and they'll know it in their mind but not in their heart. I can't even articulate all of the ways thinking about it makes me feel nervous and awful. "

how would you answer these questions ? 

* why pwc when u were from kpmg ?
   * can i say i want to try out all the different big 4s ?
* why internal audit over tax ? 
   * Is it okay if I were to reply , Tax Compliance deals with historical transactions however IA deals with the current predicament the firm is in . It helps make a difference to their current internal controls and also it is more rewarding when the tiny difference we make help the company to achieve their corporate goals .

atu995,229,2019-02-23,[D] Undergraduate student feeling completely overwhelmed,LazyLoo,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/atu995/d_undergraduate_student_feeling_completely/,"As an undergrad student with a math major that wants to pursue ML in grad school (preferably the top ones) I am feeling completely overwhelmed. I need to keep my grades and GPA high for grad school, am doing research with professors (cannot make much progress as I don't understand much of the deep learning foundations), doing side projects, applying to internships and preparing for interviews, and trying to learn as much as possible in the field. I am also trying to improve my coding skills as I lack some of the more foundational knowledge in OOP and OS and so forth since I don't have a CS major. It honestly seems impossible to balance all of this and I find myself staying up late at night stressing out and trying to cram as possible and it doesn't seem to be getting me any closer to my goals. In fact it is affecting my health and relationships. Maybe I am expecting too much of myself an undergraduate student? 

The major issue is just finding the goddamn time to learn the machine learning and deep learning content and keep up with what's going on while being a full time student. Much of my time is devoted towards classes so I really don't understand those undergrad students I find on LinkedIn who are interning at Google and stuff with insanely high GPAs and who already have multiple research papers and seem to already be experts in the field. Maybe I shouldn't be comparing myself to people like that? 

Meanwhile for me I read research papers and can't understand over 90% of what's going on in them. I read articles on specific ML topics and in those, there are another 100 things I don't understand so I end up opening another 50 tabs. Each night I close my laptop with at least 30 unread tabs of random things lol. Even half the posts and comments on this subreddit I cannot understand. Also, how am I even supposed to make any progress in my research if there's so much to understand and I don't have the time to?

So far I've gone through the coursera ML course, reviewed all the math necessary (the only thing I'm really confident in since I'm a math major lol), trying to brush up and improve my coding (don't know how necessary it is to learn C++ which I don't know), doing algorithms practice and leetcode for interviews, and I'm planning on going through the Goodfellow deep learning book. There's also David silver's reinforcement learning course I want to go through as it'll be helpful for any robotics internships. And after that I may go through the fast.ai course to get stronger at the applications aspect of ML. This is alongside classes and keeping my GPA high and doing as good a job I can with research for my professors. 

Honestly this post has been much longer than I thought and more of a rant, but maybe I just need some advice or someone to point me on the right track. Am I seriously overly rushing myself and having unrealistic expectations for an undergraduate student? Am I trying to do way too much at once?

TLDR: full time student finding it difficult to balance classes, research, internships, and everything else while learning ML from scratch and looking for advice

Edit: Thank you so much for all the advice and encouragement! I'll read the comments more thoroughly and reply individually when I have the time üòä"

atuw48,2,2019-02-23,Me (21M) and my girlfriend (21F) are having major trust issues while studying abroad,SubjectDirector,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuw48/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_21f_are_having_major/,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep it short! 

&amp;#x200B;

Me \[21M\] and my girlfriend \[21F\] have moved to different countries for studies (she left in januari, I left in february) for \~4 months (she moved to study abroad for a semester, and I moved for an internship). It's been hell.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic issue is that there are trust issues. At the start of our relationship, I had a night out that resulted in me cheating (kissing) on her. She decided to stay with me, and we've been building on our relationship eversince. Until we parted, it had been going great. We have plans to move together after we get back, and I can honestly say that I have never been as in love with someone before.

She is very outgoing, and participates in a lot of fun activities. I think this is great. Ofcourse, sometimes I get worried but I think that's normal. I have been here for two weeks now, and she has said that she ""can't handle it"" if I go out, meet other girls or meet a group of people which might include girls. She says she would quit the relationship because she wouldn't be able to handle it.

I've told her multiple times that I think it is very unfair that she expects me to make no friends while abroad while she, herself, has been very outgoing and befriending lots of people (guys and girls) and going out with them. We've had some heated arguments about it. When we are having an argument, she gets mad if I say she forbids me from going out and she often tells me I play the ""victim card"" a lot.

I am always the one to try and fix the fight we're having. She often gets mad and hangs up on me, and I feel like she expects me to chase her. 

I have been in a really bad state of mind because of this, and I feel like I don't enjoy the opportunity I've been giving. I feel very isolated and alone, and I get uncertain about everything. I feel pretty depressed and I haven't went out to meet new people. 

I really want to have fun here, and I really want to make friends. I am not the most extroverted person, so making friends is hard enough: and now, it is impossible.

I do not want to get out of this relationship, because I really do love her and I am so happy when we're together. I am however very afraid that we won't make it. She is due to visit me in March, but I am afraid we won't make that either.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Am I in a toxic relationship, or is this normal regarding the situation? I really need some advice about what to do now.."
atv7cj,9,2019-02-23,Lack of termination notice,xiaochenshu,humanresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/atv7cj/lack_of_termination_notice/,"Hi all,

Have you ever had an executive deny signature on a notice of termination? I'm in a state (NY) that requires the company to give this notice.

We had an intern at the company that we decided to not transition to full-time employee. His manager had an in-person meeting with him about 1,5 weeks ago about this. Yesterday was his last day and I prepared a notice of termination. However, the CEO didn't want to sign it because it's a bad look for the company to terminate someone and harsh for the intern to receive a letter like this.

For full disclosure, this notice has never been given to past interns, as the company wasn't aware of the law (they thought we only have to give noticed to fired employees).

But moving forward I want to make sure our company is compliant. The interns' last day was yesterday (had an exit meeting with him, he's a great kid), the executive never signed the notice and I'm sitting here upset and confused as to what should I do about this. 

Any thoughts?"
atv8xa,6,2019-02-23,Limerick internship - pay vs. cost of living,Ov3rpowered,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/atv8xa/limerick_internship_pay_vs_cost_of_living/,"Hello,

I am a student from the Czech republic and I accepted an offer for a 1 year long internship at a tech company in Limerick (Raheen Industrial park) starting in July. The company is going to pay me 400 EUR/week and I'm going to get 660 EUR/month tax free from Erasmus+ programme. This should amount to cca 2230 EUR/month **net** income.

I've been wondering how much should I expect to spend in Limerick, especially related to rent. At first I thought that I could even save a nice amount, but it looks like there is a housing crisis in Ireland and it may be impossible to live on your own in Limerick without spending more than 1k. I would prefer to live alone as a bad roommate can really ruin your life but is it even possible? There are few offers online in general (based on daft) and most of them are only 1-3 days old as I guess people snag them super fast. I am also afraid that being a foreigner is going to make my chances worse as I won't have any references. I would love to live in or close to Raheen due to work location but it seems like there are &gt;1500 EUR/mo 3+ bedroom houses only. Would it be worth it to look at real estate agents at all when I get there or is daft the only reasonable way to rent a cheap-ish apartment?

Also, how much should I expect to spend on other stuff like groceries, bills, transportation, private health insurance (apparently you guys have to pay for everything health wise which is terrifying to me) etc.? Cost of living websites suggest roughly 800 EUR/mo. Is it accurate?  


Thank you very much for any help. Its going to be my first time living in a foreign country and it all seems quite daunting.

atvndx,211,2019-02-23,AITA for believing this girl working as a dancer was really into me? I'm crushed and my friends are being so harsh I'd like a neutral opinion.,Areallydumbass,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/atvndx/aita_for_believing_this_girl_working_as_a_dancer/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Background: two weeks ago I found out my girlfriend of 5 years has been cheating on me with her much older supervisor. It is devastating because I'm getting my masters in engineering, have a job lined up at an almost Fortune 500 company, I'm in good shape and decent looking and she's been fucking the out of shape alcoholic manager at Applebee's. My self esteem is shit right now.

My friends decided to take me to a strip club last night and I was finally having a good time. I really likes one dancer and my friends bought me a couple of table dances with her. She asked if I wanted to go VIP and I told her I didn't have much money. She said don't worry about that my friends told her I was having a hard time with a break up and she just wanted to chill anyways. So we wend back to an essentially private area. She danced for me and I gave her the $100 I had but after that we just sat and talked for maybe 30 minutes and then she kissed me and we made out for maybe like 45 minutes. When she first kissed me I told her I didn't have any more money and she told me to paraphrase ""I'm a 20 year old college girl, I like to kiss cute boys."" It was an incredible experience and it felt amazing to just not think about my ex for a few hours. 

The club was closing and I asked her if I could see her again, she said she had to change and I should wait for her in the parking lot. My friends told me she was just messing with me and all left. I waited for about an hour and she never came out. Using some stuff she told me I was able to triangulate her Instagram and tried to send her a message. She instantly blocked me.

I got an uber and met my friends at Waffle House and they are being so harsh saying that she wasn't really into me and I told them I didn't give her that much money and what she said about me being cute. They say that she was like a drug dealer and offering me the first ""hit"" for cheap to keep me coming back where I'll start spending real money and maybe even she was a prostitute and that's why she blocked me oh instragram and why she never came out. Basically they say she played me like an asshole. I want to go back tonight and try to explain to her I'm not a creep and I just had a nice time. My friends say I'd be a real asshole then as she'd call the cops on me or worse see me as a sad puppy dog with a well paying internship and want to bleed me dry. 

I've been through so much turmoil over the past few weeks I don't even know which way is up so am I the asshole? "

atw9yr,103,2019-02-23,I need help and advise on something I did as a stupid 19 year old that is about to be exposed and derail my life.,peach-n-cream,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/atw9yr/i_need_help_and_advise_on_something_i_did_as_a/,"It‚Äôs truly a long story that I can‚Äôt give too much detail without being exposed (which may be happening anyways). 

When I was 19 (female) I went on a mission and loved it. Met a specific member who I felt I connected with because of our likeness in bumpy past and family drama. This member was old enough to be a parent. I felt that the connection between us was that and the attention was nice since I had no parents back home. 

After my mission I ended up applying for internships in different states - one of which was my mission state and got into a internship at a university close to this member who made me feel loved and special and who I looked at like a parental figure. This member and their spouse offered me their home while I went to school to save on expenses. I accepted and was immediately brought in as one of the family. 

It wasn‚Äôt long until I learned how dysfunctional this family was. That there was historical lying, sexual abuse, and straight up manipulation. This was hard for me to process since this family had been picture perfect to me on my mission. 

Anyways this member that I was particularly close with and I began to get closer. It confused me because the entire time I was on my mission it felt parental (which I have not had any parental relationships so it was a guess). But I quickly noticed that it was more than that and I was sexually attracted to this member and this member likely was to me too. 

It turned into a full blown affair. At first it was nice. The attention, affection and love. But it quickly caused me to spiral. I lived in their home the duration of my internship and a year after in this relationship with a married person who I was in a emotion and physical affair with. I was so innocent before and it killed me to no longer be. I ended up attempting suicide and going to a psychiatric hospital for the guilt, shame and emotional turmoil from this relationship.  

It took everything I had to leave this relationship, the church and the family I thought was going to be mine. I have remained in contact with the member and their family. I served in their area. I have many people whom I love in that area. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve been away for a year and a half. This member told me that they were going to confess about our sexual and emotional affair. To their spouse, children and bishop.  Going to expose ‚Äúwhat we did so Christ can heal them.‚Äù 

I am just now getting my life together after this horrible thing I did. I am just now getting to have thoughts of ‚Äúomg I didn‚Äôt think about killing my self today‚Äù. I am just now getting the courage to be myself and leave the thought of Mormonism behind. 

I‚Äôm terrified and don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel that this members confession will cause me to spiral, result in a lot of public hate and ruin my reputation. All of which I may deserve.

1. *The slutty-moan worthy attraction of primal fucking.*

2. *The fun power-reversal dynamics of being owned by an animal.*

3. ... *Fuck it, knots are pretty hot too...*

*Anyway, without further dallying, the prompt:*

---

No one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*"

Looking for a JO bud but something with some long term substance that includes both sexual and non-sexual talk. Someone to sext with and cum together and eventually know each other's kinks and what not to make cumming that much better. If you're gay, bi or straight it all works! Just as long as we can make each other cum and enjoy each other's company! We can talk about fantasies, girls we find hot and find new ways to make each other cum

If you have a girlfriend you want to include we can do that too! Bonus if there's footage for us to enjoy but this isn't mandatory. We can see whether the new intern is into you or not. Let's also talk about your day and other non-sexual things and hopefully that makes the experience all the better! If you can be horny as ever but also know how to have a conversation then let's give this a try!

I'm 27. round asses and athletic girls are my favourite kinks. Tits, blowjobs, cum, fingering, threesomes and squirting are up there too. Anacheri, Kim K, Kylie Jenner, Stella Maxwell and Gemma Arterton are a few named named interests! But feel free to convince why another girl you love should be worth the cum. PM for me more details if you're interested and let me know a little bit about yourself and what you're into! Please read the whole post and get back to me, I'd prefer a message longer than a couple of words! Thanks!"

They say that college is the best 4 years of your life, but as a freshman, it feels like the opposite to me. People like to sell this idea that you're free to whatever you want here without any restrictions and that you're supposed to have a great time with your friends, but I always find myself stuck in my room or at the library trying to finish my assignments or study for an exam. Perhaps it might just be my strong work ethic that I've obtained since GMOW in high school. I've always liked to look at things in the long term, and to tell myself that the hard work that I do now will eventually pay off in 4-8 years. For my first year of college, I've taken close to the max possible credits I'm allowed to do per semester, as this will allow me to take more advanced computer science courses sooner, making me a more attractive prospective intern for top tier companies. I've always been in love with the computer and software world so in a way I do feel at home here considering some of the classes and clubs I'm currently a part of. When I want a short break from coursework, I usually give myself some side programming projects to work on (currently working on a DIY Raspberry Pi IoT solution to save myself some money from buying overpriced solutions from outside). However, last semester, the classes I took were extremely rigorous, and that in combination with the number of classes I was taking as well as transitioning into college resulted in me receiving a lower than expected GPA. Initially in the semester I had made time to hang out with friends and have fun and all that good stuff. However, I was already beginning to cut that down as the semester went on. To make things even harder, I promised to myself that I would achieve a 4.0 GPA this semester to make up for the bad grades I received in some of my classes last semester, so this would mean that I would get zero time for socialization or any other fun. So far I feel like I'm on track with my goal as my test and assignment scores have been pretty good. However, I see my friends having a great time on Friday nights while I'm stuck in my room not being able to understand jackshit because my ADHD distracts the fuck out of me everytime I hear a voice or a footstep in the hallway or when I get a notification on my phone. I understand that my work will pay off in the long term, but it sometimes discourages me to see everyone else having fun, some of whom have a similar schedule to mine and seem to be on top of things. Sometimes I make the mistake of questioning myself, ""is all my work and reclusiveness really worth it?"" Any tips on how to stop worrying about others and focus more on worrying about myself? Do these 4 years really matter much or does it get better after this?

Melina talked about it a lot in 2016 as well, she deleted lots of stuff as she wanted to move on and not be linked to ""any of this"".

Anyway, Meliners are not just sippers and teens, lots in this fandom are coders, and there have been discussions lately as shady stuff are happening again.

Melina talked about the harassment from 2015/2016 in long detailed podcasts late 2016 (to which Mr Purple answered ""I will be your hero"", btw !!! üòªüòªüòª But this is not today's topic, haha...).

Long story short, Melina mentioned back then that they know what she is watching, reading and if she watches a youtuber too many times, they will often be asked to say nasty stuff about her or even dox her. (Also, Melina also said that among the people sent to her IRL to harass her (see her recent video), there were people telling her to watch some youtubers or younowers as they ""had a message for her"", ""or else"", one time it even involved showing footage of Mr Purple ""having fun alone""....which they told Meliners to watch as well on social media (early 2016, Younow).

Anyway, this fandom have been complaining about stuff that happened on Twitter lately, if we stan someone, shady stuff happen, we're  doxxed, harassers know we are stanning and do  stuff. This is...not even legal, especially since the GDPR. At the moment, everybody is deserting.

According to coders, it's not surprising they're able to know what we browse, post on there, edit and stuff, when we're logged in. How they do that when not logged in (youtube) has people divided. (IP ? Unique Windows serial number ? Other ?).

This has been called out A LOT since 2016. These past days, several harassing accounts on Twitter, who keep posting about CP, (Leafy+the Witney girl AND still stirring crap about Baby Raccoon, who is now 18, but like, they've been doing this since 2016, even using ship name of him and Melina as usernames again !!!! Ffs !!! For some reason, they're trying to involve the UMG singer again, but like all the time now, that's weird, we not even stanning her at all ???!!!).

Anyway, those accounts started to dox Mr Purple, Melina and also other people who were stanning (I mean, so many people were doxxed by those accounts before, and on Youtube and Younow, we know who it's about, and let's be honest, everybody is stanning drama and stuff like these, so we get why they were stanning, haha... This is messed up.)

Creepy stuff happened on FB too, but like, we don't really care, even if it was literal doxxing of Melina in 2015, involving quoting her PRIVATE CONVO WITH HER FRIEND ABOUT HOW MS ARE LOSERS by a youtuber on Twitter, stolen pics (not from FB, either from her computer or from the MS webcam Melina sent back because ""she doesn't want to use their crap ever again"", and stuff. With all the news and stuff recently, we get the idea of what happened, they literally reported about MS having access to convos and everything.

It seems organized. I mean, it always gravitates around Youtube.... Someone gets the info of what we stanning, EVEN IF WE STANNING ON TWITTER, and it always ends up with youtubers doxxing either on youtube or twitter... Been like that since 2015.

There was something like that going on on Reddit a while ago, we reported it, doesn't seem to happen anymore. We even learned stuff about lots of people, as there was doxxing involved. This is scary. According to coders, those harassers could literally post anything on any accounts, have us muted for everybody, even for social media staffers/admins, have people see something, while others see something else, use a single line of code to auto-replace words with others, but not for everybody. Melina talked about stuff like that before. And the admin of Reddit posted some stuff too.

We need to take screenshots and post them when stuff happen to make sure everybody is seeing the same stuff. This is insane !

Also, we are wondering, since we know the MS-linked creepy person who harassed us on Twitter and r/leafyishere managed to have someone tweak youtube algorithm to have a very old video where Leafy insulted them on top search result after we told them off... No wonder we always seem to stumble on certain videos all the time. What Melina said in 2016. We also stan YT subreddit A LOT, and coders commented on stuff, but we not sure what it means... Stuff about watch history.

Melina also said in 2016 ""I like checking social media, it's like an internship for me, a real case scenario of what could go wrong"".

Well, Melina said in ""Nope"" and later that they're not making Meovely for now, even if the website was basically finished. She explained why (the reasons were not hacking and harassment, even if the SSL certificate was ruined at some point, which prompted Melina to change of host/hosting country altogether, and Mr Purple to troll her when Melina asked if anybody had coupons/referral links before picking a new host company, because Melvin are couple goals and troll each other all the time üòªüòªüòª)

Speaking of which, everybody can easily guess who's stanning who thanks to those harassers and the doxxing they're doing all the time... (Or those subtweets/passive aggressive hints they leave). It's been largely proven that Mr Purple himself been stanning Melina before... And stuff... About lots of people... ü§´ü§´ü§´

Anyway, be careful, because on top of that, there was also hacking which involved JS injection and internet boxes or other hardware (see Mr Purple's video, he was stanning too that time, obviously) to be damaged. We're not accusing anyone, but it happened when we criticized MS UK. Every time. Coincidences, surely.

Now the big question is, do those harassers have access to admin accounts ? why they linked to youtubers ? or are they hackers ? but why they linked to youtubers and have them say or tweet whatever all the time ?

We'll be stanning tbh. They're so ""in your face"" every time we log in anyway, haha, thanks for the mouse, I guess."

He went on a date with this girl and I guess it didn‚Äôt work out. He dated a bit and then we met. They had an internship with the same company, they began working on a project together. He could have chosen someone else but he chose her. However, I later found out that he did have a choice. I told him that then working together alone and for long hours made me uncomfortable. He said, trust me. For months, I did, but their interactions were so iffy to me. But he said to trust him, that he loved me, that I was the love of his life. A few months later, Something happened (I don‚Äôt remember what) but he broke up with me. Less than a week after the break up, He wrote me an email saying ‚Äúyou were so nasty but I stayed hoping you would change. I liked you better when you were submissive. I was unhappy and I told you I was. And she made me feel things you never did. I began thinking about her, I didn‚Äôt do anything with her, but I desired her and kept thinking of her. Now that we broke up, I hung out with her and other friends. She asked me for a ride home. I drove her home, we kissed and I asked her to date me. You caused all this. You see I‚Äôm so desperate to be happy and I want to forget you, you caused this.‚Äù

I think back to this moment. I hate that I never looked nor desire another man. My lips and body have only belonged to him. I hate how loyal I was to him. My stupid loyalty brought me nothing but pain, abuse and betrayal. 

This thing, where he feels unhappy and continues to be engaged with me, and yet he flirts and cheats somehow it‚Äôs always my fault because I don‚Äôt make him happy. 

He told me that watching me leave many times has hurt him. And i think to myself, why did I leave? there were many times when I left him. And if my memory is correct, it came because he kicked me out. His favorite line was ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it, get the fuck out bitch‚Äù. Once he threatened to burn my stuff if I didn‚Äôt get out. Once I stood up for myself, and said I‚Äôm tired of you kicking me out, I pay rent every month. I have a right to be here. That angered him more. And he began yelling about everything that he didn‚Äôt like about me and why he hated me. I looked at him and said why do you say such hurtful things to me, he looked straight in my face and said ‚Äúbecause you deserve it, and deserve to be treated like a bitch‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúI deserve being insulted, cursed at, yelled at and kicked out of my home, simply because during dinner you told me ‚ÄúI said I shouldn‚Äôt call you a bitch, now get over it‚Äù and I tried to get over it but I was still hurt and not as communicative and that enraged you?‚Äù He said ‚Äúyou are so fucking entitled bitch and I will teach you to fucking respect me. No one does hurts me and and gets alway with it. And know that I will do this again, because You deserve to be treated this way. I walked to my closet. Began packing my some stuff and he was now spitting fire. He tore me to pieces saying hurtful things about my past and using personal insecurities and family issues against me. I pretty much ran out of there. 

And truthfully, I‚Äôm not sure how to explain this, but my body and specifically my soul, feel tired of not having a place to call home. I was with him for 3 years. He kicked me out so often, that I felt no place was really my home. That I had to be prepared to leave if he kicked me out. I was pregnant and he kicked me out. I feel like I need a place to rest my body and not just my soul. I feel homeless. Why was this one of his go to moves?? Why was I the one that had to run with my tail between my legs??

After, not just this but so much more abuse, why do I still hurt knowing He moved on after only 3 weeks of our separation. Why does it hurt knowing he is mad at me and blames me for this break up. Why can I logically comprehend that even though I was never perfect, I didn‚Äôt deserve any of his treatment. Why do I wonder if I caused him to cheat or hurt me?

This week has been mostly bad. I‚Äôve had some hours where I feel ok and I‚Äôm able to do things. But most of the time I fear that as time passes by, we are becoming more distant and a potential reconciliation is less and less possible. 

See! I‚Äôm going crazy!! He moved on with the girl he told me not to worry about. He abused me and somehow I‚Äôm still hoping for a reconciliation???? What is wrong with me.

atyrut,4300,2019-02-23,Just because your gay doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt date my daughter.,Maragirl,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/atyrut/just_because_your_gay_doesnt_mean_you_cant_date/,"Obviously M - me, EM - entitled mom, but EK - equals embarrassed older sister around 18-19 years old and CK - confused (8/9?) year old kid. 

I am bisexual, and my bf and I were on a date. I was 21 at the time, and we had gone to a mildly fancy restaurant (as we were poor college kids) for my bf‚Äôs 22 cake day. We had a great time and were just eating our dinner. He got a call from a lab he wanted to do an internship with and had to excuse himself to talk logistics. 

I‚Äôm sitting by myself when I notice the EM and her kids come in. This isn‚Äôt the place where kids are out of the ordinary but it was a little late so it peaked my interest. I am on my phone now, looking at those r/dankmemes because I live in the 21st century, when I notice they family sits down pretty close to us. This isn‚Äôt that weird as the place was pretty full, but what was weird is that the EK was staring at me. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time, but looking back I realize my bf wasn‚Äôt ever at the table with me when they saw me. I turn and wave to the EK and the blush and loom away. This was pretty weird but I wasn‚Äôt really giving it much thought. I notice EK is whispering to EM but I figure she may know me from somewhere. I am kind of eaves dropping at this point and I hear the EM say then go ask. I figure she will ask where she knows me from or something but when she walks over she says ‚ÄúI noticed you when we walked in and I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies after this?‚Äù I thought this was strange but then realized she must not have known about my bf. 

M - Sorry, I would but I have plans with my date after this. Maybe we could hang out another time though? 

I understand how hard it can be to ask someone out and I didn‚Äôt want to be rude her as she was obviously already embarrassed. 

EK - okay, my number is (blank)

M - cool

I go back to minding my own business and don‚Äôt think about what happened. I then noticed that the EM was staring daggers at me. Her look would be against the Geneva Accords it looks could kill. I wave at her to try to lighten the tension. 

Wrong move. Very wrong move. 

She stands up, walks over to me sitting alone and asks ‚Äú why the hell did you reject my daughter. She is obviously very pretty and she is a good kid too. She has a straight 4.0 in her classes. I can‚Äôt believe people like you.‚Äù 

Well she wasted no time getting angry. 

Now, her voice was pretty loud and causing a bit of a scene. I have ADHD and get really bad with my temper sometimes, so I am trying to stay calm. 

M - Excuse mrs, I am sorry for turning down your daughter. I agree she is attractive bu-

EM - If you think she is good looking why don‚Äôt you take her out?

M - because I am on a date right now. 

EM - Oh, so when you said she was pretty I bet you were already thinking of a threesome, you preferred fuck!

EK - mom stop

EM (to EK) - be quite honey while I deal with this rude piece of shit. 

EK turned her head and mouth I‚Äôm sorry. I felt bad for her but I also was pretty pissed now. She just called me a pervert in front of an entire restaurant, she practically yelled it. This is when CK pipes up.

CK - mommy when are we gonna eat?

EM - once this gentleman‚Äôs date gets back. 

The 180 she did from wanting to send me to hell to her speaking to CL as if he was the holy one himself was honestly impressive. 

M - Can I please enjoy my meal and you stop bothering me? 

Now I said this in a pretty rude tone because I am mad now. That is when my bf came back though, so that made me feel everything was going to be okay as she would go back to her table. 

Once again I was wrong. 

Bf - *sits down*

EM - where is your date then? 

I was at a table of two so obviously he was here. It surprises me how dumb people are. 

Bf - I am his date. What are you doing?

EM stares at the both of us with the most appalled face ever, as if she couldn‚Äôt believe same sex couples were a thing. 

EM - WHAT!

CK - is that your date?

At this point EK left to the bathroom once my bf sat down. She didn‚Äôt want to deal with her mother anymore. 

M - yeah buddy. That‚Äôs my date. 

CK - but what one is the girl?

I understand people not getting gays while they are young so I started to explain. 

M - we are both guys. We lo-

EM (screaming in my ears) - don‚Äôt prison my son with the dangers of homosexuality! You faggot!

What the actual fuck woman. 

M - what?

EM - don‚Äôt tell my son that! I don‚Äôt want him to turn into a creature like you!

I am seeing red now. They have way crossed the line. So I turn to the more sensible one and say. 

M - just remember little guy, your mother will hate you forever if you chose to love who you want. 

EM has officially lost it. My response was rude, but she straight up slaps me and yells ‚Äústop talking to my son!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what it is with entitled parents but they sure seem to hate homosexuals or anybody from LGBTQ. 

All because I said no to a date. 

She is really going off now and I am doing everything in my power not to chuck here out the window. I am very very pissed now but I try to stay in check. 

In all here rambling I pick up probably my number one nomination for dumbest quote of the year ‚ÄúJust because you are gay doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt date my daughter‚Äù

Really?

Anyways, the manager comes and removes her and CK (EK is still in the bathroom but she leaves after) from the restaurant for causing so many problems. My bf and I both get a large desert on the house for the crap we dealt with. It was very pollute of them because our night was ruined. We went back to our apartment and celebrated the rest of my bf‚Äôs birthday and ended up having a laugh over what happened. The night wasn‚Äôt completely ruined but it was still a pain in the ass.

I still have EK‚Äôs number and we all hang out together. 

Moral of the story, don‚Äôt be a fucking idiot or you will be made fun of on the internet. "

I have never posted anything on reddit before but I have this issue that I don't want to discuss with people I know. I have talked about it with my partner, but I think about this every day, and I don't know what to do. If you have any suggestions or similar experiences, please share. I might learn a thing or two.

My mother (F54) and my older brother (M35) are both very financially irresponsible. They live together in a rented apartment with my younger brother (18). They usually ask for help when it comes to their utility bills and rent. They never ask me to give them money, but they always want to borrow from me to cover their expenses. Sometimes, it's very difficult for me to get that money back. Even when I made only $10/hr and had more bills of my own, I was the one who had to lend them money all the time. I even took out a loan in my own name for the down payment of their apartment (I lived there for 2 years).  They still haven't paid me fully for the loan. The payment was withdrawn from my account every month, and many months, they ignored me when I would ask for their contributions. I ended up paying off the loan on my own. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for helping others, but I hate that I have to help them when it's their fault that their bills aren't paid on time. They pile on those credit card debts, and use their money on useless shit. I refuse to help you when I see where your money is going. If you were struggling and not wasting your money, I'd be more sympathetic. At the end of the day, we're all poor!!!

Last year, in January, my mom got a job with some solar energy company, where she was making $18/hr and often worked overtime. I offered to guide her so she can make better financial decisions. She was to send $500 to my account every 2 weeks. Knowing how weak she was, that was the best way for her to save. She only has the 3 of us so the only person she has to care for financially is my younger brother. The plan was for her to pay off her 2 credit cards (one of which was nearly $2000 because my older brother used the card for his business and had this dumb party on Thanksgiving the year before!) and also save money for a down payment to buy a home. In December, she got laid off because the job ended. Guess what? She did not save one cent! She only made 2 transfers to my account, but took the money back little by little. We had started paying off her credit cards. I guess things were looking too good, so she went and spent more money from said credit card, and opened a new one. What a joke! And guess what? My older brother got a hold of the new card and did some shopping of his own as well. Not only is she out of a job now, she also has 3 credit cards! On the other hand, 2018 was a tough year for me, but it was worth it. I worked 3 jobs, while getting my Bachelor's (I graduated in December) and managed to save $12000 (I started saving around September 2017). One of those jobs was an internship and in September, they hired me full-time. I quit one of my jobs, and worked 2 jobs up until this month. Why do I work so hard? I have student loans of about $14000. I would very much like to pay that off in full next month. This morning, my mother messaged me to let me know that she is being evicted. I should add that she hasn't worked since she got laid off in December. Now she needs my help to avoid eviction. She had the audacity to tell me that she knows that I have money saved. I never once told her how much I have saved. She told me that she knows I have money somewhere because I usually have my  bill money ready before the bill comes. she figures I must have some car insurance or car loan money just sitting in my bank account. To be honest, those bills are already paid for since they're due at the beginning of the month and I pay my bills automatically. What the fuck am I to do? I refuse to lend her rent money from my savings that I will need next month. On one hand, I feel selfish and I feel like a bitch. On another, I don't give a shit because I worked extremely hard for this money. Some days, I would work from 6:00 am - 9:00 pm. Why do you deserve this money??? I was still making less than you even though I had 3 jobs! I currently run my household the same way I handle my personal expenses. My bf and I bought a condo, which we moved into last month. We have a joint account where we put money in every month to cover our common expenses, from the mortgage to food, and I have the bills set up to be paid automatically of course. Why should I let you borrow my mortgage money or the money I have saved to pay off my student loans. Part of me is feeling shitty to think that they might be in the streets. Another part of me feels that they deserve it for being so irresponsible. They should get evicted so they can learn their lesson. My mother owes me $400, not including her contribution for the down payment loan that was not collected. She also owes my bf around $130 because the electricity was turned off last month. My older brother owes me his contribution for that down payment loan. Collectively, they owe my bf $900 for a flight that he paid for me because of them.  It's not the first time that they have received an eviction notice. I'm not asking for your permission to help them because I will not help this time. I'd like to know what you think about this situation. What would you do if you were me? "

atz3pk,7,2019-02-23,CF SNF Offers,curlyslp,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/atz3pk/cf_snf_offers/,"I am graduating in May and have been offered two full-time CF positions at two different SNFs and am having trouble deciding which offer to accept. 

&amp;#x200B;

Offer 1: SNF company is one of the largest in the state. They have multiple facilities in my city so if census is low I can travel to a different site to make a full day. Pay rate is lower than expected but doable if I work 35 hours a week with a slight raise once I get my CCCs. My supervisor will be in the same building as me as well as another CF. The facility is really nice and rather new. However it is 25 miles from my house but it is in a major city. I have had an internship with this company (but at a different facility) and have really enjoyed my experience and have a good understanding of how things are done here. I haven't had any issues with ethics and area director is a SLP so she understands what we go through and approves of FEEs and/or MBS when necessary. Productivity is set at 85%. 

&amp;#x200B;

Offer 2: SNF company is rather new but owned by a SLP. The SNF facility that I would work at is 24 miles from my home however it is in a rural town. The SNF company only has one other facility near me but it's over an hour away so if census is low, I'm not sure what will happen. We are still negotiating pay but the pay is much higher than offer 1 ($15,000 a year more) with benefits such as CEU reimbursement and they pay for basic health insurance. I would be the only SLP at that location. My supervisor would be part-time/PRN and travels to different sites however would be available to me via phone. The facility is kind of run down and they don't have much material for me to work with (they just recently acquired this facility and said renovations will happen soon) so I would more than likely need to provide my own. I was told productivity is 85-90%. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping to meet potential supervisors at both facility's soon but they didn't give me much time to make a decision. I like offer 1 because it won't be so unfamiliar to me, my supervisor would be on site and there will be another CF going through the experience with me and the facility is so nice. I obviously like offer 2 because of the higher pay rate but am nervous about working for a company I don't know much about (especially after hearing SNF horror stories) with higher productivity rates and the facility is really rundown.

atzg1u,1,2019-02-23,[Advice] How should I [20F] bring this up to my boyfriend [23M]?,throwaway16657621375,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/atzg1u/advice_how_should_i_20f_bring_this_up_to_my/,"Hello all, I'm just looking for some advice on how I should go about asking my boyfriend about moving in? TL;DR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been dating for about 5 months. We would not be moving in any time soon and it wouldn't happen until we have at least been dating for 1 year (which is something we both discussed and feel comfortable with). However, my boyfriend - I'll call him 'Joe,' is in the military and is about to join reg force, as he is currently in reserves. Once his transfer goes through, he will be sent off for any additional training, and come back. When he comes back, he will be given 5 weeks to find a new place and move out on his own, as he cannot live with his family. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has brought it up in passing that he would like me to move in with him when he gets his new place (by the time he gets his new place, we will have been dating for a year or more), but we haven't had a real sit-down talk about the actual plan. Because his transfer hasn't officially gone through, he has no idea when he will be sent for training and when he will return; therefore, he has no concrete idea of when he would be moving into his new place. The latest he will receive this information is May of this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where my dilemma is: my lease for my apartment is ending at the end of June. From June to the end of August, I will be on an internship in England, and I will resume university/my job in September. The places that I have looked do not offer month-to-month rentals, and I am looking at at least a 6 month-11 month contracts; however, it is more likely that I will have to take the 11 month contract as they do not like giving out 6 month contracts (I have contacted them already about this). That means that I would have to resign my lease middle of June before I leave the country, and it would go until May of 2020. I also cannot get out of my lease, or else I would have to keep paying rent until my contract is done, so signing and leaving is not an option. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do I ask him in a more serious, sit-down manner, if he really does want me to move in with him when he returns from training? The reason being, is that if he does want me to (as he has previously stated, albeit in casual conversation), then that would change what kind of contract/place I need to get for next year, and I would need to decide at the latest before I leave in June. By May at the latest, he will have all his dates given to him once his transfer goes through, and I can better determine how long I need my contracts to be, if he does want me to move in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that we have only been dating for a short period of time, and that is why I am hesitant to straight up ask him, even if this is concerning matters months from now. I do not want to scare him away. How can I word this without being too intense? I wouldn't even be asking this soon if I didn't have the matters of my own lease and agreements to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My lease is up in June and I would likely have to resign for an 11 month contract (if I'm lucky I can get a 6 month contract). Boyfriend has mentioned in casual conversation he wants me to move in with him when he comes back from training in the fall. How do I ask him if he wants in a serious conversation if he wants me to move in with him in a couple of months without it being weird? I have to ask because of my lease and the inability to leave contract without severe financial repercussions. "

TL;DR: My lease is up in June and I would likely have to resign for an 11 month contract (if I'm lucky I can get a 6 month contract). Boyfriend has mentioned in casual conversation he wants me to move in with him when he comes back from training in the fall. How do I ask him if he wants in a serious conversation if he wants me to move in with him in a couple of months without it being weird? I have to ask because of my lease and the inability to leave contract without severe financial repercussions."

Topic : Feelings of Inferiority,HelpMyWeinerAndMe,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/au0aba/goal_of_post_unloading_and_receiving_myriads_of/,"Summary of Inferiority
I think about all of this everyday, deal with this too often and am reminded of it frequently because of ‚Äútriggers‚Äù. And I‚Äôm tired of it. Trying to navigate them, understand them are just as stressful as the feelings and circumstances are themselves. I don‚Äôt even know what a solution or coping looks like... Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don‚Äôt like what I see. I am ugly. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there‚Äôs no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don‚Äôt like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I‚Äôm this way, I‚Äôm super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I don‚Äôt like being associated with this ugly. I don‚Äôt like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It‚Äôs like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever.  I‚Äôm tired of being beneath others and not good enough.  There are times when I don‚Äôt even want to go outside because of the way I look. It‚Äôs painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can‚Äôt let being ugly take over. There‚Äôs no solution to this. I just have to deal with it. Many people don‚Äôt have to deal with this at all, so they don‚Äôt have the solution for it or need a solution. I‚Äôm tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I‚Äôm not ugly. They only say that because there‚Äôs nothing else they can do or say to people when they‚Äôre ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I‚Äôm dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out in some of the most heinous ways possible but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.

I feel uncomfortable around attractive people. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don‚Äôt have much experience socializing or getting to know an attractive person (since most don‚Äôt want anything to do with ugly people since often times, ugly looks devalue us in society and functions almost like class). I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their good looks alone. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. I also feel down and angry upon seeing them, knowing that I‚Äôll never be good enough for them romantically or sometimes socially because of my looks (even though looks aren‚Äôt the only thing that define me). And of course I envy them too. For their looks, for the privileges that come with looks (there are so many of them as looks and the idea of sex really baits people. Self confidence, status, being treated nicer, luxury of love and relationships and using their looks to advance in life to acquire wealth, more status/popularity, etc.) and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at finding love. I also feel hatred. I hate ones that use their looks to their advantage on purpose. I also hate ones that are really confident in their looks and kind of flaunt it or come off as conceited. It's like a mockery to me. Even seeing them smile sometimes feels like a mockery to me. It's rare that someone would actually mock me, but it just feels that way. Seeing these people is a trigger within itself. That gets me angry, on top of the hatred and sadness I have to deal with by looking the way I do and therefore not being good enough socially or romantically. I just hate the unfairness. It‚Äôs also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks.

I feel uncomfortable around white people who I also find attractive. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don‚Äôt have much experience socializing or getting to know a white person since I grew up in a low income neighborhood where white people don‚Äôt reside in, because I distance myself from white people infested areas because of this discomfort and because anything that‚Äôs geared towards white people (places, hobbies, groups) is likely geared towards wealthy people or white people since here in New York the two are nearly interchangeable since most whites are middle class or wealthy (it‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt know much about my city because I‚Äôve really sheltered myself because of this discomfort and can‚Äôt tell what from what in the city. There probably are some places that are meant for everyone, but I won‚Äôt find out anytime soon because of this cluelessness as a result of the discomfort and because of the discomfort) - both meaning the same thing to me as someone who grew up low income from immigrant parents (who don‚Äôt speak english) with little understanding about the white and professional world. Not all white people are the same of course, but it‚Äôs hard to truly understand that because of my lack of interaction with them. I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general because of the whole underlying white supremacy and class ties that runs the United States and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their color alone. Some of them look down on you by choice and/or look down on you because of the very same kind of conditioning that makes me feel beneath them. It would be fine and dandy and all if that was it, but on top of having to overcome these disadvantages, I also have to compete with these very people in order to earn freedom and successes, through education and job hunting, finding love etc. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. And of course I envy them too. For privileges that come with their skin, general looks and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at success. Many things are made by them and made for them. It‚Äôs often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy ones that live in homes of great quality. It‚Äôs also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks and upbringing. I envy both the privileges that these two kinds of people have and also envy the things that they don‚Äôt have to go through like the stress I have to go through dealing with and trying to navigate all of this as they get to just live life carefree. It‚Äôs worse when they‚Äôre ignorant to the problems of others and/or are conceited.

It‚Äôs a little more than just white people though. It more has to do with socioeconomic status and popularity/fame more than anything (since like I mentioned before, most white people are wealthy and as a result acquire status easier and faster here, so at this point it boils down to that, however). I feel uncomfortable around people of higher socioeconomic status and people who are talented (white people because of privileges that make their lives easier and therefore give them the time, money, resources, connections and mental health to perform and advance... not to say that other races cannot become talented... it's just that we have less privileges) or have higher status in general because of their popularity or looks and the privileges that they have as a result and therefore feeling like. Also people who have done and experienced a lot in life are people who I feel beneath and uncomfortable around. Intelligent people too. People who have accomplished a lot, both quantity and quality. People who are ambitious and have a lot to show for their goals, life and ambitions. Upon seeing or reading about someone who is incredibly accomplished, I feel bad about myself (one example, browsing someone‚Äôs linkedin account... I couldn‚Äôt even dream to measure up to that person even within two lifetimes. Privileged or not, I‚Äôm still behind.) I also feel pressured. I feel like I need to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par. It‚Äôs impossible to be on par with some people. I‚Äôm not good enough to be around those people and I also feel bad because I don‚Äôt measure up whenever I'm around them. People in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you‚Äôre good enough for the job, rich white men created white supremacy, professionalism which describes how assimilated you‚Äôve become to white culture in the sense that you speak formally/properly like a white person and earn their respect (since all the people who are employers/in power are white people because their governing and taking over - killing off the native americans, but let‚Äôs not go there) and beauty standards (which were created to benefit their women). Professionalism and white supremacy are two entities that are simply one in my eyes. Two societal barriers that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. I shouldn‚Äôt have to change who I am in order to be accepted by others, but it looks like there‚Äôs no other way out because the people in power dictate your worth and how you attain freedom. And there are some people of higher socioeconomic status that don‚Äôt see others as inferior or beneath or not good enough for them, yet I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell at first glance of course because you can‚Äôt see someone‚Äôs true colors based on their looks alone. You would just have to find out by chance. So I‚Äôll still feel beneath them initially, unless I am of equal socioeconomic status or develop value through some skills or talents or something weird. And then all that‚Äôs left are the things I can‚Äôt change like my skin color, my height and my facial features.

White people here in NYC are often attractive as well, so the discomfort is more - a direct correlation to how inferior I am to them. It‚Äôs because generally speaking white people and light skin is found to be attractive. It‚Äôs also because white people here and in general are wealthy and therefore have had access to healthier foods in their neighborhoods that they could afford, and likely have more time and more resources that aid in general life well being which reduces stress, likely are more fit because of the healthy foods and opportunities to play on sport teams etc. It also doesn‚Äôt help that white people are seen as the most attractive, so even if I did have a chance to find love, there‚Äôd be no point since white people are the most desired. I envy white men for being able to charm attractive women. Their facial structure could even be less attractive than mine, but their white skin is what saves them. Light skin is just attractive. Do you know how small I feel (especially as a man?)


Being Brown. Brown skinned men like myself are short and often times ugly. Our darker skin alone is not seen as attractive as light skin. Our facial structures are less attractive too. On average, we are on the shorter side, which makes us less manly and attractive. White men are seen as more attractive because of their light and I guess because of their socioeconomic status and because of white supremacy norms or in other words - because they pushed the idea that they were the best because they have it all and created it all - others consciously and/or subconsciously bought into it and are attracted to this power and associate it with those looks. After all, we are attracted to people who can provide. Also, negative stereotypes don‚Äôt help people of my color. We‚Äôre known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly and ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù (not very assertive and submissive) and more things exclusive to the Indian or Middle Eastern nations‚Äô cultures. Brown people are really unattractive. A lot of our facial features aren't attractive, but it also has to do with racial conditioning/white supremacy/racism that‚Äôs rooted in our subconsciousness that influence what we find attractive - by that I mean beauty standards being Eurocentric.


Being Short doesn‚Äôt bother me all that much. It sucks. It only sucks a lot when coupled with the others - being a poor, brown, ugly minority. I guess it does suck because it‚Äôs the main thing on top of being ugly that prevents me from having a chance with women. It also makes me feel small around people. Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don‚Äôt want short men anyways.

Growing up poor under immigrant parents and having less resources not only has led me to this mental health dilemma, but has also put me in a position where I have a hard time even trying to express how I‚Äôm feeling (bad verbal/written skills, also another insecurity - thing that makes me inferior and uncomfortable and also a thing that professionals and white people look down on)don‚Äôt know of terminology - like social justice stuff that aids in my expression, understanding and self development when it comes to this stuff. I‚Äôm tired of this. I‚Äôm also tired of having to see mental health doctors for my problems (other problems too) and also dislike being around doctors in general, police officers, people in authority in general and having mental health problems because I‚Äôm in a position where I‚Äôm beneath others.

I‚Äôve always had an identity crisis growing up because of feeling inferior to different people and being around different kinds of people. I felt inferior to the strong and tough african americans and latinos in my low income neighborhood, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. I felt inferior to the tall and attractive white people, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. Now I don‚Äôt really know who I am, how people see me and who exactly I want to be or what things would make me feel on par with others/would make others see me as on par or what my personality would be or want to be seen as or whose opinions or views of me should matter. 

This last part I just added recently. I feel kind of uncomfortable around or when I think about or read or hear about people who are kinda sexually forward or ""excessively promiscuous"" (wasn't allowed to use a certain word here) or when people are intimate with one another and I can see it or when I suspect that someone who I walk by in person who I feel could be an actress in adult films (unfortunately because of all of this stuff in general, I too have preconceived notions about people based on their appearances. I feel like in the society we live in, it‚Äôs impossible to bypass that because stereotypes and whatever are everywhere.) I know that doesn‚Äôt make sense because I‚Äôve been watching adult material, but I guess that‚Äôs how I feel when I view it for what it is and not in an unconscious state for pleasure. The feeling is a strange one. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anger. It might be envy, but at the same time it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. It‚Äôs almost like a feeling of - this is wrong (even though sex and stuff are normal. Could it be that I feel inferior to someone who is promiscuous?). I wish I knew how to explain it better. It does stack on top of the envy I have for those people envy though there‚Äôs a lot more than what meets the eye like how the industry treats them bad as well as the professional world. I can‚Äôt just shake off the envy because... well what I envy about their situation is present and nothing more. Thoughts like these are almost a constant I feel because it‚Äôs such a big issue coupled with my insecurities about my image, but also because I feel as though the bad sleep I‚Äôm experiencing is making my mind a bit wonky. In class it was hard to concentrate because of these thoughts coming and going as well as the need to comprehend them and I guess come up with solutions.


Summary

I hate it all. (Not mentioned, but my home life and upbringing - verbal abuse, lack of resources, stupid parent, stupid single parent, underserved or nonexistent resources for low income neighborhood, no privacy, sadistic family members)(that I still have to be grateful and guilty because there are people who will look at me and think my problems are only a fraction of theirs), things I‚Äôm not even allowed to mention, Other insecurities of mine like my voice, body, Being ugly, being short, being a minority, not being good enough for love and more and being beneath others according to existing societal standards, beauty standards, people pretending to be who they aren‚Äôt, a superficial based society as a result of media brainwashing us that makes people alter themselves through lighting, makeup etc., white supremacy and its byproducts, professionalism (which is another way the elite separate themselves from the rest and define everyone else as inferior)(another way that forces people to become fake and superficial in order to please others. Resumes, speaking formally, dressing in clothing for interviews that has no value otherwise), the white, privileged and wealthy profiting off of the poor, ignorant minorities through business while putting on the facade of genuinely trying to help us while also making them look superior because it only emphasizes the class difference. (hate that I) envy those who have wealth, good looks that ‚Äúaward‚Äù them too many privileges one of which being the ability to earn money through modeling and adult films (even though the adult film industry isn‚Äôt pretty and is a toxic and manipulative and fake and ugly on the inside), envy and privileged people and my identity crisis. I‚Äôm tired of having been conditioned to feel inferior and to want to prove myself to others (when maybe I should be the one I should be proving things to.) Who do I want to be? What makes me feel good enough? What do I determine my value on without sugar coating things for myself in order to avoid feelings of inferiority altogether? How do I cope with my shitty circumstances for the rest of my life? How do I live with this anger and frustration?

Edit : 2/23/19
So today, I volunteered to join an organization that was tabling (had a table up at a place in hopes of handing out fliers and information to promote events and whatnot). (You might wonder why I even did this upon finishing reading this. I want to volunteer because I genuinely want to help the less fortunate, give back to the community and to give back to nature. I wouldn‚Äôt have put myself in such an uncomfortable position otherwise) It already started off as a bad day because I had gotten a shitty haircut. Another thing that gets in the way. No hair shape or style works on me on top of being ugly. Continuing on.. So the person I volunteer with is someone kinda extraordinary (I only know because I looked them up online, their linkedin account). They‚Äôve been involved in a myriad of extracurriculars, volunteering, internships, attended an amazing university, graduating with honors etc, speak 3 languages, supports themselves, isn‚Äôt even going to settle for the career they have now (which shows ambition and that they‚Äôre advancing and moving on in the future... this and this person in general is a good foil for me though in the sense that their existence highlights how little I do and am, how little I‚Äôve done and how much time is going by without me growing or making anything of it), once lived in one state and moved across the country to live in this state (showcases the ability to make a huge transition, plus showcases another experience/stage of life this person has undergone) is married, is under 25 years old, is a professional, is attractive, is kind, cares for the environment, is self aware, is ambitious, is talented... someone like that would be amazing to be around. It‚Äôs a privilege to be around someone so lucky and amazing... but it also feels like a punishment. I‚Äôm one hundred percent inferior to them no matter how I look at it. If I could live to be 200 I still would be inferior to them. A whole second lifetime and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to measure up to them. (why does inferiority matter so much, I don‚Äôt know. I suppose because we‚Äôre conditioned to want to fit in to have friends/love, so our value and appearance matter. Humans need one another. Stuff like professionalism, status, looks, etc. matter when looking for work - which earns money which earns freedom/time. 

So yeah, I‚Äôm inferior to them, so I was uncomfortable around them. I was also uncomfortable because I didn‚Äôt have much to say because I‚Äôm not really cultured. I don‚Äôt do much or know much because of my upbringing whereas she and the other people I was with are a couple of years older than me and are cultured, accomplished, have had a lot of experiences, are really making the most of their time/are situated (job, home, etc.) I was also uncomfortable because I was supposed to help out but I didn‚Äôt really help out because I‚Äôm not a very social person and I didn‚Äôt have much to say because I don‚Äôt know much about the organization. I felt stupid too. She was trying to simplify things for me, but that act from her part only made me feel more inferior. She was nice, it‚Äôs just that on top of everything else, her knowing that I was uneasy made me feel even more small and inferior. In addition, there were many accomplished and/or white people who were coming to our table and were at the event which made me uncomfortable. 

I just snuck out midway through the event and sent an email to her because I wasn‚Äôt going to further make myself look and feel inferior by explaining all of this to them, especially in person with my poor verbal skills. I‚Äôm already ashamed enough and am considering breaking up communication with them even though they‚Äôre helping me by inviting me to volunteer at events that would assist in furthering my college/career (especially since I‚Äôm a lousy 20 year old student at community college) Feeling inferior makes me anxious and the inferiority and anxiety made me depressed. I just had to leave. And so I did. I can‚Äôt change my circumstances, but I can work on myself to be on par with some people (though I‚Äôll never be on par with certain people). I can find ways to cope with stuff like this and everything else when I feel down because when it gets to the point of feeling depressed, it consumes me. I forget about the rest of the world and what‚Äôs amazing about it and then I feel like my life is over because I can‚Äôt have or be certain things. That‚Äôs not to say that all of this isn‚Äôt small in terms of the grand scheme of things. It‚Äôs very big. However there is more going on in the world.

au0mth,1,2019-02-23,Trying to be rational.. need some advice. [F/18 M/19],yunglemon14,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/au0mth/trying_to_be_rational_need_some_advice_f18_m19/,"Hi! So before I get to my question, here's some background on my LDR. Growing up I would spend two weeks at my grandma's house in Texas. One summer between 6th &amp; 7th grade, I met a group of boys at a waterpark and connected with them through instagram. One of the boys and I talked on kik a lot and eventually started facetiming a lot throughout high school. We were really close and told each other everything. We didn't admit it to each other, but we had interest in one another. He plays hockey and would come to my state for tournaments. The first time i saw him in person again was at the end of 2017. I was in a serious 2-year relationship but wanted to see him as he had been my friend for so long. About six months later, my serious relationship had ended. I was graduating from high school and had invited him to my grad party. He had friends in my state so said he'd come so he could see them and go to a hockey camp in my state. He stayed with my family and we acted on our feelings for each other, to put it vaguely . His mom invited me for a week later that summer to stay with them. We saw each other in july, october, november, and twice in december. He asked me to be his girlfreind on December 30, 2018. We've been together since but it certainly feels a lot longer given our history. additionally, I flew to see him last weekend for his birthday and to celebrate valentines day.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's what i'm seeking advice on. I am a student studying aerospace engineering. His mom set me up with a good friend of hers with connections at NASA and GE for internships. If I get one, I will spend the summer near him which would be an added bonus to pursuing an internship in a field I love and getting to make new friends in a new city. If not, I will stay here and nanny or try to find an internship here. But I think it would be awesome to spend the summer with him, since during the school year I am only able to see him on a weekend here in there if affordable. Getting to live in a new city would be really cool too, so I could look for other work options down in houston if the internship doesn't work out. But is this rational? moving to a different state to be with the person you love at this age?"
au0qq9,237,2019-02-23,Open Heart Autopsy - A Medical Look at Chapter 1,ArgyleMN,Choices,https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/au0qq9/open_heart_autopsy_a_medical_look_at_chapter_1/,"So, I've been nervous about this book. As a pediatrics resident physician in real life, I tend to avoid medical media because unless it's Scrubs, the inaccuracies get under my skin. That being said, I love those youtube videos where a lawyer reacts to a legal show or a rugby player reacts to NFL games, so I thought there might be some in this community who would be interested in how a doctor who unabashedly loves Choices reacts to Open Heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I'd start with Chapter 1 and see if there was any interest. I understand that this book is primarily designed to entertain, so I'm not looking to tear it apart or anything, more just a glance at what was accurate, and of course, what wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

We start with meeting Dr. DelaRosa, who is the perfect example of an awesome senior resident, the type I strive to be currently and the type I loved having as a med student and an intern. She's friendly, helpful, and provides accurate advice. Her assessment of how residency compares to medical school and her advice to befriend the other residents is spot on. No one else can really understand what you are going through, so residents do form incredibly tight bonds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The book really starts off with a medical emergency in the waiting room. Time to spring into action. MC is impressively badass, ready to go from minute one of day one. It's pretty much the opposite of how I felt at my first code. I was nervous that I would be the first one there and would be expected to make decisions, and I was about two months into residency at that point. MC here does have the option to ask for someone to call for a doctor, which is a nice touch. It does take a long time to get used to being Dr. Lastname (took me about 6 weeks).

&amp;#x200B;

As far as medical accuracy goes, this scene does numerous things very well. Dr. Ramsey and MC start with vital signs, which is absolutely the right call. We don't get her actual blood pressure, but we learn she is hypotensive and immediately call to start fluids, the correct call in management. So far, MC is rocking it. MC and Dr. Ramsey then perform a quick head to toe assessment, which is reasonable seeing as we have no info on this patient. Any clues as to why she is here are important. MC spots both an evolving bruise and blue fingers. MC knows that the bruise represents a likely bleeding disorder. Combined with her hypotension, this is concerning for a massive bleed somewhere. Her blue fingers are a sign of hypoxia, or low oxygen saturation in her tissues. Both of these are emergencies, but oxygen desaturation will likely cause permanent damage quicker, plus we can easily intervene by giving supplemental oxygen, so MC chooses to point out the fingers to Ramsey. MC's management to this point as been stellar for a Day 1 intern, and she knows it.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, the same cannot be said for her attending. As he points out the bruise, he concludes that the patient is a hemophiliac. Given that the patient is a woman, this is highly unlikely as hemophilia is an x-linked disease. The DNA for certain clotting factors is carried on the x-chromosome. Women have two copies of this chromosome, so they are typically just carriers as their other x-chromosome had the genetic information to properly make these clotting factors. Women can pass the disease to their sons (who only have one copy of the x chromosome). There are other conditions that can cause easy bleeding that would be more likely in this patient. For instance, if she had liver disease, she could have impaired production of clotting factors. She could have a history of blot clots and be on a blood thinning medication. She could have a massive infection that has caused widespread inflammation and end-organ damage (sepsis) leading to a condition called DIC. She could have an autoimmune immune condition called ITP where her body destroys it's own platelets, the blood cells that help form blood clots. But this attending is somehow sure this is hemophilia. MC is skeptical, but doesn't feel comfortable asking the attending to explain his thought process in the middle of an emergency. So she goes along with it. She listens for breath sounds at his instruction and notes no breath sounds on the left. Given her hypotension and easy bruising, this is concerning for a bleed into her pleural cavity, the tissue that encases the lungs, called a hemothorax.

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Ramsey very belatedly decides this is the appropriate time to call a code blue. If he had called one immediately upon finding a minimally responsive patient on the floor of a waiting room, more staff would be here to help. Code teams consist of a variety of medical professionals, including pharmacists with a box of commonly needed medications, nurses who can help with procedures, recording, and time keeping, anesthesiologist, who can help with securing an airway, and security, who can help with crowd control and moving the patient if needed. Dr. Ramsey seems to value being a bit of a cowboy and having doctors do things on their own, but this is an outdated way of thinking. Medicine is a team-based profession, and having more hands on deck would help provide better patient care.

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Ramsey takes over airway management and actually encourages MC to come to the diagnosis on her own in a reasonable way. By bag masking the patient, he is providing care while taking an opportunity for teaching in a reasonable fashion. However, MC starts spiraling down a path of thinking this patient needs surgical repair of a blood vessel, and Dr. Ramsey agrees with this probably incorrect assumption. If this patient is a hemophiliac, it is possible that the bleeding occurred not from damage to a large vessel that would require surgical intervention, but from a small vessel or numerous small vessels that aren't clotting off due to her clotting factor deficiency. It that case, making a surgical incision would put her at increased risk for further bleeding. The patient would need clotting factor to help stop the bleeding in the pleura and before any procedures could be performed.

&amp;#x200B;

In the malpractice case of the chapter, Dr. Ramsey decides to place an emergency chest tube. Given her known bleeding disorder, this is an incredibly risky procedure, and it should not be performed in an uncontrolled environment like a waiting room. Preferably, she would be given clotting factors and blood products prior to or during the procedure. However, Dr. Ramsey decides that a fresh intern's first chest tube should be this one. No one puts on gloves or sterilizes the skin, unnecessarily increasing this woman's risk of infection, but MC takes time instead to worry about a local anesthetic. Dr. Ramsey rightly scoffs at that idea, although his method of correction is not going to instill confidence in MC to complete the rest of the procedure. Still, MC places the chest tube in the appropriate location with some guidance from Ramsey and blood begins to drain, presumably all over the waiting room floor. Oops! Oh well, this has an immediate effect, allowing much easier breathing for our patient. For Dr. Ramsey, this is enough to call her stable, even though her bleeding is not controlled at this point. He also makes an unfounded promise that she will be fine, establishing expectations that he can be sued for if they aren't met.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, MC is pumped. She just performed an emergency procedure for the first time. The adrenaline rush is powerful, but Dr. Ramsey wastes no time in squashing that enthusiasm. Instead of setting up a time to debrief over what went well and where there was room for improvement when they are both calm and not riding an adrenaline rush, he opts for the less effective, but sadly still practiced by some, teaching technique of berating and humiliating MC in public. Instead of taking over the procedure or walking her through it step-by-step if he was concerned that MC was endangering the patient, he waited until it was over to tell her everything she did wrong in the harshest way possible. MC doesn't let this get to her, correctly identifying him as the asshole in this situation. Supervisors at teaching hospitals should teaching during procedures, not shame you afterwards for everything you did wrong. She understands that she has a lot to learn, but that is the point of residency.

&amp;#x200B;

MC goes to change out of her bloody scrubs, meeting some of her fellow residents. She decides not to hit on her brand new colleagues. Jackie comes across as a former gunner who can't shake the competitive nature of med school. Hopefully she will drop this behavior over time when she realizes working with her coresidents makes way more sense and there is nothing to be gained by being cutthroat. Bryce and Jackie engage in some good-natured ribbing over internal medicine versus general surgery, which is incredibly accurate. Stereotypes about different specialties are a common opportunity for teasing. MC decides not to wear the skirt and blouse with the white coat, as she recognizes that the skirt is way too short for a doctor. Her ass would be hanging out every time she had to bend over a patient to examine them, so she selects instead a clean pair of scrubs. 

&amp;#x200B;

After an address by the Chief, Dr. Harper Emery, the interns partner up to go see their first patients. Aurora and MC do not get along the best, but they agree to just keep their focus on the patient. MC and Aurora have no sense of how busy they will be as Aurora repeats vitals that a nurse has undoubtedly already taken and MC offers to help the patient with her schoolwork. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's time for MC to start building a differential diagnosis for her patient. Symptoms including itching, or pruritis, headaches, nausea, vertigo, and cramping hands. She also reports foreign travel to Indonesia, which raises MCs concern for an unusual infectious disease. Nausea and itching could be associated with an infection of the liver, such as hepatitis. If the patient swam in bodies of water or walked barefoot along beaches, she could have also picked up a worm, although those infections typically develop over a slower time course and she has not had any diarrhea. Examination reveals a rash on the back of her neck and a cut on her ankle. MC for some reason only asks about one of them, so she picks the ankle cut, thinking it might be an entry point for an infectious agent.

&amp;#x200B;

As Aurora and MC decide on their plan for the patient, they decide to run a ""full workup"" and screen for all viruses and bacteria. I'm guessing a full workup consists of drawing blood to assess for cell counts and electrolytes, possibly liver and kidney function as well, which is a reasonable starting point. MC is focused on infection with the history of foreign travel, which is reasonable, although it would serve her well to consider other types of illness as well. Bacteria can be screened for by drawing blood cultures. Unfortunately, no screen exists for all viruses. Since most viral tests look for genetic material specific to a given virus, MC is going to need to decide which viruses she wants to test for. Hopefully, she can touch base with a senior resident or attending who can help her with this. I would recommend starting with a hepatitis panel and maybe adding stool studies to assess for ova and parasites.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of her patients keep realistically busy for hours before a nurse approaches her with a paper copy of test results. Realistically, these lab results would be all electronic in this day and age. The blood culture shows bacteria, which is very concerning for bacteremia. However, the patient's overall clinical appearance is pretty good at this point. She is awake, friendly, and interactive. With how quickly this culture grew out bacteria, she should be much sicker (like on death's door sick) and should have high-grade fevers. Given that the culture has already identified the specific strain of the bacteria, something that should take much longer to determine, I'm concerned for lab error. This could be a different patient's blood culture. However, since this is MC's first day, she is rightfully concerned by such a finding. She moves to treat right away with a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic, a reasonable choice that provides pretty broad coverage, although she should have selected an IV antibiotic over oral given that she is thinking the patient has bacteria in her blood. I also think this would be a good time to update a senior resident or attending, since this is a pretty serious development and MC is probably a bit nervous. Talking this through with someone more experienced would be a good idea, as would be repeating the blood cultures.

&amp;#x200B;

MC meets Landry and decides to be brave and face Dr. Asshole again in a diamond option. She is not going to be a coward and hide from one asshole for the next three years. She's cringy when she asks him to sign Landry's book, but at least she gets to see that Dr. Asshole is pretty good with his patients. He also gives her some pretty good advice about how to handle making mistakes as a doctor. This is an example of good but harsh teaching. MC is hopeful that maybe they just got off on the wrong foot when tensions were high during a code situation. She wants to have a good professional relationship with him, particularly since she admires his research and might like to work on a paper with him going forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

MC swings by Annie's room to update her on the lab results and agrees to sit down and keep her company. Sadly, this will probably last about 2 minutes before MC gets paged about an order she forgot to place, but it's a lovely gesture. Of course, Annie crashes at that exact moment due to rule of drama. It leaves off with an intense cliffhanger, but I do want to commend MC for calling a code blue immediately. It would be very easy to be paralyzed with fear here, but she does the first thing she should do in this situation, which is to call to get some assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so that's the first chapter. Some things were very accurate, although there certainly were some errors. Overall, the medical inaccuracies are at a tolerable level at this point, where they are not so massive that they completely pull me out of the story. Additionally, it helps that MC is brand new and therefore it is understandable if she makes mistakes. Dr. Ramsey's teaching style is a bit questionable so far, but we will need a bigger sample size to decide if he is a harsh but good teacher or just a complete asshole."
au18ih,2,2019-02-23,Goal Of Post : Unloading and Receiving Myriads of Supportive Responses. Please Help Me Accomplish My Goal. Topic : Feelings of Inferiority,HelpMyWeinerAndMe,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/au18ih/goal_of_post_unloading_and_receiving_myriads_of/,"Summary of Inferiority I think about all of this everyday, deal with this too often and am reminded of it frequently because of ‚Äútriggers‚Äù. And I‚Äôm tired of it. Trying to navigate them, understand them are just as stressful as the feelings and circumstances are themselves. I don‚Äôt even know what a solution or coping looks like... Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don‚Äôt like what I see. I am ugly. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there‚Äôs no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don‚Äôt like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I‚Äôm this way, I‚Äôm super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I don‚Äôt like being associated with this ugly. I don‚Äôt like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It‚Äôs like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. I‚Äôm tired of being beneath others and not good enough. There are times when I don‚Äôt even want to go outside because of the way I look. It‚Äôs painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can‚Äôt let being ugly take over. There‚Äôs no solution to this. I just have to deal with it. Many people don‚Äôt have to deal with this at all, so they don‚Äôt have the solution for it or need a solution. I‚Äôm tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I‚Äôm not ugly. They only say that because there‚Äôs nothing else they can do or say to people when they‚Äôre ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I‚Äôm dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out in some of the most heinous ways possible but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.

I feel uncomfortable around attractive people. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don‚Äôt have much experience socializing or getting to know an attractive person (since most don‚Äôt want anything to do with ugly people since often times, ugly looks devalue us in society and functions almost like class). I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their good looks alone. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. I also feel down and angry upon seeing them, knowing that I‚Äôll never be good enough for them romantically or sometimes socially because of my looks (even though looks aren‚Äôt the only thing that define me). And of course I envy them too. For their looks, for the privileges that come with looks (there are so many of them as looks and the idea of sex really baits people. Self confidence, status, being treated nicer, luxury of love and relationships and using their looks to advance in life to acquire wealth, more status/popularity, etc.) and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at finding love. I also feel hatred. I hate ones that use their looks to their advantage on purpose. I also hate ones that are really confident in their looks and kind of flaunt it or come off as conceited. It's like a mockery to me. Even seeing them smile sometimes feels like a mockery to me. It's rare that someone would actually mock me, but it just feels that way. Seeing these people is a trigger within itself. That gets me angry, on top of the hatred and sadness I have to deal with by looking the way I do and therefore not being good enough socially or romantically. I just hate the unfairness. It‚Äôs also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks.

I feel uncomfortable around white people who I also find attractive. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don‚Äôt have much experience socializing or getting to know a white person since I grew up in a low income neighborhood where white people don‚Äôt reside in, because I distance myself from white people infested areas because of this discomfort and because anything that‚Äôs geared towards white people (places, hobbies, groups) is likely geared towards wealthy people or white people since here in New York the two are nearly interchangeable since most whites are middle class or wealthy (it‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt know much about my city because I‚Äôve really sheltered myself because of this discomfort and can‚Äôt tell what from what in the city. There probably are some places that are meant for everyone, but I won‚Äôt find out anytime soon because of this cluelessness as a result of the discomfort and because of the discomfort) - both meaning the same thing to me as someone who grew up low income from immigrant parents (who don‚Äôt speak english) with little understanding about the white and professional world. Not all white people are the same of course, but it‚Äôs hard to truly understand that because of my lack of interaction with them. I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general because of the whole underlying white supremacy and class ties that runs the United States and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their color alone. Some of them look down on you by choice and/or look down on you because of the very same kind of conditioning that makes me feel beneath them. It would be fine and dandy and all if that was it, but on top of having to overcome these disadvantages, I also have to compete with these very people in order to earn freedom and successes, through education and job hunting, finding love etc. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. And of course I envy them too. For privileges that come with their skin, general looks and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at success. Many things are made by them and made for them. It‚Äôs often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy ones that live in homes of great quality. It‚Äôs also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks and upbringing. I envy both the privileges that these two kinds of people have and also envy the things that they don‚Äôt have to go through like the stress I have to go through dealing with and trying to navigate all of this as they get to just live life carefree. It‚Äôs worse when they‚Äôre ignorant to the problems of others and/or are conceited.

It‚Äôs a little more than just white people though. It more has to do with socioeconomic status and popularity/fame more than anything (since like I mentioned before, most white people are wealthy and as a result acquire status easier and faster here, so at this point it boils down to that, however). I feel uncomfortable around people of higher socioeconomic status and people who are talented (white people because of privileges that make their lives easier and therefore give them the time, money, resources, connections and mental health to perform and advance... not to say that other races cannot become talented... it's just that we have less privileges) or have higher status in general because of their popularity or looks and the privileges that they have as a result and therefore feeling like. Also people who have done and experienced a lot in life are people who I feel beneath and uncomfortable around. Intelligent people too. People who have accomplished a lot, both quantity and quality. People who are ambitious and have a lot to show for their goals, life and ambitions. Upon seeing or reading about someone who is incredibly accomplished, I feel bad about myself (one example, browsing someone‚Äôs linkedin account... I couldn‚Äôt even dream to measure up to that person even within two lifetimes. Privileged or not, I‚Äôm still behind.) I also feel pressured. I feel like I need to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par. It‚Äôs impossible to be on par with some people. I‚Äôm not good enough to be around those people and I also feel bad because I don‚Äôt measure up whenever I'm around them. People in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you‚Äôre good enough for the job, rich white men created white supremacy, professionalism which describes how assimilated you‚Äôve become to white culture in the sense that you speak formally/properly like a white person and earn their respect (since all the people who are employers/in power are white people because their governing and taking over - killing off the native americans, but let‚Äôs not go there) and beauty standards (which were created to benefit their women). Professionalism and white supremacy are two entities that are simply one in my eyes. Two societal barriers that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. I shouldn‚Äôt have to change who I am in order to be accepted by others, but it looks like there‚Äôs no other way out because the people in power dictate your worth and how you attain freedom. And there are some people of higher socioeconomic status that don‚Äôt see others as inferior or beneath or not good enough for them, yet I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell at first glance of course because you can‚Äôt see someone‚Äôs true colors based on their looks alone. You would just have to find out by chance. So I‚Äôll still feel beneath them initially, unless I am of equal socioeconomic status or develop value through some skills or talents or something weird. And then all that‚Äôs left are the things I can‚Äôt change like my skin color, my height and my facial features.
White people here in NYC are often attractive as well, so the discomfort is more - a direct correlation to how inferior I am to them. It‚Äôs because generally speaking white people and light skin is found to be attractive. It‚Äôs also because white people here and in general are wealthy and therefore have had access to healthier foods in their neighborhoods that they could afford, and likely have more time and more resources that aid in general life well being which reduces stress, likely are more fit because of the healthy foods and opportunities to play on sport teams etc. It also doesn‚Äôt help that white people are seen as the most attractive, so even if I did have a chance to find love, there‚Äôd be no point since white people are the most desired. I envy white men for being able to charm attractive women. Their facial structure could even be less attractive than mine, but their white skin is what saves them. Light skin is just attractive. Do you know how small I feel (especially as a man?)

Being Brown. Brown skinned men like myself are short and often times ugly. Our darker skin alone is not seen as attractive as light skin. Our facial structures are less attractive too. On average, we are on the shorter side, which makes us less manly and attractive. White men are seen as more attractive because of their light and I guess because of their socioeconomic status and because of white supremacy norms or in other words - because they pushed the idea that they were the best because they have it all and created it all - others consciously and/or subconsciously bought into it and are attracted to this power and associate it with those looks. After all, we are attracted to people who can provide. Also, negative stereotypes don‚Äôt help people of my color. We‚Äôre known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly and ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù (not very assertive and submissive) and more things exclusive to the Indian or Middle Eastern nations‚Äô cultures. Brown people are really unattractive. A lot of our facial features aren't attractive, but it also has to do with racial conditioning/white supremacy/racism that‚Äôs rooted in our subconsciousness that influence what we find attractive - by that I mean beauty standards being Eurocentric.
Being Short doesn‚Äôt bother me all that much. It sucks. It only sucks a lot when coupled with the others - being a poor, brown, ugly minority. I guess it does suck because it‚Äôs the main thing on top of being ugly that prevents me from having a chance with women. It also makes me feel small around people. Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don‚Äôt want short men anyways.

Growing up poor under immigrant parents and having less resources not only has led me to this mental health dilemma, but has also put me in a position where I have a hard time even trying to express how I‚Äôm feeling (bad verbal/written skills, also another insecurity - thing that makes me inferior and uncomfortable and also a thing that professionals and white people look down on)don‚Äôt know of terminology - like social justice stuff that aids in my expression, understanding and self development when it comes to this stuff. I‚Äôm tired of this. I‚Äôm also tired of having to see mental health doctors for my problems (other problems too) and also dislike being around doctors in general, police officers, people in authority in general and having mental health problems because I‚Äôm in a position where I‚Äôm beneath others.

I‚Äôve always had an identity crisis growing up because of feeling inferior to different people and being around different kinds of people. I felt inferior to the strong and tough african americans and latinos in my low income neighborhood, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. I felt inferior to the tall and attractive white people, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. Now I don‚Äôt really know who I am, how people see me and who exactly I want to be or what things would make me feel on par with others/would make others see me as on par or what my personality would be or want to be seen as or whose opinions or views of me should matter.
This last part I just added recently. I feel kind of uncomfortable around or when I think about or read or hear about people who are kinda sexually forward or ""excessively promiscuous"" (wasn't allowed to use a certain word here) or when people are intimate with one another and I can see it or when I suspect that someone who I walk by in person who I feel could be an actress in adult films (unfortunately because of all of this stuff in general, I too have preconceived notions about people based on their appearances. I feel like in the society we live in, it‚Äôs impossible to bypass that because stereotypes and whatever are everywhere.) I know that doesn‚Äôt make sense because I‚Äôve been watching adult material, but I guess that‚Äôs how I feel when I view it for what it is and not in an unconscious state for pleasure. The feeling is a strange one. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anger. It might be envy, but at the same time it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. It‚Äôs almost like a feeling of - this is wrong (even though sex and stuff are normal. Could it be that I feel inferior to someone who is promiscuous?). I wish I knew how to explain it better. It does stack on top of the envy I have for those people envy though there‚Äôs a lot more than what meets the eye like how the industry treats them bad as well as the professional world. I can‚Äôt just shake off the envy because... well what I envy about their situation is present and nothing more. Thoughts like these are almost a constant I feel because it‚Äôs such a big issue coupled with my insecurities about my image, but also because I feel as though the bad sleep I‚Äôm experiencing is making my mind a bit wonky. In class it was hard to concentrate because of these thoughts coming and going as well as the need to comprehend them and I guess come up with solutions.

Summary

I hate it all. (Not mentioned, but my home life and upbringing - verbal abuse, lack of resources, stupid parent, stupid single parent, underserved or nonexistent resources for low income neighborhood, no privacy, sadistic family members)(that I still have to be grateful and guilty because there are people who will look at me and think my problems are only a fraction of theirs), things I‚Äôm not even allowed to mention, Other insecurities of mine like my voice, body, Being ugly, being short, being a minority, not being good enough for love and more and being beneath others according to existing societal standards, beauty standards, people pretending to be who they aren‚Äôt, a superficial based society as a result of media brainwashing us that makes people alter themselves through lighting, makeup etc., white supremacy and its byproducts, professionalism (which is another way the elite separate themselves from the rest and define everyone else as inferior)(another way that forces people to become fake and superficial in order to please others. Resumes, speaking formally, dressing in clothing for interviews that has no value otherwise), the white, privileged and wealthy profiting off of the poor, ignorant minorities through business while putting on the facade of genuinely trying to help us while also making them look superior because it only emphasizes the class difference. (hate that I) envy those who have wealth, good looks that ‚Äúaward‚Äù them too many privileges one of which being the ability to earn money through modeling and adult films (even though the adult film industry isn‚Äôt pretty and is a toxic and manipulative and fake and ugly on the inside), envy and privileged people and my identity crisis. I‚Äôm tired of having been conditioned to feel inferior and to want to prove myself to others (when maybe I should be the one I should be proving things to.) Who do I want to be? What makes me feel good enough? What do I determine my value on without sugar coating things for myself in order to avoid feelings of inferiority altogether? How do I cope with my shitty circumstances for the rest of my life? How do I live with this anger and frustration?

Edit : 2/23/19 So today, I volunteered to join an organization that was tabling (had a table up at a place in hopes of handing out fliers and information to promote events and whatnot). (You might wonder why I even did this upon finishing reading this. I want to volunteer because I genuinely want to help the less fortunate, give back to the community and to give back to nature. I wouldn‚Äôt have put myself in such an uncomfortable position otherwise) It already started off as a bad day because I had gotten a shitty haircut. Another thing that gets in the way. No hair shape or style works on me on top of being ugly. Continuing on.. So the person I volunteer with is someone kinda extraordinary (I only know because I looked them up online, their linkedin account). They‚Äôve been involved in a myriad of extracurriculars, volunteering, internships, attended an amazing university, graduating with honors etc, speak 3 languages, supports themselves, isn‚Äôt even going to settle for the career they have now (which shows ambition and that they‚Äôre advancing and moving on in the future... this and this person in general is a good foil for me though in the sense that their existence highlights how little I do and am, how little I‚Äôve done and how much time is going by without me growing or making anything of it), once lived in one state and moved across the country to live in this state (showcases the ability to make a huge transition, plus showcases another experience/stage of life this person has undergone) is married, is under 25 years old, is a professional, is attractive, is kind, cares for the environment, is self aware, is ambitious, is talented... someone like that would be amazing to be around. It‚Äôs a privilege to be around someone so lucky and amazing... but it also feels like a punishment. I‚Äôm one hundred percent inferior to them no matter how I look at it. If I could live to be 200 I still would be inferior to them. A whole second lifetime and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to measure up to them. (why does inferiority matter so much, I don‚Äôt know. I suppose because we‚Äôre conditioned to want to fit in to have friends/love, so our value and appearance matter. Humans need one another. Stuff like professionalism, status, looks, etc. matter when looking for work - which earns money which earns freedom/time.

So yeah, I‚Äôm inferior to them, so I was uncomfortable around them. I was also uncomfortable because I didn‚Äôt have much to say because I‚Äôm not really cultured. I don‚Äôt do much or know much because of my upbringing whereas she and the other people I was with are a couple of years older than me and are cultured, accomplished, have had a lot of experiences, are really making the most of their time/are situated (job, home, etc.) I was also uncomfortable because I was supposed to help out but I didn‚Äôt really help out because I‚Äôm not a very social person and I didn‚Äôt have much to say because I don‚Äôt know much about the organization. I felt stupid too. She was trying to simplify things for me, but that act from her part only made me feel more inferior. She was nice, it‚Äôs just that on top of everything else, her knowing that I was uneasy made me feel even more small and inferior. In addition, there were many accomplished and/or white people who were coming to our table and were at the event which made me uncomfortable.

I just snuck out midway through the event and sent an email to her because I wasn‚Äôt going to further make myself look and feel inferior by explaining all of this to them, especially in person with my poor verbal skills. I‚Äôm already ashamed enough and am considering breaking up communication with them even though they‚Äôre helping me by inviting me to volunteer at events that would assist in furthering my college/career (especially since I‚Äôm a lousy 20 year old student at community college) Feeling inferior makes me anxious and the inferiority and anxiety made me depressed. I just had to leave. And so I did. I can‚Äôt change my circumstances, but I can work on myself to be on par with some people (though I‚Äôll never be on par with certain people). I can find ways to cope with stuff like this and everything else when I feel down because when it gets to the point of feeling depressed, it consumes me. I forget about the rest of the world and what‚Äôs amazing about it and then I feel like my life is over because I can‚Äôt have or be certain things. That‚Äôs not to say that all of this isn‚Äôt small in terms of the grand scheme of things. It‚Äôs very big. However there is more going on in the world.

au19wo,0,2019-02-23,"[REQUEST] - anything that anyone is able or willing to.. more info inside post (long post, sorry)",radiantkitty,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/au19wo/request_anything_that_anyone_is_able_or_willing/,"I posted the other day asking basically for some support, and I was very grateful for the responses I got.. I didn‚Äôt have any other intentions initially - unfortunately I‚Äôve realize I‚Äôm out of options.. 
I‚Äôm currently in the final internship portion of my paramedic program where I‚Äôm working full time hours unpaid, I‚Äôm also working full time at my actual job, I‚Äôm also a single mom of a 2yr.. so without anything else coming into play.. things are difficult. 

However, this past week - week 1/2, EVERYTHING started falling apart. 
So first of all I‚Äôve been losing a lot of hours at work because of my internship, so finances have been doable just harder.. but then, somewhere in Decemberish? I got FMLA for my son‚Äôs asthma because it gets extremely severe.. well my employer decided to not care about the FMLA part a week or so ago and suspended me, unpaid for 2 weeks (it‚Äôs being handled per our union people) 
Then this past Sunday, I was supposed to move, I was staying with them during medic school because of child care and my divorce happened at the beginning of medic school, which has been totally fine.. but they had to sell it, and it sold SO quickly that they have to stay (temporarily) in their little travel trailer and they can only have 2 cars where they‚Äôre staying at so I literally cannot be there, which also was fine because I had worked out with some friends who live significantly closer to my internship anyway so it was perfect.. well later Sunday for reasons beyond me, that living situation fell through... and I had no choice but to basically be homeless for a night or 2 while I figured stuff out (son was at his dads so just me) Luckily I reached out to an old roommate about staying.. no problem it was flawless.. but they live preeetty far from EVERYTHING. My drive to internship before this was: 68mi round (not great but no choice) to work was 36mi round trip.
However now, because of things I‚Äôve had to more or less be forced to do those numbers are internship: 196mi round trip, work: 100mi round trip... HUGE change. Unfortunately I have no other options so I have to just make this work which is fine. It‚Äôs difficult enough because at work I‚Äôm doing 12hrs 3 days a week, and internship is 12hrs 3/4 days a week.. so it‚Äôs draining - but that just is what it is. 
But the cherry on top was that also last week a very close uncle had a heart attack, resulting in the need for a triple bypass. 
Basically everything around me has fallen apart, in ways out of my control.. 

Moving on to the help part: I‚Äôm financially suffering from all of this, moving, gas, toddler (I mean he‚Äôs there in general but it‚Äôs a thing lol), losing not just hours but an entire pay period at work because I guess it‚Äôs okay to suspend someone on FMLA.. but all of those things included I just need help. I‚Äôve got major bills (car payment, rent) covered, I need gas money, groceries I think I‚Äôve got, car insurance, various smaller things.. 
I would be immensely appreciative of anything, to be honest I think that $150 would be bare minimum to get me by until I do get paid. More would be awesome, less would be still very much appreciated.
we can work out the payment arrangement for me to repay you and everything if someone is able to. And if you are my preference would be though PayPal. 
Thank you everyone! 

TL;DR everything is falling apart around me, I‚Äôm super broke and I really need help. "
au1har,3,2019-02-23,Out of state internships,nesgmz,thesca,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesca/comments/au1har/out_of_state_internships/,So I'm looking at internships that are quite far from where I currently live. How would the interview process work? It would just be entirely over the phone? Anyone have experience relocating far from their hometown? 
au20lm,3,2019-02-23,Goal Of Post : Unloading and Receiving Myriads of Supportive Responses. Please Help Me Accomplish My Goal. Topic : Feelings of Inferiority,HelpMyWeinerAndMe,selfdevelopment,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfdevelopment/comments/au20lm/goal_of_post_unloading_and_receiving_myriads_of/,"Summary of Inferiority I think about all of this everyday, deal with this too often and am reminded of it frequently because of ‚Äútriggers‚Äù. And I‚Äôm tired of it. Trying to navigate them, understand them are just as stressful as the feelings and circumstances are themselves. I don‚Äôt even know what a solution or coping looks like... Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don‚Äôt like what I see. I am ugly. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there‚Äôs no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don‚Äôt like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I‚Äôm this way, I‚Äôm super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I don‚Äôt like being associated with this ugly. I don‚Äôt like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It‚Äôs like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. I‚Äôm tired of being beneath others and not good enough. There are times when I don‚Äôt even want to go outside because of the way I look. It‚Äôs painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can‚Äôt let being ugly take over. There‚Äôs no solution to this. I just have to deal with it. Many people don‚Äôt have to deal with this at all, so they don‚Äôt have the solution for it or need a solution. I‚Äôm tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I‚Äôm not ugly. They only say that because there‚Äôs nothing else they can do or say to people when they‚Äôre ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I‚Äôm dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out in some of the most heinous ways possible but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.

I feel uncomfortable around attractive people. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don‚Äôt have much experience socializing or getting to know an attractive person (since most don‚Äôt want anything to do with ugly people since often times, ugly looks devalue us in society and functions almost like class). I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their good looks alone. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. I also feel down and angry upon seeing them, knowing that I‚Äôll never be good enough for them romantically or sometimes socially because of my looks (even though looks aren‚Äôt the only thing that define me). And of course I envy them too. For their looks, for the privileges that come with looks (there are so many of them as looks and the idea of sex really baits people. Self confidence, status, being treated nicer, luxury of love and relationships and using their looks to advance in life to acquire wealth, more status/popularity, etc.) and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at finding love. I also feel hatred. I hate ones that use their looks to their advantage on purpose. I also hate ones that are really confident in their looks and kind of flaunt it or come off as conceited. It's like a mockery to me. Even seeing them smile sometimes feels like a mockery to me. It's rare that someone would actually mock me, but it just feels that way. Seeing these people is a trigger within itself. That gets me angry, on top of the hatred and sadness I have to deal with by looking the way I do and therefore not being good enough socially or romantically. I just hate the unfairness. It‚Äôs also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks.

I feel uncomfortable around white people who I also find attractive. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don‚Äôt have much experience socializing or getting to know a white person since I grew up in a low income neighborhood where white people don‚Äôt reside in, because I distance myself from white people infested areas because of this discomfort and because anything that‚Äôs geared towards white people (places, hobbies, groups) is likely geared towards wealthy people or white people since here in New York the two are nearly interchangeable since most whites are middle class or wealthy (it‚Äôs to the point where I don‚Äôt know much about my city because I‚Äôve really sheltered myself because of this discomfort and can‚Äôt tell what from what in the city. There probably are some places that are meant for everyone, but I won‚Äôt find out anytime soon because of this cluelessness as a result of the discomfort and because of the discomfort) - both meaning the same thing to me as someone who grew up low income from immigrant parents (who don‚Äôt speak english) with little understanding about the white and professional world. Not all white people are the same of course, but it‚Äôs hard to truly understand that because of my lack of interaction with them. I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general because of the whole underlying white supremacy and class ties that runs the United States and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their color alone. Some of them look down on you by choice and/or look down on you because of the very same kind of conditioning that makes me feel beneath them. It would be fine and dandy and all if that was it, but on top of having to overcome these disadvantages, I also have to compete with these very people in order to earn freedom and successes, through education and job hunting, finding love etc. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. And of course I envy them too. For privileges that come with their skin, general looks and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at success. Many things are made by them and made for them. It‚Äôs often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy ones that live in homes of great quality. It‚Äôs also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks and upbringing. I envy both the privileges that these two kinds of people have and also envy the things that they don‚Äôt have to go through like the stress I have to go through dealing with and trying to navigate all of this as they get to just live life carefree. It‚Äôs worse when they‚Äôre ignorant to the problems of others and/or are conceited. It‚Äôs a little more than just white people though. It more has to do with socioeconomic status and popularity/fame more than anything (since like I mentioned before, most white people are wealthy and as a result acquire status easier and faster here, so at this point it boils down to that, however). I feel uncomfortable around people of higher socioeconomic status and people who are talented (white people because of privileges that make their lives easier and therefore give them the time, money, resources, connections and mental health to perform and advance... not to say that other races cannot become talented... it's just that we have less privileges) or have higher status in general because of their popularity or looks and the privileges that they have as a result and therefore feeling like. Also people who have done and experienced a lot in life are people who I feel beneath and uncomfortable around. Intelligent people too. People who have accomplished a lot, both quantity and quality. People who are ambitious and have a lot to show for their goals, life and ambitions. Upon seeing or reading about someone who is incredibly accomplished, I feel bad about myself (one example, browsing someone‚Äôs linkedin account... I couldn‚Äôt even dream to measure up to that person even within two lifetimes. Privileged or not, I‚Äôm still behind.) I also feel pressured. I feel like I need to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par. It‚Äôs impossible to be on par with some people. I‚Äôm not good enough to be around those people and I also feel bad because I don‚Äôt measure up whenever I'm around them. People in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you‚Äôre good enough for the job, rich white men created white supremacy, professionalism which describes how assimilated you‚Äôve become to white culture in the sense that you speak formally/properly like a white person and earn their respect (since all the people who are employers/in power are white people because their governing and taking over - killing off the native americans, but let‚Äôs not go there) and beauty standards (which were created to benefit their women). Professionalism and white supremacy are two entities that are simply one in my eyes. Two societal barriers that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. I shouldn‚Äôt have to change who I am in order to be accepted by others, but it looks like there‚Äôs no other way out because the people in power dictate your worth and how you attain freedom. And there are some people of higher socioeconomic status that don‚Äôt see others as inferior or beneath or not good enough for them, yet I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell at first glance of course because you can‚Äôt see someone‚Äôs true colors based on their looks alone. You would just have to find out by chance. So I‚Äôll still feel beneath them initially, unless I am of equal socioeconomic status or develop value through some skills or talents or something weird. And then all that‚Äôs left are the things I can‚Äôt change like my skin color, my height and my facial features.

White people here in NYC are often attractive as well, so the discomfort is more - a direct correlation to how inferior I am to them. It‚Äôs because generally speaking white people and light skin is found to be attractive. It‚Äôs also because white people here and in general are wealthy and therefore have had access to healthier foods in their neighborhoods that they could afford, and likely have more time and more resources that aid in general life well being which reduces stress, likely are more fit because of the healthy foods and opportunities to play on sport teams etc. It also doesn‚Äôt help that white people are seen as the most attractive, so even if I did have a chance to find love, there‚Äôd be no point since white people are the most desired. I envy white men for being able to charm attractive women. Their facial structure could even be less attractive than mine, but their white skin is what saves them. Light skin is just attractive. Do you know how small I feel (especially as a man?) Being Brown. Brown skinned men like myself are short and often times ugly. Our darker skin alone is not seen as attractive as light skin. Our facial structures are less attractive too. On average, we are on the shorter side, which makes us less manly and attractive. White men are seen as more attractive because of their light and I guess because of their socioeconomic status and because of white supremacy norms or in other words - because they pushed the idea that they were the best because they have it all and created it all - others consciously and/or subconsciously bought into it and are attracted to this power and associate it with those looks. After all, we are attracted to people who can provide. Also, negative stereotypes don‚Äôt help people of my color. We‚Äôre known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly and ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù (not very assertive and submissive) and more things exclusive to the Indian or Middle Eastern nations‚Äô cultures. Brown people are really unattractive. A lot of our facial features aren't attractive, but it also has to do with racial conditioning/white supremacy/racism that‚Äôs rooted in our subconsciousness that influence what we find attractive - by that I mean beauty standards being Eurocentric.

Being Short doesn‚Äôt bother me all that much. It sucks. It only sucks a lot when coupled with the others - being a poor, brown, ugly minority. I guess it does suck because it‚Äôs the main thing on top of being ugly that prevents me from having a chance with women. It also makes me feel small around people. Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don‚Äôt want short men anyways. Growing up poor under immigrant parents and having less resources not only has led me to this mental health dilemma, but has also put me in a position where I have a hard time even trying to express how I‚Äôm feeling (bad verbal/written skills, also another insecurity - thing that makes me inferior and uncomfortable and also a thing that professionals and white people look down on)don‚Äôt know of terminology - like social justice stuff that aids in my expression, understanding and self development when it comes to this stuff. I‚Äôm tired of this. I‚Äôm also tired of having to see mental health doctors for my problems (other problems too) and also dislike being around doctors in general, police officers, people in authority in general and having mental health problems because I‚Äôm in a position where I‚Äôm beneath others.

I‚Äôve always had an identity crisis growing up because of feeling inferior to different people and being around different kinds of people. I felt inferior to the strong and tough african americans and latinos in my low income neighborhood, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. I felt inferior to the tall and attractive white people, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. Now I don‚Äôt really know who I am, how people see me and who exactly I want to be or what things would make me feel on par with others/would make others see me as on par or what my personality would be or want to be seen as or whose opinions or views of me should matter.

This last part I just added recently. I feel kind of uncomfortable around or when I think about or read or hear about people who are kinda sexually forward or ""excessively promiscuous"" (wasn't allowed to use a certain word here) or when people are intimate with one another and I can see it or when I suspect that someone who I walk by in person who I feel could be an actress in adult films (unfortunately because of all of this stuff in general, I too have preconceived notions about people based on their appearances. I feel like in the society we live in, it‚Äôs impossible to bypass that because stereotypes and whatever are everywhere.) I know that doesn‚Äôt make sense because I‚Äôve been watching adult material, but I guess that‚Äôs how I feel when I view it for what it is and not in an unconscious state for pleasure. The feeling is a strange one. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anger. It might be envy, but at the same time it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. It‚Äôs almost like a feeling of - this is wrong (even though sex and stuff are normal. Could it be that I feel inferior to someone who is promiscuous?). I wish I knew how to explain it better. It does stack on top of the envy I have for those people envy though there‚Äôs a lot more than what meets the eye like how the industry treats them bad as well as the professional world. I can‚Äôt just shake off the envy because... well what I envy about their situation is present and nothing more. Thoughts like these are almost a constant I feel because it‚Äôs such a big issue coupled with my insecurities about my image, but also because I feel as though the bad sleep I‚Äôm experiencing is making my mind a bit wonky. In class it was hard to concentrate because of these thoughts coming and going as well as the need to comprehend them and I guess come up with solutions.

Summary

I hate it all. (Not mentioned, but my home life and upbringing - verbal abuse, lack of resources, stupid parent, stupid single parent, underserved or nonexistent resources for low income neighborhood, no privacy, sadistic family members)(that I still have to be grateful and guilty because there are people who will look at me and think my problems are only a fraction of theirs), things I‚Äôm not even allowed to mention, Other insecurities of mine like my voice, body, Being ugly, being short, being a minority, not being good enough for love and more and being beneath others according to existing societal standards, beauty standards, people pretending to be who they aren‚Äôt, a superficial based society as a result of media brainwashing us that makes people alter themselves through lighting, makeup etc., white supremacy and its byproducts, professionalism (which is another way the elite separate themselves from the rest and define everyone else as inferior)(another way that forces people to become fake and superficial in order to please others. Resumes, speaking formally, dressing in clothing for interviews that has no value otherwise), the white, privileged and wealthy profiting off of the poor, ignorant minorities through business while putting on the facade of genuinely trying to help us while also making them look superior because it only emphasizes the class difference. (hate that I) envy those who have wealth, good looks that ‚Äúaward‚Äù them too many privileges one of which being the ability to earn money through modeling and adult films (even though the adult film industry isn‚Äôt pretty and is a toxic and manipulative and fake and ugly on the inside), envy and privileged people and my identity crisis. I‚Äôm tired of having been conditioned to feel inferior and to want to prove myself to others (when maybe I should be the one I should be proving things to.) Who do I want to be? What makes me feel good enough? What do I determine my value on without sugar coating things for myself in order to avoid feelings of inferiority altogether? How do I cope with my shitty circumstances for the rest of my life? How do I live with this anger and frustration?

Edit : 2/23/19 So today, I volunteered to join an organization that was tabling (had a table up at a place in hopes of handing out fliers and information to promote events and whatnot). (You might wonder why I even did this upon finishing reading this. I want to volunteer because I genuinely want to help the less fortunate, give back to the community and to give back to nature. I wouldn‚Äôt have put myself in such an uncomfortable position otherwise) It already started off as a bad day because I had gotten a shitty haircut. Another thing that gets in the way. No hair shape or style works on me on top of being ugly. Continuing on.. So the person I volunteer with is someone kinda extraordinary (I only know because I looked them up online, their linkedin account). They‚Äôve been involved in a myriad of extracurriculars, volunteering, internships, attended an amazing university, graduating with honors etc, speak 3 languages, supports themselves, isn‚Äôt even going to settle for the career they have now (which shows ambition and that they‚Äôre advancing and moving on in the future... this and this person in general is a good foil for me though in the sense that their existence highlights how little I do and am, how little I‚Äôve done and how much time is going by without me growing or making anything of it), once lived in one state and moved across the country to live in this state (showcases the ability to make a huge transition, plus showcases another experience/stage of life this person has undergone) is married, is under 25 years old, is a professional, is attractive, is kind, cares for the environment, is self aware, is ambitious, is talented... someone like that would be amazing to be around. It‚Äôs a privilege to be around someone so lucky and amazing... but it also feels like a punishment. I‚Äôm one hundred percent inferior to them no matter how I look at it. If I could live to be 200 I still would be inferior to them. A whole second lifetime and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to measure up to them. (why does inferiority matter so much, I don‚Äôt know. I suppose because we‚Äôre conditioned to want to fit in to have friends/love, so our value and appearance matter. Humans need one another. Stuff like professionalism, status, looks, etc. matter when looking for work - which earns money which earns freedom/time.

So yeah, I‚Äôm inferior to them, so I was uncomfortable around them. I was also uncomfortable because I didn‚Äôt have much to say because I‚Äôm not really cultured. I don‚Äôt do much or know much because of my upbringing whereas she and the other people I was with are a couple of years older than me and are cultured, accomplished, have had a lot of experiences, are really making the most of their time/are situated (job, home, etc.) I was also uncomfortable because I was supposed to help out but I didn‚Äôt really help out because I‚Äôm not a very social person and I didn‚Äôt have much to say because I don‚Äôt know much about the organization. I felt stupid too. She was trying to simplify things for me, but that act from her part only made me feel more inferior. She was nice, it‚Äôs just that on top of everything else, her knowing that I was uneasy made me feel even more small and inferior. In addition, there were many accomplished and/or white people who were coming to our table and were at the event which made me uncomfortable.

I just snuck out midway through the event and sent an email to her because I wasn‚Äôt going to further make myself look and feel inferior by explaining all of this to them, especially in person with my poor verbal skills. I‚Äôm already ashamed enough and am considering breaking up communication with them even though they‚Äôre helping me by inviting me to volunteer at events that would assist in furthering my college/career (especially since I‚Äôm a lousy 20 year old student at community college) Feeling inferior makes me anxious and the inferiority and anxiety made me depressed. I just had to leave. And so I did. I can‚Äôt change my circumstances, but I can work on myself to be on par with some people (though I‚Äôll never be on par with certain people). I can find ways to cope with stuff like this and everything else when I feel down because when it gets to the point of feeling depressed, it consumes me. I forget about the rest of the world and what‚Äôs amazing about it and then I feel like my life is over because I can‚Äôt have or be certain things. That‚Äôs not to say that all of this isn‚Äôt small in terms of the grand scheme of things. It‚Äôs very big. However there is more going on in the world. Things not mentioned: Shitty sleep, other health complications."
au37d8,9,2019-02-23,Need help with first Env Sci job out of school,boogito,Environmental_Careers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Environmental_Careers/comments/au37d8/need_help_with_first_env_sci_job_out_of_school/,"I graduated with a BSc in Environmental Sciences in June 2018.  Hoping to do a Masters in fall 2020 (this would depend if I'm working a job in the Env Sci world that I'm liking at the time, in which case masters could be postponed)  
I have some research assistant experience from during my degree but I haven't yet had my first ""real"" job in Env Sci since graduating.  Two weeks ago I decided to start a more serious job hunt, I'm applying to anything and everything in the environmental field Canada wide.    


I've only had two calls for interviews so far. One will be in early march for a summer seasonal gig, the other one I had this week and got a call yesterday with an offer! It's an internship that would have me going to a country in South America as a sustainability officer. In short, I would be helping develop the sustainability aspect of some projects out there that local in-country groups are working on.   


 Long term, I see myself working a job in sustainable community development or conservation, so jobs that are outreach, field work, lab work, etc.. any of it would be relevant.   


  
Questions! 

How important is the ""first"" job out of school?   


My hesitations with the internship (or any other seasonal position) is that its a 6 month position, and once it's done, it's done. Unlike a seasonal job within Canada, the internship can't be extended and it won't really help me build my network here (as opposed to even season gigs in canada can set you up with companies for future positions). It's also a lower paying position.  
The pros are obviously that it would be a very unique experience, its in sustainable development which is right up my alley and getting to live in another country.   


I was hoping that by the time my first offer came, I would have had a few interviews, have   
 better feel for what's out there. Am I better off waiting and continuing my job hunt? after all, something will surely come eventually. does the importance of building up a network outweigh the ""coolness"" factor of the abroad position?   


I'm sorry for the wall of text. I'm am overthinker and would just appreciate some opinions as I'm really unsure what to do.   


TLDR : first job offer is internship abroad, how important is building up a local network for a first env sci job? "

au3ydh,8,2019-02-23,Someone told me to post this her from around sub,burneraccount1995,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/au3ydh/someone_told_me_to_post_this_her_from_around_sub/,"I‚Äôm writing this because I am so sad this week and confused. I keep thinking what the hell happened.

My wife (F28) and I (M28) dated for two and half years before getting engaged. Overall we had a great relationship. She struggled with depression at times and it was something we worked together through when she was sad.

After we got engaged - everything changed. Her and I decided to move into my parents house while we were engaged to save money for our future. We live in one of the most expensive places in the country. She was in graduate school and had a non-paying internship and I was working at a startup so I could not afford to support both of us at the time. It is also worth noting that my family and fiance got along great. She spent a ton of time with them and I was so happy they all got along well.

It is worth noting at this point that my family did a lot for my fiance. Celebrated her birthday, job promotions and graduate school acceptances. They cooker her dinner almost every night and if they were making something she didn‚Äôt like then they would make her something that she did. They helped support us a lot.

My fiance slowly started to turn on my family while we were living with them. She would accuse my mother of comparing our wedding plans to my sister wedding that happened three months earlier. I did not see it this way and simply saw them using it as a reference. For example, my fiance would ask my mother, ‚ÄúHow much does a DJ cost?‚Äù and my mother would reply along the lines of, ‚ÄúWell when we were doing research for \[insert sisters name\]‚Äôs wedding we found that they cost around 2K.‚Äù My fiance would then get upset because that my mother brought up my sister wedding.

I did talk to my parents about this and through my eyes they did seem to stop bringing it up less but my fiance did not see it that way. I understand that I cannot hear everything. She eventually just completely stopped talking about our wedding in front of my parents.

My family offered to pay for the flowers for the wedding and told my fiance at the time that she could hire anyone she wanted to within the budget, but they didn‚Äôt want her to use the same florist that my sister used for her wedding because she did an absolutely terrible job and got everything wrong. My family explained they didn‚Äôt want to see that happen to my fiance and didn‚Äôt want to pay the lady again.

My fiance then went and meet the the florist behind everyones back including mine. She eventually told me and my family. My parents were upset, but if she really wanted to hire her they said she could. So my fiance hired her. She then invited my mother and grandmother to help her pick out flowers and they were both excited.

A month later my grandmother died unexpectedly. It crushed me and my whole family. Especially my mother - they were best friends.

Two months later when it came time to pick go pick out the flowers my fiance ditched my mother and went to the appointment. My mom even saw her that morning and asked what she was up to that day and she said just studying. My dad saw her as well and she lied to them also. It wasn‚Äôt until my family say my fiance mom outside of the house unexpectedly (her family lives 4 hours away) that they found out she was ditching my mom to go to the florist.

My mom wasn‚Äôt upset that she got disinvited she was more upset about her blatantly lying to them after all they had done for them. Honestly, if my fiance would have told my mom, ‚ÄúDo you care if I go with my mom instead.‚Äù My mom wouldn‚Äôt have had a problem with it.

Anyways my mom goes off on my fiance yelling at her and saying some mean things. My mom did not handle her mother's death well and wasn‚Äôt in a good place. I started yelling at my mother sticking up for my fiance. Our wedding was in 30 days at this point. They both apologized the next day and agreed to move forward, but my wife could not.

We moved out 7 days later.

After we got married my wife wanted to nothing to do with my family - she didn‚Äôt see them or talk to them for seven weeks after we got married.

My mom hosts Sunday dinner twice a month that last about an hour. Those dinners are important to me. After about seven weeks I asked my wife if she would go to a family dinner and she went off on me.

She told me we should have never gotten married. That she hates me. And marrying me was the worst decision of her life.

I was devastated to say the least.

Eventually she comes around and apologized. And agreed to go to a family dinner. Then a very clear patterned started to emerge.

1. We would go to family dinner
2. My wife would only speak when spoke to (unusual for her) and would never continue to the conversation.
3. After the family dinner she would have a melt down on me told me how she hated my family, wanted to divorce me and a bunch of other extremely hurtful things.
4. Fight for 24 hours to 5 days
5. Repeat every time there was family event

She eventually got diagnosed with depressions and got on some meds. Things got better for about two and half months before the same cycle started to occur. She eventually wanted me to stop talking to my mother.

After about 15 time her threatening to leave me and months of therapy. I decided I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

I would never leave someone because they didn‚Äôt like my family it was the fact that she would verbally attack me afterwards or stone wall me for days after being with them.

Also, I did a lot a support her over the years and never asked for anything in return. My only ask was that she just did look completely miserable at family dinners, but she couldn't do that. It was apparent she was hating every minute of it.

I moved out for three weeks. I came back and decided to give it another go. Things were better for about a month and she didn‚Äôt freak out at much when she saw my family.

During this time I found out she was texting another guy. It wasn‚Äôt sexting, but it was definitely not appropriate for being married. She had the guy listed as a women from her work in her phone - it even had the work as her place of employment.

I took this as a sign from god and left the relationship after 16 months of trying to make the marriage work - we were in therapy since month one.

Before we got engaged things were so great and after it all crumbled after the engagement.

I still can‚Äôt believe how bad it was and it all blew up. I‚Äôm not sure what I did wrong but I‚Äôm devastated and miss her a lot.

Sorry for the long post - I need to get this off my chest and just write."

Hey all! Yet another ""long-time lurker, first time poster."" I've never posted or even told anything like this, so please be nice. The ""sexy stuff"" is marked with ""at a later date."" Disclaimer: there is no sex in this story, sorry.

**Some backstory:** 

Several summers ago, I had an internship in another state where I got to live on-site. Right off the bat, I was incredibly attracted to my boss's son (he was 20 at the time, I was 18) and we ended up dating. Unfortunately, I had to move back home after only 2 weeks (3 dates) of ""officially"" dating, so we didn't get too far physically. Just the basic kissing/cuddling/cute new couple stuff. Once I moved back home and then to school, we FaceTimed almost every night. Since we were obviously lacking in physical attention, we spent a lot of time talking about personal/sexual preferences, what we'd do if we were together or next time we saw each other, etc etc etc. He visited me over Labor Day weekend, but we didn't do much beyond kissing and light grinding. All of this is just creating tension and frustration to be dealt with ""at a later date.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Descriptions:**

 ""James"" (name changed for anonymity): 20, 6'4""ish, very lean, muscular but not chiseled, full but short and well-maintained beard. To this day still the most attractive man I've met. 

Me: 18, 5'9"", 135 lbs, 34DDD, short blonde hair.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**""At a later date""**

 Fast forward to December, when I visited for the week before Christmas. He picked me up from the airport, and from the second we got in the car we couldn't keep off each other. Finally got home, I showered the ""airplane stench"" off me and we hung out with his family for a while. Since it'd been a long day, I opted to hit the hay rather than hang more with him, creating more tension somewhat intentionally.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night was a different story. We headed to the basement as soon as dinner was over to watch my favorite movie, Phantom of the Opera, as he'd never seen it. We made it all the way to the ""All I Ask of You"" scene, which has forever been a turn-on for me. We started kissing, and I took the opportunity to point out that he'd promised me a massage several times over FaceTime and that I was stiff from the plane ride. Obviously, he didn't take much convincing and was very eager to begin rubbing my body, starting at my neck and shoulders and working his way down. As he got to the level of my boobs, he started conservatively, staying focused on my back. I moved my arms a bit away from my body to allow more room for his hands to wander, which he shyly took. I could tell that my bra was sort of in the way, so I slid out from under him to toss it to the side. This worked like a light switch.

&amp;#x200B;

Sans bra and slightly bolder, James worked his way down and around my back and sides, leaving no millimeter untouched. When he got to my pants, he started working his way back up, knowing that I was incredibly modest and not one for groping right out the gate. After all, I was there a week and there was more than enough time to explore :) That being said, on his way back up, he got much bolder and started brushing the sides of my boobs lightly at first, then when met by approval by me, a bit harder. He leaned down and started kissing the back of my neck and around to my chin, and I flipped over under him to facilitate making out. We're both huge fans of being rough and wasted no time dancing with our tongues, biting each others' lips, working our way down. After a bit, he asked if I wanted to try being on top. I agreed and with some amateur yoga moves, we swapped.

&amp;#x200B;

Not missing a beat, we got right back into it, and I discovered a new side of me. Feeling bold and empowered, I broke the kiss to start kissing and biting along his jawline, up to the ear, down to his chest. From our hundreds of FaceTimes, I knew he was into kisses and teasing on his torso, so I kissed all over in designs and patterns worthy of a display in the Louvre. Now below the belly button and still getting ""yes""s and gasps of approval, I dipped my tongue just a bit into his waistband, which was met with shock and what I read as glee, as it was by far the boldest thing we'd ever done. I looked up at him with a smirk, asking for the ""okay."" James pulled me up to his face, and kissed me before flipping me over so I was back on bottom. Guess you can only get so far in one night.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, there's 6 more nights of content, which do get steamier, as I get that this is pretty tame. If y'all liked this, our story, or my writing, let me know and I'd love to write the others up! If not, that's cool too and I might anyway. Thanks for reading."

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

I will likely get into the program where I'm doing my master's degree, but the group I'm with is doing biomedical NLP specifically and aren't well connected to the NLP field (especially those working on machine learning). Should I stay here for my PhD or wait and apply again later?**

Hey all

Wanted to get the community's input on my current situation and see what people think, especially regarding the importance of who you work with and the group that you are in during your PhD. Some background:

I'm currently finishing my master's in computer science at a pretty decent school (top 15). My main research interests are in NLP and machine learning. I've spent the past year doing biomedical NLP and machine learning research. I published two papers during my master's (one first author) but not at top conferences. Prior to my masters I worked in industry as a software engineer for 2.5 years, and during my undergrad I did research for two years on some applied machine learning and published 6 papers (one as first author, again not at top venues). When I applied for grad school straight out of undergrad, I was rejected by every program (Stanford, UW, UCSD, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, and MIT). I tried again next year, and was again rejected by every PhD program but was accepted by the one master's program to which I applied. Looking back I understand why I was rejected (I was definitely not high enough caliber to get in at the time). Now I've applied again to PhD programs, and it is looking like I will again be rejected by all of them (NYU CDS, Columbia, Stanford, UW, MIT, CMU, UT Austin, and UCSD). I picked those schools specifically for the mentorship I would receive and the types of problems being worked on there. However, I will most likely be able to transfer into the PhD program at my current school.

I'm still certain that I want to pursue a PhD; I love exploring NLP and machine learning, and enjoy asking interesting research questions and discovering new knowledge in the process of answering those questions. If I stay in my current lab, I will most likely be able to continue doing that. Additionally, I ultimately want to become a professor and do research/teach. I have funding on my current project, and will potentially be able to get a decent fellowship through our industry partners. I will also be doing a research internship in industry this summer which will hopefully open some more doors.

My biggest concern is that my current lab is not well connected to the larger field of NLP. My advisor publishes mostly in bioinformatics journals and conferences, while I'm more interested in conferences such as NeurIPS, ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, AAAI and the like. They are currently trying to break into those communities but as of now they are not well connected and have limited history with publishing at those venues. Additionally, I'm somewhat siloed from the main NLP group on campus. I had briefly worked with one of the NLP profs on a project for a quarter but they did not continue our work due to ""resource constraints"" (in reality there was a difference in communication styles so we just didn't mesh very well).

So I guess the main things I need input on are: do I stay in my current lab for my PhD or do I try to improve my publication record this/next year, get better connected with the community, and apply again in the future? If I wait and apply again, what should be my course of action in the mean time (I'd like to continue doing research somehow or at least be doing something to advance my research goals)? How important is who you work with during your PhD? Will staying in a not well connected lab lead to limited prospects after my PhD (in terms of post-doc, industry labs, etc.)? Is it possible to have a satisfying career in this field without being in a top lab? I guess that last question depends on how you gauge satisfaction, which to me mostly lies in working on problems I consider interesting and exciting, but also that other people consider interesting as measured by publication in good (top) venues.

As a side note, my GPA is definitely not the issue (4.0 in undergrad, 3.92 in master's), my master's program is generally considered ""elite"", and my GRE is not too terrible (159/165/4 V/Q/W).

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you got this far :) any input is appreciated!"

Okay a little backstory: so back in 2016 I was very excited to go to live in southern England for a year as an au pair both because of my love for the language and because I was pretty burned out from school. I was 20 years old at the time and I really liked my first host family(except the mum made me do more and more chores, but this story is not about them) but after 2,5 months it was revealed at my host mum was pregnant and they wanted to get a full time nanny with infant care experience as the mum wanted to go straight back to work at a hospital in London as soon as the baby was born. They were nice about it though and helped me find a new host family: dad lawyer, mum previously lawyer now owning a small personal fitness centre and their four kids: J(boy 10), N(boy 8), E(girl 7) and A(girl 2).
The family was fine and seemed nice at first and I had a whole basement to myself with my own toilet, but it didn‚Äôt last
The mum always seemed nice and seemed to really appreciate the things I did and often thanked me, the dad seemed to think he was way better than me and always complained about what I did or didn‚Äôt do, so slowly the kids started losing their respect for me because how can they respect me when clearly their dad can‚Äôt? The kids had iPads and four tv‚Äôs so the first thing they did when I‚Äôd gotten them home from school(where the older ones would literally run in three different directions to avoid going home) was to turn them on, even though we‚Äôd made the rule:homework first, then tv/play. At one point E decided that she didn‚Äôt want to do homework and just grabbed the remote for the tv and turned it on every time I turned it off(button on the side of the tv) yelling that I wasn‚Äôt the boss of her and that she would tell her dad that I hit her if I didn‚Äôt let her watch tv! Meanwhile I once again shot off the tv and told her that she can watch tv when she‚Äôs finished her homework or not at all. This pushed her over the edge and she threw the tv remote into the table so it bounced down on the floor and luckily didn‚Äôt break completely but got a crack. E then just ran into J and N who were doing their homework in the living room yelling that I was hitting her ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è later when the dad came home E told him that I had been hitting her and the dad came to me but I explained to him what had happened and he did nothing more -no consequences for her either... i also experienced the dad telling me off and yelling at me in front of the kids because N and E again had refused to do their homework until he came home and told them to do it or else... the kids had these huge grins on their faces while I felt like a little kid while being verbally assaulted by the father.
 the big bin had bin out by the road for a few days(four apartments in the house we lived in on the countryside, East, 2, 3 and west ‚Äúname of house‚Äù) we lived in E and therefore out bin had an E on the side, but the one with 3 was the one left there so it never occurred to me that ours might be missing as we couldn‚Äôt see the bins from the house. Anyways he yelled at me because I hadn‚Äôt brought it back in(which was like his only chore) and I just accepted it all because I didn‚Äôt want to give the kids the idea that it was okay to talk back. When the dad was done yelling at me I tried to lift the mood by telling the kids that I had seen four foxes in the garden that day(I‚Äôm danish I had never seen a fox before so I was quite excited about it) this only led to the dad starting over on yelling at me because apparently the dad had left some bags of rubbish out behind a shed and they would‚Äôve been digging in that, he says that any idiot with a brain knew that foxes are as bad as rats and now I was my fault that they had been here and possibly would be back again later...
another instance that actually happened a few times was that when I collected the four kids from school and drove home on the motorway N and E would undo each other‚Äôs seatbelts! They then refused to do them again and even undid A‚Äôs seatbelt as well! I was terrified and pulled over as soon as I had left the motorway shortly after, turned around to face them and tried to explain that they shouldn‚Äôt take off their seatbelts while driving because it‚Äôs dangerous. N‚Äôs response was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù... that was actually his response I many things. I of course did also inform both parents about what had happened when the kids was in bed, the mum sounded a bit worried, the dad, not really. 
I also weren‚Äôt allowed to take away the kids‚Äô toys or privileges in any way when they misbehaved so the only thing I could do was to call the parents which at one point led to the dad telling me to run after N outside barefoot in snow because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have shoes near the door as they would take up space(the kids and parents had all their shoes out on the floor but I wasn‚Äôt allowed one pair) he ran to the very back of the garden, through some bushes up on the main road and back inside where he locked the door so I couldn‚Äôt get in! The dad who was still on the phone just sighed and said that if I couldn‚Äôt get N on the phone to be told off then I should stop wasting his time and then he hung up... I was locked out and standing in snow wearing only very wet and cold socks... eventually J led me in through a window and we nearly didn‚Äôt make it in time for school that day! 

I survived there for nearly 9 weeks (came nov 22nd and left feb 3rd but had two weeks at home for the holidays) and was fired a week after my birthday(where they took me out for the grandparents‚Äôs anniversary and had me babysit the kids and their cousins for free -10 kids in total age 2-11!)and was kicked out with 36 hours notice as the dad said he wanted to do some diy in the basement in the weekend and therefore I had to be out -turned out that in reality it was because that‚Äôs when their new male au pair would arrive
Also they wouldn‚Äôt write me a recommendation ‚Äúfor obvious reasons‚Äù they really made it sound as if I had been assaulting their kids or something! As a bonus they owed me like ¬£360 for two weeks of work, babysitting and the plane ticket but they didn‚Äôt give them to me. 
I was home in Denmark for three weeks where I found an internship to start in the summer and a new host family to live with in Swindon until then. I also kept on writing the mum and dad using the whole ‚Äúfake English politeness‚Äù as best as I could and just tried to be annoying in general despite my mother telling me that I would probably never see the money and it would probably be better to move on. I didn‚Äôt though, I started writing to the host mum as the host dad just kept ignoring me, I would be like ‚Äúhi (mum) I hope you‚Äôre well :) I just wondered if you know if (dad) has seen my messages? He hasn‚Äôt answered me for a week now so I believe that he must‚Äôve forgotten :) sincerely (me)
The first day at me new amazing host family the old one suddenly transferred ¬£280 to my account because apparently I had managed to be annoying enough for them to pay a big part of what they owed me. I texted them a thank you and a smiley face and never heard back from them again - I did get to spend 5 amazing months with my lovely host family and we still stay in touch even though they‚Äôve moved to Canada, but I‚Äôm looking into visiting them this summer üòä thanks for reading my very long story, I suddenly realise that it never occurred to me exactly how much shit they put me through!

What is the worst thing that happened when you or someone you know were an au a pair?"
au64cv,2,2019-02-24,Possible job offers while currently employed,ealbert191,Employment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Employment/comments/au64cv/possible_job_offers_while_currently_employed/,"I graduated about a while ago and was offered a job where I was completing my second internship. As an intern in one department, it was great and I loved it. The department I became employed in was terrible. The boss left two weeks in and him being amazing was a big reason I was willing to move to that side. When he left, his boss took over who we all hated. So things sucked. 

About two months in I began looking for jobs (October). By the end of the month I had an offer. I gave my two weeks and left, and have been at my current job since November, so not long at all. 

I like my job a lot. It is fairly easy and my staff and I get along. I can request time off pretty easily. It is a nonprofit so the pay isn't exactly great (took a small pay cut to move out of the job I hated) but I'm not too bothered by it because overall I feel well compensated for the challenge level of the work. I'm much happier here. 

This week I have received two job offers that pay significantly more than what I currently make. One was a job I interviewed for and didn't get, so I was placed on a registry in case another position opened. It did, and they wanted me to continue through the hiring process with a conditional offer. The other was my first internship, calling to tell me they finally had a full time opening that I had expressed interest in and asking for me to come in for an interview. 

I currently make about 35k per year. The first offer would end up between 60 and 70k per year, and the second offer is 58-65k. 

I am not interested in moving to the second job currently, as it is very similar to my job but with a lot more paperwork and much less flexible hours, which wouldn't really make the pay increase that worth it. The first offer was almost a dream come true job. It was in my career path with the demographic I desire to work with in social work, and I was really bummed that I originally didn't get it (which I when I took my current job). 

If they made me an offer, I would kind of like to take it. However, I feel a sense of duty or loyalty to my current job as I know they have a hard time keeping staff and turnover is pretty high there. I also really do like my current job and wouldn't be unhappy staying with them for the time being. It's definitely not a long term career move for me though, and I wouldn't see myself here more that 1-2 years. 

I know my resume would look bad with job hopping. I have had a few long term jobs of 1-2 years, but recently because of constant moving due to DH's Job my stints are shorter. I also have been told company loyalty is no longer a huge thing because you'll get better money moving around. 

I'm just hoping for some more qualified opinions here. I am 22 if that matters, so I'm pretty new to jobs that are full time post-college and not me working after school. 

Thanks in advance! "

&amp;#x200B;

I'm studying OR in France and currently looking for a 6 months internship in the OR/Optimization field at a company. The problem is that almost every internship is at a university. I've nothing against universities but the thing is that they pay less the interns and I need the money lol.

Anyone have any idea about companies that might be hiring interns in this field in France ?

Thanks :)"

au97e5,72,2019-02-24,"Connecticut is honoring their 1999 National Championship team today at their game against Cinci, so I figured to take a trip down memory lane and talk about a little about the 1999 team.",I_LIKE_TOM_BRADY,CollegeBasketball,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/au97e5/connecticut_is_honoring_their_1999_national/,"‚ÄúYES, UCONN!‚Äù is a term that was coined after Connecticut's first championship victory in 1999. It‚Äôs a play on words meaning ‚Äúyes, you can (win a championship).‚Äù After a decade filled with [getting so close](https://youtu.be/4DD2fEEVVMk) to the final four, Jim Calhoun, his Huskies, and the state of Connecticut finally got to celebrate the ultimate victory.

Leading up the big game, the storyline was about what you‚Äôd expect. Duke was flexing star power similar to how they are today. They had Shane Battier, who would eventually become a sixth overall draft pick, an NBA champion, and one of the most prolific 3 point shooters in history. They had Elton Brand, an unstoppable big man, the number one overall draft pick in 1999 who had a long and successful career in the NBA. They had Trajan Langdon, a long SG and consensus 2nd team all American while at Duke, drafted 14th overall and didn‚Äôt quite pan out in the NBA as expected but had a great overseas career. They had Corey Maggette, a McDonald‚Äôs all American SF, who went 13th overall. You get the picture, Duke was good and I'd say this was one of Coach K's greatest teams in history and smoked everyone in their path on the way to the final 4 and came in as 9.5 favorites (!!) to beat a Connecticut team that finished their season at a ridiculous 34-2 and were Big East regular season and tournament champions. It was one of the most lopsided betting lines in championship history. Some people might say we had no business winning this game.

On the other hand, Connecticut had some great players, but from a talent perspective we were clearly outmatched. Our best player was Richard Hamilton, better off known as Rip now. In his UConn days, most people referred to him as Richard. I think he became Rip in the NBA. People look at me funny when I refer to him as Richard but that‚Äôs just how I remember him haha. My first ever favorite basketball player, Hamilton tore up Duke's defense, and dropped 27 points on them. He had an amazing career in the NBA and was part of the Pistons team that beat the Lakers in the 2004 finals, which lead to the break up of Kobe and Shaq. The Pistons were considered to be huge underdogs in that series, which goes to show you that Richard thrives when people count him out. 

Another great player for Connecticut was Khalid El-Amin. He played second fiddle to Hamilton in winning this title. A junior point guard who has been mostly lost in history due to the fact he had only a very short stint in the NBA. However, his overseas career was about as successful as it possibly could‚Äôve been as his career lasted 17 years! Very rare to see overseas careers last that long. His [shock the world quote]( https://youtu.be/F1l2qJMtmhA) is still talked about by Connecticut fans today and personally it gives me chills whenever I see the video. He came through big on his promise. El-Amin was up and down during the tournament (didn't score once in the elite 8 game vs Gonzaga), but came through in the title game big time. Hitting a late floater and sealing the game with a couple of free throws. El-Amin ended up on David Letterman after winning the title. I love [this interview](https://youtu.be/G5XYyEWGZ9I) because it shows El-Amin has a great personality. El-Amin asked Letterman for a summer internship, but Letterman wouldn‚Äôt commit to offering him one lol.

Connecticut also had Jake Voskhul who was a solid starting Center for us and went on to have a successful NBA career and Ricky Moore who made one of the most important stops in UConn history against Langdon. Fun fact: Moore was an assistant coach on the 2014 squad that won the title, so he‚Äôs got 2 rings with UConn.

To wrap this up, this team is very special to me and to the state on Connecticut. This team put us on the map and for once everyone in country was talking about us. I was only 6 years old when we won this title and I obviously don‚Äôt remember much, but what I can remember is watching games throughout the season and couldn‚Äôt believe that this team called Connecticut won nearly every single game when we put the TV on. The men and women Huskies influenced so many little boys and girls in the state to play basketball, myself included. Anyway, I‚Äôm super excited to be in attendance today while this team gets honored. 

Go Huskies!

au9nze,3,2019-02-24,"Step dad has been mad at my husband for months for something supposedly under the bridge, but never told us husbands apology wasnt valid to him. When helping some of our friends move, he brought up to them all the shit, and hung up on me when confronted.",menstropy,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/au9nze/step_dad_has_been_mad_at_my_husband_for_months/,"Back story I guess, my mom has been single for a long time, and married NSD (Nar. Step dad) several years ago. (On mobile, apologize for formatting). Around August, my husband made a comment while playing a game with them that was a bit rude, even for dealing with a narcissist. He apologized enough to not enable NSD to think it was his world, of course he caught on though that ""I'm sorry I offended you, that was not my intention"" wasnt good enough for him.

We've gone months now with him not mentioning anything about this to us, just that he graciously let it slide during the holiday but my husband is still not allowed in their home because he was insulting. NSD had more than enough right to come over the table at him, snap his neck, on and on.

The friends of mine he was talking to know quite a bit about my life, and let it slip that I had been talking to my birth dad, who I only recently got in contact with in December. This was news to Rick (my mom knew and didnt tell him) which set him off. He began going into how it was obvious to him that I started talking to birth dad about a year ago because that's when I stopped talking to him as much. Also, my husband and i got married 9 months ago, and ever since, my husband has taken me away from them. This sent him on a train with rumors about him, me, and kind of solidifying my suspicions of him being deathly insecure.

He also started rumors to my friends (who told me, which is why we're having this confrontation at all) that I wasnt pure when we got married, we arent active in our church, along with ridiculous claims that are completely normal for him to make. He has a contact in the Pentagon that told him my husband didnt get an internship with the NSA because he failed his psych exam (he never took a psych exam). He also claims to be the mastermind behind Deadpool, he's best friends with Ryan Reynolds as well as has two bachelors degrees, is a chef, voice over actor, but is disabled and uses that as a constant excuse for everything.

I called last night as soon as I heard everything to confront him. He confirmed everything about needing a better apology (I hadnt let on that I knew everything else he said). As soon as I called him out for saying I wasnt a virgin when I got married, he hung up on me. Will be calling him today to set expectations that will be met or we wont have a relationship with him. 

Asking for support, advice on dealing with NSD, any helpful things that have helped for you in the past.

A fear of mine is that my mom will do as she usually does and just go along with what he says. Shes generally strong willed, but hes so demanding and annoying, shes been saying yes dear since they got married. I'm confident I can still call her and maintain a relationship despite this all going south.

I understand that it‚Äôs a big ask, but without this I‚Äôm genuinely not going to be able to even make it to work and school, let alone anything else over the next few weeks..

auahge,3,2019-02-24,Second bachelor's from CSUCI? Was it worthwhile? Enjoyable?,LowPainThreshold,csuci,https://www.reddit.com/r/csuci/comments/auahge/second_bachelors_from_csuci_was_it_worthwhile/,"I have a BS in Physics, and minors in Stats and Maths from CSULB with a high GPA earned this year, so I'm not really concerned about getting in. I'm curious if anyone earned a second Bachelor's from CSUCI and how they enjoyed the experience. Was it difficult to get classes? Did prerequisites get in the way or did you get exceptions? Were you allowed to have a minor? How long did it take to earn the second Bachelor's?

I'm trying to decide wether to get a Bachelor's in Computer Science or go for a Masters. I'm leaning towards Bachelor's because I am highly specialized in C++ and feel I am lacking fundamentals, as well as experience in other disciplines and languages. (I worked as an intern in game programming for a bit and am pursuing this interest but I have no school experience with comp sci.)

Also, if anyone took any classes in or did the game design minor, how was your experience?"

 I was diagnosed with social anxiety 2 years ago and that isn‚Äôt really helping. I got a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù about 8 months ago but she‚Äôs on the internet and I really want a real friend, 

I‚Äôve tried getting a internship but people were much older then me,I tried being in a riding club for people with autism, but the other kids with autism were people with really bad autism and they just annoyed me because they could barely even keep them self‚Äôs on the horses, I also tried being in a club in school but none of the other kids would give me they‚Äôre number. 

I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I‚Äôm just really fucking unbearable to be around or something. I mean if no one wants to be my friend maybe I‚Äôm just a asshole, I‚Äôm just so close to giving up and I just can‚Äôt relate to other people my age what am I doing wrong

When I try to talk people I just know I bore them

Please help me how can I get out of this terrible hole with no friends

It definitely seems like there is interest in this series, so I'll keep it rolling with my reaction to Chapter 2 of Open Heart. I promise to keep this series going with one exception: there is a high probability I will quit this book if a patient becomes a LI. That behavior is so wildly inappropriate and goes against every moral and ethical code out there. Docs legit lose their license if they date a patient. I know this is fiction, but that plotline would make me feel really gross, and I honestly will probably stop the book if that happens. Otherwise, I'll keep trucking along no matter what else they throw at me. I can't really promise a consistent posting schedule, but I'll write these up as soon as I can after chapters are released.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I forgot to mention last time, but feel free to ask any questions. Whether I use an abbreviation or word that is unclear or if you just are curious or want something clarified, I'm happy to answer any questions!

&amp;#x200B;

Chapter 2 picks up right where Chapter 1 left off, with the patient unresponsive and the monitor showing a flatline. The first thing MC does is start CPR. Excellent. Getting on the chest and starting compressions right away is super important. MC has done the two most important first steps 1) call a code and 2) start compressions. This is a pretty impressive performance already, seeing as the most realistic initial response to a cardiac arrest on the first day of intern year would likely be panicking in the corner or crapping one's pants. The one thing that MC should have done is check to make sure the patient actually doesn't have a heart beat by checking a pulse. A monitor showing a flatline and an unresponsive patient are highly concerning for cardiac arrest, but there could be various reasons the monitor is not picking up a heart rate while the heart is actually still beating.

&amp;#x200B;

Jackie pokes her head in, presumably because she's wondering who called this second code and was checking to see if they needed any help. That's right, another room called a code right before MC. Given the size of most teaching hospitals and the number of patients they care for, this is not an unheard of occurrence. That is why hospitals have plans in place for simultaneous code blues. At every hospital I've been at or rotated through as a med student and resident, there is a secondary code team that is activated if another code is called while the primary code team is still involved with a code. For some reason, Edenbrook seems to be very ill prepared for such an event. We now have two baby interns running a code by themselves. Just effin' perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

This is definitely going to be a M&amp;M (morbidity and mortality) presentation at this institution. The fact that this hospital has no back up plan for this situation is appalling. What's even worse is that no one comes by to help these two interns. Even though MC has pretty much been working independently for most of the day, her patients are all covered by an attending, and the buck absolutely stops with him or her. He or she is responsible for everything that happens to these patients, so if they hear an announcement for a code blue over the paging system for their room number, you better bet they're running. Barring that, even someone not directly linked to this patient should be coming in to see how things are going, particularly since it's July 1st. The first code I ever saw as a med student occurred when I was talking in the hallway with my attending and we saw a nurse running to grab the code cart. We took off sprinting after her to make sure that no one needed an extra set of hands. We were not on call or the code team, but we saw someone who looked like they might need some help. Most health care professionals would do the same thing. The fact that no one, not a random senior resident or attending who happens to be in this unit swings by is insane to me. The only one who comes by to do this is Jackie, who is literally in the same position as MC. Girl must have ovaries of steel to step up to the plate like this with less than 12 hours of experience under her belt.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also surprised no nurses came in to see who is here running the code. You see, on July 1 of your intern year, literally every nurse is more experienced then you. Even though there is very little they can do without you putting in orders on your patient, they often are significantly more confident in how to manage patients for the first stretch of your intern year. Some of these nurses have been working for 20+ years. They have seen hundreds of interns come in and fuck shit up on July 1. They are on high alert, making sure you don't kill their patients. I guarantee that some of the nurses on this unit could have provided some guidance for these two newbies. At the very least, they could have helped with any procedures that needed to occur, such as placing additional IVs or drawing up doses of medication, recorded the order of events of the code to help with documenting the event later, or even just kept track of the time, as certain medications in a code situation can only be given every 3-5 minutes. Hell, they could swap out for whoever is providing chest compressions, because actually giving compressions is hard work. The goal is 2 inches of compression at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, which is exhausting after a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is no help for Jackie and MC at Edenbrook. They are gonna have to do this shit by themselves. They start by attempting to diagnose the underlying issue. I understand their temptation to do so, but this is jumping way ahead in the cardiac arrest algorithm, which puts an emphasis on early cardiac management and stabilization over determining the underlying cause. Yes, there is an algorithm for how to manage a cardiac arrest. It is called ACLS (advanced cardiovascular life support), and yes, there is a flowchart. I carry a copy of the pediatric version of this algorithm (PALS, or pediatric advanced life support) with me in the hospital. ""But ArgyleMN, shouldn't you know how to manage critically ill patients without a cheat sheet?"" I can hear some of you asking. Nope, when it is a high stress situation, I do not trust my memory. I am going to use a resource that will ensure I provide the highest quality of care to my patients. I'm not going to let my pride be the cause of an error.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if Jackie and MC never got their copies of their ACLS cards at orientation or they are just stressing too much to think to pull one out, but they are attempting to run this code from memory. Given that it is literally their first time doing it, they are gonna make a lot of mistakes. Like I discussed above, they are spending a lot of time discussing why the patient went into cardiac arrest. There are numerous key steps they should be doing first. They should be grabbing the code cart (which will contain not only the defibrillator, but also commonly used medications in a code, intubation supplies, and a backboard to slide under the patient for better quality chest compressions), analyzing the rhythm shown by the heart monitor, and ventilating the patient in addition to the chest compressions I assume MC is still performing. There are literally only two of them. Four hands. There is only so much they can do. Realistically, one of them should be performing chest compression while the other ventilates the patient via bag-mask ventilation. As you can see, that basically ties up all their hands. There is no one available to give medications, shock the patient (if the rhythm is a shockable one), or place an IV. This is why code teams have so many members. There are a lot of things that need to occur at the same time during a code.

&amp;#x200B;

MC and Jackie, bless their little hearts, are floundering around the best they can. Both of them have completely forgotten about the airway, so no one is ventilating the patient at this point. In fact, no one brings up airway management until after the patient has a normal pulse again. Oops! Jackie figures out pretty quickly that the patient must have had an allergic reaction to the antibiotic. It's a good pickup, one that probably should have occurred to MC, but we'll give her a day 1 stress-related pass. I actually want to give credit to PB for having the two choices for MC when she realizes that her order caused this to happen be pretty unproductive statements. She can either express guilt that it was all her fault or become defensive asking how she should have known. Neither one is the most healthy response to the situation, but they are pretty realistic for a new intern, so I'm granting some realism points here. My MC gets defensive. An attending already shit on her today, so she's not ready to take the blame here when she asked about drug allergies. Jackie agrees that MC couldn't have known, but correctly states that it doesn't really matter at this point if the anaphylaxis was preventable. They just have to treat it now.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things go off the rails. I kind of assumed either Jackie or MC would suggest epinephrine (the medication in an EpiPen) to treat the allergic reaction. Not only is it a treatment that is common enough that a decent number of non-medical individuals would think about it, but it has the added benefit of being a part of the ACLS algorithm. It was wishful thinking on my part that thoughts of epinephrine would trigger one or both of them to start following the cardiac arrest flowchart. Alas, they are both way too stressed to take a breath and think things through. They are charging full steam ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

Jackie is the one to suggest using the defibrillator, so even though I give her all the credit in the world for diving into this code, this is a terrible call on her part. This patient is flatlining, which is consistent with the arrhythmia called [asystole](https://pcs12.azureedge.net/ekgtracings/33.gif). Asystole is not a shockable rhythm. To plagiarize from myself in some of my other comments I've posted on this chapter, there are a handful of different rhythms that you can see on a monitor when a patient is in cardiac arrest. Two of them (ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, commonly shortened to [v fib](https://i0.wp.com/bossrn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VFIB-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C382&amp;ssl=1) and [v tach](https://www.ecgguru.com/sites/default/files/165%20V%20Tach.jpg)) are the ""shockable"" rhythms. The electrical abnormalities in these arrhythmias can be corrected by a large burst of externally applied electrical current.  Asystole and another arrhythmia called pulseless electrical activity, or [PEA](https://nhcps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/acls-rhythm-reversible-causes.jpg), are non-shockable rhythms. You can try to shock them, but it is not going to correct the arrhythmia. Both Jackie and MC should know the difference between a shockable and non-shockable rhythm.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of how appropriate it is, these two have decided they are going to defib this patient. Jackie suggests a starting voltage of 300V. Now, in the peds world, I'm used to weight-based voltages, but I'm pretty sure 200V is a more common starting level, but 300V is not an insane number or anything. Defibs usually max out at 360V. Jackie takes over chest compressions while MC runs to grab the code cart, which is a nice detail. In addition to not having a sufficient number of code teams, Edenbrook apparently has pretty outdated defibrillators. Most hospitals now have defibrillators with adhesive disposable pads instead of the paddles you have to apply to gel to and manually hold on the patient's chest. The adhesive patches are nice because they do not require a person to reposition the paddles every time a shock is delivered, an awkward endeavor that often interrupts the chest compressions. They also allow all providers to fully stand clear of the patient at the time of shock delivery, reducing the risk of accidentally conducting the charge to a provider. But MC is stuck with this older defibrillator. She tears open the patient's gown before grabbing the paddles and applying the gel. Jackie pauses compressions while MC is applying the gel, which is a common mistake. She shouldn't stop compressions until MC is telling her to get clear of the body. MC places the right paddle in a good spot, but the left paddle is a little high if it is right under that left armpit. It could be along the side, but it should be just below the level of the patient's breast. MC chooses 300V as her charge (30V is oddly enough much more common in my world) and yells to clear the patient. They are doing this; they are defibing asystole.

&amp;#x200B;

MC jumps right back on the chest with compressions as soon as she delivers the shock, which is absolutely the correct thing to do (well, obviously the shock was incorrect, but in situations where you deliver a shock, resuming compressions immediately is appropriate management). Somehow, the monitor shows normal electrical activity after a few seconds. I would encourage either MC or Jackie to check a pulse here. PEA looks like normal conduction, but there would be no pulse it the rhythm changed to that arrhythmia. For some reason, MC continues compressions even though a normal heart rate has resumed. All that is going to do is break a rib. *Now* MC brings up intubation and giving epinephrine. In general, their post-arrest care is horrific and mainly consists of things they should have been doing instead of shocking the patient when the patient didn't have a heart rate. Lord knows how Annie survived this, but MC should seriously consider writing her up as a case study.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, as soon as the heart rate is back, Dr. Ramsey strolls on in, and he is all sorts of fired up. MC immediately summarizes the situation by telling him that the patient was allergic to the antibiotics. Dr. Ramsey seems to like MC's ownership of the problem, but oddly implies that she could have been more cautious. I'm not sure what he's getting at here. Yes, he is right to remind her that even drugs that seem as innocent as antibiotics can have deadly side effects, but MC was concerned for bacteremia. That isn't really a diagnosis you can just hope a patient will clear on their own. Jackie finally gives some epinephrine, but she uses an EpiPen instead of drawing it up from a vial, which would be far more likely to be the dosage form available in the code cart.

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Ramsey then completely slides back into being Dr. Asshole, bitching at MC for not being able to handle the code on her own. As I described above, even with two sets of hands, MC and Jackie couldn't do everything on the ACLS algorithm. How this douchebag expects one person to do it all is beyond me. If he wants to act as a one-doc code team, he's gonna kill a lot of patients. MC is seething mad, as Dr. Asshole heaps praise on Jackie, but her anger is reserved for Dr. Asshole alone. Jackie was the only one in the entire hospital who came to help, so MC has no problem with her. MC figures that Dr. Asshole is just going to shit on her some more if she whines about how she was vital in the code, too, so she just thanks Jackie for her help. This fuckwad is going to find some way to make this all her fault regardless, so might as well let a colleague get some credit. Dr. Asshole reminds her of all of her least favorite attendings in med school (most of them surgeons). He cements himself in that role as he proceeds to rip her a new one, basically saying she should reconsider if she is cut out to be a doctor since she didn't run a code perfectly by herself on day one. He also decides to vaguely threaten MC that she needs to figure out the diagnosis by the next time he sees her. Is this his patient? If so, he should have been there for the code. If not, he should not be getting involved with non-emergent management.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the character I most strongly identify with, Sienna. She rescues MC from getting chewed out by Dr. Asshole, calls for intern solidarity, and is strongly anti-gunner. She is me. This is the role I assumed with my resident class. I'm the one people come to for a pep talk when they are shit on for something that isn't their fault.

&amp;#x200B;

Annie is apparently still unconscious, which is most likely related to her arrest, which was a medication side effect, so not really progression of her underlying condition. I have no clue if she ever got intubated, or if she really needed to be. Is she making sufficient respiratory effort? Who knows!

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, MC very realistically is on the verge of tears. Today has sucked ass, and her hero whose research inspired her to go into medicine turned out to be an absolute douche. MC heads into a supply closet to take a moment to collect herself. Sadly, this is very accurate. I was advised in med school to find a ""crying place"" on every rotation where I could sneak off and collect myself without letting anyone see me by an attending. To this day, I have never cried at work, but I have broken down sobbing in my car at the end of a shift on a handful of occasions. I chose Jackie to enter as it is far more likely that a medical intern would be on this unit than an surgical resident. Her pep talk proves that even though she is competitive, she is not looking to undercut her fellow interns. MC asks for a hug. As a senior resident, I've hugged interns and medical students numerous times, usually after someone shit on them like Dr. Asshole shit on MC. I always pull them to an area where whoever was a dick to them probably won't come by, hug them and validate their emotional response, then give them a moment of privacy. This moment here between Jackie and MC really rings true to those experiences, until things get very sexual. No making out for my MC. One, she's not gonna be *that* intern who's caught fooling around with a coworker on day one. Two, she's upset and just not in the mood.

&amp;#x200B;

We now get MC thinking up potential diagnoses for Annie. The medicine here is pretty bad for a variety of reasons. MC is focusing on cardiac conditions, presumably because of the arrest, but the arrest was caused by an allergic reaction to something MC ordered. It's not connected to her underlying condition. Also, her suggestions are insane. WPW is an abnormal conduction pattern in the heart that Annie would not necessarily know she had and could be ruled out in one minute by getting an EKG. Aortic stenosis would come with a murmur that MC should have heard on exam. Neither of these fit her presenting symptoms. Lost in thought, MC meets Elijah who is friendly and makes excellent Harry Potter references. They are both lost, but are given directions by a kind patient who seems to know all the staff. She's most likely a frequent flier. Rule of drama says she'll die this book.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this patient also makes an innocuous statement about not rushing things that triggers a medical realization. It's a classic medical drama trope, but I'm pretty sure it never happens in real life. At least, I've never had it happen. MC has solved Annie's case. She has decompression sickness, which causes a wide variety of symptoms as bubbles of gas that dissolved at the high pressure while diving reform and travel throughout the body. It can actually be crazy dangerous. MC also states she has labyrinthitis. I'm not sure how she came to this conclusion. The bends explains Annie's presentation decently well, as it can affect the inner ear as well. MC decides to provide symptomatic treatment for the labyrinthitis, but makes no suggestion of treating the decompression sickness by sending Annie for hyperbaric oxygen, a treatment where the patient is placed in a chamber to receive oxygen at a higher pressure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Asshole agrees with the shitty management. You see, he came to the same conclusion and had already written a prescription for antihistamines. Once again, I am left asking, WHO IS ANNIE'S ATTENDING? If it's Dr. Asshole here, well, he's been absent from her care until he decides to swoop in and be a condescending dick. If it's someone else, where are they? Terrible oversight at this hospital. Dr. Asshole is pompous and rude, telling MC he was basically waiting for her to fail. Why didn't he sit down with her to guide her through a differential diagnosis if he was sure she was floundering? Why is he working in a teaching hospital if he so clearly hates teaching? MC thanks him for giving her the chance to figure out the diagnosis on her own, because she's quickly learning that independence is all Dr. Asshole appreciates. No one brings up the positive blood culture, which I guess we are just ignoring at this point. Realistically, even if this was a lab error (which I still suspect), bacteremia is a serious enough condition you need to treat it until repeat cultures are negative.

&amp;#x200B;

Aurora arrives on the scene at this time. Not gonna lie, I completely forgot about her. Where the fuck has she been all day? Has she been meeting with her aunt for 12 hours? She legit missed everything, including a code on her patient, and she has the gall to be upset that MC is talking with an attending? MC chooses not to throw Aurora under the bus because that behavior always pissed her off in med school, but if she is absent for hours at a time on a consistent basis, MC is going to have to chat with the program director. No matter how important her aunt is, Aurora needs to be available for patient care.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, MC has survived her first shift! After sign out, she changes into a very trashy looking outfit. She knows she should go home and get some sleep, but she's not gonna miss a chance to hang out with her new coworkers and blow off some steam. She hasn't yet realized the 10 hours between shifts are precious and that she is going to regret going out tomorrow when her alarm goes off and she is hungover and only got 4 hours of sleep. They all head to the bar. The IM interns, minus Aurora, are all there and have an adorable bonding sessions over shots. MC even manages to slip in a dig at Dr. Asshole by toasting to taking the jobs of attendings who treat them like dirt. MC has a great time blowing off steam. She dances with her IM friends, plays darts with the surgical interns, and completely ignores Dr. Asshole. She is not spending any of her precious free time with him. MC doesn't flirt with any of her coworkers just yet. A hookup on night one is a bad idea, but she might be developing a little crush on Bryce. He's cute and friendly, plus they aren't in the same department, so they wouldn't be forced to spend a lot of time together if things get awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

MC ends the evening deciding to move in with her fellow IM interns in an effort to fully emulate Grey's Anatomy. MC is excited, as she likes all of them and already is feeling close with them. Intern year is one hell of a bonding experience. The only intern she doesn't like is Aurora, who is not in on this roommate plan.

&amp;#x200B;

So, medical accuracy in Chapter 2 was much worse. Code management was abysmal by both the individuals involved and the hospital as a whole. MC randomly stumbled into a half-correct diagnosis and then proceeded to treat based on the incorrect half of her diagnosis. Dr. Asshole not only is a shitty teacher, but he advocates a cowboy mentality in young physicians (an attitude that should die a fiery death) and he doesn't correct MC when she makes medical errors. Instead he practices the ABC's of shitty attendings -accuse, blame, and criticize. He either completely hates teaching or gets some masochistic glee out of dumping on interns like he was dumped on during his training. Either way, a teaching hospital is a poor fit for him. "

Back on the 'Triple V' Torrance opened the data store housed in the spinning exploding cube. He was standing in the safety of the Mindwar Office. Although, in that moment, he recalled that place as a site once horrifically profaned by the atrocity of the cube's subject. 

It was problematic the data gained, far more than he believed he had bartered for or maybe even wanted. Somehow whilst being compliant his Rogue friend Gryll had found another innocent way to challenge the Torrance. The thoroughness of the data provided was rather amusingly very emulated Korvax something of a mind boggling circle in itself given the previously mentioned source. 

It was supposed to be just a name and an address. The name taken by the Clone that had betrayed his assistance and the address where he could find that traitor for some justified revenge. Instead Torrance received a full Korax style dossier about a new power in one broad sector of space: The so-called 'Broken Prophet' and the rising organisation  of the same. The organisation known simply as 'The Sect', almost as if there could be no other.

Typical First Spawn bombastic arrogance that name, at least at first glance. The address he needed finally located deep in the data but no more specific than an entire Gek solar system. It seemed the Clone that Torrance had foolishly healed and that had then backstabbed him and those he deemed his people had been busy since he lost track of its wanderings. In fact, he hardly recognised the picture painted of this 'Broken Prophet': Not quite at the last the deceitful wounded shell or the later crazed sociopath that had been hidden underneath if perhaps in plain sight to some.

The Broken Prophet seemed an unexpected evolution or an especially well devised not to mention cunningly constructed scheme. The Gek now spoke of the 'Forge of its Suffering' the madness of its awakening... It now preached many virtues such as broad acts of repentance rather than vengeance taking, and claimed perhaps to excuse its past ills that for a time it was 'maybe unsurprisingly' - given all that it had endured - been mentally unstable.

Now from the pulpit as a humble penitent it espoused taking back a cleaner path than that offered by those - justifiably - outlawed Blood Cults and their dodgy Grandmasters. Waxing much on a deeper far less tainted rebirth for Gek folk: Nothing less it seemed than a true redemption for the sins of their First Spawn forefathers. Moreover the Broken Prophet was against a mechanical forcing and limitation of the personality by little machines but advocated instead an escape from that soul trap. The Prophet espousing an unleashing of a vital Gekness that was older it insisted than the First Spawn allowing a real rebirth capable of incorporating real self restraint and a  rekindling of connection to a lost empathy with every living and even nonliving things. The idea coming over as an almost holistically animistic concept: A spiritual enlightenment from a time almost beyond record, a time before Empire.

Included in the dossier was an especially lengthy speech in which the Prophet delivered upon how his private genesis of change came to pass. It was all in there and made enough sense in its fullness to be credible but as they say once bitten... Torrance felt this one had already taken a huge chunk out of him so he was beyond wary ranging into outright disbelief. Still, it was quite a story.

##In the Words of the Broken Prophet - Act One.

""The Blood Cults now fear my message,"" the Clone began in his guise as the Broken Prophet the record spoken not written, ""for they know I speak counter to their unrepentant solutions of greed, hate and wrath. I have delved something else, something deeper beneath the invaded skin that the Nanites of the Korvax altered to make you my children the poorly mended broken things that you are today."" 

""I know this is hard for many of you to hear. Indeed my message is painful for you, for you are not free you are all controlled. Each of you infested with the solution of the Korvax. The little machines are a part of you even now and reactive not passive. Already I see some of you look unwell as you hear these words. This will not be easy, but I believe in time what has been done to you can be reversed.""

""I believe, my friends, that through great pain I have found the Gek - we were supposed to be - a nature long ago lost to acceptable history. The First Spawn were not our beginning only arguably our first corruption. Back long before the rise of the supposed glory of the Empire there was another way. I am positive now that our most distant ancestors lived in a far more agreeable and agrarian state. I know not what dire catalyst brought about the calamity of the creed of Empire only that it must have been something momentous. Perhaps the Overmind of my unexpected benefactor was real enough or something tainting like it. Not that I thought of my rescuer in pleasant terms at first far from it. Yet I stray slightly from the direct path though these marshes of the mind."" 

""As you know there is little lore about any prequel to Imperial times as if no history was even recorded of the ages before the First Spawn claimed dominion. Well to the First Spawn it was an unhistorical period lacking any merit of dynasties, battles won and resources pillaged. Have you however ever wondered about the fullness of that lack of ancient data? It is simple enough and an old tale in itself, victors wrote our histories or more specifically they rewrote them redacting anything that derided the manifest destiny of the Imperial remit the push to power."" 

""When the Empire took control and began to shape us - in body and soul - those in charge more than comfortable with destroying the legacy of a more peaceful past: They burned away those simpler days just as they commenced to scorch away all, as they saw it, weakness of empathy from the character of our people. There was to be no weakness in us, Masters are not weak only slaves are weak."" 

""To my horror I can now imagine the process of our sorrowful becoming as a long and torturous undertaking of hard knocking social evolution. We First Spawn - for once I was of that dreadful creed - we First Spawn beat those that resisted into the shape we desired or destroyed them entirely. Meanwhile the backstory of the Empire simply degraded to our minds to a prequel unworthy of telling beyond 'a cleansing of the unworthily weak' or so they / we scripted. Even I as a belatedly cloned digital iteration of a First Spawn Survivor have little memory of any time before our Empire changed everything save a few fragments of myth and song known to all."" 

""Naturally there are scriptures from the Blood Cults that claim to reach back but as a now penitent Gek disavowing such bloodletting factions I understand such manipulative texts all too well, far too well to accept them as literal sooth. Meanwhile, I believe inside of us rests something intrinsically far more real both a seed and genetic map of our truer beginning.""

""Sometimes to move forward you must peel away at the falsehoods - one layer at a time - to look back, back beyond the known into less known ages, back in this instance through hints of genetic memory to when we were part of a grander whole rather than seeking ever to stand aloof - oft atop of a heap of corpses - as grim masters of our fate.""

""Yet when first freed from my prolonged torment - as a mere source of body parts - I cared little about such things as legendary pre-imperial times save to mock them as unsophisticated primitive and lacking. At first, I now know, I was broken 'in a bad way': Initially, I was far from rendered wise by my suffering or clean of taint. My first rebirth was bloody and excruciatingly painful. The worst of my pain emotional rather than physical. I was then loosed upon this age full of inner suffering, hatred, guile and exceptionally unrepentant - indeed a recidivist."" 

""I admit I pretended to be an empty shell to my saviour, as soon as I realised that was all that fool initially beheld. Yes, I only saw that one as an idiot back then, an easy mark to my act of victim. Although ironically I was a victim, my egotism - my will to overcome - would not permit me to believe it. Indeed, any hint of being rather than just acting the victim enraged me even more. In my pride, even a hint of sympathy from any member of the lesser races - our natural subjects according to the scriptures of Empire - cut deeper than every previous cruelty inflicted upon me by my maker, my other self from whom I was cloned."" 

""That some pathetic homeless wanderer of an Interloper, a member of that privileged tourist class a wayward - Slave of the Atlas - should look down upon any First Spawn Survivor with sympathy almost too much to stomach. How dare it grant us pity. I was determined to teach that worthless imbecile an epic lesson in humility.""

""In my mind it would be a great teaching - as it was in the high days of yore - when we taught the Korvax the errors of their pacifistic ways the failures in their choices and inaction."" 

""Oh we taught them well, reaping their very planet around them to its bleeding core. Taking all that once belonged to them and making it ours even recycling the very technology of their Casings their artificial bodies. Mine, I prayed, would be a similar work one that my deliverer would never forget or be able to forgive, a work to haunt a restless mind."" 

""For my sins I did just as I planned - to the best of my means at that time. I waited almost subserviently whilst pretending to that emptiness, pretending to be grateful for a simple release from my physical pain and for the healing of the crude vehicle of my latter age body. Then when the Torrance 'as he named himself' was gone on another of its empty travails then but only when I was fully ready - including deeply underestimated - even amusingly judged a friend by some - only then did I let loose my terrible wrath."" 

""In my departure I wrought a mighty ruin upon his mobile house sending many of his associates on to their next iteration. To me it was almost too easy I was on the inside, beyond all their primary outer defences. Although some of the Vy'keen Interns - never fully trusted me - those honour bound overly martial idiots, for the sake of their oaths of friendship with this Torrance, still did not distrust me half strongly enough.""

""Honour to me back then just a foolish imaginary construct for fools to hide behind. We First Spawn spat in the face of such concepts they served little purpose in our elevation.""

""I was incensed having taken every act of kindness bestowed upon me as both weakness and insult: Trespasses I meant to repay with cruel interest. I was bitter indeed, perhaps to your cooler minds - temporarily criminally insane - although as an echo of a First Spawn it felt almost to me akin to business as usual - a coming home, not to mention my first steps back on the road to power.""

""What can I say, we plot - sometimes we fall - but there is always that fire of revenge to uplift us again in its warming updraught: The fire burns and we rise as if on invisible wings."" 

""My wrath however went wild once finally free from its period of prolonged and for us unnatural containment. It almost killed me, I became a glutton for the creation of punishments, I painted the bulkheads with the blood and excrement of my foes, they never saw it coming. I displaying their sundered body parts as grim decorations. Killing did not seem enough to me, indeed nothing satisfied my inner rage I wanted everything to rip and tear and burn more... I could hardly bring myself to stop revelling in my excess - I was drunk on revenge - even after the alarms were finally raised and it wisely became a prime time to make a strategic withdrawal I tarried a while. After all this was an escape to true freedom not just an act of vengeance.""

""It was of course with hindsight all absurdly senseless violence, the body feels no pain beyond death and in this age even the worst tableau of mutilation is easily cleaned down to the microscopic after the fact."" 

""Much akin to my earlier suffering at the hands of my maker my little demonstration of ire was on some level pointless. That torture chamber of a medical facility in which I was so artificially spawned had a purpose - true enough - but the digital ensoulment of the abused and harvested flesh well arguably that was always surplus to the primary requirements."" 

""Perhaps all the evil things done to me mere whim or First Spawn curiosity to see how a copy of its own mind would cope or maybe it was some filthy shadow of self hate. Else it may have been a calculated object lesson: You must understand extravagant lessons to the underlings are typical Grandmaster ploys of any Blood Cult. After all if the Grandmaster would inflict such endless agony upon a fully memory endowed fleshy copy of itself what horrors might it inflict upon unrelated others - especially any enemy - or even those allies that fail to live up to expectations."" 

""The most powerful First Spawn leaders lived by the might of their most rabid reputations and they were always individuals to be feared.""

""In truth, as mad as my time under my maker was, the Universe is full of such senseless punishments and often enough of seemingly limitless suffering too, some of it all too random but other evils are skillfully devised by minds that have lost all empathy towards deemed lesser beings. To me whilst back in the facility of my maker, at times it felt like I was just made to suffer. It was only dreams of escape and messy vengeance back then had granted my mind any peace any hope at all so I nursed those fantasies well - probably too well."" 

""I barely cleared the 'Triple V' when I made a hyperjump and I am positive just in time before reinforcements could arrive to seal my doom. I had been wise enough to strike when the Frigates were all away - timing in some operations is everything. Indeed it was during a period when even the 'Triple V' itself held but a skeletal crew - just enough souls aboard for my harsh lesson. I did not stay to tangle with the Interloper that had brought me to his home vainly believing he had rescued me from my torments, whilst to my mind inflicting only more emotional pain."" 

""Even if I killed that one - the Atlas brought his foul kind back far too soon - and this one had established ways of remembering beyond death via anomalous logs and local contacts. No, my vengeance against the Torrance for his part in my prolonged humiliation was served by proxy and as is often true with some that removed plan, I was positive, would cut deeper than any direct injury to his person. Meanwhile, as stated I made my getaway in a stolen star ship his property too."" 

""It was all good, until I ran foul of a Pirate ambush at my first system of call. I had taken a star ship with a decent cargo one I could sell for a quick profit - perhaps too valuable a prize - for the local Pirates found it impossible to ignore. The ship was a relatively new acquisition of Torrance - perhaps for undercover operations - which meant it lacked additionally upgraded security systems but also any enhanced systems in general thus no powerful shield or weapon modifications. I had not planned to fight in the 'AJ3 Hando' - not as it was - it was just a temporary perfectly nondescript Shuttle transport to later far greater things.""

""I could have immediately attempted to flee that Pirate fight when it presented but my pride forbade such an overly hasty forbearance. A First Spawn does not flee from such a rabble and worse - grave insult - they were Korvax. Korvax Pirates, hah the very idea was ludicrous to me, almost as a concept inconceivable. The idea that any of that subservient slave race could muster the martial might to best me in a space battle - impossible - even if I flew a far lesser ship. I gunned my engine at the one I judged the wingleader of the soon to be sorry hunting pack, naturally I had an eye for such predatory things."" 

""In my wrath, I ignored that I had only some underpowered photon cannons, poor shielding and little in the way of shield regenerating resources in the hold under my command. In my mind such trifles meant nothing more than good reasons to fly better - I alone would suffice - I alone was more than enough of an edge over these instinct lacking machines flying other machines. Yes, I was full to the brim with the arrogance and pride of my kind I gloried in it. I was of the Master Race they of the Slaves the outcome to me seemed inevitable."" 

""I entered the fracas confident of victory, I got the leader directly under my reticule easily enough too and that one took a solid rain of hits but the weak photon fire barely scratched at its upgraded wall like shields so that my bravery and accuracy accounted for little. Meanwhile, the weaker, if only compared to their leader, wingmen - that I had scornfully ignored - came at me from all sides like biting swamp flies."" 

""Almost instantly my shield, such as it was, commenced failing at a shocking rate. I reacted by attempting to make violent and erratic movements to shake off that incoming torrent as my ship rattled and bucked from multiple ongoing impacts. Ah but she had no engine upgrades whatsoever, and responded sluggishly to my deft commands. Sometimes being masterful is simply not enough."" 

""As physical hull plating began to ablate away from the shuttle on all sides, I had no option but to shamelessly flee before the unexpected might of those slaves, racing to gain time to recharge my depleted shields. Thankfully many asteroids rested nearby so I used those lumps of debris the best I could for cover. Hee, hee, the old ways are still viable even after ages of advancements. A great jewel of a blue and red planet rested relatively close as well, if I could somehow make it there I knew fortune would favor my First Spawn boldness once more. Such a world would be ripe in resources for the reaping and Space Pirates tended to fend poorly in atmosphere. Well to be drawn into a planet is usually too risky given the Sentinels brooding watch so they usually lacked much practice at fighting in air rather than vacuum.""

""I believed the smart Pirates hit and run with the loot gained they do not hang around to tangle with the authorities be they bounty hunters or robotic Sentinels.""

""It was a close thing though the rocks only providing partial cover and the planet soon seemed far further away than it looked despite filling up so much of my view ahead. I admit, at first, I paid little attention to the numbers on the screens, I preferred to fly by sight and feel. Machines too cold and unfeeling - slavish technology too."" 

""It became akin to a test of endurance. Every so often they would catch up to me again and then I would seek more rocks for cover before making another push for the planet. I admit my self belief began to suffer pangs of doubt as more and more hull got chipped away my shields only partially recharging only to be stripped time and again.""

""It became increasingly difficult to ignore those readings the large distance remaining to the planet the small percentage of hull protection left before the ship would come apart around me, most likely in a violent explosion. The computers were good at judging such things even though I despised that mechanical intelligence.""

""Yet as I began to despair the ferocity of the assaults began to wane and it was clear they were getting reluctant - as I had hoped - not desiring to get too close to that enlarging world as a Sentinel nest. Abruptly I seemed free altogether and moments later was suffering the welcome heat of a hard atmospheric entry whilst already trailing fire and smoke.""

""The local Korvax would soon rue my arrival whilst supplying me with all my material needs or so I inwardly promised. I would take it all whatever I needed or desired as was the First Spawn way.""

""My recent Pirate issues meant nothing, I would revenge myself upon them later - at my leisure - too, ideally that delay granting a prolonged rather than brief suffering. Although thinking of prolonged suffering I felt immediately cheated and empty. For all the damage I left behind me on the 'Triple V' whilst I had sweated and swerved later to simply survive a little longer none of that carnage had seemed enough. None of it measured well compared to the ills inflicted upon me by my maker or the insults so casually and blindly bestowed upon me so many times by the sympathy of my rescuers."" 

""My current flight irked as well. I knew it had to be done but even as I almost obtained the final victory of my escape I felt no thrill of elation upon that hard won win. Instead of joy I felt only shame and anger at a forced retreat - it seemed a poor beginning unfit to my Grandmaster status. For a moment I was tempted to turn back - despite the grave risk - with the mad aim of predating those hunters but I schooled myself to let it go in favour of patience. Actually, had I tried to turn back I am not sure my ship would have made it out of the gravity well.""

""My landing proved more of a crash. During my scorching entry something damaged by the fight and seemingly vital to a more controlled arrival broke loose or just failed or both. For a moment I lost control and so apparently did any automated landing fail safe - curse the Korvax. We hit some trees so hard I swear we burst their nanite cohesion asunder then ploughed towards the earth. I awoke an unknown time later befuddled as any Atlas new spawned Interloper. My stolen shuttle a ruin, my body bruised and battered. A storm was raging, hot rain searing my flesh through the damaged canopy."" "
aubhq9,70,2019-02-24,I got caught fucking my boss by his wife,homewrecker95,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/aubhq9/i_got_caught_fucking_my_boss_by_his_wife/,"Last summer I was interning at a law firm. It is fairly small but prominent. One of the partners is a handsome Latino man. He is 40 with broad shoulders and a great smile. I noticed him instantly as did most women with a pulse.

A few weeks into the internship, he started paying more and more attention to me. I noticed him checking me out when I walked by. I am pretty curvaceous so even when I dress conservative there is still plenty to see. I loved the attention even though he is married. A few times I caught him looking and gave him a smile back.

One day a the end of work, he asked me into his office. He gave me this speech about how he takes mentorship very seriously. A partner's number one job is to develop the future partners of the firm. He asked me if I would like to get a drink and we could discuss my future plans.

Now I am not stupid. This wasn't my first rodeo. I knew exactly what he was after and I was all for it. I said yes. He said great. He asked me not to mention anything to the other interns so they wouldn't get jealous. He also asked me to leave now and get us a table at the bar a few blocks away. I am pretty sure he didn't want to be seen leaving the office with me.

When he got there he started asking me about my plans and school. What classes was I in. Was I in a sorority? Did I have a boyfriend?

To the last question I said ""No I don't have a boyfriend. College boys don't interest me much. So immature."" That was a half truth. I had been fucking around with one of the other interns but it was a casual summer thing. I also love college boys. Either way he took the signal. One of his hands was working is way down my back and the other was one my knee.

I asked if there was somewhere less loud we could talk. He said he condo was only a few minutes away and no one would be home for a few hours. His wife had a dinner meeting and wouldn't be home until later.

We got to his place and it was amazing. Money might not be able to buy happiness but it can buy one hell of a view. He poured us some wine. He took me out on the balcony to show me the view. He pushed himself up behind me to point to something. I leaned back into him. He leaned in to kiss me. I broke a wine glass but he didn't even notice.

We went back inside and he pulled me on top of him while he sat on the couch. As we kissed he undressed me. When I tried to start unbuttoning my shirt, he slapped my hands away and said that was his job. He took off my shirt and skirt. I still had on pantyhose, underwear, a bra and my shoes.

He had me stand up. He told me to spin for him. I did. He told me to face away and bend over. I did. He felt up my ass and told me I was a ""fantastic specimen.""

He stood up and told me to kneel in front of him. He told me to take off this belt, then his pants and then he told me to hold the top of his underwear. He asked me if I wanted his cock. I said yes. He said say the whole thing, I said, ""I want your cock. I want to suck it. Please let me suck it.""

He said go ahead. I pulled down his underwear. He was fully hard. I kissed his cock from head to base. I sucked each ball. I licked it up and down. I kissed the tip and slowly let it in my mouth. I bobbed up and down the shaft until I took the whole thing then I held there as long as I could. He was loving it. I couldn't stay there long because he pubes were tickling my nose. Then I gave him the best blowjob I could and I take pride in my work.

He was loving it. He stopped me eventually and led me to the bedroom. He slowly removed the rest of my clothes but asked I put my heels back on. He lead me to a low dresser. He told me to bend over it and place my hands and elbows on it. I did. He got behind me and slowly pushed his cock in. He built up speed. He would pull my hair and slap my ass.

I love doggy-style so this was working for me. He found the right tempo and made me scream and I came.

He led me to the bed. I laid down and he got on top of me. We started fucking in missionary. He was holding my wrists so I couldn't move my arms. I was moaning. He had his faced buried in my tits. Suddenly I heard, ""ROBERT!""

I looked over and his wife was in the door way. She said something like, ""Not again"" or ""Not another one."" I'm not sure because I was trying to stop existing. He still hadn't let go of my wrists.

He said, ""I'm sorry honey. I don't know what happened. She just came on to me and I don't know.""

She walked a few steps into the room and he turned a little to keep looking at her. He was still inside me so when he turned his dick moved deeper into me and I involuntarily grunted.

She shouted, ""Are you still fucking her? Jesus Robert! Well finish up and get her out of here. I have guests coming at 9:00."" Her tone this whole time wasn't angry or hysterical or anything. More annoyed and frustrated. This obviously wasn't his first rodeo either.

She closed the door. He turned back to me. I could tell he was unsure if he should finish or get off me. I was humiliated and not in the good way so the mood was ruined for me. I told him to get off. It was a bummer because up until that point it was one of the best sexual experiences of my life.

I cleaned up and got as dressed as I could in the bedroom. He sheepishly said he was sorry and went to the shower. I slowly snuck out of the bedroom. I didn't see anyone in the living room where my clothes were so I went in. I found my clothes neatly folded on the arm of the couch. I started throwing them on as fast as I could.

""I am sorry he put you through this,"" she said from the doorway to the kitchen with a glass of wine in her hand. I didn't see her and I almost jumped out of my skin. This bitch was stealthy.

""He's a weak man and can't control himself. I provide him certain freedoms as long as he keeps things out of my life but he can't even manage that.""

I do NOT know what to say to this. This is way too much exposition way to soon after having a dick inside me.

I apologize and she says it's not my fault, but asks that if anything ever happens again make sure if doesn't happen in her house. I say ok and flee the scene.

I keep my mouth shut at work for my own good. I don't want a reputation. Things are kind of awkward between Robert and I but it was functional enough for work. Near the end of summer I found out from another of the interns that she'd been fucking him most of the summer in hotel rooms. I don't tell her anything but I do notice that she and I both have red hair as does his wife and at least 2 other younger women in the office. 4 of us 5 are also pretty curvaceous so evidently Robert has a type and has dipped his pen in the company ink (or at least tried) quite a few times.

Long story short, guys, don't fuck your side piece in your wife's bed if you're married to a stealthy fucking bitch."

aubq0r,0,2019-02-24,How to find a fulfilling career in the UK?,GeeseHonk,AskUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/aubq0r/how_to_find_a_fulfilling_career_in_the_uk/,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm a 24 year old, based in the UK. I'm currently working as a data analyst in a well-paying job that I don‚Äôt really enjoy. I feel as though this is due to the role being office based; I‚Äôm sat down all the time, there‚Äôs little variety in the work, and there‚Äôs no tangible sense of accomplishment. This paired with a long commute and not bonding with any of my co-workers has left me feeling uninspired.

I have a maths degree and have completed a 12-month internship doing operational research (data analysis) in the civil service, which I also found unfulfilling. I didn‚Äôt really think about my career when choosing a degree, I just ambled into studying maths. I guess this was down to me being good at it, and having been told that it would open a lot of doors for me in the future.

I‚Äôm struggling to see which of the open doors I‚Äôm excited about though. There‚Äôs plenty of office jobs, which I‚Äôve ruled out due to the bland, static environment. I want to be on my feet and outside most of the time, working with different people and environments. 

Another option I‚Äôve considered is teaching, having taught maths in a secondary school during my degree. This was okay, I enjoyed interacting with the kids, but I wasn‚Äôt passionate about it, and have been told terrible things about the work-life balance of being a teacher.

Ideally, my top requirements for a career (at the moment) are: 

- Solving problems. 

- Creating things with my hands, some desk work would be fine. 

- The ability to work for myself in the future. 

- Workload variety. 

- Environment variety.

I am currently thinking of learning a trade, as I think this would satisfy these requirements. However, I have no idea how to choose a specific trade, or how to approach returning to college (already completed my A-levels)/ starting an apprenticeship.

I‚Äôve also considered returning to University, to do a masters course in something that would help me transition to my ideal career. However, I‚Äôm struggling to find any postgraduate careers that satisfy my requirements.

Any advice would be great."

Hi. I've had this fantasy for sometime and hopefully you'd love to play it out. We can discuss the specifics but initially I'm thinking you're a young intern at my wifes work or a close friend. You've been over to our place for BBQs, supper etc. and on this occasion I'm out with some friends. I return home and hear noises from the bedroom/bathroom/home office (Your preference). The door is slightly ajar so I silently walk down the hall and peak in. What I see is disturbing and also very erotic. Hopefully this scenario interests you. We can change things up depending on your interests and desires.

Some about myself and my wife.  She doesn't know I chat online so won't be involved in the play herself. We're both 55 yo. She is very attractive with a nice body; long legs, a nice butt and smaller breasts. FYI - I will get involved in the play but the thought of catching you two and watching for awhile excites me. Anyways. I hope to hear from you and get to know a little about you before we begin. Oh, I prefer to talk in reddit chat or another chat app.

Take care,

Paul"

End date isn't set in stone yet, although the start date must be around May 15th as my internship starts on the 20th.

About me: 20 y/o engineering student at Virginia Tech; quiet, clean, &amp; keep to myself; don't party, drink, or do drugs.

Looking for: Furnished room; prefer to be in the city but location is flexible; rent isn't a major constraint but $600 or less is preferable.   

Lmk if you have anything available or have any advice on places to search. I haven't gone the route of looking for other college students (at IUPUI?) to room with, but that's probably my next step. I'd prefer to live with people who have normal work schedules though.

Below are some scene ideas that will hopefully frame my general interests. I‚Äôm not sold on any one of these and would be happy and prefer to chat with a partner to work out details and see how we can form stories that are fun for us. 
 
My preference is to find good long-term partners but one-shot roleplays or short term is fine as well. Quality writing is important to me. For me, that means full sentences, grammar, punctuation etc. and generally no text/internet lingo-talk. I‚Äôm just too old for it, I think and I don‚Äôt find it very enticing or exciting. 
 
For these roles, I like male characters that are balanced and have personalities. I do like somewhat aggressive leads but not so much that they‚Äôre one-dimensional. I am not into jocks/jerks (at least for these scenes) or guys whose sole focus in roleplay is the sex. I want there to be lots of kinky sex in the roleplay, but only if there‚Äôs plenty of story to support it with good characters. 
 
As for me, I do best with roles where I am not the aggressor and nor am I playing ‚Äúteacher‚Äù to anyone. Instead, I tend to play more nurturing, sweet, fun, flirtatious, joking type. That doesn‚Äôt mean I want to be your sub or anything, please understand the difference. When you write to me first, showing me you have an understanding of these dynamics will make it easier for me to see we‚Äôll be a good fit. 

I'm a South Asian American. Mostly have spent the last 25 years or so in America so am a bit of a mix. I don't have a hard accent or anything but a slight one that most folks find endearing, haha. I usually prefer scenes set in America because that's what I know best. 
 
We can hash out more details in PM‚Äôs as well. I‚Äôd like to get to know my partners before starting a roleplay. 
 
A good initial message will: 

- Be a paragraph or two long. 
- Enough to give me some info about you but not a novel. 
- Clearly explain some of your biggest **current** interests 
- What are some things that excited you about my post? What do you want to do with these ideas?
- Where you like to roleplay: Reddit, Chatzy, other options etc. 
 
Kinks: race play, age play, titty fucking, facials, swallowing, lingerie, anal, dp, groups and generally open to anything as long as we discuss it first.
 
Here are some takes on scenes. I‚Äôd love to hear your own take on them and what you have in mind as well. When you message, put your favorite kink in the subject line so I know that you read this. 
 
 
**A Road Trip to Remember**
 
I play a MILF-type character who's related to a group of younger guys (maybe 2-4). I could be a mother's close friend, for example, but am open to other ideas as well. I'm thinking we'd be on a cross-country road trip that's going to take a couple of weeks. None of us would have had any kind of sexual history, but during this trip such situations arise. 
 
**The Internship**

You and a few of your friends are interning for the summer at company. I‚Äôm a doctor and researcher and occasionally we take a few interns during the summer. The guys have recently graduated HS and are headed to college and are planning to get some experience under their belt. For this scene, we‚Äôd need to hash out whether we are already known to each other or if we‚Äôre strangers who are meeting for the first time. I‚Äôm open to either depending upon the setting. 
 
**Start-Up Culture**

We‚Äôre all co-workers at a high-paced start-up environment. We‚Äôve gotten to know each other fairly well over the last year. I started at the company a few years ago when it first opened and moved to the states from India for my first job. It‚Äôs one of those intense work environments and our team always ends up saddled with coming in on the weekends to help out with them team over in Europe. It‚Äôs kind of annoying but the pay is great and the work environment is pretty fun. 

**Happy 50th (or 60th) Birthday!**

I enjoy holiday/celebration themes. In this scene, I was imagining that it would be my birthday and perhaps an important one. I‚Äôd be MILF aged so we can discuss what options we want for the ages. I end up invited to a wedding of my friend‚Äôs daughter and have to attend myself while my husband is too busy with work. One of us must go, so i give in and do it and figure a wedding is a fun way to spend a birthday. I was planning on a wedding that‚Äôs fine but a bit boring . The evening winds down and my friend‚Äôs son a few of his friends find themselves bored as well and chat me up. This can might be split up into 2 different scenes if we wanted to focus on the birthday angle or the wedding angle.

audaaw,1,2019-02-24,Best way to port data to a new Google account for a Chromebook user?,baeology,chromeos,https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/audaaw/best_way_to_port_data_to_a_new_google_account_for/,"Wasn't sure where the best place to post this was, so if there's someplace better for me to post this, please direct me there.

A little backstory, if it helps. I went to a high school for the past three years where we used computers all on a G Suite for Education. Therefore, all of my schoolwork, school-centric emails, etc. went on that account. I didn't have a personal email for that. Because all my stuff was on a school account, I created a backup email with an stupid inside joke as the username. However, I unexpectedly moved states, so now for my senior year I had to move all of my information onto the backup. Now, I'm applying for colleges and summer internships using a stupid email address; but that's the account linked to my Chromebook. So what's the best way for me to port all of my information onto a new account with a more professional email? (I have not created the new email yet).

Thanks for any help you can give me. 

TL:DR: All of my info is on an email with a stupid name, so I'm trying to port it to a new email. How?"
audb4m,0,2019-02-24,Am I the only one thinking One UI is a downgrade from oreo ?,Yosock,GalaxyS9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS9/comments/audb4m/am_i_the_only_one_thinking_one_ui_is_a_downgrade/,"Got One UI since the beta in november, and I think I'll switch back to oreo after I'll send my S9 for a camera repair.. 


I have many grudges against One UI but I'll try to stick to the biggest points:

It's ugly, the news icons feels outdated with their strange color choice and too basic design ( seriously it feels like an intern jobs made quickly from noun project icons). The one handed menu are fine from an ergonomics standpoint, but thoses huge empty areas either White or Black ?!? Again feels like rushed. The recent app drawer, same as on the pixels but without the cool gestures and haptic feedback, you can see only one app at a time, the old one was vastly superior.

Thoses huges rounded corners everywhere, yes I get it that you wanted something that copy the corners of the display, but that's really again ugly. 

The unlock since pie can be glitchy when you use both fingerprint scanner or intelligent scan. Sometimes the scan is too slow so I use the fingerprint scanner but the phones seems to busy to find my face so it slow down the unlock process and often broke the animation. I thought it was a beta bug, but even after a reset with the stable version, it's still here. 

Speaking of animations, Samsung seriously needs to get their shit together. I know I have the slower exynos S9 but that's still an high end Phone, I should get smooth animations 99,9% of the time not get a choppy or buggy animation 1 out of 10.  And most of the animations doesn't feel right, the rounded corners dissapears when you switch between apps, the opening animations of notification often fails ( or you needs to wait SECONDS before anything happens) that really hampers the user experience. That's really sad to say but my old iPhone SE feels faster and is smoother while having a nice clean ui with nicely done animations. Animations are even better and smoother on the X &amp; Xs. Okay I'm a motion designer so I'm more sensitive to these kind of things, but seriously the animations are barely okay for a 2016 phone.

There are a lot of other  things that I didn't like about One UI ( the good lock apps dissapearance, menus of the camera app, the shitty gesture navigation..) but everyone seems satisfied with getting the update, and seeing that the S10 is shipping with the same thing I wonder if many are really liking what the update brings or just happy to have an update..

Edit: Others things I forgot :
The crappy ram management, my Phone can barely keep 3 apps open at the same time with One UI. Spotify sound even has micro freezes when I use a GPS app while browsing on the Web..

The multitasking menu that jump you to the previous app. I got the update since november, still doesn't feel natural.. "

The door closed behind her and I smiled, looking up at you. You stood there, looking hot. That was all you where good for really. You really weren‚Äôt the brightest of the bunch but you certainly were the hottest. My summer internship for staff members daughters had been very successful, everyone praised me for my forward thinking and inclusivity. I‚Äôm not sure if they would feel the same if they knew what I was really doing for those six weeks.

I looked you up and down. You were wearing a short summer dress, it wasn‚Äôt at all professional but I didn‚Äôt care, I didn‚Äôt need professional.

‚ÄúSo, do you know why you are here?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Äù you grabbing the hem of you dress, twirling slightly on the spot as I stood up ‚ÄúDaddy said.. that you were going to give me some work experience so that I could earn some money... and pay for things I want because he was tired of buying me things‚Äù you giggled.

‚ÄúDid he now? Well I certainly will give you an experience‚Ä¶ tell me‚Äù I took a step towards you ‚ÄúDo you watch porn?‚Äù

‚ÄúErm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, sometimes I guess. Why do you ask?‚Äù you giggled nervously again.

‚ÄúHave you ever seen a porn where a girl does some‚Ä¶ favours... for her boss?‚Äù I placed my hand on your cheek, brushing gently against you.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I guess... but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really appropriate‚Äù you said, your cute face staring up at me.

‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs see, I‚Äôm your daddy's boss, and, well, it turns out your daddy"" I paused for effect, and continued with mock indignation ""isn‚Äôt that good at his job"" I made a sad face at you ""so I‚Äôm going to fire him. Then he‚Äôll be sad, and he won‚Äôt be able to buy you those nice things you wanted‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt want that now would you?‚Äù You thought for a second, the cogs turning in your head before you shook your head. ‚ÄúGood... good... well I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be happy! Although, maybe best not best not to tell him why he‚Äôs still employed‚Ä¶ now I want to see what I‚Äôm working with‚Ä¶ Strip for me‚Äù

You thought for a second, you didn‚Äôt want daddy to lose his job, and you did like all the nice things you had. Besides, you thought, this happened all the time. You began slowly sliding your dress up as I sat down to watch. Soon you were stood naked in front of me. I smiled and gestured for you to hop up onto the couch, which you obediently did.

‚ÄúPlay with yourself for me‚Äù  I instructed. Your hands slid between your legs and you felt a rush of blood as my fingers brushed against your nipples before I grabbed your tits firmly. The feeling of showing off filled you with a perverted rush, and it wasn‚Äôt long until a puddle was forming on the couch. 

You moaned out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cum‚Äù I just laughed as your body twitched and you sat back breathless.

You saw my cock getting hard through my trousers and I flipped you over ‚ÄúAre you on birth control?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äù you said, as I stroked my cock, holding you still with my other hand ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs a shame, we‚Äôll have to fix that. For now...‚Äù I pressed the head of my cock against your asshole ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to fuck you like a proper slut.‚Äù You gasped as my cock slid inside you and you let out a cry of pain as I pushed deeper into your virgin ass. ‚ÄúCall me Daddy whilst I fuck your ass‚Äù I said, and you drew a breath as I pulled almost all the way out before plunging back in.

As I fucked you harder you whimpered in pain and your knuckles turned white as you gripped harder into the pillows on the couch. 

‚ÄúSay 'thank you'‚Äù I grunted, my strokes becoming more frequent now.

‚ÄúThank you‚Äù you whispered, drool spilling onto the cover now.

‚ÄúLouder!‚Äù I spat ‚ÄúAnd didn‚Äôt you forget something?‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Daddy!‚Äù you said, feeling your heart race as the words left your lips. I grunted as I came deep inside your ass. I pulled out as you still held your ass gaping open, my warm cum deep inside you.

‚ÄúI think this summer might be fun‚Ä¶‚Äù"

While i'm comfortable with the MEAN and MERN stack, and with other languages such  as C, Javascript, Python, PHP,  I have absolutely never touched Java ever.

Now i only have 6 months of programming bootcamp behind me and know the basics of web development like HTTP requests, sessions, tokens, cookies, REST API, routes, MVC-type frameworks etc... and more general programming concepts.

That being said, I have about a month and some to learn about the aforementioned frameworks so where do I start ?

I don't need to learn what a variable or a function is obviously and i'm more of a visual learner if that makes sense.

Do you guys have some recommendations regarding JAVA EE / Spring / Hibernate video tutorials ? Most of what i've seen on Udemy seems to be geared towards total beginner or is too deep into Java concepts. I don't mind paying for an online course but I just don't know where to go, should i bother learning JAVA SE ?

TLDR : Any good video tutorials about these languages ?"
auds90,28,2019-02-24,Weird guy was obsessed with me for like a year,Tonii04,niceguystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguystories/comments/auds90/weird_guy_was_obsessed_with_me_for_like_a_year/,"Idk if this fits here but I really wanna get this off my chest because it was a really weird experience for me so..

The characters:

\- Me, Toni, 13 years old when this whole thing started, pretty naive and awkward.

\- Phil, the creep of this story, had just turned 17 when this started.

\- Kira, my best friend at the time. She's a kind girl, but was pretty focused on finding a boyfriend for me.

(Also yes all names except mine are changed for the sake of privacy)

This whole thing started in November 2017. I met Phil in the chat of a live stream and he seemed like a pretty decent guy. He eventually started to send me pick up lines, but I thought he was just joking. After a few weeks, he texted me that he loved me and asked me if I wanted to date him and if I loved him too. I said no to both, since I didn't even really know him at that point. He asked me if we could get to know each other better then and I agreed to giving him my phone number. Big mistake. For the next few weeks to months, Phil constantly spammed me with heart emojis, compliments, questions about just about everything, and, I shit you not, plans of our future together, marriage, kids, all that and also asked me out about two more times, to which I also said no. At that point, I asked Kira for advice. She told me to start actually speaking to him on the phone (Yes, Phil was in love with me before even really talking to me once. He had heard my voice on my Instagram though.). So I started talking to Phil almost every evening and it was actually not that bad at first. So I talked to Kira about him again and she said that he'd make a good boyfriend for me and that I should date him. The next time he asked me out (around May 2018, I was 14 by then), I said yes. Phil was extremely happy about it, I could literally hear him quietly sobbing through the phone. After that, our phone calls got more awkward. Phil started ranting to me about random things and wouldn't let me hang up even though it was pretty late on a school night and I was struggling to stay awake. He also implied that he would immediatly want to have sex with me if we met irl and pretended that I was pregnant by him as a joke. I told him that I was uncomfortable with it, but when he completely ignored me, I just tiredly hung up. Anyway, he broke up with me just 4 weeks later, apparently because he needed to focus on his internship, but told me that he still would be interested in dating in a few years. I didn't really care, so I just hit him with the ""k"" and moved on. However, he kept talking to me. No more phone calls, but the obligatory ""You're so pretty üòçüòç"" comments on my Insta, random attempts at conversation which I all dodged and one arguement unrelated to him acting creepy, so I'm leaving that one out. In August, Phil eventually contacted me again, making extremely creepy remarks about my body, saying that he regretted breaking up with me, asking me if I still loved him and begging me for another chance. Both Kira and me had had it with him at that point, and I just told him that I had never had any feelings for him in the first place. Kira also texted him and told him to just get a life. Fast forward to autumn, I was complaing on my Insta about some other guy who constanly tried to talk to me about his weird-ass videogames. Cue angry messages from Phil claiming that I had been fucking that guy, with his explaination being that I was giving the other guy more attention than him, so therefore I **must** be dating him, duh. At that point I was so done with Phil. I told him that his life must be sad if he has nothing better to do than harass a girl 4 years younger than him for a year, told him to fuck off and blocked him on everything.

TL;DR: Weirdo is infatuated with me for almost a year, loses his shit when I pay attention to someone that isn't him"

audvr2,90,2019-02-24,"Goodbye, emom. Hope we never meet again.",ThetisBlanche,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/audvr2/goodbye_emom_hope_we_never_meet_again/,"I got engaged last year, getting married this year.  Pretty happy and exciting time, and while there's lots to do beforehand, it's one of the few times in my life I am genuinely looking forward to the future.  Haven't had that much before, but my life has dramatically improved as of late.  Probably TL;DR.  


The month I get married this year, it'll have just been three years since I ran away from home.  To summarize, I took an office job with my nfather to help pay for graduate school for a set number of hours a week.  After the first semester, he terminated one of the only two other employees, and I was forced to more than double the number of hours I signed up for, as well as eventually having to start evening classes to get training on what I didn't know how to do.  The employee he cut?  The biller for the business.  Note that I essentially had to ask ndad to actually pay me every month where he'd call me a tapeworm and bankrupt, never mind that his rage exploded whenever anything wrong, regardless of whether it was anyone's fault or not.   


That one other employee?  My emom.  My last day at the office was when she was upset that I didn't want to help her with something (working on the AR report, it's overdue, thanks,) and she sat there and tried to provoke me, which I ignored.  A comment finally hit home, and I requested to leave early that day from ndad.  Emom charges in and starts arguing, but I was at my limit, and I drive home.  


When I'm back, I see a series of furious texts from ndad, asking how dare I be so disrespectful of my mother?  I was ordered that I wasn't allowed to leave home until he got back to deal with me.  How dare I think I was an adult?  


Hearing that when you're past thirty flipped a switch in me for the first time.  I stuffed what I could fit in my car and bolted.    


Was homeless for a time, being housed with my friend's family at their expense.  I started my first real job three weeks later.  (It was actually their second offer; the first came after I did an internship and they offered to hire me afterward while I was still working for ndad, and he said no.  His bookkeeper, who worked for him for over twenty years, asked why I didn't walk on him.)    


Tried to move into an apartment with my brother, but ndad told my brother I'd be fired in less than a year and my brother would be stuck paying for the whole apartment.  (Note:  approaching three year work anniversary at that job.)  


Anyway, went NC with ndad within the next year.  Emom was much harder.  I kept making excuses for her, thinking she was ndad's greatest victim, but I couldn't keep ignoring how complicit she was in my abuse.  Then I got engaged, and her behavior was so reminiscent of when my sister was getting married.  You could charitably say that my emom was at my sister's bridal shower and wedding in body only.  I thought seeing my mom at my wedding, looking profoundly bored and uncaring would result in many unhappy tears that day.  Fiancee also mentioned how my cousin's wife was more interested in my upcoming marriage than my mom was.    


Around Labor Day, I tried to meet with her in person to talk.  I actually had to call my brother *twice* to get her to respond to me.  I offered to drive into town to meet with her on a weekday (I am sixty miles away,) but she kept saying she was busy in September and she was going away for vacation in October, why couldn't she wait to me see me in November?  When I did talk with her via phone, she kept interrupting me to tell me why my fiancee was unsuitable and what ended up being her slandering him, that I deserved my father's abuse, and that if I didn't want to invite her to the wedding, that was fine by her.    


I hadn't said anything about inviting her or not, but I respected her wishes and removed her from the guest list, and went NC after that call.  


I had regrets now and then, until she kept it up with irritating texts.  November had a series of accusations via texts, and I promptly blocked her number then on.    


My best friend's father passed away suddenly in January.  (She is also my matron of honor.)  My fiancee and I attended the funeral and the cremation at the cemetery.  Much to my best friend's family surprise, my parents show up.  (They're not close to my best friend's family by any stretch of the imagination.)  My ndad at least has enough sense to not start anything at someone's funeral.  On the other hand, my emom sidles up to family friends standing all of three feet behind me, and starts a conversation of what an awful daughter she has, one that won't even talk to her.    


She never once tried to approach me.  What was going on at the time?  My best friend and her family were saying their goodbyes to their father and husband as his body is being taken out of a casket and being placed in the crematorium.  Emom asked my best friend earlier how hot a crematorium is.    


It took something like this to see what a vile and detestable human being my emom really was/is.  I can see the good parts of ndad (even if he freely indulged in every kind of abuse, save perhaps sexual,) but I was tying myself into knots in trying to do that same exercise with emom.  I genuinely am hating her right now, and wishing terrible things upon her.  

&amp;#x200B;

But I've wasted enough of my life over either of them.  I'm getting married and starting a new life with people who not only love me, but treat me with respect.  The only regret that I have is that I didn't run away from home sooner."
audzav,5,2019-02-24,"BREAKING: A_Cool_Prussian Suffers Stroke, In A Coma Doctors Confirm",A_Cool_Prussian,ModelUSPress,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSPress/comments/audzav/breaking_a_cool_prussian_suffers_stroke_in_a_coma/,"A_Cool_Prussian, the self-described *‚ÄúKaiser of Eastern State‚Äù* has ‚ÄúSuffered a serious stroke.‚Äù according to doctors taking care of him. The former Senator left his position in late January due to health complications. ‚ÄúThose problems only seem to have gotten worse.‚Äù A relative says. The stroke has left the former Senator in a coma, doctors have also confirmed that he is on life support at the current time.

Ever since A_Cool_Prussian swore into the 118th Congress, many questions were raised about his health. A former intern, who asked to remain anonymous, said that ‚ÄúHis face seemed to be ghostly‚Ä¶ and his speech slurred.‚Äù With this, the former Senator has received much support from supporters all around the state and country who praise him for his work in trying to work with both the Democratic and Republican parties and populist message as a member of the infamous Bull Moose Party.

Doctors and medical professionals are not sure when, or if, he will recover from his coma. However they have confirmed that he, whilst in life support, is in stable condition.

The former Senator started his political life as a member of the House of Delegates in Eastern State under the banner of the Christian Unionists. After serving a term he moved up the political ladder by becoming a member of the House of Representatives, during this time the Christian Unionist Party had then merged into the Republican Party. During his second term he was nominated and voted as the House Majority Leader. In his third term he ran for Speaker of the House, but because of the fact the Democratic Party controlled the House he was made instead as the House Minority Leader. After serving for a short time in the House the then Congressman ran for Senate in a special election and won. During this time he started to voice his concern about the current state of the Republican Party and began to question his future within the party. On the night of October 30th he, along with other disgruntled member of the Republican Party, left to create the centrist Bull Moose Party. The party then began to work with the Republican Party to retake the Senate and House. And that they did. During the latest midterm election, A_Cool_Prussian faced the Secretary of Education, /u/AV2000, in a close election A_Cool_Prussian defeated his opponent securing the coalition the super-majority that they wanted. However recent disagreements has since crippled the coalition with the Bull Moose Party pulling out to work with the Democratic Party.

Ever since the former Senator had his stroke, and subsequently, his coma, he has been unable to view the critically acclaimed film *‚ÄúWho Killed Captain Saldol?‚Äù* which features him as Captain Saldol‚Äôs brother. ‚ÄúThe sad thing is that even though he kicks ass in the film, he won‚Äôt be able to see it for quite awhile, or even at all!‚Äù his brother remarked, ‚ÄúEverybody in our family has loved it and we hope and pray for the day my brother can be able to see this great film. Thank you /u/bandic00t_ for doing such a great service towards my brother and my family, we hope he will be able to see it soon.‚Äù

It truly saddens me to read about what all of you have been going through, but it also gives me a sense of relief knowing that I am not alone. That being said, like everyone else's situation, the level of homology shifts and I believe my story to be a bit of a unique one. It is also currently ongoing. With that out of the way, here goes it:

&amp;#x200B;

For background, I am currently a third year at a pretty decent university, studying biochemistry, actively involved on campus (clubs, TAing, student ambassadors), 3.5 gpa, and with a pretty decent internship thats paid. I'm really not trying to toot my own horn, but I'd say I am a pretty good member of the campus community as well as a decent student. 

&amp;#x200B;

Flashback to almost a year ago (mid spring of my sophomore year) I met a girl on tinder who had a lot of mutual friends with me. She's a freshman at the time and has a dorm room that's a single (this will be relevant later). After texting and snapchatting, some of our mutual friends eventually tell her I'm a good guy and we go on a date together. We eventually hit it off and started seeing each other regularly. I started sleeping in her dorm more often than mine since she had a single, which allowed us to spend a lot of time together since after each night we slept in the same bed we generally had breakfast together before our respective classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although we were spending a lot of time together, we weren't fully in a relationship for a month or so after meeting. I had some level of commitment issues because there were certain mannerisms/personality traits of her which I particularly didn't care for (Judging of others at time, very moody, love for drama, very easily manipulated into doing what her friends called 'cool'). None of them were extreme red flags, but enough for me to not want to get into a relationship unless I saw other redeeming qualities. She however really wanted to be in a relationship with me and made it very obvious, despite me expressing a desire to not be fully commitment and rather just have a FWB type relationship and see where things went. After sometime, I gave in and we were 'exclusive'. 

&amp;#x200B;

The semester ends and summer starts. Since I'm going into my junior year, I can finally live off campus in an apartment (It's a university requirement to live on campus for the first two years of undergrad). She goes back to her home, which is about 2.5 hours from campus. We decided to be 'unexclusive' the summer, which was all well and good for me. We did however continue to talk on the phone via text, snapchat and even phone calls on a daily basis. She would even drive 2.5 hours to see me on occasion and spend the night at my apartment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the course of the summer, I hooked up with other girls (all consensually, obviously), but she did not hook up with any other guys. I think the fact that we talked regularly gave the impression that we were still dating even though we agreed to be unexculsive. The end of the summer came and I realized that I wanted to be single more than I wanted to be dating her, so I broke things off, which she took pretty hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the semester started, my housemates and I started throwing parties somewhat frequently. I specifically made sure that my ex wasn't there just because I didn't want to have any drama, also, it's my damn apartment. Some of our mutual friends that I mentioned earlier would come to our parties, and my ex would be upset since I didn't want her there. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a month into school (October 5th, to be exact), I got a notification that she was filing a title IX against me for sexual assault, claiming that I had fingered her without her consent in April (2 months of us dating). She never once mentioned this to me while we were dating and it hit me like a train out of nowhere. The school holds their investigation and about a month into it, she makes another claim, saying I raped her in June, something that also never had happened. My reputation on campus was slowing falling apart since she was telling her friends all of this, and word was getting around through the grapevine. This had been bothering me so much that I had attempted suicide by mixing a large amount of benzos with alcohol in hopes of a painless death. It obviously failed. On top of this, a few people who I know saw her drunk at a party asking loudly if she should 'hook up with a good friend of mine to get get back at me.' How could someone who was sexually assaulted want to get back at their assaulter by fucking one of his friends? This evidence went into the Title IX investigation as evidence, so at least it was something that was useful for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The initial investigation ends in February (It was originally supposed to take 60 days, but it got really dragged on). On top of that, it turns out the Title IX investigator withheld an interview that was supposed to be used as evidence until a few days before giving her final decision. She claimed this was an accident, but in that interview it had a lot of evidence that was on my side. The school found me responsible for the fingering, but not the rape. Holyfuckingshit.jpg 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am currently waiting to hear back from the school to have a sanctions panel meeting where they decide weather or not I'll be expelled, suspended, or receive some other sort of penalty. My parents have hired a lawyer and we have made it very clear to the university that we are not afraid to file a law suit claiming my civil rights were violated if we deem the sanctions to be too extreme. I'm also pre-med, so any sort of sanction that would show up on my transcript will pretty much guarantee that I won't be attending med school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel as though my college experience has been ruined now. I think about suicide constantly, I have extreme anxiety, I have lost some really good friends in this process, and my passion for school just isn't quite what it use to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions to you people of reddit is this: Have you faced false accusations while in college? And if so, how did you deal with it? Have you ever been in the process of suing a university? "

I am currently in a toxic relationship that I would like to believe still has hope and I am trying to research couples therapy techniques to use at home and also trying to pinpoint what ex.

From my point of view, my partner's alcoholism and depression has caused the toxicity.

He frequently states that I am toxic, unsupportive, and make him feel depressed.

After googling a lot about emotional abuse today I am starting to think I may be the problem. If he is drinking and brings up something that bothers him that I did or something about me, I do not take it seriously. I address the problem in the moment when he brings it up because I am afraid of not seeming completely invested and concerned, however in my head, I always think that this would not be a problem if he was sober. So the next day when I bring up the conversation, I focus on the fact that he was drinking and I want him to stop and that I don't feel comfortable talking to him when he is drinking. He also says I am toxic and that I have made him depressed and he wasn't depressed or an alcoholic when I met him so I'm worried that its true. I keep trying to figure out how I can fix this and help him out of his depression.

He frequently is upset about me going out to hang out with my friends, study, or hang out with my family. He never outwardly says that I can't go and doesn't even always complain about me being gone, but the way he asks 'did you have a good time?' sounds accusatory (if that makes sense). And he is almost always drinking when I come back, which is why I think he behaves like this. He deals with a lot of depression and insecurity and I think I might not be doing the best things for him, I try to encourage him to go to therapy or support groups. In order to make him more secure I have cut back to almost nothing on going out with friends so that I can make sure he is okay and happy.

I'm worried his alcoholism is going to destroy our relationship to a point of no return. Everytime I ask him to not drink during a certain period of time, or when I have to go somewhere, he always will drink. He got a DUI last year and is still dealing with that legally and still has not stopped. I feel stupid even typing this because if I was reading it I would be screaming at the person to GET OUT. But I am afraid of what will happen to him if I leave. Aside from our relationship I am fairly successful, I have a great family and good friends, I have maintained Dean's List throughout all of this since 2017, I have a job, and internship, and am in school full time and doing well. He has a great steady job, and has friends there and his family is very sweet, but his depression and alcoholism are taking over his life. I am scared he may hurt himself if I leave, if not intentionally then through drinking himself to a point of no return.

I don't know if this relationship is truly abusive or not. My last serious boyfriend was physically abusive towards me, and he is not physically abusive, so I just don't know. I don't even know if this is the right sub to post in - it just seemed like a good place to type out my thoughts that I don't say to anyone out loud."

This is my first time sharing for a while, so I‚Äôve built up a lot in my head

The past year, I‚Äôve felt my mental state revert to how it was when I was in high school. I consider 11th grade to be my lowest point in terms of my mental wellbeing. Academically, it was my worst year because of all the days I missed because of my anxiety. I had these beliefs that all of my teachers hated me and thought I was a failure (which I‚Äôm sure couldn‚Äôt have been farther from the truth). 12th grade, things starting to go up and have been going up for me, until recently. I think the stressors were losing one grandfather in March, the other in August, and my step-grandfather last month. 

Since March, I haven‚Äôt felt like myself. Despite being top of my class in my major, I‚Äôve felt these thoughts start to come back. I know logically that all my professors are very proud of me, but recently I‚Äôve been magnifying every little mistake I‚Äôve made and jumping to conclusions without any real evidence. It‚Äôs my last semester of college and I‚Äôm in an internship, so my main communication with my professors is electronically. I think this fuels my anxiety as I don‚Äôt hear any of the tones necessary to actually get the true meaning of their words. 

There‚Äôs no concrete explanation to why I got better the first time other than I was in a period in my life where the circumstances caused me to mature. I think I‚Äôm in similar circumstances now. That, in addition the losses I‚Äôve experienced the past year, made for the perfect storm. At least, that‚Äôs how I see it. But I digress. 

The point to this little rant is I was wondering if this was normal? I‚Äôd really like to hear any stories of reverting back to old thought patterns or habits and how you overcame it. 

tl;dr gone back to old thought patterns after losing grandfathers, wondering if this is common and if anyone has experience with this type of situation "

I have come to a point where I need to make a decision about this summer, and I currently see two choices:

1. Accepting an internship that's far away from me, doesn't pay great, and doesn't appear to be what exactly I want to do. However, it is IE work experience and in today's market, it seems like that is the hottest ticket currently available.
2. Staying at my university and continuing the research relevant to my interest I am doing with a professor (unpaid) and work on some personal mathematical modeling and optimization projects while holding another part-time summer job.

As reference, I am a third year IE student with no relevant work experience, a bad GPA, and am interested in more Operation Research type jobs.

aufadg,35,2019-02-24,"Theory: Dan and Arin don't want to do Game Grumps anymore, so they're making the channel ""commit un-alive"".",DeltaRamenSebas,rantgrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/aufadg/theory_dan_and_arin_dont_want_to_do_game_grumps/,"So I've been thinking for the past few months, and seeing Dan and Arin work since the big re-brand of 2018 (new Grump Heads, the Ten Minute Power Hour, streams, hiring of a bunch of interns seemingly with no purpose, and more recently the schedule change and the bombardment of absolutely horrendously boring, repetitive, half assed games) I've come to the conclusion that, the guys don't want to do Grumps anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

But they don't want to admit it because they know that the *""lovelies""* would go ape shit over it and annoy them to no tomorrow, so they're thinking strategically. Essentially, since the re-brand they've tried their best to lower the overall quality of the gaming aspect of the show, shown when Arin *""forgot""* to do Ghoul Grumps and more recently with all the shitty shovel ware games, the numerous play throughs of ""Jeopardy!"", and of course, things like ""Spot the Difference"" and. *fucking.* ***riddles.***

Another big clue for this is the energy they show during sessions, they're bored, uninterested in the game itself, almost like they didn't want to be there, Which they're doing on purpose, knowing that word gets out very quickly through the community about how bad their quality has gotten, and people will either stop watching because they can't bare the quality of it, or keep watching, which just helps them with revenue.

As for the company aspect of Grumps, they want it to die, so they hired a bunch of random friends to work for them doing...nothing..., not to mention hiring a *fucking* ***writer*** to make their dialogue because they've run out of ideas on discussion topics, and so that the channels funds deplete more quickly. But, in order to even out the playing field, they made the TMPH, to show that they're still putting some effort to the show, which isn't much.

I don't judge them though, they've been at it for a while now, not to mention Dans almost in his 40s, so the guy has got to be tired of all the loudness and randomness by now, not to mention probably wants to move on to music full time. And Arin probably just want to work on other things (I assume, I don't really see him going back to animation, so I don't really know what he'd do other than bank off the monetization of the channel) Although I do have complains for both of them, why does Arin continue to try to fake rage and ignore tutorials on every single game, not to mention shit on them as much as possible for no realistic reason. And Dan, having played video games as a **job** for all these years, yet still never has a knack for how controllers work, hasn't played almost any games from this century, and is essentially Arins (excuse the term Dan, not trying to be rude) bitch boy for jokes and gags. Arin on the other hand is just the worst manipulator ever, pulling on Dans leash whenever he needs to validate himself or tries to be ""funny joke boi"" and purposely fakes the ""Grump"" persona to the brink of insanity. Its frustrating, seeing this snake try to just monetize any sort of interaction with Dan at this point, completely half, even quarter assed most of the time. I have heard that apparently Dan wanted the show to have a more ""Podcasty"" vibe, thus the ""quality content"" we have now, but seeing how they had a podcast that seemingly just stopped as fast as it started, I don't know what to believe.

Game Grumps still has so much potential left untapped (I've actually made a post about this in the sub a while back) like how they could actually put all those interns to work and revamp things like GrumpCade, Neo-SteamTrain (since a lot of people seem to think that regular old Steam train is solely Ross's thing, I decided to pay homage to that) or even their GrumpOut channel. They could do so much still, but instead are trying to make the Game Grumps slowly crash to the ground with all these problems they themselves have produced. Honestly I think, and ive heard a lot of people hypothesizes this as well, that the supposed ""YouTube Algorithm Problem"" that's apparently plagued them is just an outright lie, because realistically thinking, seeing that your biggest source of income is making less money, yet you decide to make *less,* lower quality content rather than more content with high quality, how is that even logical??

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, ive watched the Grumps since the late start of the Dan-era, and of course have gone back to see the Jon-era, and all the genuine laughs ive had with numerous game series mean a lot to me, but I don't see Arin going back to that style any time soon. I honestly don't give Game Grumps even 2 more years of life anymore, but ill always keep a hopeful eye out, hoping that it just maybe gets better. But what do you guys think?"

1. What kind of food should I feed a cat? Is wet or dry food better? What brands are the best? What about treats?

2. Are there any kinds of toys that are better than others for keeping a cat entertained while I‚Äôm away? I live in an apartment and I‚Äôm currently a college student and will have an internship next year so I will be away periodically.

3. Should I get a harness and a leash to give a cat more exercise outside of my apartment?

4. What‚Äôs the best way to keep a cat from scratching furniture?

5. How often should I take a cat to the vet for check ups?

augnig,62,2019-02-24,My mother [51F] expects me [20F] to pay off the mortgage and I don't know how to talk to her,throwaway_239210310,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/augnig/my_mother_51f_expects_me_20f_to_pay_off_the/,"Last week, I was home from university during a study break. Over dinner one night, my mom told my dad not to worry about the mortgage if he couldn't work because I would pay it off. I responded that I wouldn't do that, and if they couldn't pay the mortgage then we should sell the house. My mom took this quite badly and yelled at me for being an ungrateful and heartless child, and she continued to rant to my dad about it after I decided to not finish dinner and left the dining room table. I was upset at the time and told them I'd go back early to the city of my university the next day. However, my mom got up early the next morning and hid my laptop and the pants I brought home so I couldn't leave, then spent the rest of the break pretending nothing had happened. I didn't talk to her much for the rest of the week.

I wanted to convey my disappointment through silence, but I probably should've spoken with her. I don't know what the best way of talking about this is. If I leave the issue alone, we'll just pretend like nothing happened when I go home again, and I'm not okay with that. I have a relatively close relationship with my parents, but occasionally I feel like my mom treats me as an investment; I'm an undergraduate math student planning to start a phd next year, and she often suggests I delay graduate school for a few years to work in finance to make money, which wouldn't be a great career move. Sometimes she asks me to buy luxury items for her or expensive meals which she never asks my dad for, and this makes me feel like she thinks the money I earn is almost disposable? When I bring these things up with her, she just laughs it off.

A month ago, my parents' car broke down. They wanted to buy a new car and paid a $1000 deposit for it, but later decided it was too expensive and bought a used car instead. However, they had to forfeit the deposit, and since they were unhappy about this, I transferred them $1500 to cover the deposit and towing costs for the old car. So honestly, I'm willing to help pay off some of the mortgage, but it wasn't even as though my mom had asked me to do it; she just assumed I would. But at the same time, it's kind of ridiculous considering I'm living on scholarships, student loans, internships, and extra money from tutoring. I manage to support myself by living frugally and have not asked my parents for any funding since I enrolled in university, and I've transferred about 15k of extra money to my parents over the past 3 years. Sometimes I feel guilty and selfish over not planning to get a cs job after university, which would pay much more than academia and would immediately improve the standard of living for my parents. But I can support myself this way and do what I want, I just can't possibly pay back a \~300k mortgage during the next six or seven years without giving up on my dreams. So, Reddit, how should I communicate with my mom on how I feel about this matter?

Edit: I haven't taken out additional student loans since 1st year so I only have 5k of student loans to pay off which I will be able to do immediately after graduating. My parents haven't asked me for any of the 15k that I've sent them. My parents are first generation immigrants, don't make a lot of money, and my mom doesn't work.

TL;DR: had an argument with my mom after she assumed I would pay off the mortgage and I refused, how do I talk to her about this?"

I'm currently a second year undeclared student. I had an EXTREMELY POOR freshman year, but I am doing far better this year. I'd like you to rate my chances of internal transfer.

Freshman Year, Semester 1

* M 408C - B-
* CH 301 - Q-Dropped
* GOV 312L - A-
* ECO 304K - B
* UGS 302 - B-

Freshman Year, Semester 2

* M 408D - A
* M 340L - B+
* CH 301 - A
* CS 312 - Q - Dropped
* E 316L - A

I ended my freshman year with a 3.41 GPA. I applied to internally transfer into CS, but obviously, I didn't get in. But after doing so poorly my first year, I had a fire lit under my ass and did MUCH better my second semester. Here are my stats for this year:

Sophomore Year, Semester 1

* M 427J - A
* M 348 - A
* M  362K - A
* PHY 317K - A
* PHY 117M - A
* HIS 315K - A

Sophomore Year, Semester 2 (Projected Grades)

* CS 312 - A
* M 325K-H - A / B
* M 368K - A
* M 378K - A
* PHY 317L - A
* PHY 117N - A

After my first semester of sophomore year, I now have a cumulative 3.64 GPA, and if I make all As this semester (which I'm confident I will in CS 312, M 368K, and PHY 317L and 117N for sure), I will have a 3.74 GPA.

Edit: I have some extracurriculars. I've been an active participant in Association of Computing Machinery and various programming competitions within that organization. I'm also in the Directed Reading Program in Math, where I am currently doing a project with a graduate student on Numerical Analysis in Computing. I also teach kids to code through a church program. I also had an undergraduate math REU after my freshman year, and I just accepted an internship from Google Engineering Practicum after this year!

Thoughts? Please be honest. If you think my chances of getting into CS are a joke, say so."

First post, sorry for formatting and length.

For the longest time, I had believed that my experience growing up was somehow unique to my family, but over time it became much more apparent that other people have gone through very similar things. A few years ago I stumbled across the concept of ""narcissistic parents"" and assessed that my childhood seemed to match up pretty closely. For me, my dad was the narcissist.

Some recurring experiences:
* Being berated for any minor transgressions or missed chores, called names, and being told I don't care about the family if I made a mistake (even from a very young age).

* Being threatened with over-the-top punishments while already in the midst of being punished. For example, as a small child, I would be sobbing while being hit by my dad. He would then menacingly tell me to stop crying unless I ""want to get hit in the head a million more times.""

* Being told to be suspicious of other adults around me (including teachers and other parents) and to not share ""family secrets,"" like how we were treated at home.

* Being told that everything my dad did was ""because he loved us"" and that he wouldn't ""take everything so seriously"" if he ""didn't give a shit about us.""

* Having ""bad"" things that my dad hasn't forgiven/forgotten be brought up repeatedly in any future scolding, no matter how many years it had been and being told a grand narrative that I was ""still the same bad person"" or ""still didn't understand him"" or ""still immature"" like I was back when I did/said XYZ. For example, I distinctly remember one time he was berating me for some minor thing when I was 17 and brought up something I told my **kindergarten** teacher when I was five as ""evidence"" of how I was still the same immature, little baby. (According to him, I mentioned to my teacher that ""my daddy spanks me sometimes when he's frustrated."" Of course, he would never let me forget how wrong I was in thinking that, let alone saying that to a teacher.)

* Once, I had the spine to tell him that his abusive words were really hurtful and I felt that they were disproportionate for the situation. He turned it on me for not understanding his ""intentions"" and for being overly sensitive. Then he mocked me.

I grew up in constant fear of my dad's temper. If he was happy, he was nice and fun and easy-going and loving. If he was upset about anything, anyone could get caught in the cross-hairs whether they had anything to do with his problem or not. Therefore, I just wanted to keep him happy. I wanted to be a good girl. I was scared to genuinely speak my mind for fear of the repercussions. Every single interaction I had with my dad was characterized by my ""mask."" 

I became a really good liar to cope with him. I would literally pretend to have strong opinions about random things or criticize some easy low-hanging-fruit topic  that I knew he agreed with so that I could come across as relatable and genuine and not afraid of him. For example, as a kid saying something like ""ugh, I'd never get a tattoo. I can't even imagine why someone would want to permanently mark themselves like that"" when I already knew he didn't like tattoos. 

Eventually, I left the house for a work internship elsewhere and then college. However, the pressures my dad exerted on me and my older brother never let up. (Most everything I went through, my brother endured in spades.) My dad would always say that he never pressured us to do anything. He would say he didn't try to micromanage our lives while we were away from home. That was a half-truth at best. 

He wanted us to write to him via email every day ""if possible"" or ""as often as you can."" However, if we were busy and didn't write, he would get angry and send incredibly long rants via email about how terrible we were for not writing. I would spend hours crafting emails to send to my dad, hoping to keep everything as innocuous as possible so that he wouldn't sermonize and pick apart the things I shared in his return emails. He never failed to find something to lecture me about. It could be a person I mentioned or some small story I described. Then, if we didn't reply to every single point he brought up in his email replies, he would accuse me (or my brother) of avoiding the point/not responding appropriately. If we tried to correct him or clarify something he was starting to go off the handle about, it would result in even more lecturing and angry emails. 

As you can imagine, it became very difficult to write to him after a while. The sheer hours it took to write or reply to him, the emotional toll of trying to argue reasonably with him or fix endless misunderstandings--would get to be too much for me and I'd just stop talking to him entirely. Even when I thought we reached an understanding, later on he would revert to his original conspiracy theory about me and act like I hadn't clarified myself repeatedly before. This continued through the first couple years of college, until we had a major falling out over an issue I couldn't back down from (long story) and I basically went NC while I wasn't home for holidays.

Years later, he twisted the narrative of this time to my younger sister, describing how I ""cut him out of my life"" and how I ""just wanted to be independent"" like I was some full-of-myself-pseudoadult (really, just a stupid child ""based on my actions""). She is unfortunately thoroughly brainwashed by him and his viewpoints, and has never accepted an alternative explanation of what happened between us those years ago. She acts very self-righteously offended on his behalf over how shit of a daughter I turned out to be. I've tried repeatedly to describe to her the utterly fruitless uphill battle of keeping in touch via email with him, how many hours I spent regularly to write to him for years, etc. etc. but if it wasn't good enough for my dad, then it wasn't good enough for her. 

My younger siblings didn't have nearly as rough of a childhood as my older brother and I. As we were deemed ""responsible"" for everything that our siblings did, we would be the ones to take the fall in any situation. As a result, they didn't often get to experience firsthand his gaslighting and irrational behavior. When I no longer lived with my family, he easily manipulated my remaining siblings to believe whatever he wanted to tell them about me. He's actively destroyed my relationships with my younger siblings through lying about me to them and getting them to agree to not speak to me (controlling the flow of information).

They're all so loyal to him and he has been incredibly successful at controlling them. I saw them eight months ago for the first time in over three years and I could tell how much things had changed for them. I love them and only remember them fondly. Even brief interactions with them showed that now none of them trust me, they all look at me with contempt, and think I no longer belong in the family. It was only when my dad told them to be nice to me that they started to even make small talk. I hate that he's ruined our family. I hate that none of them had the decency to second-guess his lies or reserve judgment until they heard both sides. I guess it was just easier to take the story they were told while I wasn't there to defend myself.

Now I'm married, finishing up graduate school, have a child on the way, and live six hours from them. For all intents and purposes, I'm making it in the world. I'm successful. But deep down I'm not happy. 

I love my family so much and nothing can replace them in my heart even if they hate me, even if my dad is a narcissist. I don't trust any of them as far as my pregnant ass can throw them. But still, my ILs can't replace the parents I've lost. My SILs can't replace my own sisters. I find myself just wanting to be alone, and I can't enjoy my life. I feel like I've got to keep a lookout over my shoulder. I have to play life close to the vest. I'm torn about how to raise my soon-to-be son.

Currently my dad is playing friendly, mostly because I'm pregnant. He's acting very ""loving"" towards me on the occasions that we do talk. However, I know that he's just as bad as he's always been because he literally went NC with my older brother (again) over the stupidest reason three months ago and hasn't replied to any of his texts since. I know that given the right excuse, he will start playing the cut-you-out game with me too. But, if I cut him out, then that just proves to my siblings that I'm a terrible daughter. He is always justified in his actions and I'm always made out to be this unforgivable entity.

I hate it all. I hate still feeling shackled by his existence. I wish he would just drop dead on a good day before he has a chance to make his last order for my siblings to stay NC with me. There's no chance of ""having a real conversation"" about boundaries because he'll just use any rules I try to set as a weapon against me again. 

TL;DR: Narc dad turns sibs against me and uses access to them as  a weapon against me and my brother. I'm afraid I'll lose them forever if I tried to cut my dad out--even though they're basically lost causes already. I'm also pregnant and have to figure out if any of them would be allowed to see my child, given his consistently manipulative ways and the fact he's been playing nice with me for a few months via text.

As a result, people kinda formed their circles and that was that.

I‚Äôm relatively shy, and I can‚Äôt drink due to the issues I have, so going out to bars and doing things like that is pretty awkward, since I‚Äôm the only sober one (not that you have to be wasted to have a good time, but I‚Äôm sure you catch my drift).

auipbz,0,2019-02-25,My (21M) ex-girlfriend (22F) just shut me out of her life with no explanation- confused and angry,BigTofuu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/auipbz/my_21m_exgirlfriend_22f_just_shut_me_out_of_her/,"I started dating this girl during high school, after moving to a new school. Our relationship was amazing for a really long time- we were each other's first loves, and we were really good together. We ended up going to different colleges, but we decided to pursue a long-distance relationship, as we were both committed to each other. I was able to see her about once a month, and we lasted like that for about two years. 

Last summer, we decided to move in together because she had gotten an internship in my city. Over the past year I had been dealing with a lot of stress in college and I had sunk into a pretty serious depression. After I told her about what I was struggling with, her attitude towards me immediately changed. She stopped saying ""I love you"", and refused to show any affection whatsoever. It was pretty obvious that she wanted to break up.

After stressing about that for weeks, I finally brought it up to her and asked her if she thought we should split. She agreed with zero hesitation. Unfortunately, we were both stuck in our lease and had to continue living together in the same room for another two months. Eventually we both move out and head back to school. We left each other on pretty good terms, considering the situation. 

I started to really miss talking to her, and would text her every so often to check in with her and to ask her how she was doing. I really loved this girl, and still cared about her immensely even after we broke up. I didn't want to push boundaries, so I'd only text her once every month or so. Looking back, I think I wanted her to ask me how I was doing, just once. Being depressed and a little suicidal, I just wanted to know that she still cared about me too. She never did. It really hurt for a long time.

Recently I went to go look her up on Facebook because again, I still really cared about her and wanted to make sure she was doing okay, but didn't want to contact her excessively. To my shock, I found out she had blocked me, as well as made her friends and family members unfriend me. This came as a surprise to me, as the last time I had tried to text her was two months prior, to wish her a Merry Christmas. I texted her again asking why she had blocked me. No response. I waited a couple of days and tried again. Nothing. 

Confused, angry and a little worried about her, I message one of her college roommates, asking if she's okay and trying to figure out what's going on. After a long while, she says nothing beyond ""she has no interest in having any contact with you"". The heartbreak sets in.

At this point, I'm ready to give up on her. I had no intention of getting back together with her, but I really did care about her and wanted to at least remain friends. I really have no idea what made her want to completely eliminate me from her life. I don't know if sacrificing my own mental health is worth it for someone who obviously doesn't want anything to do with me. Looking for advice or insight. Thanks for reading.


TL;DR, My ex wanted to break up after almost 5 years, I try to stay friends while respecting boundaries, but she shuts me out of her life with no warning

auj2ny,1,2019-02-25,Its now or never!,Well_it_Suks,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/auj2ny/its_now_or_never/,"Hi, throwaway account here for a new beginning. Well I am at my internship, today was suppose to be the day last day of this shitty internship but now because I fucked up my report, I have to stay a week longer. This is not the first time I have not being able to finish my work on time. Last quartile I dropped 2 courses as I was not able to submit reports for both of them. Going further back, it took me an extra year to finish my undergrad, and now doing my master. I should have started my thesis a week back but am still struggling to write a decent proposal. 

""Well this is fucking boring and I cannot seem to find the things what i am searching for. Fuck it, let me check out instragram for a while as a break"" that's the conversation what I have with my self while I was in my internship for the past 2 months or so. And the next thing what happens is - I am at the toilet fapping. After that I try to work again but I have this numbing feeling which is like I dont feel anything, what I feel is more anxious and unmotivated. This is not the first time that has happened to me. I remember doing this at the end of my undergrad, where faced with any kind of pressure, I had to rush to a toilet and nut it out. 

The next few months are very important for me and I want to be a better version of myself in these months. I have used masturbation as a coping mechanism since I was in eighth grade, before leaving for school, I used to fap just to calm my nerves. Masturbation has been a part of my daily life since then and now I am 27 and facing the consequence of how I have wired my brain to become this person. Disappointment for my supervisors, professors, friends and me myself. I know its gonna be hard trying to change that, I have tried before, but failed. But this time its important, this time it will count. 

Having been so much habituated to masturbation, I think the part which affects the most is the voice in your head. You have given so much to the urge of masturbation that, I feel, the voice in my head is working for the fap monster,  justifying why my fapping is GOOOOD. But now its time to change my narrative- and hopefully, narrative of the voice in my head.  So, with this I start the first day of NoFap, wish me luck so that i dont nut! (sorry for the bad pun) "
aujbj3,1,2019-02-25,I (25M) don't know if I should break up with my girlfriend (F25) for her unstability.,RocknPolo,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aujbj3/i_25m_dont_know_if_i_should_break_up_with_my/,"Hold on tight this is going to be a long ride. I've long hesitated to come here but, since every situation is different...

&amp;#x200B;

We had been dating for 3 years when she first decided to break up. She's from Italy and I'm French, we met at uni in France and before leaving me we had stayed 3 years in France, and 6 months apart because we had to go to different countries to do internships. Interestingly enough, that distance worked out very well: we could see each other often and it somehow made us even closer. That was at the very beginning of the relationship. The first two years everything was great, like really great. I had never felt such a connection with somebody, she was sweet, loving, caring,  perfect. But things started to go south the third year, whe she started working.

&amp;#x200B;

We had always had some problems or blurry zones regarding important issues (having kids, where to live, the fact that I don't actively take Italian classes even if I've spent a lot of time with her family and have a good understanding of the language, speaking French and Spanish...) and smaller ones (generally speaking, she's extremely proud and has trouble apologizing or admitting errors, while I tend to overthink and be a real pain in the ass when I don't get the answers I need). So basically, there are differences of mentality, on top of cultural differences (she is very expressive, I am not except when it comes to expressing how much I love her, and she's the opposite). When she broke up, she said it was because she couldn't bear staying in France anymore, that she wasn't sure to be in love with me anymore, and also perhaps because of her job. She was indeed working for an awful person that used to humiliate her on a daily basis because said person was very jealous of the GF for being young, pretty, and obviously, in a relationship.

That last year was wild, I had the feeling my girlfriend had lost it completely : she didn't want to stay in France, but told me she wanted to buy an appartment here. She wanted to change job to do French teaching, no wait, HR, no wait, law school... she ended up doing none of those and broke up with me and the end of the year, after admitting she had a problem with stability. She had never known that in her life, and now that she did, she wanted to throw it down the drain because she's not used to it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast-forward to after the break-up, she went back to Italy and I stayed in France, started a new career path and succeded, met new friends, in short rebuilt myself. I even met  a new girl but it didn't last. Everything went very well until three months after the breakup, when the GF announced to me she was coming back to France. My whole world shattered because, damn, I had done it, I had rebuilt myself after so much pain, and now she comes back and re-opens the wounds? At that time I was with another girl, and she had a ""friends with benefits"" relationship with a dude she could not stand talking to for too long. She was devastated when she learnt I was seeing someone, telling me she didn't think I was ""capable of doing that so soon"". One precision here: our common language is French, but somtimes we get lost in translation, and she later told me that when she said that, she didn't mean that she thought I was a loser, but rather that I would have waited more. Anyway, As I said it didn't last with the girl, and GF came back, we met for coffee and she started to consider maybe coming back with me. I was puzzled because she had said that she couldn't be in France anymore, that she hated her job and that she possibly didn't love me anymore. Now she comes back to retake the very **same job** she said she hated, in the **same city**, and now she was considering having me back?

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly didn't know what to think. I still had very strong feelings for her, and of course there were problems but there were good memories and strong ties too. So I told her I would consider it, under the conditions that she would change, and work on her unstability and pride, while I do more things like projecting myself with her (which I hardly ever did because I'd rather live the moment), and actually involve myself more in learning her language and culture. You can't have the same ingredients and the same recipe and expect a different outcome, right?

She said she needed time to think, I respected that. I only asked her one thing, not to play with me.

&amp;#x200B;

And then started one of the worst period of that year, because she did her best to leave me in the blur. A month went by before I finally called her to know if she had thought about all that. She told me that she still had fears, and needed time. I said alright, but I knew she was just trying to escape the confrontation. One day we were to meet after a weekend I'd spent out of town, she first tried to convince me not to meet because I ""must be tired"", and then confessed she did not want to meet me because what I was gonna hear was not what I wanted to hear. Now, in the past she had often reproached me with being a coward,  because there was a time I was unemployed and trying to change career rather than finding another dead-end job. When I understood she had no courage to tell me things, I insisted and she was clearly pissed off because now she had to confront me. We talked and I realized at that moment that I had no idea who was sitting in front of me. To be clear, that girl had : told me she was thinking about me and still loved me, ghosted me to avoid a confrontation, proposed to me in a more or less serious way, then ghosted me again. I told her I was sad, not for us, but for her, because she would hurt people and herself, and there's nothing I could do to help.

&amp;#x200B;

We agreed on cutting ties untill one of us could not stand it anymore. After that, I felt liberated, but you guess where this is going, right?

&amp;#x200B;

A month later, she contacted me for a beer, and explained to me that she dumped the guy and now was sure she wanted to be with me. I told her I needed proof, and also reminded her I had asked her only one thing, no to play with me. She did that, showed cowardice when she tried to find dumb reasons not to meet, and knowing she hated me for being a coward some time ago, that made her not only a coward too, but an hypocrite. And for the first time, she told me those three words ""You are right"". I know it sounds absurd, but really I had never heard this from the proud girl she is. She said she would totally go see a therapist for her unstability, and we agreed that if we were to get back together, she needed to put our relationship before her pride.

After that, I think the situation got out of hand by my fault, because of my feelings for her. See, I really loved her. Vvery soon we started dating again and within two weeks she was back in the same appartment we had shared a year ago. Same place, same job, same bobyfriend, same everything. Except for the cat we had.

At first it was a bit weird but everything seemed to have found its place again. She would indeed communicate more, sex life was a bit weird but alright, and we also agreed not to tell our friends before being absolutely sure it was going to work.

&amp;#x200B;

And then it all went South again.

&amp;#x200B;

Her boss was very jealous we got back together, because she didn't have anyone and also because she behaves like a 3-year-old : nobody can have a toy if I don't have a toy. Sometimes it was ridiculous, somebody would compliment my GF for having lost a bit of weight (btw, I found her pefect as she was, but she didn't like her body so she started doing sports and I encouraged her to do so), and her boss would complain about not getting the same compliment, even though she did nothing for it.

Anyway, that situation was starting to take its toll on our relationship, and I suggested she should quit, for her sake and ours. She agreed with me, but took a long time to act, and to put it another way, instead of curing the disease, she decided to treat the symptoms : she more or less forced us to get a dog, saying it would greatly improve her morale and our lives. Because,yes, her boss made things very difficult for us. All that humiliation and insults made my GF completely numb : we hardly ever went out in 5 months, sex drive was non-existent, and she would always arrange not to stay with me over the weekends to go back to Italy. After some times, she admitted she was bored of being here in France, to which I replied I could understand since she was indeed working here, but not living here. She'd always say ""no"" when I suggested we should go out, and at the end of the day, we had created no memories. We used to take a lot of pictures before, we even had a special album made out of carved wood for our pictures, and we had a lot. In a 6-month-time, there was still the same number of pictures in there than there were a year ago. I told her that, and if at the beginning she admitted i was right, she very rapidly gave up and made me fel guilty about it, saying I was ""forcing things"". The more time went by, the more I was questionning her intentions too. When she was back in Italy, she barely gave me knews, and one day she came back saying she had yet another crazy project, as she wanted to go to Milan to study, but that she also wanted me involved in it by being officially engaged. I was sick of her changing her mind all the time, but I said I would support her if that's she absolutely want to do. Right? Well, two days later, she figured she would give her actual job another chance by going to talk to her boss' boss. 

&amp;#x200B;

She then went to Italy because her firm's Italian, they loved her there and said they would think about what thye could offer. They eventually told her she could stay in France without being under the hierarchy of her boss. My GF was ecstatic about it, and I figured it was good news since I love my job and it's a job I really fought for. I asked her if she was happy with their decision, and she said yes without a doubt.

Guess what? She lied. The very same night she told me she'd like to definitively go back to Italy, and that I now had to make the same sacrifice that she did. I told her she should have said that at the very beginning, instead of making me believe she was happy with their offer, and also kindly reminded her that she\* came back here in the first place. I did not force her of anything, we weren't even together at that time.

A couple of days go by and she tells me they want her to go there 2 weeks to see how she works. So she goes there, and the first day they tell her they love her so much that instead of staying 2 weeks, they'd rather she stayed until December. And she was completely fine with that. So here I was, stuck with a dog I did not want, in a long-distance relationship she had imposed on me. I tried to talk to her, but she is very bad-tempered and when you make her face her mistakes or unconcistency (lying about what she really wanted, changing her mind all the time and forcing us to have a dog as a paliative instead of fixing the problem at its roots), she started to say awful things. She said she saw me as her true love... of the past. That it wasn't like how it used to be, that it's not normal for her to never want to have sex, to never want to go out, that it's not normal that she doesn't miss me when she's in Italy. I was crushed, simply crushed by what she said. I finally understood why she was always reluctant to quit her job : she knew her best chance of going back to Italy was to stay in that firm, even if it jeopardized our relationship. She broke up with me in that phonecall, but eventually said that she needed some time to think. 

After that, we barely spoke for a week or so. She admitted she did not think what she had said, but she said it because she was pissed at me for telling her what was wrong with her behavior. She also said that even if she had broken up with we, she totally meant to call me later. As if I was disposable.  She did miss me and loved me, but not in France. I asked her if she really, genuinely thought all of our problems would magically be solved once I would cross the border. She said yes... well no actually, she couldn't promise me they would, nor could she promise me she wouldn't lost it again and change everything in our life overnight. Then she proceeded to ghost me again for a few days, including Valentine's day, before calling me again because she ""missed me"".

All my senses are telling me not to go, and to end that. She tried to impose her will to me, a dog, a long-distacne relationship, she gave me litteral orders that I have to comply with if  I don't want her to ghost me, she told me to comme with her or else we're done.. She said we didn't talk because she needed to know if she missed me. Man, her last message before everything went wrong was, and I'm quoting ""I miss you so much"". Well maybe she does miss me, but then why doesn't she come back for a weekend? Or at the very least give me a call to know how I am doing. After a week of not talking, she eventually sent me another message saying how badly she missed me and how she knew I was precious, but I didn't answer. So she called me, because I think she was surprised that for once, I wasn't chasing her as I used to do. She told me again that she loved me, that she was veyr happy where she was, but the only thing missing was me. Then, again because I was pointing out that she said awful things and did nothing to make it up for it, she started again to say awful things, like ""You're not my priority"" ""You remember when you took me for granted for 3 years? Well now I'm taking you for granted"", before again saying she did not mean it. Oh, and also, she owes me money, but won't give it back to me unless I go see her a weekend, which kinda looks like blackmail to me.

Now, she's officially accepted their offer to stay there, and expects me to drop everything to go there with her in June, despite what she said, despite being cruel (she mocked me for calling her and telling her what mattered the most was our relationship, because she found that to be a weak and pathetic move), and despite forcing me to do what she wants. I'm very afraid that one day she'll push to get married and have a kid, and overnight change her mind and just leave me alone or worse, taking the kid with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading all this, and I know I have heaps of reasons to cut it. I just don't have the courage to cut it because, she's not a bad person, she's just incredibly unstable. That's why I'm seeking out help here, because I need to find the force to cut things with a woman I've loved more than anything. Thanks again for reading, I really need help in that, beacuse I was pretrified by the idea of calling her to end it yesterday night."

The only sounds in the room are your whimpers, your harsh breaths as you gasp for air, and the soft squelching of my fingers pumping in and out of your pussy. ""P-please, I'm s-so...""

I spread my fingers slightly inside of you, curling them up against your walls for added friction as my thumb slides over your clit in slow, cruelly slow circles. You're bent over my desk, your body trembling under mind as I lean over you, my hand wrist deep in the front of your unbuttoned slacks as my fingers work your slick little cunt.

But when I feel you get close, I stop. I let you fall forward against the desk, groaning with frustration as I slowly lick your juices off of my fingers. ""Interns with boyfriends don't get to cum. Remember, baby girl?"" I press my lips to the back of your neck, sucking at soft, sensitive flesh as you shudder. ""You know what you have to do.""

I'm interested in an RP where a woman has never had an actual orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college, and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her orgasm several times before the evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss just fucked her brains out.

The boss wants to have a playfull time with your character, but she resists, insisting that she has a boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again throughout the work day, reminding her of the actual orgasms they had the night before.

So, will you dump your boyfriend and let your rich, older lover spoil you and fuck you raw?

Kinks: anal, cunnilingus, public sex, clothed sex, mind break, ddlg, incest, lingerie, rimming and more

Limits: snuff, gore, any toilet play, and diapers"

Well, I guess I should make an update about what has happened to me the last months I was out. So let‚Äôs get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, in February, an scholarship for a exchange program in France was announced by my university and I was able to candidate. I practically had to hurry to learn the language in two months for the proficiency test, since my level in French was very basic at the time. I also needed to send some documents with my grades, extra-activities and cover letters to concur.

&amp;#x200B;

Between all this, the craziness in university began, I had to search for an internship and I became tutor in Solids Mechanics. Besides that, my brother and I were taking care of a dog we found lost near our house (a big fella, gave us some work). He ended up being with us for 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was waiting for the results for who was gonna be selected to the exchange program I had to focus on this professional / academic side of my life, as it was incredibly busy. I could go through it if relatively well, but not everything went so smooth.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was finally selected for the scholarship, I had to prepare for living in another country for the first time of my life. I had never lived by myself either. The experience was amazing in a lot of aspects, but during the time trying to adapt to this new life, studying in an university where I still struggled with the language, I ended up slacking of in some aspects of my life. I was not exercising and meditating consistently, I was often awake late at night doing projects or studying and I started indulging to PMO once in a while. I decided I absolutely had to get back on the tracks. I was in a place in my life where I could only get because of all the hard work and discipline I had and I needed to get to the top of my game again.

&amp;#x200B;

After about 2 weeks in this process of fixing my routine I thought, ‚Äúhey, I should check how are the Heirs doing‚Äù, and coincidently all those changes were going to happen, with the Discord platform and all, so I decided to join once again.

&amp;#x200B;

Let‚Äôs keep going, my friends. And may we always remember that **‚ÄúDiscipline equals freedom‚Äù**.

As the year has progressed, I realized more and more that I want to switch fields (out of my advanced spot).  Unfortunately, I just decided in the past few weeks that I am 100% about switching and most rank lists have been submitted :( .  I do have a good thing going for me already in the advanced spot, but being a resident made me realize what I want in life/career much more than a few med school rotations ever did..

&amp;#x200B;

Is it definitely too late for the switch to begin this summer or am I out of luck having to go through the match again in the fall (and essentially waste a year)?  Competitiveness and such shouldn't be an issue as the advanced position I originally matched in is tougher than what I hope to go into now.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone been in a similar situation and made the switch that could PM me or offer advice?   I have been told about residency swap as well, but dont know whos actually been successful with it.  Also, if I did hold off for a year, are there clinical opportunities to earn money for someone who only completed intern year while I wait for match again?

TIA!"

I'm a grad student in Information Science based in Florianopolis, Brazil. I'm currently working at a local company as a Jr. UI and UX Designer (hired a year ago as an Intern and promoted recently). 

The thing is, I've been searching for Online UX courses, certifications and masters that would help me get internationally recognized education in the field, which I intent to enroll right after graduation in December. 

Two options called my attention, based in the program certificate model and the institution: 
The UX design certificate at UCSD (Around $6,600, 18 to 24 months) .
And the UX  and customer-centered design certificate at Cal State University in Fullerton (Around $4,420, 12 months). 

I've found plenty of amazing program in other institutions, as Washington University, UCLA, and the University of Baltimore, but they all need in-person classes or they are too expensive for a foreigner. 

Since I couldnt find any former students from any of these programs, I'm requesting advises from people here who could help me with that, or indicate another course. 

Is UCSD so recognized as best than CSUF to justify the 2k difference? 

It is quite important for me, and I would have to sell my car to pay for the course, so it should be something actually meaningful. 

PS: Is there a possibility for foreigner to pursue scholarships? I've been searching about it but the US scholarships system is quite confusing. 

Thank you very much! "
aung7i,2,2019-02-25,"[F4M] Variety of prompts and ideas - MILFs, CEOs, Snowbunny Secretaries (and plenty more) [RP]",SmuttyWriterGirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/aung7i/f4m_variety_of_prompts_and_ideas_milfs_ceos/,"Hey, DPP. I'm looking for partners to RP and write with.

I have some extra info for what kind of stuff I‚Äôm into along with a few sample prompts and/or ideas for you down here. I also have plenty more in my profile ranging from simple MF pairings to threesomes and group scenes even up to a prompt roulette and CYOAs both for you and me. I'm always open to suggestions of themes and ideas we could work forward with.

***

##Writing Style

I play long-term and prefer shorter replies, that allow better interaction, usually one or two paragraphs, except for when longer descriptions are needed. I also only do written character descriptions and expect the same. I like introductions, building the dynamic and flirtatious interaction between the characters along with the obvious smut to make things feel more enjoyable and relatable. I don‚Äôt tend to play extremely dominant nor extremely submissive characters but usually on the flirtier and more active side, though I do like the corrupted cute &amp; innocent girl aspect a well.

I also like to write the introductions, so I can set the mood. Some change of pace for the guys of DPP.

***

##Ideas

**Male Talent CYOA**

I got this idea just recently. Premise is that you are a boss/manager/etc of a small porn studio and you need to run it and turn in a profit. I will be hosting this as a GM.

**Blackmailed threesome**

For this I'm looking to play a cheating woman in a high position with you playing both the man I'm cheating with and the person who catches us. Two basic ideas are you being a high school student (18+) who catches his two teachers going at it. Or an intern in my company who catches me with a rival ceo etc.

**Picking up chicks around the town**

You might have seen those clickbait videos where the guy goes around picking up chick with an expensive car. I'd like to try out building a prompt based around that without it being acted and much more smuttier.

**Fucking someone on shift**

A prompt based around not really caring a bout my job and just having fun while taking in the cash, can range from anything from me being a clerk at a secluded gas station or a late night security guard.

**Tomboy**

Anything tomboy related really, guy sports, mechanic in racing scene or anything else.

**Interracial pairings**

I'm white but I'm also open to playing an asian in a themed roleplay maybe something Japan or even Yakuza related. Along this I'm always happy to play prompts revolving around black men in a western setting

##Prompts

**Discovering company secrets and getting in on an even bigger one** [F4M]

Earlier this week you had discovered details of the company finances that, in a just world would lead to the whole board of directors in jail and the company being taken over by the state.

Now you were now being seated against the CEO, Ms. Jane Michaels in the top floor meeting room, glass windows overlooking the city lights. Her brown hair in a bun and black trim glasses on the nose. She was wearing her usual designer clothes: white dress shirt and dark suit jacket and matching pencil skirt. Along them there was something out of the ordinary in her outfit, something leathery around her neck. No one said a word.

As soon as you sat down the lawyers handed you a document, you read it quickly, confirming it contained everything you had agreed upon with the signature of the CEO in the bottom next to an empty slot for yours. You signed the paper, she made a quick motion and the lawyers disappeared like they had never been in the room.

Her gaze followed the exiting lawyers until she turned to you and reached into her shirt and pulled out a leash attached to a collar. ‚ÄúTwenty-four hours‚Äù she said extending the hand holding the leash towards you

**Going all the way with my son‚Äôs childhood friend** [F4M]

Visiting my son was always an enjoyable experience mostly because it was nice to hear how he was doing but partially because he was roommates with our neighbor‚Äôs kid and his best friend, who‚Äôd grown up to be quite a handsome young adult. This time he was coming back to his parents‚Äô who lived directly next door to us, so I decided to offer him a ride.

""Thanks for giving me a ride, Mrs. R"" he said as we both entered my sedan, parked in front of the dorm. ""Please, just call me Hannah"" I replied to him. 

I was a yoga teacher in my early 40s while my husband worked in sales and was quite often away from home leaving the mutual time quite short. My occupation was visible in my slender and toned physique. Usually I would be in my yoga pants and a tank top but for the visit I was wearing a dark blue jacket with the college‚Äôs grey sweater underneath along my black skinny jeans. My brown hair was on a ponytail.

""Did you get everything"" I asked him to make sure I could start the 45-minute drive home. Unbeknownst to both of us he‚Äôd left the keys to his parent‚Äôs house at the dorm.

**Secretary for my boyfriend‚Äôs black boss** [F4M]

I had been unemployed for a while before my boyfriend gave me a pleasant surprise. He had arranged me a position as a secretary at his company. The only problem. I didn‚Äôt get assigned to him, rather his boss, the CEO of the company, a seductive hot black guy, impressively still in his late 20s taking his position into account.

I stood in front of my mirror buttoning up my dress shirt hiding away my D cup breasts I was already wearing a black pencil skirt to go along with my blazer and the dress shirt. I was wearing black shoes and stood 5‚Äô7‚Äù high against the mirror. My light brown hair on a bun with my thick framed glasses on my small nose. I had otherwise quick sharp features with a prominent but feminine chin.

My boyfriend Mark was waiting me in the car. It was my first day working after he had gotten me into the company. 

‚ÄúDiane, Diane Winters‚Äù I introduced myself to the receptionist. ‚ÄúI was supposed to start with Mr. Black today.‚Äù

aunn6l,22,2019-02-25,TIL about the Independent Counsel Act - relevant to the Mueller report coming out.,sushicomped,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/aunn6l/til_about_the_independent_counsel_act_relevant_to/,"With the Mueller report coming out soon, you're going to hear a lot of the lefties complaining that ""we're just getting a summary report - tax payers paid for this investigation - we want everything"".  What they wont tell you - is why we only get a summary report.   
   
The Independent Counsel Act allowed for unlimited funding and less restrictions into investigations of top officials.  After the information overload shitshow it created for Clinton the law was allowed to expire in 1999.  Since then you cant have an independent counsel - just a special council, with limited funding, within the justice department, under the thumb of the president - and all thats required to be released is a summary report (as opposed to detailed accounts of interns getting whoo-hawed in the oral office).     
  

   
Good summary of the report difference:  
&gt;Unlike the Starr Report, which was a report by the prosecutors who investigated President Bill Clinton, this report is a court document, a ‚ÄúReport and Recommendation‚Äù from the grand jury itself combined with a document entitled ‚ÄúMaterial in the Grand Jury‚Äôs Possession Having a Material Bearing on Matters Within the Primary Jurisdiction of the United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary Relating to Questions of Impeachment.‚Äù 
     
  

and a bit more background - because its cool to have good information.
    
Tooked from CNN:  
&gt;	 	 CNN/AllPolitics - Storypage, with TIME and Congressional Quarterly

&gt;Senators predict end to Independent Counsel Act
&gt;March 1, 1999
&gt;Web posted at: 3:52 p.m. EST (2052 GMT)

&gt;WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, March 1) -- Saying, ""I don't think it is fixable,"" Sen. Tom Daschle on Sunday echoed the sentiments of many lawmakers on Capitol Hill toward the Independent Counsel Act.

&gt;With the statute set to expire on June 30, it is almost certain the law will be allowed to lapse.

&gt;""The time has come for us to close the books and try to find another way within the Justice Department itself to handle these responsibilities,"" the South Dakota Democrat said on ABC's ""The Week.""

&gt;Even GOP members of Congress agree with the Senate's minority leader.

&gt;""I'm beginning to think it would be better to put it back in Justice, demand more accountability, bring in these special counsels when the situation calls for it,"" Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee said on NBC.

&gt;But Thompson, who chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that oversees the Independent Counsel Act, rejects criticism of Independent Counsel Ken Starr, saying the problem is that the law fails to balance independence with accountability.

&gt;Under the current law, special prosecutors have an unlimited budget to hire aides and investigate their targets. Starr, for instance, has spent nearly $50 million investigating President Bill Clinton.

&gt;Sen. Carl Levin (D-Michigan), an author of the 1978 law and the ranking Democrat on Thompson's committee, also believes the law is flawed.

&gt;""Ken Starr has demonstrated the excesses and the extreme to which an independent counsel can go unless you have limits on that work,"" said Levin.

&gt;According to Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Connecticut), the 20 independent counsels appointed under the act have spent a total of about $150 million. Two-thirds of their investigations have not led to any indictments, Dodd told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

&gt;Both House and Senate committees plan hearings this week on the act.

&gt;Levin suggested that Congress look at a way to keep investigations within the Justice Department without sacrificing independence, ""so that we can have that kind of public confidence without having the abuses we've seen over the years.""

&gt;""For 180 years, we had a good system. It can work. It can work again. We don't need this independent counsel statute,"" Dodd said, citing how the old system worked even when President Richard Nixon fired special counsel Archibald Cox in 1973 because of his probe into Watergate.

&gt;After the so-called ""Saturday night massacre,"" Cox's successor, Justice Department special counsel Leon Jaworski, won 39 convictions on 45 indictments, Dodd said.

&gt;But Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Connecticut) told CNN's ""Late Edition"" he hopes Democrats will not rush to kill the act because of their distaste for Starr's investigation. Refuting Dodd's assertion, Lieberman said ""the system came close to a collapse"" when Nixon fired Cox.

&gt;It was reaction to Nixon's firings that prompted the independent counsel statute. The law requires the attorney general to seek the appointment of an independent counsel when there is substantial and credible evidence of a crime by any one of 49 top federal officials, including the president.

&gt;A panel of three federal judges then picks an attorney for the job. With approval from the attorney general and the appointing judges, the independent counsel can broaden investigations far beyond the original mandate, another target of the law's critics.

&gt;The statute was tested and found constitutional by the Supreme Court. Republicans were the first to complain of the law's abuse during Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's seven-year Iran-Contra investigation. The controversy prompted Congress to let the law lapse for 18 months during the early 1990s.

&gt;Ironically, it was Clinton who successfully campaigned for the statute's renewal in 1994.

aunqa3,2,2019-02-25,My boyfriend (23m) is having a hard time with the long distance between us and I have no idea how to make him feel better (f23),TarynNiquole,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aunqa3/my_boyfriend_23m_is_having_a_hard_time_with_the/,"hey, hi, hello.  the title pretty much says it all but I'll lay it out from the beginning.  fair warning this is reallllllyyyyy long. 

&amp;#x200B;

it start about last august when I went back out to School -university-.  I've been wanting to go back for awhile now, but I had a job  down with him and I was really just trying to stay as long as I could to save up as much money as I could and vola the day came and I went to school.  so,  We were together -living together- for about two years.  I was in florida for an internship and we had met and yea, it was great.  but I told him, and everyone else , that florida was only temporary and that I was going to go back once I had the money too.  right, he said he was fine with it, like everyone else, and we moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

So, Around late october, early november, he starts to tell me that he's been really depressed lately and he does have seasonal depression so we both were handling it like one does with depression.  However,  I kind of ended up pushing him away for the rest of the semester because I got really stressed out between work and school, and our contact became very minimal.   That triggered him to become VERY clingy and needy and blowing up my phone constantly with paranoid texts that include the following: ""You don't love me anymore"", ""I'm sorry that I keep bugging you."" ""why don't you answer me?"" and the list goes on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our schedules never lined up, so it was always kind of hard to text and even when I did message him it was always about how to calm him down, and getting him to try something new since I wasn't there.  He seriously lost interest in everything, and would listen but never take my advice.  

sooooooo, I ended up ""ending"" the relationship because I wasn't feeling it anymore -most likely due to stress and not wanting to deal with my own depression and someone elses depression-.   The holidays were around the corner and we weren't going to be spending it together because neither of us had the money too.  My sister at the last minute pulled some money out and got me to her place, so I was at least with someone lol.   I use """" with ending because we really didn't break up.  you read the title, so you know what happens.  

&amp;#x200B;

we stopped talking for a week. that was our breakup.   the reason for that is because I told him college would be a lot cheaper for me if he moved out here with me -like a 1000 miles away in the midwest-  and he'd be free from  his family who keeps wanting to drag him down.   he didn't take too kindly to the idea, and so I was like, alright lets take a break and over the holidays we didn't talk.  a week later we get back to talking about it, and  he told me that it wasn't a good idea for him because he was scared about ... many things really and he wasn't willing to take the plunge  on this type of thing just yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said fine, and we got talking about how he has become dependent on me to make him happy.  I told him I was willing to stay in the relationship if he was willing to work on  his depression like I am, and willing to make himself happy.  he agreed and for a few months now we've been fine.  Until this past week where he literally fell into the same problem again.  He said he doesn't have any hobbies or friends to hang out with because they all hate him and that he's too insecure to do anything he wants to do and it's really dragging me down in the process because I can't keep running to his  beck and call.   I'm a very...  sensitive person I guess.  Like,  it makes me feel bad when someone messages me and I haven't responded to them in like two hours or whatever.  so, I feel really guilty about the whole thing because I feel like I'm not doing enough to help him.  I told him that I don't know when I'm going back to florida, if ever because it was only TEMPORARY.    


I just really need some help.  It seems like everything I'm trying to do to convince him that  we should move in together -for him a 1000 miles away-  for a year so I can finish school, is a bad idea.   I know what it's like to move away from everything you've known, so I'm not pushing it as much as I kind of want to.   Am I the only who thinks it's just hit a dead end?  anyone know any words I can try to tell him to calm down?  I just... I really don't know what to do at this point, nor even what to say to him.  I'm not a therapist and i have my own mental issues, and it just feels like every time I try to reassure him, it's only fueling this dependent need of his to be closer to my side.  like we're magnets or something.

auofbb,302,2019-02-25,PSA: Watch out for Southwestern Advantage - it's an MLM.,Ae3qe27u,aggies,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/auofbb/psa_watch_out_for_southwestern_advantage_its_an/,"I got a call yesterday afternoon about what I thought was a potential internship. He told me that he'd been given my name as a potential candidate. I thought that maybe it was a late response from the career fair, so I was pretty excited for it.

Went in today and got a couple pieces of paper. One asked me to write down the names of ten people I knew that I thought would be interested in this thing.

They started by taking about how exclusive it was, how you could make a lot of money, how it would build communication and sales skills, and talking about how great the thing was. They didn't actually tell us anything about the program itself until about half an hour in, maybe 45 minutes.

They really emphasized how you could do and make so much if only you were willing to put in the effort. That got my r/antiMLM alarm bells ringing, and I took a bit to look em up while they talked about something or other. I kinda stopped paying attention about 20 minutes in.

Southwestern Advantage is banned from several university campuses, both in the US and abroad. They've been investigated for human trafficking in the past, as they expect students to fly themselves around. They expect you to work 85+ hours a week with no guaranteed pay, as ""employees"" are technically independent contractors. They expect you to pay for your own transportation, food, lodging, etc.

We should not be comfortable having an organization like this on campus. They are predatory, money-draining schemes that take advantage of na√Øve college kids. This does *not* align with the Aggie Honor Code. It's antithetical to everything we stand for.

If anyone has any advice on who to talk to to get them banned, let me know. They do not belong. Nothing else, I'll start shooting out emails.

Just a warning and a PSA."

auou9j,4,2019-02-25,Not happy in my relationship,When_In_Rome_WDE,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/auou9j/not_happy_in_my_relationship/,"I (M23) have been dating my girlfriend (F23) for two years. We met at work and were happy for a long time but recently I have just felt miserable and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. When we started talking/ dating I had friends at work saying I should probably avoid her because she was sort of mean and honestly a little crazy (she had a little fling with someone else at work who said the same thing). 

Anyway, we started dating and she occasionally had little fits where she got upset, but she would calm down. I am majoring in engineering, where an internship or Co-Op isn‚Äôt necessary for graduation, but it is very helpful to get experience and looks great on a resume. The major that she was in (Apparel Merchandising) requires an internship but she was having a hard time finding one. Fast forward a few months and I started an internship 4 hours away from our college, but she didn‚Äôt find one. She blamed me and my father for not helping her enough to find one, and she was upset that I took a job a few hours away. Basically she was jealous and said she wasn‚Äôt sure if we could work being apart for 3 months. We got through it but during the summer she was also looking for a new apartment. Once again, she had trouble finding one and said it was because I didn‚Äôt help her enough (while at my job 4 hours away). She finally found a place and I thought all would be well. 

Fast forward a few months again and I got another internship, only about 45 minutes away (only 20 minutes away from my hometown so I lived there) and she was stuck doing her ‚Äúinternship‚Äù as basically her normal job at the retail store we worked at. At the end of that summer she graduated, but had no luck finding a job (again, apparently my responsibility to help her find one even though I can‚Äôt do anything about her lack of experience or low GPA). She moved in with me (against my parents wishes) and has continued to look for a job, but still no luck. I will graduate this coming May and I have already accepted a job 2 hours away. At first she said she did not want to move to this city with me, because there will be no job opportunity for her there and that I was being selfish. That is true, I did make a selfish decision, but it was either that or me sacrifice my future and a great job offer and wait around on her hopefully finding a job. 

Over the past few months I have just been really unhappy with my relationship for a few reasons. It is mainly her thinking everything is my responsibility, but also her always complaining that we never do anything fun and that I don‚Äôt take her anywhere (like Disney World, she loves that place) even though she knows that I do not have the money for that right now. She also never trusted me with the friend from work and always assumed that I liked her, when she was truly just a friend. 

Another problem is that I am starting to develop feelings for someone else at work, who I feel like may like me back. We have been talking recently and really enjoy working together. I realize this makes me an awful person and I would never cheat on my girlfriend, but as I‚Äôve said, I am sometimes miserable with her. I feel like talking to this other person has made me realize that I am completely unhappy in my relationship. I had seemed sad recently and my girlfriend asked what is wrong, and I told her everything about being unhappy and constantly feeling like she blames me for everything. She said she was sorry and just stressed and didn‚Äôt mean the things she has said. There have been times where she has gotten upset and said we are done, but later acts like it never happened and now she said she didn‚Äôt really mean those things and she wants to really try to make things work now. She said she is willing to move to the new town with me because she really wants to be with me. 

To make matters worse, she sent me a message apologizing and saying she was sorry, but she also said that I‚Äôm one of the only reasons she‚Äôs still alive, and without me she doesn‚Äôt really see a reason to live because she is not happy with her life. I feel like that is trapping me in the relationship because I don‚Äôt want her to hurt herself, but I do not want to stay in something that is going to make me miserable. She always says she hates her life and her job, and I tell her to look for new jobs, even back home so she wouldn‚Äôt have to pay rent (something she sometimes struggles with because of college debt) but she never does anything about it. 

Sorry for the long post, I just don‚Äôt know what to do and can use any help and input. 

(Edit):
Another thing I‚Äôm worried about is the living situation. If we broke up, I assume she would quit her job (like I said she should do anyway) and move back home. However, she would put in her two weeks and still have to stay with me probably since she doesn‚Äôt really have any friends in the area. I could always sleep on the couch for the two weeks, but I feel like it still may be too awkward and cause her extra pain constantly seeing me. She could simply quit, but then the company will not hire her back, and there is a store in her hometown and she has also tried to pursue a job with the corporate location. "
aup8tr,30,2019-02-25,"Leaving the MSP world, some experiences and reasons",supaphly42,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/aup8tr/leaving_the_msp_world_some_experiences_and_reasons/,"Been in IT in various capacities for around 15 years, the last 8 or so in MSPs. I'm looking to move back into an in-house position now. I know in-house isn't perfect, and there is plenty that I'll miss about being an MSP, but I think it's the best place for me at this point. 

Here are some of my thoughts on the benefits of being in an MSP. First and foremost, it's amazing experience. I have learned so much by doing it, I wouldn't trade it for the world. I've gotten to work on systems for so many different companies, it's amazing. From a small 3 person office to a large medical practice. I have gotten to work on all different hardware setups and software systems. I manage both a Hyper-V and a VMWare setup, and can see the day to day differences in managing the two. I've used countless pieces of company-specific software, and have seen what works and what doesn't, and why. There is absolutely no other way to get that breadth of knowledge. Even changing to a new job every few months, you won't have the time in to gain the knowledge. This is years of knowledge on each of these systems, learned concurrently. Second, the people. I'm in and out of offices all day long. I meet and work with so many different people. Some wonderful, some horrible, haha. I work with everyone from the entry-level intern to the owners of multimillion dollar companies, and have gotten to develop relationships with all of them. Most people only work with the handful of people they interact with day to day. And another major is the flexibility. I love being able to schedule my projects as needed, knowing that, emergencies aside, I can come in late one day if I need to, or take off early. And I enjoy the time spent driving around in the summer with the windows down, instead of being in the office. 

That said, there are reasons I'm moving. Most of these are flipsides to the positives. For example, the flipside to getting knowledge across a couple dozen clients at once, is that there are times when things are going wrong at several clients at once. Trying to handle all of that can be brutal. Also, as much as I love the flexibility, there are plenty of times when I end up working in the evenings or on weekends on stuff, or occasionally through the night for a big emergency. And having to justify all of your time. It's nice to be able to do some research on something without worrying about whether it's unbilled time you have to justify to your boss, or billable time you have to justify to the client. And the biggest is focus. I'd love to be able to just focus on one place. To not keep getting pulled away to other issues all the time. To be able to just learn one system completely, and to be able to really spend time doing preventative work and making things run better, coming up with new ways to set things up, etc. Even with a client that's fine paying for that kind of stuff generally, you can still rack up a huge bill quickly that they wouldn't be fond of. 

TL;dr: I definitely enjoyed the time I spent doing it, and I'm sure I'll miss parts of it. And I would absolutely recommend it to someone fresh out of school. It's such a valuable learning experience. "
aupvle,24,2019-02-25,My internship mentor flew to my college town to profess his love for me,winevessel,cswomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/cswomen/comments/aupvle/my_internship_mentor_flew_to_my_college_town_to/,"I am graduating with my CS degree in a few months and had an internship with a large company this past summer. I was put on a team of all guys but it didn‚Äôt really bother me because I‚Äôm used to being the only girl around at this point. I kept in contact with my mentor (~38 single male) whom I spent a lot of time pair programming with and he emailed me that he was driving through my little college town on his way to see friends and asked me to grab lunch with him. 


Thinking nothing of it I go, but that‚Äôs when it starts to get creepy. He was meeting friends in Dallas, TX and was not just driving through my town. He flew down to Houston (4 hours away from Dallas) and rented a car to drive up to where I live before driving to Dallas. He only lives a three hour drive in the opposite direction of Dallas so this was WAY out of the way for him. He decides to stay in town the night and is asking me to show him around which I decline because I have things to do, but I agree to get lunch again the next day because I am feeling guilty. 


The next day I bring my boyfriend with me to lunch because I can tell something is up. I think he is finally gone after this but he messages me later that night that he is still in town for another night because he forgot his laptop here and asks to meet again tomorrow which is a Monday. I tell him no I have school and work and he begins to beg to just come talk to me for 10 minutes. 
Me being pissed and stupid I agree to meet him briefly in a public place for a few minutes while I grab coffee. He tells me that he fell in love with me over the summer and thinks that he might have a chance with me. The worst part was when he mentioned that he still wants kids and that I would be great for him being that I‚Äôm only 21. I obviously told him no and to please not ever talk to me again, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I did something wrong to make him think this. 


This was my first experience being in a corporate environment and now I am about to graduate and start my career elsewhere (thank god I rejected my offer at that company) but I am terrified that I was not acting professional enough or may have given other people the wrong impression. Is this what my whole career is going to be like? I understand an office crush but this was beyond creepy from someone who was assigned to help me and have my back. Now I feel so uncertain of myself and am afraid to start my new job. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust the men I will work with. 
What advice do you other ladies have about how I can fit into my new work place and try to avoid something like this again? Has anyone had a similar experience?

I now have a pretty consistent rhythm with my current work situation, where I go to a coworking space with cubicles and claim a cubical for myself all day. My Spring internship also entails working at a different coworking space a couple times a week.

Right now I do have a grab bag of pencils and pens I carry along with my laptop and some notebooks in my backpack. I commute via train.

Now that I‚Äôm so often spending a full work day or longer at the cubicle space, I‚Äôve started wanting to grab some more fun and productive supplies like highlighters, a nice calendar or planner, folio, thumb tacks (I can pin up whatever I want so long as the space is mine and I take it when I leave), file folders, paper clips, etc


Does anyone here have ideas or suggestions about making a workspace home when you are packing it up and putting it in a backpack at the end of the day?

How do you personalize a temporary yet consistent work space?"

I feel like I already know this answer, but I need to ask anyways to know I've covered every basis.

I am a Masters level social worker, aiming towards getting my licensure. I currently live in one state and have currently put in my resignation. I am feeling awful about it, but for my own mental sanity I am moving out of this state and back home. (I moved from Florida to Wisconsin, last year). 

However I am feeling the most guilt I have ever felt in my entire life. All over one client. I work with a young kid, 7 years old. And he has a lot of anxiety and depression. However we have REALLY connected. In fact I just got a message from his Mother expressing her gratitude towards me and how happy she is regarding the connection that has been made and the progress he has shown in just over 6 months. 

I will have to let her know soon that I am leaving and I know it's going to absolutely devastate the family but most of all the client/child. He has never shown this progress with anyone else,and I feel like I'm abandoning him. 

Is there any way to keep in touch with the kiddo. Letters every now and again? Or do I do what I know I should do and just rip the bandaid off and aide in the transition as best as I can. 

I need some advice. This is my first real job in the field outside my internship and I'm just struggling"

Let me know if you know anyone who can help.  


""My Invison account was maliciously taken over late Friday night with myself and my team locked out. I've been a customer of Invison for many years and spent thousands of dollars with the company. I've advocated for them with my clients, interns, students and employees.

I've been attempting to regain access to my PAID account since just past midnight on Friday night and was just informed by Invision's support that I'll need to negotiate with the hacker who took over my account ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/bgb3oAT)) in order to regain access.

Currently my credit card is still attached to this account and I have no way of cancelling because I'm unable to access the admin controls. I'm hopeful that Invision will do the right thing and verify my identity using the plethora of other methods available (other than negotiating with someone who proved malicious intent).

These methods include but are not limited to:

1) Looking at the credit card on the account and seeing that both the name of the business and name of the person are in fact me.

2) Looking at my team's years of history with the company and considering that perhaps kicking everyone with an @""studioname"" email address out and changing ownership at midnight on a Friday night is unusual activity.

3) Using common sense

I'm posting this, not so that FB sympathizes, but instead hoping that the design community (their customers) will see this and be aware. Invision you have an opportunity to help right a wrong, or continue to keep my team from our work and charge me for an account that I no longer have control over."""
auuddv,20,2019-02-25,Epic Gamer Grumps is getting worse and worse and I‚Äôm noticing it more and more as time goes on and on. This title is stoopid woopid. - A pretty lame history of my time watching grumps,Evsta99,rantgrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/auuddv/epic_gamer_grumps_is_getting_worse_and_worse_and/,"I started watching grumps at the beginning of mario galaxy and loved it so much. The jokes and all the series after it made my day the best it could be but as years went on slowly lost interest in grumps. Kevin left, Brain joined, Super mega arrived, we started hearing about manager Brent, Brian fazed out of existence, grumps started going on tour, grumps did a YouTube red series, content started becoming less fun, Barry left, then 400 new people (who I still don‚Äôt know) joined, and I stopped watching regularly.

10 minute power hour started! I began watching again more frequently. I looked forward to those videos until I realized that the joke about 10 minute power hour was to be as obnoxious as possible. I still watch in hopes of the videos getting better but they rarely make me laugh like they used to.  

They stopped making the long series of one game just because non loyal ‚Äúfans‚Äù stop watching them at episode 10. They can‚Äôt pay all of their freeloading friends who joined grumps as time went on, even though it seems like they weren‚Äôt needed in the first place. Seeing as how all of them are just sitting on a couch during power hour. 

They decide to compensate for replacing the series‚Äôs with streams where interns come in and out and talk over Arin and Dan. The Unfunny interns make inside jokes we don‚Äôt understand. They read donations every 10 minutes and don‚Äôt focus or make jokes/comments on the game they are playing.  Which is nothing like the old series and is turned on only for background noise when I‚Äôm working on something, never turned on for me to enjoy and actually pay attention to. 

Now I watch and listen to old game grumps series‚Äôs, Sleepycast episodes, Supermega and Oney plays to get my fix of laughs. I love the grumps and I hope they are happy doing what they are doing, but I hope they realize they are now pandering to the newer audience and the older viewers are becoming less interested in what they are doing now. I wouldn‚Äôt even call myself an older viewer because I started watching during mario galaxy but I have definitely seen the shift in the type of content they produce. Anyways, if somehow any of the people at grumps see this, we still watch and hope the best for you guys. To all the and new employees or interns working for grumps, I‚Äôm sure you are all lovely, great people. Maybe try to convince the grumps to do a video where you introduce the behind the scenes interns and employees to give us an idea of what they dood there isn‚Äôt this blind hate towards y‚Äôall.

To me, seeing such a huge change happen so quickly is kinda sad. Grumps is becoming more and more like a company rather than small a group of friends doing what they love. 

In conclusion, I miss Kevin.

auvfqc,1,2019-02-26,How Much Does Where You Study Matter for Your MBA?,dipika20,u_dipika20,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dipika20/comments/auvfqc/how_much_does_where_you_study_matter_for_your_mba/," 

As well as the choice of school itself, the physical location of your chosen MBA has a significant impact on your business school experience too, both inside and outside the classroom. It‚Äôs very unlikely you wouldn‚Äôt take location into account, at least in some respects, when deciding where to study your MBA, but it‚Äôs maybe not going to seem as important as the business school‚Äôs reputation or the course content. So, how much does location actually matter?

Many people aspire to hold positions of responsibilities in Managerial roles, such as that of a CEO, CFO or CMO, whereas some aspire to be entrepreneurs in the future. The most common approach to enter and excel in a managerial career is by completing an MBA. If approached in the right way, MBA can prove to be more than just a certificate added to your existing arsenal of courses and certifications. It opens your eyes to many aspects of the business world which otherwise would not have been of knowledge to you.

Deciding the place where one pursues their MBA is of utmost importance to people, given how corporates prefer colleges based on their history and reputation. Universities globally, such as Harvard, Stanford, Yale and IIMs in the case of our country, tend to get a chunk of the reputed corporates who pick up their students for corporate roles, whereas these corporates don‚Äôt tend to go to other B Schools to hire. The location shouldn‚Äôt be decided, keeping the job opportunity at the end of your MBA tenure in mind, but should be selected keeping in mind the courses you would like to study during these 2 years, to gain knowledge on the domain of study.

An MBA shouldn‚Äôt be perceived as an entry ticket to a managerial career but rather as two years of your life which you dedicate to improving yourself as a person and your knowledge on various aspects of your domain, through additional reading of books, business magazines or journals. Earning your MBA from a highly reputed B school would give you a great boost at the initial stage of your career, but the curriculum would be very hectic, given which one would not get enough time to work on individual development and knowledge enhancement. On the other hand, earning your MBA from a lesser known university might not give you a great boost right at the start, but once you have enough valuable experience in the domain of choice, you would be able to scale up the corporate ladder just as smoothly as an MBA grad from a highly reputed B School.

Consider the example of **Warren Buffet**. He does not have an MBA, but has successfully built Berskhire Hathaway and is also known for his great managerial skills apart from being known as the best investor alive to date. He spends a lot of time enhancing his knowledge by reading books and newspapers and even today, at the age of 88 is known for reading up to 500 pages per day!

Thus, MBA should be treated as a course that helps you enhance your domain knowledge and get useful business insights to the global business environment, rather than just a starting point to a golden managerial career. Location shouldn‚Äôt be the sole deciding factor on the MBA, but the courses taught in the university, faculty handling courses and the usefulness of the course with respect to your career aim should be kept in mind while deciding where to pursue your MBA.

**Life Inside the Classroom**

The location of a school matters less when it comes to life inside the classroom ‚Äì after all, a good school is a good school, no matter where it is. However, where your school is based can have a real impact on your academic experience, as it may affect the number and quality of speakers that come to visit and give talks, as well as the connections you can make at school-organized networking events.

When choosing a school, it‚Äôs a good idea to take into consideration where you want to do your MBA internship, as your chosen location can have a big impact on this. You should already have an idea of the sort of industries and companies you‚Äôd be interested in before you start your MBA course, so focusing on locations with links to internships in your preferred industry could be useful to consider. For example, schools in California may be useful if you‚Äôre interested in the tech industry, while London is likely to be a good choice of study destination if you want to pursue a career in finance.

You can also explore schools that offer formal affiliations with other business schools or international campuses, allowing students on one program to study at the other campus and access both alumni networks. The University of Bath School of Management, for example, offers global residencies at 50 institutions worldwide for MBA students. These formal affiliations can not only double your location, but also double your network.

**Life outside the classroom**

Studying an MBA will be some of the most intense years of your life, so it‚Äôs important to be in an environment where you feel safe and comfortable and are able to take some downtime when you need to. Don‚Äôt just visit the school campus or buildings when you‚Äôre deciding where to apply. Take a couple of hours, or even a day, to explore the place it‚Äôs in, so you can establish if it‚Äôs somewhere you could see yourself living (or even working after graduation).

Taking your own personality into account is vital when deciding the right location for your MBA. If you prefer smaller towns with fewer people, you‚Äôd probably be unhappy and stressed in a non-stop, bustling city like New York, and may value the small campus experience offered by, for example, Dartmouth‚Äôs Tuck School of Business instead. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to go for a school with a really good reputation if you know you won‚Äôt enjoy living there. You should also consider your financial situation when deciding where to study, as some cities are far more expensive than others.

You may also want to get involved in professional associations within your business school city, such as the American Marketing Association, so check to see if there are active local chapters near your school. These can be useful for networking and discovering new opportunities, both during your studies and after.

**Life after the classroom**

The most important thing to consider about study location is whether it will provide enough opportunities for career progression. Certain cities are simply superior to others in terms of both internships and post-MBA employability. Even if you don‚Äôt intend to stay in the city where you studied, the networking opportunities in certain cities are invaluable. A contact you make in London may lead to job opportunities back home in Chicago, for example.

Plus, some cities are good to be based in for specific companies; for example, Mumbai is a headquarters to many FMCG companies along with being the fiancial capital of India. Think about industries and cities you‚Äôre interested in working in after graduation and take that into account when making your decision. It‚Äôs also worth considering alumni networks in the city or town ‚Äì particularly the size and level of activity within the network ‚Äì as these could prove very useful both during and after your MBA. Apart from learning MBA looking for a [Good  MBA College in Mumbai](https://www.nldalmia.in/) is one of the difficult job when it comes to take decision, as future depend upon how you choose a right college."

Michaela is one of the most controversial character among fans; you either love her determination or you hate her bitchiness, no in between. personally i love her as a character, but am confident that in real life i‚Äôd fantasize about wringing her neck. i think she has some of the best (and most consistent) character development of the show.

there‚Äôs probably a theory about every character on this show being secretly ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù but i‚Äôve never seen any about Michaela. but i think it‚Äôs pretty obvious: she‚Äôs got borderline personality disorder.

for anyone not familiar with BPD, here‚Äôs a short spiel from NAMI:

&gt;‚Äú\[BPD\] is a condition characterized by difficulties regulating emotion‚Ä¶ This difficulty can lead to impulsivity, poor self-image, stormy relationships and intense emotional responses to stressors. Struggling with self-regulation can also result in dangerous behaviors such as self-harm.‚Äù

unlike most mental illnesses, BPD is developed in early childhood and is not usually the result of a chemical imbalance or genetics, although it is often comorbid, meaning people who have it usually do have some other mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc). the most commonly accepted theory is that it‚Äôs developed from childhood trauma, usually abandonment or neglect by a parent. we all know that babies and children need a certain amount of emotional and physical affection and a lot of times people with BPD did not receive that. think about it like this: when a baby needs attention, they cry, because they don‚Äôt know how else to communicate, and eventually someone‚Äôs going to come to the baby‚Äôs aid. people with BPD, because of a lack of emotional support in early childhood, never learned how to effectively communicate that they have emotional needs, so they hold onto these behaviors into adulthood.

we can infer that Michaela‚Äôs biological parents likely did not have a stable life. most men don‚Äôt just wake up one morning and shoot their wives (or girlfriend or whatever). that‚Äôs usually the culmination of years of abuse. in S3, Trishelle mentions that Michaela was rescued from the floor of a dirty swamp shack, so we can also infer that they didn‚Äôt have a lot of money. even though Michaela may not remember her life up to the point where she was taken from her biological parents, the damage was already done. at two, if her home life was messed up enough, she‚Äôd have already begun to feel the effects emotionally, even if she has no actual memories from that time. we don‚Äôt know how much time passed between her bio mom being shot and her being adopted by the Pratts, but it‚Äôs not an overnight process. she likely spent some time in foster care. Michaela‚Äôs time at the Pratts is also mostly a mystery, but we know that she clearly does not like them now. whatever happened to her after she was adopted, it didn‚Äôt leave a good impression, and it sounds like the house was pretty chaotic in general, with lots of other children. we can safely assume that Michaela didn‚Äôt get the level of emotional and physical affection that she needed as a child, and along with the traumatic nature of a lot of her childhood, it‚Äôs pretty much the perfect storm to develop BPD.

symptoms of BPD manifest in a variety of ways, but mental health professionals have simplified it into nine criteria. someone has to present at least five of these criteria to be considered borderline (she got 6/9 from me), which i‚Äôm gonna go through one by one. i got this list straight from the dsm-5.

&gt;1. frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment 

we see this a LOT with Tegan. the abandonment is obviously real (Tegan went from being her mentor to hating her), but Michaela takes it a lot harder than most would. between her starting her internship at C&amp;G and the Antares party, what, a couple of months passed? they were just starting to get close and Michaela‚Äôs acting like she‚Äôs lost a lifelong friend and will do whatever she can to regain Tegan‚Äôs approval. someone in their right frame of mind would realize it‚Äôs in their best interest to at least give the person some space to process things. the whole Antares thing kind of fucked up Tegan‚Äôs life, so it‚Äôs understandable that she‚Äôd be mad at Michaela, but it‚Äôs likely if Michaela had backed off at that point, Tegan might have calmed down enough to hear her out eventually.

instead Michaela starts trailing her around the office like a puppy, does Tegan‚Äôs work for her, tries to ingrain herself in Tegan‚Äôs life. my favorite easter egg is the night Frank finds Michaela getting drunk on the steps of Asher/Gabriel‚Äôs apartment. she‚Äôs drinking the same gin that her and Tegan shared that night in Tegan‚Äôs office. maybe a coincidence, more likely she was trying to feel somehow closer to Tegan by drinking her favorite liquor.

i also think of the restaurant scene, when Annalise gave them the recommendation letters. while Michaela‚Äôs reaction wasn‚Äôt as intense, she definitely had the most emotional reaction of the group and was the only one besides Asher, who only made one comment, to argue. i think that, at this point, her feelings toward Annalise were not nearly as strong as when they‚Äôd first started working for her, and it‚Äôs likely Michaela‚Äôs mind had already turned Annalise from ‚Äúall good‚Äù to ‚Äúall bad‚Äù before that moment (which i‚Äôll get into in the next point).

&gt;2. a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation

whew, this one! if the idealization/devaluation cycle was an olympic sport, Michaela would be a top contender. which makes sense cause we know she loves to win.

Annalise: again, Michaela‚Äôs first love, so to speak, at least as far as we see on the show. before the Keating 5 even begin the class, Michaela has started the process. Annalise is her professional idol, and, to Michaela‚Äôs mind, a stand in for the mother she wanted but never got. it‚Äôs very likely Michaela had spent years fantasizing about what meeting Annalise would be like and had already started to form a relationship with the woman in her head. of course, working for Annalise turns out to be nothing like any of them had expected, but to Michaela, it‚Äôs jarring. she‚Äôd expected Annalise to fawn over her for being smart and pretty and praise her as a perfect student and employee, but Annalise is cold and withdrawn, which only makes Michaela work harder for her approval. Michaela thought she‚Äôd finally found that mother figure and just ends up with another person denying her the emotional support she needs.

the students are loyal to Annalise for various reasons, namely because she keeps saving their asses and cleaning up their messes. but they all fight her at every turn, for whatever reason. Michaela is no exception, but it‚Äôs not always the case. sometimes Annalise is her hero, and other times she‚Äôs the spawn of Satan and the cause of every bad thing that has ever happened to Michaela. this is where the devaluation side comes in. borderlines tend to see everything as black and white; you‚Äôre either a good person or a bad person, they either love you or they hate you. and when they hate you, good riddance.

Caleb &amp; Levi: these relationships were short lived, and both of these guys turned out to be the woooorrrrsssstttt. Michaela didn‚Äôt even have a chance to turn on them, but based on how quickly she ended up in relationships with both of them, i‚Äôd say there was definitely some level of idealization going on here. interestingly enough, i believe that Michaela didn‚Äôt idealize them to the level she did Annalise and Tegan because they‚Äôre men. even though she‚Äôs obviously romantically and sexually attracted to men, the root of Michaela‚Äôs emotional issues tie back to her mother(s), and so she tends to idealize the women in her life more strongly because of that.

Asher: the relationship that never should‚Äôve happened, if you ask me. the two of them make zero sense as a couple. Asher definitely had a redemption arc, and dropped the dumb frat boy shtick, but it still didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense as far as their personalities go. but she went from basically hating him to planning their future as ‚ÄúMichelle and white Barack.‚Äù the relationship started as just sex, but Asher treated her well and, after dating a stalker and a murderer who was banging his sister, was basically the perfect man. the more time they spent together, her feelings towards him went from mild tolerance to actually liking him to idealizing him, painting him as the perfect mate in her mind.

at this point, the two of them are in an actual relationship and things are going well. Michaela starts at C&amp;G and this is when her infatuation with Tegan begins, and she starts to repeat what she did with Annalise in her mind, creating this fictional relationship. we can see that she‚Äôs starting to cool it on Asher; she gets visibly upset when he shows up to her job and introduces himself to Tegan, and starts to repeat her sentiments from the previous season about him not fitting into the plan she has for her life. then the crossover episodes happen. cheating on Asher was totally out of character for Michaela, except that at this point, she‚Äôd likely already started ending her relationship with Asher in her mind.

Tegan: Michaela returns to her roots, mirroring her feelings toward Annalise at the beginning of the show. older, successful woman, takes Michaela under her wing, although Tegan actually mentors her and is nice to her and praises her. you can see why Michaela falls hard. even though i ship these two, i don‚Äôt think Michaela is canonically but straight. Michaela likely doesn‚Äôt have sexual feelings towards Tegan, but the intensity of her feelings towards Tegan and the fact that Tegan is a lesbian is probably confusing to her because she doesn‚Äôt even know she has this disorder or idealizes these people, and therefore doesn‚Äôt understand what exactly it is she‚Äôs feeling towards Tegan. idealizing someone does feel like being in love with them, though, just in a super unhealthy way, so it makes sense that Michaela might even start to think she has romantic feelings for Tegan.

i already covered the abandonment part of their relationship, but i think we‚Äôre now starting to see Michaela devaluing Tegan. the moment i realized Michaela wasn‚Äôt idealizing Tegan as strongly was when she insisted they send the Jane Doe email. everyone else was shocked at the very idea of it, and even though Michaela insisted she loves Tegan, she knew the risks behind sending the email and talks the group into doing it anyway.

&gt;3. identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self

Michaela seemingly has a pretty strong sense of self when it comes to her professional life and has been clear about what she wants from day one in that regard. other than that, she‚Äôs struggling. her whole life plan revolves around what she thinks is the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do things: get married to a nice, rich man, have some kids, be the best in her field. even her serious romantic relationships have been based on who will look good on her arm and be able to stand beside her in her success and not on actual love. of course everyone wants to be successful in life but she wants literal perfection, likely as an extreme overcorrection of the craziness that was her childhood. her whole personality is based on this and i don‚Äôt think she actually knows who she is outside of her professional goals.

borderlines tend to struggle with knowing who they are as a person and are often known to build their personality around someone they find interesting or look up to, whether it be a celebrity or a fictional character or someone they know personally. this brings us back to to her relationships with Annalise and Tegan (seeing a pattern here?). i think Michaela definitely builds at least some aspects of her personality and her life as a whole around whoever she‚Äôs idolizing at the time. if i remember correctly, when she started with Annalise, she wanted nothing more than to be the best criminal defense attorney in the world. then she started working under Tegan and doing corporate law and we haven‚Äôt heard anything about that since.

&gt;4. impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)

sex with Olivia‚Äôs assistant when they go to DC for the class action is the big one. honestly most of Michaela‚Äôs relationships with men after Aidan are marked by some kind of impulsivity. her and Asher start as a hookup, and the thing with Caleb happened weirdly fast. 

overall, Michaela‚Äôs pretty type A and prides herself on the level of control she has over her life. the few times she does display impulsive behavior are usually when she‚Äôs under extreme stress and acting out in reaction to that. still, it would explain the seemingly out of character moments she‚Äôs had out of nowhere. calling ICE on Simon, in my opinion, was a result of that.

&gt;5. recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior

we haven‚Äôt seen any of this on the show thus far, so this one is a no. i could try to say the fact that she didn‚Äôt just go to the cops in S1 and wipe her hands of all the murder mess and continues to stick around all this death and drama is a form of self-mutilating behavior, but it‚Äôs a stretch and this is pretty literal.

&gt;6. affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)

i think no on this one. based on what we‚Äôve seen of Michaela, her irritability and anxiety are usually pretty appropriate for the situation at hand, and generally last until whatever stressor causing them is resolved.

&gt;7. chronic feelings of emptiness

i‚Äôm claiming this one off my own assumptions and not really based on any actual proof from the show. it‚Äôs an ensemble cast, and Michaela hasn‚Äôt gotten many moments of emotional vulnerability onscreen that don‚Äôt involve the group‚Äôs crimes or her professional life, but i‚Äôm claiming creative license on the basis of how long i‚Äôve been typing. i think that, based on everything else i‚Äôve outlined in this post, it‚Äôs fair to assume that Michaela frequently feels empty, not just in her personal life but emotionally as well.. especially with how she‚Äôs constantly chasing perfection, an unattainable goal, and with the string of failed relationships she‚Äôs had over the course of the show. 

&gt;8. inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)

another no from me. Michaela has had moments of anger, but at the appropriate times, and usually with an intensity warranted by the situation at hand. i think she displays a bit of a temper at times but it‚Äôs more bratty than anything.

&gt;9. transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms

this one‚Äôs a little harder to prove definitively. i mean, there are plenty of examples of Michaela totally freaking out, even showing dissociative symptoms (namely after Sam‚Äôs death). the issue here is that, well, she‚Äôd just witnessed, and then became an accessory to, murder. the rest of the K5 all seem to take things in stride, or at least have their own way of dealing with it. Wes is (surprisingly) calm for being the spaz of the group, Laurel likely witnessed crimes in her childhood, and Connor is clearly great at compartmentalizing. Michaela‚Äôs reaction can be chalked up to being traumatized, which would be completely understandable. they‚Äôre all pretty much in a constant state of paranoia over the things they‚Äôve done or witnessed as a group.

but, i‚Äôm gonna take this one anyway. i think Michaela definitely tends to be more paranoid than the others. she‚Äôs also had some paranoia over things that were totally unrelated to their crimes. Aidan‚Äôs sexuality, for one. she didn‚Äôt really have any reason to believe he was secretly cruising in bars or whatever but once she learned about him and Connor‚Äôs past (in high school, mind you. they‚Äôre like 25? 26? now. so about a decade later), she couldn‚Äôt let it go. (fwiw, i genuinely don‚Äôt think Michaela is homophobic. i think she had some harmful assumptions about gay people that many straight people have, and she reacted terribly to that whole thing with Aidan. she didn‚Äôt have Simon deported because he was gay, but because he had the power to send them all to jail, obviously. imo it‚Äôs no worse than Annalise framing Nate for Sam‚Äôs murder. but i digress.)

ok, this post absolutely got away from me so \*queue the award show cut off music\* i‚Äôm interested to hear (if anybody actually reads this shit) what you guys think. if you agree and have some examples i‚Äôve forgotten, please tell me! if you disagree, wanna hear that too! if you think i ‚Äútake this stuff way too seriously‚Äù or something along those lines, don‚Äôt bother reminding me but thanks for coming anyway!"

I would appreciate help with the following questions:

(1) U Pitt being in the city, are there typically sufficient opportunities to do internships in Pittsburgh itself? Or, are a significant number of opportunities outside of the Pittsburgh region?

(2) Are the internships in Pittsburgh region generally in the summer only, or would there be possibility of it being year-round - and if so, would you recommend doing year-round internships considering the course work involved?

(3) My other option is SUNY Binghamton, which is generally a small-town setting. Internship opportunities would most likely be in NYC etc in the summers, and they seem to be sufficiently available (looks like they even have a week during winter break during which they visit NYC employers). It will cost me the same to attend U Pitt or SUNY Binghamton. Any info about internship opportunities for U Pitt students would be appreciated!

Thanks!"
auvj4n,2,2019-02-26,I (25 F) think my (23 M) boyfriend wants all the power in the relationship.,lostforwords0112,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/auvj4n/i_25_f_think_my_23_m_boyfriend_wants_all_the/,"( Sorry in advance for the grammatical errors just really emotional and need to write this down somewhere) 

Let me just open on how our relationship was started. He moved to my city and was relocated to start his new job. I met him and was smitten and we started to date and I didn't think too much of it at first since I was planning to move out of state in a year. But soon we realized we liked each other and started to see each other more frequently. Not knowing anything about him I started to creep on who he was on social media. I couldn't find anything and then BAM I found his Facebook but it said he was in a relationship with another girl for 4 years.
 Yes, I know. Shocking. 
I confronted him about it and asked him why he lied to me and told me he was single. He then told me he was in a relationship with a girl who was anorexic and bullimic and was depressed. So that's why he was still with her. Me being (very F***in) stupid stayed and he was living his double life for 7 months. During that time I said nothing. I was empathic and tried to understand from the girls point of view and his. He never talked to her on the phone but always texted her. Wherever we would go out, when he went to the bathroom and even in front of me sometimes. I would break down and cry and tell him that I can't do this anymore. That it was me or her and everytime it was her. He was empathic and told me he wanted to be with me but needed to help her he would word it in a way where he said it was his ""duty"" to help others who couldn't help themselves. During this time he said he loved me and wanted to be with me and saw a future for us. That's why I stayed. 
(After 7months she broke up with him) 

Fast forward to present day.
We've been together for about a year and I recently graduated college and unemployed, but had an internship in the career field I'm interested in. He works at a big tech firm make about $70,000 a year and is pretty well of for his age. He has been supportive and understanding about my doubts about the career that I want.
Even though I'm not financial independent I do other things like domesticated chores around the house (laundry, cook, grocery shop, dishes, clean his whole apartment basically) without being asked.
But when we argue he turns into somebody else. He says that I bring nothing to this relationship and all I do is ""b*tch at him everyday"" about how he did something wrong. Even when I explicitly say how I feel about a certain situation he takes it as if I'm blaming him, but I'm not trying to. He also has taken personal jabs at me saying I always play the victim and says I'm so negative and I push all my insecurities on him and the relationship. Everytime I try to explain myself he cuts me off and says the conversation is over or just mocks me and doesn't even take the time to hear me out. 
He knows that my self confidence is low right now because I have been open about it with him because currently where I am in life. But everytime we argue he turns it around on me and blames my insecurities for everything. He minimizes my feeling in that moment and acts like it's all my fault. 
He has done this multiple time to the point where after our fights I calmly explain to him that when he makes personal comments about me he is really hurting me. He apologizes, but he then keeps doing it and his comments are getting progressively worse. 
When he does this it makes me regret being open and honest about how I currently feel and where I am in life because he just throws all my insecurities at my face and blaming me for everything. 

I literally feel so alone in this relationship and I have explained to him that when he disregards my feelings when we are arguing it takes me back to beginning where my voice was not heard or considered and it's
slowly breaking me down emotional and mentally.

His reply to every argument is that since he pays for everything all he wants in return is me just basically being quiet. ""He works so hard and that he doesn't want to argue anymore."" I do not feel like I even have a voice at all I this relationship with him. I can't even express how I feel because soon that will turn into an argument. I just have to pretend to be happy and satisfied when all I feel is alone. 

Tldr; boyfriend had another girlfriend for about 7months in the beginning of our relationship. He is successful for his age. But now everytime I express how I feel I get cut off and disregarded because he is the one financial supporting both of us. Does he want all the power in this relationship?

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

I've been lurking around for quite a while and have finally decided to toughen up and ask for help.

I am a graduating senior in my last undergrad semester. Throughout my college years, I have had jobs in the food service and retail industries. Currently, I work at a restaurant. I've tried to get internships since sophomore year, but have never been able to land one unfortunately. 

My anxiety has been rising as graduation comes closer, mostly out of fear that I won't get a job in accounting and won't be able to use my degree. I do really well in my accounting classes and my overall GPA is 3.2. I've still been on the lookout for internships, but my class schedule hasn't really given me the flexibility to work ""normal"" internship hours, since I have class in the morning.

Basically, my questions to you guys out there are
If you only have experience in the retail and food industries, how did you make that transition to getting an accounting-based job to start your career?
If you were able to land an accounting job after college without internship experience, how were you able to do it? 

Most people here have been really helpful, and I look forward to the insights you guys may have. Thank you!"

auxc55,62,2019-02-26,Cultural divide and how that affected the reception of the internship arc,NerdtasticBombastic,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/auxc55/cultural_divide_and_how_that_affected_the/,"I was watching a YouTube video by Truth Hero, and it hit me.

The reason why so many people on this subreddit never really liked or hated the internship arc, probably had to do with the cultural implications and discussion within the arc itself. 

As we all know, Bnha is set in a future Japan. As such, it relys on the culture of its setting to engage with its primarily Japanese audience. And while there is a few western popculture references here and there, it never really uses that seriously.

In the internship arc, the main conflict is between the heroes, the villians, and a dieing yakuza. This not only reflects Japan's recent yakuza crackdown, it demonstrates a severe culture swift in Japan.

The yakuza have been around for more than a century... because the government has allowed them to exist. The government does this because (not only do they help the economy) the yakuza have a code of ethics. These ethics are best summarized as; the usage or selling of drugs, stealing, and other indecent acts are forbidden. You must conduct yourself under the ninkyodo (the humanitarian way). This is why being a yakuza is often considered a way of life, or even it's own subculture.

However, this code of ethics is barley even followed. Hince the crackdowns. These groups aren't considered yakuza anymore, they are essentially maifi in yakuza clothing. 

This is why the big boss of the Eight precepts of death is so bent out of shape concerning the ""old ways"". He is literally trying to defend a subculture from collapse without recognizing its own inability to adapt to a new society. Much like the actual yakuza.

While chisaki is trying to change the yakuza for the better... he does so at the cost of its (the yakuza's) core beliefs. He hurts civilians, he manufactures drugs, he steals materials, the list can go on and on.
This man is not yakuza, he is a villian who believes he is.

Many of the complaints against Chisaki was that he had complicated and messy motivations. But that was the point. He is built to be the ultimate hypocrite. 

A man who wants to get rid of quirks, but uses them. A man who wants the yakuza to thrive, yet goes against everything they stood for.
A man who wants order, yet only creates chaos.

And you would have never gotten any of this subtext if you weren't from japan. Or at the very least don't keep tabs on a separate country, thousands of miles away from you.

This is the real problem with the internship arc; it relys on recent events in Japan, effectively dating and isolating itself from the rest of the world. And while I don't believe hirokoshi should bend over backwards to appease a world market, i think he should avoid using recent events to form a story. It dates a work and loses some of its universal age-wise appeal. Because in a few years, a couple of Japanese kids are gonna read the manga and react just as badly as we did.

And sure, even without some cultural context, this arc kinda sucked. But at the very least, give horikoshi some slack. He did not write bnha for some westerners (or for anyone else outside of japan). He wrote bhna to be published in Japan, not the world.

auy6ir,2,2019-02-26,Someone please help me tame my baby craze.,norsewolf,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/auy6ir/someone_please_help_me_tame_my_baby_craze/,"When I was a teenager, I was the one who kept herself occupied with the babies and small children at family events/parties (I saw that as part of my duty because I was the oldest child). Despite of that, I told myself I hated children and never wanted any of my own.  


Fast forward to October of 2017. My best friend gets pregnant (ended in a miscarriage, sadly), and I, just having met my boyfriend, become aware of a strange sensation. The feeling that one day, I wouldn't mind having children myself. Feeling this little bundle of love growing inside me, feeding the baby little spoons of mashed vegetables,.... You get the idea. However, I knew I had to be patient, since I was still young, a student and my boyfriend and I weren't together for that long yet.  


In September of 2018 I started a full-time internship at a company, which basically means I live the 9-5 work life now. Both my boyfriend and parents say I have become a lot more mature in the last few months. The adult feeling has not only affected my behavior, but also biological clock. I can't walk into a store without taking a look at baby clothing. I smile at random families, thinking what it would be like if that was mine....  


I suffer from PMS-depression which basically starts after ovulation. It used to be just feeling ugly, worthless and whatever, but now..... It is like my mind is blaming myself for not having a child. Every month. I feel worthless because I let another egg go to waste. Or who knows, maybe I can't even have any children (the though alone makes me tear up).  


My boyfriend is not mentally ready, and I know we are also not financially prepared to raise a child, and yet my head can't let go of the thought of having a baby. As I am typing this, I am having yet another discussion with my boyfriend that he isn't ready yet, and I am angry again because my body litterally screams for a baby. I am such a hormonal mess (and not even pregnant lol, behold).  


Someone please calm my baby oriented thoughts :(.

auyl1k,3,2019-02-26,One Laddie Army,Bl00dasp,gametales,https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/auyl1k/one_laddie_army/,"https://i.redd.it/afvribtutwi21.jpg

did my first one shot style session the other day

it was a star trek themed sorta one, real space opera with tons of nonsensical science words being thrown around sorta one.

&amp;#x200B;

we had 6 crew in the group

&amp;#x200B;

a envoy lovey dovey android that it was her goal to find the best soap opera in all of the universe called Heavenly Beep Bop.

&amp;#x200B;

Veren the engineering intern who is for some reason in charge of the entire engineering department and she was played as the pure innocent type who spent most of the time folding origami cranes and those 4 segmented fortune thingys (which she did in real life also) instead of actually engineering

Reginald Butterfingers the intrepid explorer / archaeologist / grave robber who wanted to find priceless space artifacts.

Chad man the sexy space pilot whos sole goal in life was to do the sex to the hottest space alien babes.

the the scientist second in command who wanted to science stuff that i cant remember the name of

and I played Laddie (definitely not Chappie because copyright), the murder kill non standard issue robot possibly stolen space DARPA tech body guard of the shady captain of a confederate stealth spec ops ship.

&amp;#x200B;

The scenario started out with the captain being un-conscious after being possessed by a space entity of some vague description that we never really payed attention too. we established the backstory for the ship as a liability to the confederate because the captain was as i said before a bit on the shady side doing some particularly dodgey stuff (exactly what was not specified). for the first half of the session i ended up doing little else than just moping around sitting on top of captains medical pod and not letting anyone within 10 feet of him until something i could apply my very kinetic stats to appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

we got a order from high command saying that they had gotten a distress signal from such and such system and it just suddenly cut out after a huge energy spike and we were going to go check it out. but after a maintenance roll it turns out the warp core was half disassembled for cleaning and we needed to decide if we should take a few days to properly re assemble it or to rush it in half an hour. we chose the latter and we succeeded... but it was so shoddily held together it would only last one hyper jump

&amp;#x200B;

when we got to the system we found a subspace anomaly where the station we were looking for should have been. we didint see much else because our stealth systems interfered with our sensors so Heavenly Beep Bop decided to get rid of those nasty weapon systems and divert more power through the sensor array. suddenly there is a massive definitely not borg (because copyright) dreadnought with numerous smaller support ships.

we decided yea nah lets not try to fight that thing so we decide try high tailing it out of there into a nearby asteroid belt to hide, asses our options and fix our bodged hyper drive. we failed that roll by a hair so as we come up to the asteroid field we suddenly come across 2 corvette sized not-borg patrol craft.

&amp;#x200B;

we cut engines and coast trying to come up with a plan. we have no weapons, our stealth is not perfect and we will eventually be discovered on our current course. we come up with a plan to do a boarding action using a shuttle with Laddie and some space marines which would launch at the last second before being discovered to get as close as possible and take the ship. while preparing this we realized that we both would not be able to get close before being detected and that even if we did the shuttle would be shot down en route so we needed a distraction. Heavenly Beep Bop came up with the idea to bounce their favorite soap opera ""desperate house wives"" off an asteroid to make it look like the signal was coming from over in the opposite direction from us. this idea worked as the not-borg immediately reacted hurling lazer fire at the asteroid. this means the dreadnought knew we were here so we started the rest of the plan early and only half prepared.

&amp;#x200B;

only Laddie and Chad man the sexy space pilot were on the shuttle when we decided to emergency launch it. we had planned for multiple other space marines to be here but we would just have to make due with what we had which wasnt much. sure we had a murder kill bot with body amour and a proper beefy lazer rifle instead of just a little dinky phaser pistol but there was only 1 of it what could it do? we thought to covertly cut the power to the engines of the not-borg ship number 1.... but Chad man the sexy space pilot failed the pilot check and forgot to break at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

we didint go crunch but we did careen of the side of the hull of the ship and start tumbling, engines dead in space. I decide that before we drift too far away laddie vents the rear compartment and leaps out of the tumbling shuttle and attempts to EVA back to the not-borg ship. we managed the roll and Laddie landed on the roughly rear third of the ship which was about 80 meters long.

&amp;#x200B;

Laddie started to traverse to the back of the ship in a attempt to disable the engines like planned but the a not-borg climbs out of a hatch in front of him. laddie being laddie with a lazer gun in his had blasts the arms and head off the not-borg . He heard a commotion coming from beneath the dead not-borg so he quickly slams the hatch shut and trys to weld it shut... critical failure.... the DM describes as i weld the door shut i fail to notice other hatch all around the place opening up and other not-borgs popping out. they start shooting but it appears that they were storm troopers because the didint hit anything but i knew that i could no longer do this quietly. so Laddie rips off a mag boot from his battle armor, attaches it to his gun, overloads the power cell and jet-pack leaps towards the stern of the ship does a flip after boosting and chucks the contraption into the engine that he just passed.

&amp;#x200B;

Critical success! the gun attaches to the inside of the engine, explodes and cripples the drive system of the not-borg corvette. meanwhile the not-borg dreadnought nearby just heard all the commotion and our weapons were still offline and while Chad man the sexy space pilot had bailed later than Laddie had and used a fire extinguisher to land on an asteroid with minor injury, stranded

&amp;#x200B;

and then the session ended because we ran out of time. it was a great experience, definitely want to do another of an extension of the one shot into a multi shot. the other characters like butter fingers did do stuff, it was important but uninteresting for thins story, mostly background things, taking command and flying the ship ect.

pic is just a doodle i did while waiting for things to happen, I hope you enjoyed reading this!"

By Jan Wolfe

WASHINGTON (Reuters) ‚Äì The U.S. Constitution explains how a president can be removed from office for ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù by Congress using the impeachment process. But the Constitution is silent on whether a president can face criminal prosecution in court, and the U.S. Supreme Court has not directly addressed the question.

The question looms large with Special Counsel Robert Mueller preparing a report on his investigation into Russia‚Äôs role in the 2016 U.S. election, whether President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign conspired with Moscow and whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe.

The U.S. Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, indicating that criminal charges against Trump would be unlikely, according to legal experts.

Here is an explanation of the rationale behind the Justice Department policy and whether it applies to Mueller.

WHAT IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POLICY?

In 1973, in the midst of the Watergate scandal engulfing President Richard Nixon, the Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Legal Counsel adopted in an internal memo the position that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Nixon resigned in 1974, with the House of Representatives moving toward impeaching him.

‚ÄúThe spectacle of an indicted president still trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination,‚Äù the memo stated.

The department reaffirmed the policy in a 2000 memo, saying court decisions in the intervening years had not changed its conclusion that a sitting president is ‚Äúconstitutionally immune‚Äù from indictment and criminal prosecution. It concluded that criminal charges against a president would ‚Äúviolate the constitutional separation of powers‚Äù delineating the authority of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the U.S. government.

‚ÄúThe indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions,‚Äù the memo stated.

The 1973 and 2000 memos are binding on Justice Department employees, including Mueller, according to many legal experts. Mueller was appointed in May 2017 by the department‚Äôs No. 2 official Rod Rosenstein.

But some lawyers have argued that the nation‚Äôs founders could have included a provision in the Constitution shielding the president from prosecution, but did not do so, suggesting an indictment would be permissible. According to this view, immunity for the president violates the fundamental principle that nobody is above the law.

Nixon himself in 1977 offered an opposite view when he told interviewer David Frost, ‚ÄúWell, when the president does it that means that it is not illegal.‚Äù

COULD MUELLER INDICT TRUMP DESPITE THE EXISTING POLICY?

Possibly. The Justice Department regulations governing Mueller‚Äôs appointment allow him to deviate from department policy in ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù with the approval of the U.S. attorney general, the nation‚Äôs top law enforcement official. Trump appointee William Barr currently holds that post.

Some legal experts have suggested Mueller could invoke this exception if he has uncovered serious wrongdoing and lacked confidence in the ability of the divided Congress to hold Trump accountable. Some lawyers also have said Mueller is not bound by the 1973 and 2000 memos because he is not a typical employee of the department.

Ken Starr, who investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s in the somewhat different role of independent counsel, in 1998 conducted his own analysis of the question of whether a sitting president can be indicted, indicating he did not consider the 1973 Justice Department memo binding on him.

Starr did not indict Clinton in his investigation involving the president‚Äôs relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky, but lawyers in his office concluded he had the authority to do so, according to a once-secret internal memo made public by the New York Times in 2017.

After the independent counsel statute under which Starr was named expired in 1999, the Justice Department devised procedures governing the appointment of special counsels to handle certain investigations. Mueller was named after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been overseeing the agency‚Äôs Russia probe.

COULD TRUMP BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE AND THEN PROSECUTED?

Yes. There is no debate over whether a former president can be indicted for conduct that occurred while in office. In fact, President Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon after his resignation, was mindful of this when he granted ‚Äúa full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.‚Äù

The statute of limitations ‚Äì restricting the time within which legal proceedings such as a prosecution may be brought ‚Äì may work to Trump‚Äôs benefit if he is re-elected in 2020 and serves a full two four-year terms as president until January 2025.

Many federal crimes have a five-year statute of limitations, meaning prosecutors have five years from the date the conduct at issue occurred to bring an indictment. That means criminal charges against a re-elected Trump could be time-barred.

Some lawyers have said that, as a matter of fairness, the normal rules on timeliness of charges should not apply to the president. The issue potentially could be resolved in the courts.

The U.S. Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, indicating that criminal charges against Trump would be unlikely, according to legal experts.

Here is an explanation of the rationale behind the Justice Department policy and whether it applies to Mueller.

WHAT IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POLICY?

In 1973, in the midst of the Watergate scandal engulfing President Richard Nixon, the Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Legal Counsel adopted in an internal memo the position that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Nixon resigned in 1974, with the House of Representatives moving toward impeaching him.

‚ÄúThe spectacle of an indicted president still trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination,‚Äù the memo stated.

The department reaffirmed the policy in a 2000 memo, saying court decisions in the intervening years had not changed its conclusion that a sitting president is ‚Äúconstitutionally immune‚Äù from indictment and criminal prosecution. It concluded that criminal charges against a president would ‚Äúviolate the constitutional separation of powers‚Äù delineating the authority of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the U.S. government.

‚ÄúThe indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions,‚Äù the memo stated.

The 1973 and 2000 memos are binding on Justice Department employees, including Mueller, according to many legal experts. Mueller was appointed in May 2017 by the department‚Äôs No. 2 official Rod Rosenstein.

But some lawyers have argued that the nation‚Äôs founders could have included a provision in the Constitution shielding the president from prosecution, but did not do so, suggesting an indictment would be permissible. According to this view, immunity for the president violates the fundamental principle that nobody is above the law.

Nixon himself in 1977 offered an opposite view when he told interviewer David Frost, ‚ÄúWell, when the president does it that means that it is not illegal.‚Äù

COULD MUELLER INDICT TRUMP DESPITE THE EXISTING POLICY?

Possibly. The Justice Department regulations governing Mueller‚Äôs appointment allow him to deviate from department policy in ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù with the approval of the U.S. attorney general, the nation‚Äôs top law enforcement official. Trump appointee William Barr currently holds that post.

Some legal experts have suggested Mueller could invoke this exception if he has uncovered serious wrongdoing and lacked confidence in the ability of the divided Congress to hold Trump accountable. Some lawyers also have said Mueller is not bound by the 1973 and 2000 memos because he is not a typical employee of the department.

Ken Starr, who investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s in the somewhat different role of independent counsel, in 1998 conducted his own analysis of the question of whether a sitting president can be indicted, indicating he did not consider the 1973 Justice Department memo binding on him.

Starr did not indict Clinton in his investigation involving the president‚Äôs relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky, but lawyers in his office concluded he had the authority to do so, according to a once-secret internal memo made public by the New York Times in 2017.

After the independent counsel statute under which Starr was named expired in 1999, the Justice Department devised procedures governing the appointment of special counsels to handle certain investigations. Mueller was named after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been overseeing the agency‚Äôs Russia probe.

COULD TRUMP BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE AND THEN PROSECUTED?

Yes. There is no debate over whether a former president can be indicted for conduct that occurred while in office. In fact, President Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon after his resignation, was mindful of this when he granted ‚Äúa full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.‚Äù

The statute of limitations ‚Äì restricting the time within which legal proceedings such as a prosecution may be brought ‚Äì may work to Trump‚Äôs benefit if he is re-elected in 2020 and serves a full two four-year terms as president until January 2025.

Many federal crimes have a five-year statute of limitations, meaning prosecutors have five years from the date the conduct at issue occurred to bring an indictment. That means criminal charges against a re-elected Trump could be time-barred.

Some lawyers have said that, as a matter of fairness, the normal rules on timeliness of charges should not apply to the president. The issue potentially could be resolved in the courts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) ‚Äì The U.S. Constitution explains how a president can be removed from office for ‚Äúhigh crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù by Congress using the impeachment process.

I need advice, please, im suffering",kickedoutofbyui,Gastritis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/auz7hg/ive_had_gastritis_for_a_month_now_just_got/,"Been over a month now where I wake up at 4:30 with that damn acid/burn pain in my stomach. Usually once I stand up it goes away completely and I'm able to function throughout the day. Does this happen with you guys as well? It was almost like clockwork, I'd wakeup at around 4-5 in the morning, i'd stand up, and the pain would go away almost instantly. It has since gotten a little worse to where I feel it during the day now. I just need advice. I read online on some sites that certain foods are okay to eat with gastritis, but a lot of them contradict each other. Some say you can eat things like apples and eggs, others say to stay away from all acidic foods and dairy like apples and eggs. I'm confused and lost. I have no health insurance, I just moved across the country for an internship. It's a high stress internship but I can't stop doing it. I'm not too stressed about it right now though but it has the potential to get more stressful. 

If anything please answer these questions:

1. My doctors were very unhelpful. I can tell they just wanted to get me in and out of the room and take my money and answered very little questions. Will this go away on its own if I change my entire diet like I'm currently trying? Or is this a life long thing? If its life long i'm seriously gonna kill myself

2. The doctor had me on Pantoprazole, it made everything I had a lot worse after 5 days on it so I stopped taking it. He said my body just had a bad reaction to it and he put me on Tagamet which is just some over the counter drug. This is the ONLY thing I'm on. I figure I'd need to be on something prescribed for something this serious right? Why the hell am I only being put on something anyone can get? Is there seriously not anything else that can be prescribed to me or is the doctor just wanting me to have to come back and throw another $100 at him?

3. this is what I bought at the store today, can someone tell me what is safe to eat?

spinach, brown sugar oatmean, greek yogurt, almond milk unsweetened and one vanilla, bananas, green beans, pears, carrots, fish, chicken, potatoes, eggs. I don't cook honestly. I work 10 hour + days and don't have a lot of time. I'm 100% fine eating simple shit to make this pain go away. I want it gone forever idk how much longer i can put up with this.

thank you"

This year, however, he moved to Connecticut in June for a one year internship, and I opted to stay in Ohio until the internship was over. When doing our taxes this year, we found that state law in CT required us to file separately, as I never lived in CT for any part of the year.

Are we allowed to file jointly for our federal and OH taxes and have only him file as separately in CT? Or should we just file separately on everything? Any advice or insight on how any of this works is much appreciated."
av0byc,15,2019-02-26,Housemates Boyfriend living in our house and not paying a penny. (Re-post from other page),Quinny31191,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/av0byc/housemates_boyfriend_living_in_our_house_and_not/,"So a bit of back story. 

Myself, my arsehole housemate (who we will call B) and two others live in a rented house in the UK. Recently B has got himself a boyf (Bf) and recently (roughly 6 months) Bf has basically been living in our house.

He is usually round 5 nights a week, sometimes staying a lot more than that, all the while having showers, cooking food, watching TV throughout the day (he doesn't have a job btw), charging his phone, playing games on his gaming laptop and just being an itch that doesn't really go away. 

To make matters worse, Bf is extremely intorverted and controlling over B. Before moving into the house together B was a shy, quiet and didn't really have much self worth. He wouldn't clean up after himself, would shower probably once or twice a week, didn't put his clothes in the washing machine, basically the epitomy of the stereotypical WoW player. 

After a year of basically being his parent we've got him out being social, given him confidence in himself and he basically sorted his life out. He started cleaning up after himself, showered more than once in a blue moon, started buying decent clothes (he had never owned a pair of jeans) and started to push himself. We were all dead proud of B and it felt fucking amazing that we turned him into a (almost) functioning member of society!


Then Bf arrived. 

It wasn't too bad in the beginning. The usual new relationship stuff happened and he started coming round to stay. Since all of us in the house have SO's we agreed that they can stay a couple of nights a week, any more they'd have to start contributing to the house. 

Anyways, Bf started staying round a lot more (3-4 nights a week) and we told B that we weren't happy with it. Firstly because its not really fair one us that he can bend the rules, and secondly because Bf's name isn't on ANY of the rental forms. 

B then started to regress back into his pre-house state. He's stopped showering, stopped washing his clothes, stopped cleaning his room (to the point where its stinking the whole fucking house out), never cleans up after himself e.g. the kitchen and he's basically locking himself in his room. 

This is where shit starts to hit the fan a bit. 

So at the start Bf had a paid internship, which due to circumstances which were out of his control fell through and he lost his job. This is pretty much where Bf started staying round 5 nights a week, usually coming on a Friday and staying right through to Tuesday/Wednesday night and going home. 

When Bf is round B turns into a completely different person. He's quite snappy, cheeky to us, never gives the full answer and LIES CONSTANTLY. He tries to cover up how much Bf is staying. He says that he's going home and they'll both leave the house. Around half an hour later B will return with Bf closely following behind him through the front door. 

They usually do this quite late on the night because they think we'll all be asleep. Only problem is that my bedroom is above the front door and you have to SLAM the door shut due to the frame being warped. Anyways they wake me up every time with the door being closed at like 1am and I can hear B and Bf giggling to eachother like school girls who've run away from school.

After this happening I confronted the pair of them and basically said that its unfair on us that Bf round all the time and doesn't contribute anything towards the house. They've agreed and said that Bf won't be around as much, but little to my amazement nothing has changed and he's even been round for two whole weeks without going to his parents house. 



This is where I need legal advice. 

Since Bf is technically living with us and isn't on the council tax, rental contract, utilities or registered as living here under the Housing Register, how illegal is this? Is there anything I can do to limit how often Bf stays over?

It doesn't help that every time we confront B and Bf about this, they say that they can't afford to pay the rent, but STILL PUSHES THE FUCKING BOUNDARIES on how much Bf stays. 

We're all students in the house so we're pretty poor as it is, but we've reached a point of just kicking them out by a majority simply because if they don't give a fuck about our rules then why should we give a fuck about him?

I'd also like to say that myself and the other two don't want to move house. We quite like where we are and want to stay put. 


Tl;dr housemate's boyfriend is round 5 nights a week, doesn't work, doesn't pay any bills and is super controlling over housemate. Refuses to leave or pay anything. Wat do?"
av0e8n,1,2019-02-26,My parents [48F &amp; 48M] do not approve of my [21M] girlfriend [26F] because they think she's too old for me,throwingmyselfaway09,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/av0e8n/my_parents_48f_48m_do_not_approve_of_my_21m/,"I've known my (now) girlfriend for 3 years now. We met at a previous workplace, where I was an intern and she was mentoring me. We didn't really get along at first and we were both in relationships, but as time passed, we realized we had a lot in common and became friends. I broke up with my (then) girlfriend, she left her job, moved abroad and broke up with her boyfriend too. During this time we grew closer together. 

When she visited after some time, she spent the nights at my place, and I was slowly falling in love with her. She was distraught and still a bit depressed after what happened, since she's been through hard times and I gave her space and time to heal, so I kept my feelings to myself. A few months later she told me she was unhappy abroad and that she was moving back. She also confessed to having a slight crush on me, but she mentioned she's afraid of the age difference. I felt like it doesn't matter, since I look way older than my age so it's not that obvious, and even so, I still wouldn't care. 

She's also more mature than me, since she has gone through a bad childhood, was very poor and sacrificed a lot of time and energy to be the best in school and at her job. I had a significantly easier life than her. She is quite accomplished: she has a successful career, makes good money, does a lot of volunteering and is well known in the industry (and I also think she's really beautiful), while I am still in my first year of college (I started later than most due to some issues I had in high school), working a part time job. 

After she returned, we started dating and I couldn't be happier, since she's basically my dream girl. 

Moving on forward to yesterday, when I introduced her to my parents. I didn't mention her age to them, since I didn't find it relevant, I just talked about her achievements.

When we entered the house, they started acting weird. We sat down, and after introductions and some basic chit chat, silence settled in. I found this weird since my parents were friendly and talkative when I brought my previous girlfriend home. To break the silence, I asked my girlfriend to talk about our first trip abroad, where she was a panel speaker at a conference. I was very proud of her, and she's always very passionate when she talks about the things she researches. My parents looked bored and weren't paying attention, point at which I was getting angry and my girlfriend was feeling a bit upset since she noticed their attitude too. I asked them what is the problem since they seem out of it, at which point my dad blurted out: ""Couldn't you find someone your own age? Or younger?"" at which point my girlfriend excused herself and went outside, with tears in her eyes.

I was furious at my parents, but went after her. We live 4 hours away from them, I drove all the way here, we both had to take a day off for the trip and this was the way they greeted us. I took my girlfriend back home, we both calmed down over the night. 

The next day I returned to my parents to talk some sense into them. They were being very rude and wouldn't listen to me, kept telling me she's too old, that she will emasculate me and she behaves like a man (this is not true at all, it's just that the industry we work in is male dominated and they're being biased). I left, frustrated at them and myself.

I went to my girlfriend's place to comfort her, since the whole thing left her shaken up, as she is very sensitive. She told me that she loves me, but would never want to stand between me and my parents, and doesn't know what to do. I totally stand by her and consider cutting off contact with my parents, but she's very against it, since I had a good relationship with them previously.

I don't know what to do now. I don't want to lose her.

TLDR: Dating girl of my dreams, who's 5 years older than me. Parents do not approve, she is considering separation so as not to stand between me and my parents. How should I proceed? "

Through high school, we saw only each other at our internship and we saw each other occasionally through college. Growing up, I lived in an extremely low-socioeconomic city and she lived in the ""hills"", a more ritzier part of town. 

I recently dropped out of school and currently completing a 6 month internship (with 4 summer internship offers lined up). She on the otherhand, is finishing her last year and is graduating in May 2019. 

In terms of growing up, we have a lot of the same issues with body image and mental illness. That's very rare to find a connection for that, and I appreciate that I can talk to her about these issues. I do see her as one of my best friends, however there's something that is bothering me a bit.

I've noticed, since I moved to the area, how many favors she asks of me. I have a car (that I bought after working multiple internships + working part time jobs during the school year) and will ask me to drive her to certain places. If she's hungry, she will ask me for food or to come to my place to cook. Whenever I ask to meet her half way on things (like, let's split an Uber, cook a meal together instead of ordering) it gets very awkward. She expresses that she doesn't have a job every single time. I politely decline if it's an inconvience for me, however, I'm a bit of a push over and just agree. 

Don't get me wrong, she's a very hard worker. However, our work ethic is completely different. If I want something, I will work hard for it. I haven't stopped working since I was 16, whether that was an internship or a part-time job; no job is below me. I've worked in fast-food while making ends meet with a poorly paid engineering internship. However for her, whenever I've tried to help her with getting a job, she goes on a rant on work culture and politics (she's extremely politically active, while I on the other hand, know as much as NPR will tell me). She is currently transitioning genders and says that she would not fit in with other women or the men. She had an engineering internship with Tesla and left after one month because of this reason. I've dealt with discrimination in multiple engineering internships and just had to find confidence on my own. Also, she can't hold onto a normal job either because of attendance. She doesn't pay for rent either, while I pay rent here in the Bay Area. 

Now what's been bothering me, is that whenever I tell her no, she just finds another friend to get what she wants, food or a ride. I keep seeing it on social media, and it makes me feel like a bad friend. I want to support her, but sometimes I get annoyed with how she doesn't work for what she wants. I don't want to keep buying her stuff or giving her financial favors, but I also don't want to be a cheap friend. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I'm slightly annoyed, but still want to be her friend. How do I handle this situation for the better?

av1uvo,4678,2019-02-26,How to pressure a teenage boy into dating your daughter 101,larniebarney,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/av1uvo/how_to_pressure_a_teenage_boy_into_dating_your/,"Posted yesterday about how an EP at my school got involved when her daughter didn't win homecoming princess, and some people asked if I had any other stories. This involves the same EP and daughter, but takes place a year later, when I was a junior. Again, I'm not directly involved, but the victim in this story was (and still is) one of my closest friends. He'll be referred to as A, the daughter is still V, and the mom is EP.  

Also, in all honesty I and our other friends found the entire situation to be fucking hilarious, both during and after it happened. A is a very lackadaisical, happy go lucky kind of guy, and it just seemed fitting that he would be the one who'd get caught up with V &amp; EP. Onto the story!


So for those who didn't read the previous story, EP is now the freshman counselor at my high school, and her daughter V was now a senior. I ended up having class with her (newspaper/yearbook) after the co-princess debacle of the previous year and my impression of V was that she seemed a *little* entitled, but besides that was social and hard working. She was in charge of the sports pages for the yearbook and always met her deadlines, so she was OK in my book.

Now V &amp; A were both on the swim team, A being a junior like me. Like I said before, A is the definition of ""go with the flow,"" but he does have a good work ethic, took AP classes, and was active in several other groups, including the very rigorous architecture and engineering program. In addition to this though, A was a stoner on the side and went to his fair share of parties. Somewhat important later.


One day in newspaper, in like mid-April or early May, I noticed that V was excitedly giggling about something in our classroom. The yearbook had already been submitted, so their staff was basically riding the school year out. I didn't pay very much attention to it until my friend B whispered at me ""did you just hear V? She's going to ask A to prom!"" 

*For the non-American readers, prom is just an end of the year dance held for the juniors and seniors. It's basically like a farewell to your high school life and kids will go all out for it, renting limousines, posing for formal photos and paying out the wazoo for attire.*

I turned around a bit to look at V and noticed that she had a whole bag of stuff next to her, and was working on a card. I've know A since we were 12 years old and I knew he didn't like V in that way, but hey, it wasn't my business and I had work to do, so I pushed it out of my head. Two or three days later, I overheard her happily talking about how he said yes, how *excited* he seemed, and how she was going dress shopping ASAP with EP after school. At that point, I really wanted to hear A's perspective on all of this. 

I swung by his house after class with the homies to find him lazing about smoking in his room with a bunch of balloons and some confetti in his hair. We all talked for a while until he said ""oh yeah, dunno if you heard but apparently I'm taking V to prom."" 

I confessed that I heard her talking about it earlier that week, to which he replied ""Wtf larniebarney, you could've warned me before she ambushed me."" 

Ambushed? 

That's when I finally got the full proposal story. V left a series of cards for A, placing one on his car after school, another in his swim bag, another in his locker and architecture station, hinting for him to be in the main hallway after third lunch (when there'd be a ton of students). She then dropped a banner that rolled down the stairwell that said something like ""A, I hope you'll *step up* and take me to prom!"".

Obviously, with a third of the student body milling about, people started 'Oooooing' and cheering, waiting for A to give his answer. In A's words: ""honestly I wasn't feeling it, I'd rather stay home and play some games instead of spending money to go to prom, but I couldn't just walk away from all of that, she's my teammate.""

So he walked up the stairs, gave her a hug and said he accepted. Crowd cheers, two of V's friends come out of nowhere and hand A a bunch of balloons (against school rules), toss confetti over A &amp; V (very against school rules), then play music on a Bluetooth speaker while EP takes pictures and video of the whole affair. A spent the rest of the day having students ask when the wedding was and congratulating him on becoming the new co-prince (lol).

After our laughter died down, I told him that V seemed to think he was really looking forward to this, and that tbh it sounded like she had a crush on him. I remember he shrugged, smiling, and said ""well that's flattering, but I'm just going to take her to prom, help her have a good time, then walk away from this and let the school year end.""

Well he should've told V that, because in her mind, they were totally dating. She spent the next week following A around, hammering out plans for prom, getting his opinion on this or that color for her dress, deciding where they were going to go eat dinner, etc. EP is also taking the opportunity to talk to him in the hallway, gushing about how they make the perfect pair and how wonderful they're going to look together. As far as the student body is concerned, they're dating. A took all of this in stride, still telling himself (&amp; us) that this was only until after prom, then everything would be back to normal.

Prom weekend finally comes and goes, and a few days pass before I see A again. I beat around the bush for a bit before finally asking him how it all went. Without missing a beat, A cheerfully responds ""oh, I totally fucked up.""

The gist was this; V asked A if he'd like to come to a family barbecue the day before prom, as a thank you for accepting in the first place. Never one to reject free food, he accepted. During the BBQ though, V &amp; EP repeatedly introduced A as V's *boyfriend.* A didn't have the heart to correct either of them in the moment but was planning to after the event ended, until EP introduced him to the assistant dean of the engineering department from a major university. 

After gushing about how talented her new future son in law was in our school's engineering program, the dean said that with EP's recommendation, he'd love to have A come in to interview for a potential scholarship. At that point, all of A's plans to tell V and EP that they weren't dating began to crumble. The next day, after taking V to prom, she stole a kiss from him and said ""oh by the way, mom is bringing some recruiters from X University to our swim meet to recruit you! She said she'll do whatever it take to help my new boyfriend get into a good school.""

At this point, while I think it's super fucked up that EP is doing this, I am dying from laughter. A doesn't want to make V's final month of high school suck by breaking up with her, and he's also low key anxious about what EP might do to his chances of getting a scholarship if he breaks her daughter's heart. So, in true A fashion, he decides that he'll just keep up the charade until school ends in a month, then hope V moves on (she was going way out of state for college).

For the next month, EP and V smother A whenever they can. Brunch &amp; dinner dates on the weekends, impromptu recruiters swinging by A's classes with EP who very much likes calling A her son in law, V not-so-subtly suggesting that A follow her to her out of state school when he graduates, etc. School ends, V graduates, and starts getting ready to move away for college. A purposely doesn't return her text messages or calls, and eventually she leaves the state. We all have one last laugh and assume it's all over.

Wrong.

When school starts back up again, EP finds A and starts asking why he hasn't contacted V all summer? And why he didn't come to see her off? And why he didn't buy her a going away present? Then she hints that she would *hate* to have set up all those opportunities for him for nothing. A finally stands his ground and declares that... he was just very busy with family matters all summer and didn't want to be a hassle to V during such a critical time.

EP accepts this and doesn't bother A for the remainder of the semester. Everything seems OK until December, when A gets a call from V. She's coming home for the holidays and wants to see her boyfriend. At this point, all of A's friends (myself included) *insist* that he finds a way to end this nonsense. A comes up with a plan.

As I said before, despite being a very good student, A is a huge pothead and liked going to parties. V however, never knew this side of A and is very much against drug use. So A decides to get stupid high, have a few beers and meets her at an IHOP smelling dank as fuck, then tells her that since she left, he's begun using drugs (lmfao). He says that he stopped contacting her because he knew she wouldn't approve and thinks she should break up with him and find someone at her new university who's better for her.

Without missing a beat, V declares that she's willing to *leave her out of state university and transfer back to our city to help him drop his addiction, because he clearly needs her.* A can't believe it, and finally doubles down, *insisting* that she can't mold her future around him and that she should think about herself first. V finally gives in, and after a rather tearful goodbye, goes back to her school and stops contacting A. 

EP never talked to A again about V (she'd always give him a major stink eye though), and all the recruiters she introduced him to stopped contacting him about scholarships. She also made a few snide remarks in front of other teachers about him possibly being ""a druggie,"" and even tried to get the school police to search his locker, but no one took her seriously because A at this point was the president or captain of multiple clubs and was still an excellent AP student. 


In the end though, a 6 week internship he got through the school engineering program ended up offering him a job after high school, complete with a program that paid for him to go to college. He's got a pretty neat job working as a graphic designer now and still gets absurdly stoned on the weekends.

*EDIT: I texted A to link this to him and his girlfriend answered; he's in surgery right now! Tore through three ligaments in his leg. Keep this nerd in your thoughts! May update if I find out more.*

*EDIT #2: A's mcl, pcl and acl gave out due to an injury that happened in November. He's out of surgery and at home now, but he'll be out of commission for a while.*"

Tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So.. I \[f24\] haven‚Äôt been feeling well about my relationship with my bf \[m25\] for about two months already. I still love him and I cannot imagine leaving him but I am so disappointed and unsatisfied. We had a lot of fights recently because I feel like he is not interested in anything I do anymore. It‚Äôs horrible to realise that your partner looses interest in you. I talked to him about it several times but he does not seem to understand it fully.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started when he left our home town for work for one month. It left a stain on our relationship even though it was not the longest time apart. We also were apart for three months already during my term abroad. However, he did not put much effort in maintaining the contact and all and I felt neglected. Especially because he said it was all due to stress but he kept sending me snaps in the evenings going out to lots of places and dinner dates with the group of friends he made there. I also saw him texting with one girl in particular via WhatsApp and snapchat when he didn't asked me once about my day or what has been going on in my life. When I opened up to him about my feelings he just argued that it's the only because of the difficult situation of being apart and that it's normal it wouldn't be super. However, I said that if the situation changes you have to put more effort into the relationship to keep it. He tried. But it felt unnatural and forced and it went well for a few days but went back to normal. He's back now but I still feel bad about our relationship. I always open up to him when I feel there's something wrong. One of the last times was that I didn't feel comfortable with him having so much contact with the girl when he's spending all day and evenings with her and the others already, especially because he didn't have much contact to me. He said that I'm completely overreacting because he didn't even meet her alone. When I asked him if he wanted to he answered: yeah why wouldn't I, I like her and we're getting along well. Just after I said that I'm not comfortable with the contact and I'm feeling bad about it he said that. For me it was like he didn't care about my feelings at all and is kinda selfish. I didn't even ""forbid"" him to stop all contact but just reduce it. I tried to make my feelings clear for him but he didn't really care. There are many more times when I opened up about my feelings and did not feel understood at all. He's getting all pissed when I do that and he always makes it worst.  


 I'm hurt and it didn't get better. I just want him to understand how I feel. I just want him to be interested in my life. He always says that I can tell him whatever but he never asks me anything. I'm doing an internship at a school right now and taught my first lesson today. It was a big thing for me I was so nervous because of the teacher looking at me in the back. I told him that I will have my lesson today but he didn't wish me any luck or asked how it went. I'm so disappointed. I know I could have told him but I just want him to put effort into the relationship and show me that he cares. I love him but I feel that everything I say doesn't change anything. I don't know what to do anymore without getting hurt even more. When do I know it is time to break up when there are still so many feelings?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I don't know what to do in relationship with bf who does not put any effort into it anymore. I still love him but I am disappointed and hurt and don't know if I can save the relationship.

av3jsx,2,2019-02-26,AITA for pulling my work from a project last minute and screwing the team over?,CoolThrowaway43423,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/av3jsx/aita_for_pulling_my_work_from_a_project_last/,"*I'm using a throwaway because my main reddit has identifying info on me.*

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 2 months I have been working on a team I was assigned to for a college internship. All of us are working with a company and each team was supposed to work together to program a larger application overall (there are about 40 people total broken up into 10 teams.) that we would then present potentially get jobs with said company. (It's treated as a paid internship.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I signed up for this mainly because I was simply using it to fill out credits for my last semester before I go to get my masters. This isn't to say I didn't plan on trying or not taking it serious. I just had no plans to take the job in the end. This is where the problem is, the 3 people who I was assigned with are lazy idiots. 2 of them are ""Rich boys"" (Their words, not mine) who coasted into this program because their dads work in the industry. The other guy I don't know as i've never met him in person or even communicated with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suffice to say, I did all the work. We were given the application specifications at the start and we've (i've) been working nonstop in the 3 month period we had. The other 3 have blown this project off big time. They constantly miss the weekly meetings we schedule and 3/4 times a month i'm alone in the library programming myself. The other 2 have contributed, but the three of them together have programmed 20% of this project while I've done the other 80%.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I got sick of it a long time ago. And made the drive I put my code in private 2 weeks ago and none of them noticed. Well, once a month a we're required to have a company rep sit in on our sessions and this last Friday she came to see me alone. She was honestly really cool and nice and I talked to her almost the whole time. In the end, after i explained the situation, she recommended I pull out of the project. The contract we signed gives us a ""get out"" clause that says we can leave at any time, The only condition is we hand over the code we did on our own, we get paid for it, and the team had to recreate any code the person who left did on there own. Seeing as none of them helped me on 80% of the project this would mean their fucked. 

&amp;#x200B;

I filled the pull out papers there and then and left. Last night the rest of the team found out and their pissed. The 2 boys are texting me every 30 minutes begging me to come back or swearing at me for ""fucking them over"" the one who i've never seen sent me an email saying he's sorry that he's been busy and if I come back he'll ""give this project his full attention.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm over all 3 of them but I feel kinda bad. Maybe I should have given them some notice or just stuck through it like I intended and promised I would. So am I the ass here?"
av3kot,4,2019-02-26,AITA for asking my Mom for the college money that she saved for me?,cryptospartan,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/av3kot/aita_for_asking_my_mom_for_the_college_money_that/,"As I was growing up, my parents saved money for me to go to college. As I was looking at colleges with my Mom, she told me that if I happened to have any money left over in my college account, it would be mine. I would be able to use it to help buy a house or a car or something once I've graduated college. My mom told me this about 1-2 years ago. I distinctly remember the conversation like it was last week, as I wasn't expecting her to give me the money that was leftover. I thought it was just for college expenses.

Fast forward to now. I've moved out of home, and into an apartment. I'm still receiving some financial help from my mom for my car, and we're pulling from my college fund to pay half of rent during the months that I'm taking classes full-time. My college is also significantly cheaper than we had originally planned, for other reasons outside the scope of this post.

My Mom and girlfriend recently went out to dinner, and my Mom mentioned how it would be nice to use my leftover college money for my sister. My sister is planning on attending a private college, and she's going for her doctorate. Her schooling is going to be significantly more expensive compared to mine, although this is completely my sister's choice. 

Upon hearing this, I was frustrated because my mom had promised that money to me, and I've held that idea in the back of my head for some time. When I was talking to my mom about it, she completely went off the rails and got super mad. First, she claims that she doesn't remember having the conversation when she promised the money to me. She also said that since she's the one that saved the money she can do what she wants with it, and she's trying to do everything she can to help my sister graduate without student loans (even though my leftover money won't be enough,) just like she did for me. She also says that she doesn't want to waste the money by using it on non-college expenses, as it will be taxed at an absurd rate.

I have been incredibly grateful that my parents saved this money for me, and they even covered my community college costs out of pocket so that there would be more money left for university. At the last minute I had to switch schools, and the school that I'm going to is significantly cheaper, plus I received a small scholarship.

AITA for asking for the leftover money still?

Edit: Our agreement was that she'd help me with my car/rent right now, but it was 100% my responsibility when I graduated. I was more than happy to go on like this because I am set up to get a good job after I graduate through an internship I secured.

&amp;#x200B;

I just filed taxes for the first time as a 20 year old, full time college student. My 1090-T box 5 is around $68K in scholarships and grants whereas I only paid about $1900 total for tuition. I ended up owing NYS about $1300, with a net income of $25K due to internship money and working part time during school. I got $900 back total in Federal so that's a net debit of $400. Is this reasonable? I had net credit of $1200ish prior to the 1090-T being added. My parents think I should be owing NYS that $1300 despite me listing myself as a dependent but i'm not sure. Lastly, would a capital losses from investments of around $2K positively impact my return? I forgot to report that.

I know this is a problem everyone goes through at one point - People just tell me, ""Oh, you will do fine, just keep at it,"" or, ""You shouldn't complain, others encounter the same sh\*t as you did."" Look I understand, but I can't help but feeling shit and useless about myself.

Part of me wants to blame on the fact that I am on OPT, and companies don't want to sponsor a junior dev position etc., but at the same time many of my friends already landed their jobs and they, too, are on OPT. And then I wonder why I am the one who get shafted. I do the same things as my friends did - go to a good uni, 3 internships, one of which was with a top company in the industry, getting my resume and cover letter reviewed by my uni career office, recruiters, etc., doing projects everyday to beef up my portfolio. But literally zero callbacks from the two to three hundred applications I have sent out since 2 months ago. At this point I would beg just to have a coding screen or a phone screen.

There was a recruiter that contacted me a few weeks ago, the recruiter was working with a big company, and told me he came across my resume on a job board, and thought I would be a great fit for a junior position. We went back and forth for a couple weeks, and then just ghosted me, after saying how good my projects and work experiences look, and looking to schedule with me an interview. Honestly, I was crushed. Beyond crushed. Obviously to the recruiter he was just doing his job of finding the best candidate, I don't blame him. But I was so happy when finally I saw this one opportunity where I could display my full potential, telling someone I would be worth their money to hire me. But being ghosted after having my hopes that high up was the thing that broke me. I ended up crying the whole day.

One more month of not being employed then I basically have to leave the country and leave everything behind - my gf, my friends and all the hopes and dreams I had of being a software engineer in the US, because this is literally the best place to work for the industry. Day by day, I am still keeping my head in there, just applying for jobs, looking to improve my resume despite the hundreds of changes I have already made, grinding for projects, asking friends if they need help with websites so I can use it for portfolio, etc., but day by day, I am just losing hope, and reality of having a timer to get kicked out of the country dawns on me even more."
av4oiu,3,2019-02-26,Should I learn Base R or Tidyverse first for my internship underneath statisticians who use SPSS,rockthecasbah94,Rlanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/comments/av4oiu/should_i_learn_base_r_or_tidyverse_first_for_my/,"So I'm starting a position soon as an assessment intern at an international non-government organization. My work will focus on cleaning statistical data to analyse survey data. I want to learn to work as much as possible in R, because console based skills are more marketable and faster in the long run. However, my colleagues will be working almost entirely in SPSS and SQL.

It seems like there are two tracks in R learning. One involves learning base R syntax first with $ and for loops (which I already have some experience with from Python). The other involves learning the Tidy verse straight away and thinking in the tidyverse is logic.

My question is, which track is going to be easier to interface with SPSS and SQL. Feel free to tell me I'm thinking about this all wrong.

Edit: Let me give an example. Say that my bod hands me an excel file in which the enumerators have written several non-standardized answers, like using an Arabic word instead of English. I‚Äôd like to write a program that automatically corrects the most common errors that enumerators write. Then I need to return the exact same file format back to my boss. Is this really a task that the tidyverse is well suited for?

Edit2: Thank you all so much for your responses. The explanation of SQL - Tidyverse similarity was very useful, as have those of you who pointed out that  there's no need to choose between the two. Also, as I've read Hadley's paper and I had missinterpreted what tidy data is. I thought at first it was just long data, with one row for each value. But it's really one row per observation. This makes a lot more sense now. Thanks again!"

av4so5,52,2019-02-26,"WIBTA if i took another job with a way higher pay, 3-4 months after getting hired at my current workplace?",untakenUserAndMore,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/av4so5/wibta_if_i_took_another_job_with_a_way_higher_pay/,"Greetings everyone. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Forgive me if it turns out a bit long.

So, a bit of background.3 years ago I decided Im gonna change my career and become a programmer. after attending a coding bootcamp my friend told me i can join her startup (startup was based in USA and she is a senior developer there) as one of the 3 interns. The startup was struggling so the employment was not guaranteed. I was just happy to be learning and doing something I actually enjoy.

The CTO was personally teaching us and we learned a lot. Unfortunately my savings ran out and i informed my friend and the CTO that i had to find a job . They understood and we parted on good terms.

I did some freelance jobs which wasnt stable, but was better than nothing. 2 months after i left the startup got funding and hired one of the 2 other interns. since the company was based in US, their base salary for a junior exceeded the local salary 5 times.

After a year of freelancing and instability, one of my other friends who was in the coding bootcamp with me told me that their company has a vacancy. i applied and after a grueling interview got the job. The founders were trying to hire people that would stay with them for a long time. they werent sure about me, that i ""wouldnt quit after a couple of months"". My friend reassured them that i needed something stable. Which is true, i dont like frequent change and needed stability.

I thought i would stay in that company for more or less a long time. The atmosphere and environment is great and bosses are decent. The only downside was the pay, but since it was stable and enough to pay the bills and leave a bit of spending money, i cant complain.

Fast forward 3-4 months. 2 weeks ago my friend from the startup tells me that the other intern they hired (who was getting 5x my salary) quit. I was surprised but paid no mind. Today that same friend asked me if, hypothetically, i would be interested in working with them, implying i'd get the same salary as the previous guy.

So now im conflicted. i dont want to get ahead of myself but i have a feeling that the work offer is likely to happen. I had a friendly chat with the CTO 2 days after their guy quit and among other things he asked me questions about my employment.

&amp;#x200B;

To be perfectly honest the thing that is making me consider is that the salary is so high. I wouldnt be considering leaving if the prospective salary was 2x my current salary. but 5x makes a considerable sum. Part of me wishes the offer never comes so i wouldnt have to make this choice. But another part of me wants to earn more than i am currently earning.

WIBTA if i quit my current employment 4 months after being hired and knowing that the people who hired me were wary of this thing happening, in the first place? I dont want to be selfish and be someone who ""chases money"", but i also dont want to look back and regret missing this hypothetical opportunity."

Portia is putting up one hell of a fight, pulling out all the stunts and tricks; while Willow is serving you a clean lipsync and really focusing on the tragic message of the song.

When the song ends, the judges begin to whisper at their table for an extended period of time. The judges look several times at Willow and Portia during their deliberation, causing the pair to get extremely anxious. The judges seem to talk on forever and when their conversation ends, all have a discontented expression on their faces. Willow gulps while Portia looks forward intently, ready to hear the news.

‚ÄúLadies, that was one hell of a lipsync. After an extra long deliberation, we have made our decision on who has survived and who will sashay away,‚Äù Anita says with a solemn look.

‚ÄúYour interpretations of the song were evenly matched. You both had aspects that directly complemented each other. Willow was the yin to Portia‚Äôs yang. Or was it the other way around? I didn‚Äôt go to school for fucking Chinese philosophy,‚Äù Tish adds on.

‚ÄúWhile we feel this is the best decision in this situation, it isn‚Äôt one that we wanted to make. In fact, this decision puts a damper on our plans for the finale, causing them to change completely‚Ä¶‚Äù Angie continues.

**‚ÄúCondragulations. You have both moved onto the finale of Reddit‚Äôs Rising Stars. Shantay you both stay.‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!‚Äù Willow hollers as she looks all around her, not believing what just transpired.

‚ÄúThank you for this second chance. I‚Äôm ready to prove myself all over again during this finale,‚Äù Portia says with tears in her eyes, showing her moment of vulnerability.

The judges send Del and Amelia to the front of the stage where they greet Portia and Willow with hesitant arms. It‚Äôs clear that they were not so stoked to still have four girls left in the competition.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúLadies, don‚Äôt let anything get you down, you are rising stars after all. There‚Äôs no glass ceiling here my babies and it‚Äôs only up from here. Condragulations to all four of you on making it to the finale! Each and every one of you deserve to be here, and I believe in all of your talents. Portia, you have showed to be very consistent with not only your quality of work, but also with staying true to your brand. Del, you have shown that you are not only have nerve, but the talent to back it up, and not to mention the willingness to dip your toes in foreign waters in helping out on other projects. Amelia, you are one of the brightest stars to shine this season; and I mean that not only in your drag but in your attitude and heart as well. Willow, your storyline this season is by far the most interesting, but you don‚Äôt let it define you; in the face of storm you not only stand strong but continue to push yourself and it‚Äôs been so refreshing having you back.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The camera pans to each girl, with the text ‚Äú**#TeamDel‚Äù, ‚Äú#TeamAmelia‚Äù, ‚Äú#TeamPortia**‚Äù and ‚Äú**#TeamWillow**‚Äù appearing on the screen as they pose for the camera and try to hype up the audiences.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúLadies, the next time we will see you, it will be in preparation for the finale. For three of you, this will be the end of your Rising Stars journey. But for one of you, you will be named the winner of the season. No matter what happens, you all have certainly made your mark on this season as the Top Four. I know this won‚Äôt be last we will see of you. The next step is the **coronation**. ""

&amp;#x200B;

""Now let the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ter0p_iyIxk) play!""

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¶..

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs the next day, and instead of the werkroom, the girls are led into the stage of a massive empty stadium with ceilings so high you‚Äôd swear that only angels with wings could have built it. They ooh and aah at the sight and talk amongst themselves about what‚Äôs going to happen. They‚Äôre ushered into seats in the orchestra section, the best spots in the house. Suddenly, the lights dim and the song [Friends Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmc4g_-lptY) by Vitamin C booms throughout the stadium and a giant television screen, the size of a small house lowers from the ceiling.

&amp;#x200B;

A video begins to play of the season‚Äôs most memorable moments. Secret photographs of this season's queens from casting week and the very first episode, as the season was originally supposed to be completed in secret, taken on the sly by a gossipy intern are portrayed on the screen. Candid photographs depicting newly formed friendships of the cast interacting with each other are shown; even nearly forgotten members: Diane Oldman and Tooth Gap seem to have had some warm moments with their cast members. Shots of Alex mentoring the girls, really vouching for them and setting them up as a cast with great potential play next. Footage of Tish and Anita‚Äôs arrival plays, showing them as the dynamic duo who only seemed to have gotten closer as the season went on. More footage of iconic moments of the season play: the shocked faces of the girls during the announcement of the re-judgement of Episode 1; professional footage of the music videos from Girl Group‚Äôs week along with shots of Smacahoe rehearsing alone; the moment of reveal when  Priestly Borden and Glamtina were discovered to be Elle Crimson and Sonya Ponya; Diana‚Äôs ‚Äúlipsync‚Äù where she bakes a cake to a Prince song; Claudette and Sir Ving going at it during the Canadian taxes squabble; Smacahoe and Sir Ving Cox‚Äôs quits; the Miss Wig Pageant and shots of everyone‚Äôs talent shows; Willow Blue‚Äôs moment of return when she won the secret comeback challenge; Dimeliacox‚Äôs three headed sweater moment; the worried faces of the cast, especially Cassandra‚Äôs during the disappearance of Catheterina; the iconic lipsyncs of the season where there was actual lipsyncing happening; and the reactions of each of the season‚Äôs wins being given out to the queens who earned them. Finally, a side by side image of the final four‚Äôs promotional photographs are shown; followed by a behind the scenes shot from that same week of queens who would become the final four, kiki-ing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The finalists stare at the photo of the four of them from before the competition began. It‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôve all been tearing up from the video, but this picture really sets them off into the waterworks. They understand each other like no other, as they‚Äôve all been through the same experience, everchanged. They understand their own personal journey and the growth that their sisters have experienced as well. In a moment of nothing but pure love, the finalists hold the hand of the one next to them. Willow and Portia who sit on the edges rest their heads on the shoulders of Amelia and Del. Competition aside, they are at ease with each other and understand that they will be sisters for life.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get too comfortable now,‚Äù hollered out a pair of familiar voices. During their moment of sisterhood, the finalists didn‚Äôt realize the stage, which is able to rotate on an axis, completely changed. The stage is now set up extremely futuristic, with a spinning gold globe in the center and various Sci-Fi and Space Age elements.

&amp;#x200B;

On the stage are two dark silhouettes can be seen with their backs turned. One figure, clearly a male taps his foot to the sound of a bass beginning to boom. The other figure, a heavenly female stands still in a power pose, waiting for her cue. A song of pure nostalgia begins to echo throughout the stadium. It‚Äôs Madonna‚Äôs [4 Minutes feat. Justin Timberlake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAQZPBwz2CI). The male figure turns around as the spotlight hits him, it‚Äôs Tish in boy mode. Tish is wearing a black vinyl jacket with a Mandarin collar that reflect the stage lights radiantly, with the tightest leather pants that money can buy, paired with pointed toe combat boots with golden metal shards adorning them. His hair, he wears his natural dirty blonde spiked upwards with faded sides. Simultaneously, the female figure turns around. It‚Äôs Anita, wearing vintage Mugler: a gold plated bodysuit with meticulous lines that accentuate her bust and hips, gloves with the same gold plated material that nearly reach her shoulders. Her hair is a short and wavy platinum blonde bob, akin to Trinity‚Äôs Boots Runway. Her makeup is classic Anita, beautifully contoured cheekbones, a graphic cat eyeliner with a golden cut crease, and a plum colored lip. She pairs her look with a strappy spiked heels in gold of course, and a statement spiky necklace that ends at her collarbones.

&amp;#x200B;

The two hosts dance their hearts out, way better than Madonna and Justin ever did; lipsyncing the words with passion. Thinking about how the words ring true to them as they took over a once doomed season. Towards the second half of the song, another figure, a quite androgynous one in fact shows up in a golden morphsuit, their face obstructed. The third figure interact alongside the hosts, hitting every beat as well, completely serving it. At the sound of the ticking at the end, the third figure rips open the morphe suit at the head, revealing their face.

&amp;#x200B;

The revealed figure is none other than former child star and current actress, **Lindsay Lohan**!

&amp;#x200B;

The finalists applaud with glee and yell their ‚ÄúWORK LINDSAY‚Äù‚Äôs as you may have expected. Willow and Amelia sob at the sight of one of their childhood idols.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúHey ladies!‚Äù Lindsay exclaims, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here today to not only garner publicity for my new show ‚ÄúLindsay Lohan‚Äôs Beach Club‚Äù but to wish you ladies luck during the finale of Reddit‚Äôs Rising Stars! I‚Äôm honestly so excited for all of you and I just wish I could somehow Freaky Friday my way to experience this myself. Remember ladies, the limit does NOT exist!‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúThank you Miss Lohan. We love you so much!‚Äù says Anita.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúIS SHE JUDGING????!!‚Äù the finalists exclaim, chewing on their nails waiting for the answer.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúNo, but Lindsay is here for a specific reason,‚Äù Tish interjects. ‚ÄúLindsay will you please give the girls a hint to their final challenge?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶. Remember that really good movie I was in? Oh wait there‚Äôs a lot. Well, it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs iconic. Oh wait, too many‚Ä¶. Okay one more hint, it‚Äôs the one where the remake was better than the original‚Ä¶ Any guesses?‚Äù Lindsay stares at the finalists, waiting for an answer.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFREAKY FRIDAY?!‚Äù they exclaim.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFuck no! The Parent Trap! Now what would the Parent Trap have to do with your challenge?‚Äù Lindsay teases.

&amp;#x200B;

The girls ponder for a moment, but don‚Äôt give any answers. Portia makes a face of uncertainty as she clearly hasn‚Äôt seen the film before.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFor your final challenge, you will be playing both roles in a **music video duet** of your choice. Much like how Lindsay was able to play identical twins in the film ‚ÄúThe Parent Trap‚Äù, you will be **shooting both parts separately** and they will be superimposed into a seamless music video **starring your drag self and your real life personas.** The songs you may choose must be a duet; but you will have free range to choose any song you like that fits the mold. But that‚Äôs not all, you will be **re-imagining the lyrics, turning them into a work all your own.** This is the finale, so don‚Äôt worry about a budget. Go as minimalist or as maximilist as you want with your sets. You can be sexy, campy, romantic, uplifting or just downright outrageous. We just want the music videos to scream you. As to set somewhat of limit, we ask you to limit your music video to **a maximum of 4 sets**. Your music videos will premiere not on the mainstage, but on the stage of this stadium, which as you may have guessed will be the setting of our finale.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúThe dress code for the finale will be your **Best Drag**. Ladies, for a night as important as this, you need to look your best. As there are four of you, I want you all to stand out in a look all your own. Each of your best drag looks must **adhere to an element** that will be assigned to you. Also, each element comes with it‚Äôs own **runway package**, which you will utilize to showcase your look. As demonstrated previously, **the stage is able to rotate to reveal different ‚Äúsides**‚Äù, which all follow an elemental theme. It is up to you to **design your side** to your liking, following your theme. This means that you are not limited to what is in your package, you may add on to it. Also, there will be a giant LCD screen that will be the backdrop of the stage that you may manipulate to display whatever you choose. Remember, as stated previously we have a big budget for this finale, so don‚Äôt worry about picking anything expensive to decorate your set with.‚Äù

* If you are assigned the element of **Earth**, the runway lighting will be a soft yellow with falling flower petals of your choice.
* If you are assigned the element of **Air**, you will be making your entrance in the sky via invisible wires and your package also features fog machines. The runway lighting will be a stark bright white.
* If you are assigned the element of **Fire,** your runway package will include smoke machines and pyrotechnics. Your runway lighting will be a deep reddish gold, almost like a sunset.
* If you are assigned the element of **Water**, your runway package will include falling rain and cool blue lighting.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFurthermore, after you make your grand entrance, you will take part in an **individual interview**. The order you will all appear in the finale depends on the element you will be assigned. Earth goes first, then air, then fire and finally water. The questions for the interview can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdTCmNmU9TdCSXVvpZn3GXM9zYSSphioGzNsjDP7-Cc/edit).‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúNow for the very last time‚Ä¶. Gentleman, start your engines and may the best woman rising star WIN!‚Äù

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Your music videos, runways and interviews will be due in two weeks from now, giving you ample time to complete them. The official due date is **March 12th, 2019 at 11:5PM EST.**

I‚Äôm new to After Effects and I haven‚Äôt done much with cameras and perspective. What I want to do is have 3D photos (the 1st frames of various video clips) standing up in a carousel formation. I would like to be able to both move the carousel (bring one photo forward at a time and spin the others to the back) and zoom in and out of the photos without pixelating them. So to do this I‚Äôm assuming I would have to have a camera where the range of zoom is full view of the carousel to 100% scale on each of the photos.

I have no idea where to start. My guess is that this involves a lot of steps so if you know of any good tutorials, feel free to link them so you don‚Äôt have to type everything out. Also if you don‚Äôt know of a specific tutorial, I‚Äôd love something that‚Äôs pretty comprehensive about moving objects in 3D space and/or how to have a camera zoomed out from an object so something at 100% scale would appear smaller on the screen.

Any help is massively appreciated! I‚Äôm working on a project for my internship and my boss has a really clear vision of what he wants. Help me come through! Thank you!"
av4vr4,53,2019-02-26,Shane and the TV industry,jabberwockytamer,ShaneDawson,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShaneDawson/comments/av4vr4/shane_and_the_tv_industry/,"Hi hi, strap in for a wall of text

So I've mentioned before in a few comments in this sub that I work in the reality TV industry. Specifically, I do development research, which is all of the research that goes into a show that needs to happen before a pitch can be presented. I also do some work in casting as well, and I get to make pitches to my production companies CEOs (but not to networks, that's the job of our executive. And full disclosure, if I was working for a larger company, I probably would not be given the opportunity to be pitching myself)


¬†I keep seeing stuff in the comment section of Shane's channel, and on here about his Twitter stans (I dont personally have a Twitter lol) about people thinking he should have a show. I know this sub as whole disagrees, and I thought I would share my opinion with yall as someone who has some professional experience :)

So, a big point of contention: shane is horrible at deadlines. This is a fact. Networks and production companies would not put up with this. 

While that is absolutely true, I doubt anyone would be hiring shane as a producer. Shane and probably Andrew if he were to be brought on board would both be pieces of talent (think Catfish), no more, no less. Now that's not to say that shows aren't catered around talent. I think a big misconception about my field is that all reality TV is 1000% fake and we script everything all the time and everyone is secretly actors. Not only would that be more work for us, but with how saturated the market is with non scripted television at the moment, no network in their right mind would ever buy that show. Sorry team, reality TV is pretty real right now, it's definitely pretty produced and highly edited, but we have to pitch things that are real¬† for the most part. So who ever wanted to make a show about what shane was doing would definitely involve him a lot in what the show was about creatively, but he wouldnt technically be the one in charge of it.

However, given the content he makes, I dont know if networks would be interested in Shane as a person. Its shitty, but demographics really focus on stereotypes and shane doesnt fit the demos for the networks looking to buy his content. The networks who would buy conspiracies and ghost hunting aren't interested in queer men. Again, it's incredibly shitty, I'm a queer Jewish women and my bosses are POC, but even at our (very) small production company we have to be hyper aware of who we are pitching to what networks, because they dont buy things that feature talent outside of their demographics. Oh, mostly 50 something men watch this channel? You're not gonna sell a black women as a lead for your show, no matter how interesting she is. If someone from the network knows her, falls in love and convinces someone super high up, theres a slim chance, but that leads me to next point.

Shane alienated some people in the film industry already. I know we heard about the Zachary quinto thing, but then he went and talked about it all over social media which I'm sure did him no favors. Which is unfortunate for him because quinto is pretty widely liked, and I bet that puts a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths. The fact that the main critique made of him is that he doesnt take criticism well might be compounding that issue.

Another potential hurdle is YouTube talent management is notoriously difficult to work with. Back when fullscreen was a real thing, I heard that we would just not approach people with them because their agents would never get back to us anyway. Shane is represented by AAE speakers, which while it is better than fullscreen, is still something of a clusterfuck to get a hold of, much less actually get an interview in with one of the people they represent.


So let's compare Shane to a youtuber who is successfully transferring to the living room screen: Coyote Peterson. What sets the 2 of them apart? 

Back to stereotyping: there is a network that works for both coyote's look and content. Hes a¬† semi grizzled looking family man who loves animals and education. Hes american steve irwin.

I know people talk about shane not going to college. I dont think his lack of education has a lot to do with this particular topic, but I think Coyote's education does. He didnt get a degree in zoology like a lot of people think. Do you know what his degree is in? Film. Think about how we talked about connections earlier. Even if he knew a lowly peon like me at a production company, fresh out of film school, that's one more connection he has that's willing to pitch him to production companies and networks.

His talent management was also more welcoming to the industry. CAA is what he currently has, and I cant speak to what he had before he struck his deal (I dont work for the network that hired him) but I cant imagine him switching that fast so I'm working on the assumption that hes been with them for at least a short while. Enough of a while for them to be managing him while he negotiated his contract. Like I said, a lot of internet based agencies aren't great, but CAA is decent ish, from what I hear.

I cant think of a great way to end this post, this is the extent of my knowledge. But this is my reasoning to why I dont think that shane is prepared to have a show, nor do I think any production company or network will be offering him one in the near future. I'm not psychic tho, so  maybe some intern somewhere is fighting super hard for him.

(Ps, I will not be naming the company I work for. This is my personal account and I only speak for myself, not for my bosses or my company or anyone else. I doubt I need to say this but I thought I would cover myself just in case lol)

This past summer I had an internship and had a decent income. I got my W-2, and quickly filed my state and federal tax returns. I waited a couple weeks for my refund, got it, and moved on. 

Earlier today, I got a call from my very pissed off parents saying that they can‚Äôt claim me now, and instead of receiving money they actually have to pay money. They said they would have to pay almost 5x the amount that I got.

I didn‚Äôt file to spite my parents, I just thought it was something everyone does. This was my first time filing my taxes, and I would gladly pay the refund back if my parents got more. I filed as single, and checked the box that someone can claim me as a dependent. I didn‚Äôt file my 1098-t which is the tax form for college payments. Are my parents misinformed? Or did I screw up, and if so, is it reversible?

Update: I think my parents were misinformed. They saw my bank statement that I received money from the IRS and that‚Äôs how they knew I filed my taxes. They haven‚Äôt submitted them yet, and they‚Äôre talking to a tax preparer next week. The dependent box is for sure checked, so I think it will be okay. Thanks for the help. My parents just jumped the gun and in turn made me freak out"
av6h5u,5,2019-02-26,What to do when you don't trust a friend with your boyfriend?,wolfiepak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/av6h5u/what_to_do_when_you_dont_trust_a_friend_with_your/,"Hey. So I've \[21F\] been dating this guy \[24M\] for two months now and things are going really well. I've never felt a connection to anyone like I feel with him, and I know he feels the same way - we are both kinda dumbfounded by how quickly and how deeply we fell for each other. However, there's a problem that I can't really shake, and it's beginning to have a negative impact on me. We originally met through a mutual friend, and now I feel like I can't trust this friend around my boyfriend. 

She and I were really close, but she moved overseas for 6 months for an internship. I wasn't upset over this actually, as I was already getting uncomfortable with how she'd constantly try to 'one-up' me in our friendship, plus I didn't agree with a lot of things that she did. I thought that her move would give us a good opportunity to grow apart without any messy drama. 

However, she's still good friends with my boyfriend. They used to be roommates - which wouldn't bother me, if it weren't for how she acts. She's a MASSIVE flirt. She is currently in a relationship but she has cheated on her boyfriend, plus aggressively flirted with a bunch of other guys. In particular, she likes to go after the guys that she can't 'get' or are unavailable. 

She was weird when we started dating, and before she moved she used to do things that really hurt my feelings. When we'd all hang out she'd talk to him about how heartbroken he was over his exes (she knew we hadn't even had the exes conversation yet) plus would always talk to him about how much he means to her and how they always stayed up all night to watch the sun rise. It felt like she was deliberately trying to exclude me and even my boyfriend seemed uncomfortable. Whenever at parties my boyfriend and I would spend time alone, the next time we saw her she'd cry and say that we abandoned her, even though we would leave her surrounded by a group of her closest friends. She never acted like this before we started dating.

I've talked to my best friend about this, and she said that this girl is the kind of person that wants all the guys to herself. I don't know about this -- all I know is that whenever they Facetime I feel uneasy, because I don't trust that she won't try to test the waters or meddle with my relationship. And don't get me wrong, I trust my boyfriend so much - he's not the type that would hurt me by cheating - but it doesn't stop me from feeling uneasy. He's very trusting, and she's very manipulative.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I met through a mutual friend. I'm no longer that close with her - she has cheated on her boyfriend, is competitive and manipulative, and is a flirt that targets men that are taken. But she is still good friends with my boyfriend, which makes me uneasy as I don't want her to meddle with my relationship. Please help - it's getting to the point where it's really having an effect on me."
av7293,3,2019-02-26,Parents and Self worth,Jvacdoesthings,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/av7293/parents_and_self_worth/,"# Here is a rant

TL;DR: I have a terrible relationship with my parents and it's affecting my self worth resulting in me being less productive.

## Relationship with parents
So I don't have the best relationship with my parents. It's not like they've ever done anything bad to me like invaded my privacy or physically assaulted me, I just don't know my parents well and they don't know me well.  Growing up I never really had conversations with my parents, and I continue to not talk to them for anything non-school related.  This drives me insane. I have pretty mediocre grades right now, as I am in my senior year of high school and just ran out of shits to give. My parents still want me to do well in high school. I couldn't give less of a shit at this point. I've expressed to them my distrain and disinterest of going to college, but I'm still going to end up attending at least one year of it before I become a legal adult. It just drives me crazy how different our values are. I am an entrepreneur, I want to change the world through software. I started learning how to program when I was 10. This has lead me to opportunities such as summer internships, nothing I would've gotten from school. Instead of college I want to go into the work force since I am already qualified to work in software development, without a degree. My parents don't see this. They want me to go to college because it is what everyone else does and since it's safe. I don't care about safety. They want me to go to school, get a job, work my entire career there, retire and be ""happy."" If I were to go down this path, as they did, I would probably kill myself. I want to create and change the world. I cannot see myself working at some office, doing what ever someone tells me to do.
  
## Self worth
My world view from a young age has been to tell myself that I am not important and that I am replaceable.  I understand that this is not a positive outlook on my life, however this has only compounded in the last year now that my parents are valuing me much lower. To my mom, I am just a report card, she has stated this herself.  She said that she only cares about my grades and how respectful I am.  Since I care about how my parents view me, this has really put a toll on my self worth. I'm not even good enough to be loved by my parents, I tell myself. I tell myself that they are only doing these things because they love me and want to be successful. I just don't feel any love from the people who should love me unconditionally. All I ever talk to about my parents is school, how bad my grades are, why am I not doing all the work, why aren't you doing this for school, that for school. It's drove me to madness. I can't continue my relation with them because all it does is hurt me. Having all this negative reinforcement has only hurt my motivation to do well in school and to do well in the things I want to do. There are many things that should give me self worth, I am an accomplished software developer, musician, track athlete, but none of this matters since my self worth has been warped into what the people I care most about see me as, and how productive I am. It's a terrible cycle, my parents get mad at me since I'm not doing something, I can't work as well since I'm busy telling myself I'm worthless, they yell at me more, so on and so forth.

av74gs,0,2019-02-26,I(17F) got caught texting another guy by my boyfriend(18M),Cheatergirlhere,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av74gs/i17f_got_caught_texting_another_guy_by_my/,"From our age, most people assume we don't know love and maybe we're too young for all that. But, I believe for my age I don't focus on little things but the bigger picture. I'm a very critical thinker and I mean that in most humblest way; as well as my boyfriend who is tremendously smarter than I am. He's in college right now, and working an internship for the major he wants to purse in the future, I'm currently still in High school, slow piecing the right parts together for my future. I don‚Äôt see my relationship with him as a typical high school relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know for a fact I want this boy in my life and he taught me everything I wanna know. We've built each other and became motivation for each other. But, lately ever since we took a break after my sister disapprove the relationship...everything has changed

(My sister caught me texting him and I sat down with her and had a honest opened conversation about this boy and the amount of love I have for him. She explained to me that my main focus should be school right now and I should focus on fixing the relationship I have within my family before bringing another one into the mix. She told me if the love i speak about is real then this boy will wait. He'll do his thing in the meantime, but eventually you two will find a way back to each other)

&amp;#x200B;

Our relationship shift, other people got involved in it. We consistently fought about stupid shit. Our communication was shortened and had no meaning but I pushed through.

I noticed a trend within his behavior when we argued via text ( we rarely got to see each other after my mother found out) when he felt the slightest threat to his ego or pride he'd go out his way to remind that person that tested him who the fuck he was and how he's not average and will always be good regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

He let his pride get in the way a lot and i never felt him fight for our relationship and try to fix and argument, it was always me doubling texting and blowing his phone up to fix an issue, he most of the time, created.

&amp;#x200B;

These argument continued for two week , i got a feeling that words can't express, that this relationship was gonna end soon. Nothing was there anymore but fights and if we weren't fighting we were just fixing the problem other ways in private (which i enjoyed but when it was over.... the issue resurfaced)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, recently this boy who i have mutual friends with has been texting me. **I HAVE ABSOLUTE NO INTEREST IN HIM!** relationship wise or even meeting up with him wise.

&amp;#x200B;

I just thought he was cute and so did he. Our conversation were innocent but I'll admit a few days in we did flirt via text. He asked why I never messaged him before (He's been on my snap for a while) and he said ""you're really cute I should've texted you earlier than this since we've known of each other"" and I complimented him back and asked if he wanted to come to a basketball at my school.

&amp;#x200B;

I've admitted to all my mistakes but **i never ever had the intentions of meeting with this boy, to do anything with him.** I'm uncomfortable of opening up to my one year boyfriend let alone a kid I met last week.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, something i forgot earlier that week he asked for a picture of me because he forgot how i looked and I sent him a normal picture of me. WELL.... he somehow has that video saved to his camera roll and that creeps me tf out.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my boyfriend was his friends, I guess that boy was there and he showed him plus his friends a picture of me and asked if they knew me.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend clearly knows me ....

I once felt this humiliating when he physically was at his ex‚Äôs birthday party and took a video of his hand around her. I‚Äôm not the insecure or jealous stop (he‚Äôs built so much confidence in me) all my friends kept sending me the video of them and asking how i was okay with it. 

But I‚Äôll, no matter, give him the benefit of the doubt. It was a hug party I didn‚Äôt mind him being there but the video made me feel like he didn‚Äôt care if I saw it or not. 

If I were to do something like that it would‚Äôve lead to an argument.... 

&amp;#x200B;

When this incident happened my boyfriend and I weren't talking, we were childish ignoring each other and we BOTH knew what we were doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't blame shift, I take full responsibly of texting another boy while i had a boyfriend and being self because my feelings were hurt. I , also, let me ego get in the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

He texted me and ask for a good day to see me, so we can sit down and talk about this.

I'm in a box right now and I don't what to do. I'm truly sorry, I feel dumb and shamed but words wont fix something like this. I full-heartily love this boy and thought getting attention from someone else would fulfill my loneliness, boredom feelings but it didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm losing my boyfriend, of one year, to a boy i met last week and have no feelings for.

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't talked about the situation, he wants to talk in person. There's not much I can say or do. I never lied to my boyfriend and I won't start now, but saying something like this to him.. to his face will break his heart just as much as mines.

&amp;#x200B;

 tl;dr I got caught texting a boy out of boredom and loneliness,my boyfriend found out and wants to talk about it.

av7ao0,1,2019-02-26,Can You Afford a Virtual Assistant?,hitrate_solutions,u_hitrate_solutions,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hitrate_solutions/comments/av7ao0/can_you_afford_a_virtual_assistant/," 

https://i.redd.it/jhyskhiui0j21.jpg

We have spoken to our fair share of business owners that have told us they needed help, but they were pretty sure they weren‚Äôt able to afford their own virtual assistant. Do you feel as if you cannot afford a virtual assistant? If so, you‚Äôre probably wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, everyone has a different idea of what ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù means. We have experienced customers that would say ‚Äúyes, let‚Äôs do this,‚Äù then another responds with ‚Äúthis is outside of my budget.‚Äù We never judge a potential client in regards to their money situation, and we can tell you that money isn‚Äôt an indicator of your happiness or success. So don‚Äôt go thinking that whatever is in your bank account is what is going to determine how successful you will or will not be. The bottom line is that hiring help is a good investment and that is how you need to think of it. It is a new expense to account for and a new line item in your budget.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you have to forego that expensive dinner, or a new pair of Manolos. Sometimes you may have to take out a loan. Mind you, ‚Äúhave to‚Äù is a strong phrase to use. Of course, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave to‚Äù do anything. It‚Äôs your business and your life. You can spend your time, money and resources in whatever manner you please.

But isn‚Äôt that the goal in life? To spend money, resources, and time on doing what you‚Äôre passionate about? That is why ‚Äúhelp‚Äù is something people pay for. Dishwashers, nannies, meal delivery services, cleaning crews, and yes, virtual assistants. They are all there to help make your life better.

If you are struggling to pay rent or feed your family, then you may want to put your money there before thinking of further investments ‚Äì you know, because we have to be reasonable here. But, if you‚Äôre ready to spend some money and hire help, then the sky is the limit. You may have to search long and hard, but it is possible to find someone that will match your budget.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calculating the Cost of Your Virtual Assistant**

We have had many come in that have Googled something along the lines of ‚Äúassistant salary‚Äù and found a database that showed them the average salary for an executive assistant living and working in their city. We had a potential worker that took that annual salary and divided it by the number 52, then by 40 in order to get an average hourly rate. They thought they had the perfect calculation, but not in our eyes. ¬†They forgot to add in the cost of benefits they would need in order to keep themselves healthy. Things like the Internet, health insurance, supplies, and invoicing software. All of those costs can really add up. This is why sometimes you may have paid an office intern $10 an hour, but a virtual assistant may be $20 an hour. The virtual assistant will need to cover the normal expenses in life, along with their business-related expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you understand? You aren‚Äôt just paying for the actual hours worked, but you‚Äôre also paying them to have the best technology for the job, to be in good standing with the government, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, the sweet spot for a virtual assistant is usually between $15 to $30.00 per hour. There are companies out there that have a staff of virtual assistants standing by to help you and work with your budget. "
av7dep,109,2019-02-26,"Entitled aunt tried to make me catch the cat while naked, and threatened to punch me when I didn't",Ka_Black,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/av7dep/entitled_aunt_tried_to_make_me_catch_the_cat/,"Let's meet our cast before we start: Entitled aunt is EA, Grandma is GD, Mom is M, and Me is of course, me.

Before I start, I'm going to put a little bit of backstory and also a disclaimer: My first language is not english, and as you already read, this story is about my aunt, who grew up as an entitled child, and later became an entitled person.

See, when she was little my grandmother realized something was... odd about my aunt, so she took her with some specialist and they told her that my aunt was a tiny bit slow; not much, tho; if you don't know this you would think that she's just a nice, but sometimes noisy, lady. The doctors told my grandmother that with just a little more of atention in her emotional and school education, my aunt would became a competent adult. Sadly, around this time my grandparents divorced, and my grandfather broke comunication with the family for over 40 years; my aunt loved my grandfather with all her heart, and until this day she still loves him with all the love a little girl can have for her father, so naturally, she took the divorce way worse than my mom (who was the youngest) and her other older sister (who is the oldest of the three). This, along with my aunt's diagnosis, made my grandmother make the worst decision of her life: to let my aunt to get away of almost everything, because ""she cannot understand she's doing something wrong"" and ""this is in compensation of her father's abandonment"". Of course, this went as bad as you can think. In order to cut this story short, I'll just say that the odd and sweet little girl became an entitled brat, and then the entitled brat grow up to became an entitled adult.

Cut to many years later. My grandmother moved to the house next door to our left because she's getting old and needs support, and my aunt (yes, the entitled one) moved with her a few months later. Around that same time, my mom roofed my GD's small backyard with chicken wired and we were able to finally took my GD's cats to the new house (don't worry, we didn't abandon them, my grandma didn't sold her house and we went to the house daily to feed them). One of the cats was a spayed beautiful female cat with black fur and a few yellow spots here and there, and the other was a neuterized handsome male with bright yellow fur. Since they came from another place, we decided to kept them inside so they would not get lost, sick, or in a fight with other cats (hence why mom roofed the backyard). The female loved her new stuation, but the male was always looking for the chance to run away, specially on the mornings, when my GD or EA would pick up the newspaper from the garden after it was delivered; almost everyday he'll try (or suceed) to get out of the house and go wild in the streets, and when that happened, I was the one who had to catch him because my GD was too old to even try, and my EA just said something along the lines of ""he's too fast for me"".

One afternoon, as I was in the shower getting ready for college, I hear a commotion next door; at the beginning I couldn't understand what was going on because of the water, but then I hear my EA screaming loudly ""THE CAT IS IN THE STREET! HE'S IN THE SIDEWALK!"" I panicked. I was covered on soap and shampoo and I tried to wash out myself as fast as I could so I could get dress and catch the cat, when my aunt came into my house (there is a door that communicates both houses) and started calling my name in panic.

EA: Op! Op!

Me: I'm in the bathroom!

EA: Op, quick! The cat is outside the house! You have to catch him!

Me: I'm covered in soap and shampoo! As soon I wash out I'll get dress and I'll catch the cat! Go outside and keep an eye on him!

EA: Ok, I'll be waiting for you!She then ran off the house. Three minutes later, as I was getting dress as quick as I could, I hear my aunt screaming again, but this time with joy.

EA: The cat is back inside the house!

GD: Oh, thank god!

Now, this is the part when I screw things up. I should have finished dressing, go to my GD's house, asked if everything was fine and then back to my house to finish my shower, but I didn't; instead I deciced to just stay and finish my shower.

BIG. MISTAKE.

Around ten minutes later, after I finished to get ready for college, my EA came into my room stomping and screamed to me:

EA: Because of you we almost lost the cat!

Me: E...excuse me?

EA: Because of you we almost lost the cat! Why you didn't came out to catch him!?

Me: You knew I was covered on shampoo and soap! I had to wash off that me before I could get dress!

EA: You should have got out the shower like that!

Me: EA, I. Was. NAKED! Do you really wanted me to run wild in the streets without clothes in order to catch a cat?

This sentence make me laught. Just imagine that scene: you are chilling in your garden one afternoon, and the next thing you know there's a 20 something chubby girl with nothing but shampoo and soap in her body trying to catch her cat outside your house. What a view! But my giggle and the fact that I paraphrase that as something stupid made my EA got furious.

EA; I don't understand why are you laughing! You should have done that!

Me: Wait... are you really serious!?

EA: Of course!

Me: Are you even thinking in what are you saying? You actually wanted me to go naked outside to catch the cat?

EA: If that would be the only way for you to get in time to catch the cat, then yes! You were lucky I tricked him to came back into the house!

Me: And that's my I didn't went to catch him. I hear you screaming that the cat was inside the house again.

EA: I don't care! I shouldn't have tricked him! I should have let him go and forced you to catch him!

The fight when like that for several minutes. I don't even remember what we said to each other during that time, but there was some heavy stuff, enough for my EA to call me ""a little bitch"" at some point. However, she quickly realized that I wasn't going to let her win the fight, so she raised her hand, closed her first and screamed:

EA: YOU ENTITLED BRATTY BITCH!!! I AM AN ADULT AND YOUR AUNT SO THAT MEANS I'M ALWAYS RIGHT!!!! I SHOULD TEACH YOU A LESSON ABOUT GOOD MANNERS AND SHOW YOU WHO IS THE BOSS AROUND HERE!!!!!!!!!

I freezed in panic. In that moment my mind got full of memories of my childhood: tales about my mom and her sister's own childhood and how my EA always finished verbal fights by punching someone, and that was so common that when she said she wanted to be a nurse, the family started an intern joke about she had more talend as a professional boxer, and memories of me and my aunt when I was little and we got along perfectly. Now I was standing in front of her, panicking, with her fist raised, ready to punch me in the face.

And then, out of nowhere, I got brave. I got closed to her and said:

Me: DO IT! PUNCH ME IN THE FACE! I WANT YOU TO DO IT! BUT MY MOTHER WOULD BE HOME SOON! DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA FORGIVE YOU FOR PUNCHING HER ONLY DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO EXPOSE HERSELF!?

Then was my EA's time to freeze. She didn't think about the conscecuences of her acts until then. She knew that if she punched me, she was screw. See. when my EA became an adult she kept thinking she had the right to do as she pleased without consecuences. She got a job as a nurse, but she failed to show up so much that they fired her, so, she got no retiretment. She said she will related to her husband, but he dumped her because she got the house full of animals and refused to clean the place. The only reason she wasn't homeless was because my mom gave her money every month, and allow her to move with my GD's (my mom took a second morgage and bought my GD's new house). If she punched me, that was it, no house, no money, no nothing, and probably she would be excommunicated of the entired family.

She dropped her arm, defeated, looked at me with her eyes full of rage and screamed:

EA: YOU BITCH!

And then she left the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Wait. You think that's the end? Oh no, no, no! Far from that!

&amp;#x200B;

When my EA left I sit on my bed for a while and tried to calm me down, then I hear muffled screams; my aunt and my grandmother were having a discussion. I cound't hear what were saying, but I'm guessing nothing that my aunt would like, because I hear a door slamming, and strong stomping in the streets. It was clearly my EA leaving the house. Then, less that five minutes later, mi GD came into my room. She had an expression of sadness, disappointment and despair.

GD: Op, it is true that you almost punch your aunt?

*Yes, you read that right.*

Me: WHAT!? NO! SHE WAS THE ONE THAT ALMOST PUNCHED ME!

My grandmother expression got softer; it was still full of sadness and disappointment, but now her faced showed that she was kinda expecting to hear that.

GD: As I suspected. I didn't believe her when she told me that you tried to punch her, so she got angry and leaved the house. Why she got angry at you anyways?

I explained the situation to my GD, and she only noded. Then she said she was sorry and went back to her house. I felt so bad for her. Yes, she may have create the entitled monster that my aunt was (and still is), but she was her daughter. Also, she never thought that my aunt would be as far to try to punch me and later go to her to accused me to try to punch her.

15 minutes later my mom got form work and I told her what happened. She got really angry, but since my EA wasn't in the house, she decided to just wait until she came back. The wait too three days. As far as I know, EA crashed in some old friend's house. When she finally was back, my mom was there waiting for her.

Mom: (Visibly angry) I want you to explaing your side of the story sister, but please, don't try that ""op tried to punch me"" because we both know that is bullshit.

EA got super red, and REALLY tried to make that me going out naked wasn't that big of a deal. My mom told her that first, IT WAS A BIG DEAL, and second, she was my aunt, no my mom, so she didn't have the right to ""show me good manners"". Also, she said that if she even tried to pull one like that a second time, she would kicked her out of the house. My aunt just noded in agreedment.

The good thing about all that crazyness is that now she behaves less entitled and treats me better. She still lives in my gradma's house tho, but now she's alone; my grandma died seven months after that fight.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Entitled aunt screamed at me for not go outside naked to catch our cat, got mad that I thought that was dumb, then almost punched me because she wanted to ""teach me manners"" but doesn't do it because depends financially on my mom. Then she accuses me to try to punch her with grandma, but she don't believed her."

I'm 17 and I need help.

I've gone to school for 2+ years and learned, or have been interested in, in nothing but Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premier Pro and alike programs. I've acquired 2 media company internships and learned the entire craft of Photography (Not saying there's not an infinite amount of things to learn still, just saying I've got SOME good pictures under my name that I'm personally proud of.)   


I have a dilemma though. Lack of one key item of equipment. A personal computer. The last internship I had held was terminated due to the lack of this item to work on my assignments from home, and I'm very much determined to bust my ass to keep this current position. One thing that's holding me back, is a speech impediment. I have a Moderate to Severe Stutter that has made me unable to get part-time jobs, contract jobs, or any job in general to fund this work station. I have been going to therapy for almost 2 years due to my family history of physical and mental abuse, this abuse has made roots in my ability to perform in my classes, and school.   


The only happiness I find left in my life is down to my girlfriend, and video editing. Video editing has been my one of few places where I can escape, have fun, learn new things, it's the reason I ask for help, and get work done that makes me proud of my abilities. I've accomplished so much with just the simple computers of my school. (Which, in fact, I only ever use approximately once a day for a single hour)  I know that once I have this computer, I can do anything I want. I could start applying for more jobs with the confidence of knowing I wont take a whole week to edit a simple video, I can finally have a place at home to let out my frustration onto something \*actually\* fun, and work-accomplishing.   


I'm hoping for this chance at something bigger to finally move out, and maybe even start my own life as a Work-From-Home Content creator. I'm asking for your help, I cant open a PayPal account just yet, I turn 18 in April. But I can link a GoFundMe. This could change my life entirely, from where I live, to if I'm going to go hungry on days, to if I could some day even retire. I have the talent, but the opportunity just isn't reaching out for me. So I've decided to reach out for it. Hopefully it listens. Thank you for making it this far, may your respective beliefs bless you. Have a wonderful night.   


I'm willing to provide proof of me receiving money and purchasing the computer. All for your peace of mind! Anything at all. I might even add a complementary Wedding/Event Videographer Service for the people that help me. This'll very much help me start my Professional Portfolio and Video Editing career, thank you to all!

Upon speaking with the pitching coach, he said that he would love any and all analytics he could get and would be all ears to any suggestions if I could help him out. As of right now, I know that they use the program PitchCast in addition to another stat-keeping app. With PitchCast, the coach said that they keep track of pitch type, location, whether or not it was hit to help them develop hot and cold zones for their pitchers, etc. As someone who has never done anything with analytics, where would be a good place to start? What are some things that I should learn to do to be able to help the team with analytics? What information would you say I should request from the coach to form meaningful data for the team?"
av8sba,7,2019-02-26,Questions about (Discord) careers? (Mainly just a huge rant/list of questions about my future),ponninja,discordapp,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/av8sba/questions_about_discord_careers_mainly_just_a/,"Hi there! I am so sorry if I'm not allowed to ask questions about careers/jobs, as I'm aware most tech companies are very hush hush, considering I know a certain someone who works at the Discord HQ in San Fran. (I don't want them to get fired obv,,, sorry :( )

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND INFO/EXPLANATION BELOW, **SKIP TO THE QUESTIONS IF YOU WANT:**

&amp;#x200B;

I live an hour or so away from the lovely Bay Area, I see computer programming/science as a godsend? I don't know how else to describe it, but I've known since I was like 11 or 12 that I wanted to do something along the lines of computer soft/hardware engineering, or science, or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

I love video games, and I am amazed by how much technology has advanced in the past decade or so. The future is becoming the present; we have (prototypes of) flying cars, jetpacks, androids, """"""hoverboards"""""", and more. (Also, just for reference, a couple sci-favorites that I can name from the top of my head are Tron (specifically *Legacy*, sorry :( ) and Detroit: Become Human (double sorry :( )) Oh but one thing that isn't sci-fi but relates to computers that I LOVE is Mr. Robot (triple sorry :( )

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a high school sophomore planning to take Calculus next year???? I'm not too sure. Right now, I'm doing Algebra 2 and to be honest I'm a little bit rough around the edges because math is getting *hard*. But anyway, once I get the hang of something, I usually love to solve equations, kind of like a puzzle? I'm also taking AP Euro, English Honors 2, and Chemistry. Next year, I signed up for two terms (one school year) of be.tech's Video Game Design Course. I will be learning how to 3D model and program in C(?) using Blockly(?) (or some sort of Blockly-type of system?)

&amp;#x200B;

The certain someone has recommended that I learn R, even though I'm not planning to do data analysis most likely? I'm planning to focus on software engineering, as I find coding pretty cool. Like I know how they display hacking in the movies isn't how it actually is, but I find it fascinating how you can dupe thousands of people with metaphysical strings of code. Like a virus, or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

I also plan to apply to UC Berkeley (dream school), and/or UC Davis (ugh, not really feelin sacramento but imig it's a UC lol and my cousin is doing electrical engineering U\_U). My safety school would probably be San Jose State :/

&amp;#x200B;

(Computer/Programming) EXPERIENCE, if relevant, lol:

&amp;#x200B;

The only languages I've had experience with are Python, Ruby, Java, Javascript, CMD (a little), HTML, CSS, and just a little bit of C from Unity, C++ from Arduino (farthest I've gone was connect a servo fan thing to the Wi-Fi and spin it around using my phone...) . I've tried to learn Shell and Node (tried to set up a Discord bot but failed.)

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I've programmed something was about 2 years ago or more... I haven't really had the time or inspiration or motivation to do so? The most frustrating thing I remember doing was taking about 2 or more hours trying to code a Python(?) rock, paper, scissors, randomization, text-console-input game. I remember crying my ass off that night :/. I've mainly used Python to make (unfinished) choose-your-own-adventure games. I tried programming a simple drag-and-drop dress up game on Unity for PC in Summer 2018 (last year).

&amp;#x200B;

**ACTUAL QUESTIONS:**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so basically? I?? I really wanna work at Discord. The corp culture seems so chill but you can obviously see that when y'aint hangin and chillin, y'all's working *hard*. My number one dream job was Google, but now it's Discord :&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

1. I've heard that internships before/during college count as work experience. Is that true?
2. How old were you when you were hired?
3. What is a typical work schedule for a software engineer? (My certain someone can't tell me so...) If you can't tell me, is it all right if I ask what a typical work schedule is for a general employee?
4. What is a typical day as a software engineer? Do you fix bugs? Do you create completely new sets of code for new bells and whistles? Or, what is a typical day as a general employee?
5. What was your education and/or work experience when you were hired?
6. From y'all's youtube video, I've seen that you don't have sit-down-and-talk-about-hard-facts interviews. Instead, you just walk and talk and kind of hang? How does that work out?

&amp;#x200B;

aksksksk im so sorry if im violating any guidelines ! its understandable if you wanna take this down bc i sound like some sort of corporate spy,,

2. All applicants do need to apply via the link in the attached URL, we don‚Äôt accept resumes via LinkedIn.
3. You do have to be able to legally work in the USA to qualify for this position (Novartis has other international positions available on their careers site)
4. This is for a summer position, not full time.
5. If you‚Äôve had a chance to read my article here on LinkedIn, I‚Äôm more interested in getting to know who you are, not what you‚Äôve accomplished - keep that in mind when you apply. The article OP is referencing: [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/real-me-versus-cv-arthur-chan-ph-d-mba/)
6. Several of my team members will be deciding who gets an interview- after all, we want to ensure the intern is a great fit for our culture and who better to make that judgement call than the people who I trust to make this team a great group to belong to.

ava1bc,2,2019-02-27,Third Year University Student (Australia) - Seeking Advice,Eptiome,technicalwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/ava1bc/third_year_university_student_australia_seeking/,"Hi r/technicalwriting

&amp;#x200B;

**A little background first:**

I'm currently 3/4 years into my double degree Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science, with my third year starting next week. My respective majors are Professional Writing and Editing, and Chemistry. I've also taken on 3 elective units related to programming and web development. I'm an aspiring technical writer and have dreamed of becoming once since my early senior years in high school. One of my father's clients is a technical writer and I've received advice/assistance from in the past. He allowed me to visit one day and ran me through his work and projects, which really cemented the idea that I wanted to be a technical writer. However, he was diagnosed with cancer sometime last year and I haven't heard from him since. While it is understandable (I truly hope he's getting well), I'm starting to feel a little lost and worried after losing such a valuable and helpful contact. I'm becoming increasingly concerned about finding work, internships or any sort of similar work after I graduate. While that day is still two years away, I can't help but feel anxious about it; I want to prepare now. 

My university is one that heavily focuses on internships, projects and actual experience. One of my units this semester, 'Media and Communications Project A', essentially boils down to undertaking an internship or personal project for the course of the unit. While the university will help, we're also expected to source out our own internships or projects before the semester commences. I had planned to organise something with the technical writer that I knew and contacted him about it last year, which is how I found out about his medical situation.

Naturally, I want to focus in on technical writing for this unit. While, other writing opportunities may be great, I feel like now is the time for honing in and developing technical writing experience. Ultimately, I'm eager to work with an actual technical writer. 

As a long time lurker here, I've already sought out the leaders of two open source projects with hope that they'll take me on to help produce documentation. I'm now looking at reaching out to a few technical writing firms in my area.  


**My questions:** 

First and foremost, how should I go about trying to get internships or similar opportunities? Should I send my CV? Is it better to present myself in person? I'm not really sure what the best approach is. I've found a few places that seem promising, but I want to know the best way to approach these companies. Should I be trying to sell myself like I'm going for a job? 

Are there any Australian technical writers here who would be willing to give me some advice about the nature of the industry here? Can you recommend companies or places that I should reach out to? I live in Melbourne and I've found a few places online, but I'm rather unfamiliar with the scene, naturally.

University aside, what should I be doing between now and my graduation to maximise my employability and opportunities?  

Thank you in advance. I've followed this community for a few years and know people will be really helpful. "
ava1cv,59,2019-02-27,Google Fi has been downright unhelpful,Rusettsten,ProjectFi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectFi/comments/ava1cv/google_fi_has_been_downright_unhelpful/,"This might be a long and boring post, but honestly I feel like I'm out of options right now. I've been using Project Fi since 2016 and haven't had a problem with customer support until now.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, near the end of January, my Pixel 2 screen went kaput. Totally and utterly broken. Not shattered, but a crack in the corner probably led to the moment that the screen stopped working entirely. Not just the digitizer, but the entire LCD screen. The phone went dark. However, the phone still turned on. When I held the power button and volume down it would buzz. She was dark, *but not yet dead.*

&amp;#x200B;

So I did what I knew I had to- order a new phone. It was my fault the screen was originally cracked after all. I was happy to order one on the Project Fi store as I had before. I got a LG G7 ThinQ. I didn't think too much about ordering it except that it is quite a bit of money, but it had generous discounts. However, this is when the problems began.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem One:** The package came five days past the expected time of arrival. It took 9 days from the night when I ordered the phone to the day I finally got it. After two phone calls, and four emails, I was basically told by Google Fi support *""Sorry. Nothing I can do.""* over and over again. Okay, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem Two:** About a week ago, I get the email that my trade-in was complete. Great! Finally $100 of much needed cash. Nope. The phone was appraised at $6. Six. Dollars. I had made full note that *the screen was not working* but that *it still turned on.* Because it did. The phone buzzed when power-cycled. I thought, oh well, I have no proof so I guess I lose. That's OK.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem Three:** The new phone, so far so good, or so I thought. This past Friday when I noticed that my mic no longer works. To no avail, even after a factory reset, it simply wouldn't work. I also discovered that the headphone jack doesn't work either. So I quickly chatted online with a Google Fi rep and got the warranty information sorted. After entering some financial information, I was quickly sent a confirmation that a replacement phone would soon be on its way. Except the replacement phone was listed as a ***Refurbished*** *LG G7 ThinQ.* Odd, and it seems cheap for how much the phone costed. But I digress. There's nothing I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem Four:** Today, I got the package. A simple bubble-wrapped envelope with a phone inside. I could feel it. Finally after over a month of waiting I would have a stress-free phone that worked! And then I would just have to wisk away my old phone in the same package. Right? **WRONG.** I was sent a refurbished Pixel 3 with *no return label*. Wonderful. Just absolutely wonderful. So I call Google Fi support using Hangouts on my desktop and get no answer of what to do next, and I'm left with, ""I'll call you back in a few hours."" Yeah. Call me back on my phone with no mic. Except she never called back after **6 hours** of me leaving Hangouts open**.** Left in the dark, I called back using my Desktop. The new rep said that the issue had been escalated and that I would receive a response by *call* or email within 24-48 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been without a working, useful phone for too long. For three years I have stuck with Project Fi but this is getting to be ridiculous. I feel so helpless. On top of everything right now it is **the** time for phone interviews for Summer Internships, and I have to find time to get to my desktop and hope that Hangouts will get the call correctly, even though I've paid hundreds for a phone that doesn't work.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would really be appreciated. I'm not sure what to do next."
ava7vo,7,2019-02-27,How did you guys keep going after an awful experience?,King_Quijote,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/ava7vo/how_did_you_guys_keep_going_after_an_awful/,"So basically I had a pretty rough go of it for my internship. Ive had a couple line cook jobs before that had their low points, but nothing I couldn't eventually overcome. Actually my previous fine dining jobs have been amazing, and I had a great time. 
 But this was something else. The chef threw me in over my head on the line with an incompetent coworker, and it all went downhill from there. There was more than a little screaming, but to be fair, I kept screwing up. Before you call me a delicate snowflake, several other cooks quit because of the environment. 
The first half of the internship was great but then I got really sick and had to take a week or so off. 
After that my mind wasn't in a good place and I wanted to quit. I wasnt sleeping, couldn't stop dreaming about work, my hands shook constantly, and I lost about 15lb in four weeks. After having a talk with the chef, I decided not to but I was lucky to pass my internship at all.  This left my confidence shot, and I'm wondering if I can still hack it in a fine dining kitchen. Has anyone else gone through this? And if so, how did you come back?

Edit: The chef, sous, and all the other cooks did everything they could to help, but I was in such a anxious state that nothing stuck. "
avaj3s,11,2019-02-27,"Separating Your Professional Self from your ""Regular Self"" in Intimate Relationships",DirtBagStudioz,Ask_Lawyers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/avaj3s/separating_your_professional_self_from_your/,"Hi everyone. I am a 3L, set to take my state's BAR exam this summer. This isn't a legal question, but it is one relevant to attorneys.

I have a question for attorneys regarding how you separate your professional persona from your non-professional persona. Specifically, in the context of intimate relationships. Attorneys are trained to talk in a very objective manner, but this is not necessarily the way you should be speaking to your partner.

For background, my exposure to the legal field began in my undergraduate years. I began a legal internship with the local prosecutor's office and got unexpectedly shown the most terrible things that humans are capable of doing to one another. Things children swallowing glass to kill themselves because of unrelenting sexual abuse became ""just another day at my internship"" kind of thing.

In response, emotional coldness/distance became a defense mechanism for me. I ended up doing this type of emotionally-draining work each year and was always applauded for appearing to be ""calm and collected"" all the time. 

This changed in my 3L when I was diagnosed with PTSD, where I realized that, for my health's sake, I needed to make a career transition.

Currently, I am juggling 3L, bar preparation, working with a personal injury attorney for an accident my partner and I were involved in, working with a foreign attorney for property I acquired through inheritance, a law clerk position, and constant networking with attorneys and professors to help me with my career transition. 

My partner, a videogame streamer for Facebook, is a sophisticated woman who enjoys speaking with me on legal matters related to her brand and business, like contracts, taxation, and copyright.

Currently, I can see that my involvement in the legal field is starting to swallow up my identity as person. To put it in another way, I am slowly becoming unable to differentiate between DirtBag and DirtBag (future) ESQ. This has put significant strain on my romantic relationships, both current and past.

My current (and previous) partners have accused me of being emotionally distant, and letting my need for objectivity overrule my ability to be an empathetic person. I realize that they are correct in that I speak and listen to my partner's problems like they're a client and not someone I'm romantically involved with.

I currently have a counselor, but would also appreciate the input of practicing attorneys. I am a 3L, but anticipate this becoming even more of a problem in practice if I don't address this. That being the case (1) how do you separate your professional identity from your identity as a person and (2) how do you prevent your professional identity from causing friction in your romantic relationships?

Throwaway account.

Some necessary backstory: 
I met my boyfriend the day I turned 18, traveling overseas. We hit it off instantly. I‚Äôm from North America, he‚Äôs from the other side of the world, so we knew long distance was going to be a factor when we decided to keep in contact.
He had plans for the following year to do a ski season in Canada, but things were going so well with us he sped up the process and moved early. It took a while, but I eventually got a visa as well and moved to Canada to join him. We had the most amazing and adventurous two years there before deciding that our next step was moving to his hometown (30 hour flight away). 
I knew I had just lived an incredibly exciting 2 years in a party town, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting to keep that level of excitement and adventure up. I was actually looking very much forward to laying low for a bit, lay off the partying, and let my liver and brain heal while I finished school and got a start on my career aspirations, finding some internships or small jobs more relevant to my field.
Now he‚Äôs from a very small, rural town with lots of trade (he‚Äôs a tradesman) and mining, very conservative. It‚Äôs the type of place people grow up in and then settle down in. It‚Äôs very relaxed and everyone is content. I‚Äôm originally from quite a big capital city in America with a lot going on. I was ready for the change and looking forward to living near the ocean.

I‚Äôve been living in this town with him for 10 months now. Quite simply, I‚Äôm not doing well. It‚Äôs claustrophobic here, it‚Äôs quiet, the town itself is not doing well economically, it‚Äôs not very pretty, and there‚Äôs no place to get a start in anything related to what I‚Äôd like to do job-wise. Besides that, it took me 2 months and 40 applications to just find an opening at a restaurant waitressing, which is fine, however I struggle to obtain 15 hours a week there, strictly because of the lack of hours available. I‚Äôm trying to set up a second job bartending somewhere else, but they‚Äôve made it clear they can only guarantee 5-10 hours more. I enjoy working a lot, as well as having my own money, so this has been a big adjustment as I‚Äôve always had a good amount of monetary autonomy and have worked 60 hour weeks since graduating high school. 

I‚Äôve made more than multiple attempts to go out and make friends, however I feel stuck in the middle. People here my age are mostly still living with and off their parents, shopping for designer clothes on afterpay, and going out every weekend. My partner‚Äôs friends I‚Äôve attempted to get closer to are all settled down with ‚Äúadult‚Äù jobs, and some even having kids, leading to a bit of a disconnect. I‚Äôve tried yoga classes, group sports, inviting people out... no one seems to want or need any more friends, as they‚Äôve gone to school with their friends since they were children and grown up alongside each other.

My partner keeps reiterating that we will leave eventually, hopefully at the end of the year, but I‚Äôm very anxious because I don‚Äôt know when exactly that will be. We initially only planned to stay here for 6 months. He‚Äôs very content here, and his family is here, as well as a good paying job. I don‚Äôt want to rush him out, as I feel that‚Äôs selfish, but I‚Äôm getting nervous. I‚Äôm almost finished with university and want to start on my career aspirations, even just unpaid internships. The opportunity here is non-existent. 

This is driving a wedge between us, as he‚Äôs well aware of how unhappy I am here. I‚Äôm a world away from my family and any friends, and I‚Äôm so depressed, and in turn feel so shameful and guilty that I‚Äôm not happy when I should be. I‚Äôve gone to the doctor 4 times after having horrible panic attacks, and they‚Äôve told me I‚Äôm just ‚Äústressed‚Äù, to do some yoga or meditation. I have no drive to do the things I usually love (writing, reading, running on the beach), and I haven‚Äôt been sleeping or eating well. My sex drive has plummeted, which is heartbreaking to me, as that‚Äôs a very important connection for me in a relationship.

I feel so shameful that I‚Äôm not happy because I do love my boyfriend so dearly, and I‚Äôm so appreciative of everything he does for me, including assisting in my visa payment so I can acquire permanent residency. It doesn‚Äôt help I can barely afford to pay rent and for groceries. I try my best to make his dinners and pack his lunches, make sure the house is clean, but I feel like that‚Äôs my only purpose at the moment. I‚Äôve lost all the things outside of a relationship that made me happy. I feel like a mooch, and then feel ungrateful because I‚Äôm so depressed, and then more depressed because I‚Äôm so unhappy, and that in turn makes my boyfriend upset... it‚Äôs a cycle.

The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back is that I made plans to visit my family back home and see my sister graduate in May, and had to cancel the flight due to my permanent residency being in process (I won‚Äôt be able to get back in and work if my bridging visa isn‚Äôt processed). I‚Äôm devastated, I miss them so much, and will have to postpone for at least a month, most likely longer.

Am I being selfish? Can anyone recommend some coping mechanisms for sticking it out? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for advice or just someone to voice a similar experience... Anything would help.

TL;DR- I moved across the world to be with my boyfriend and am miserable in his hometown. I‚Äôm lonely and I feel horribly guilty about feeling this way. I wish I could like this place, but I hate it. I feel trapped and like I‚Äôm ruining the relationship I have with a man I love so much. Help? "
avazfc,6,2019-02-27,Here‚Äôs where the broken window claim breaks apart for me.,CommandanteAlighieri,JonBenetRamsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/avazfc/heres_where_the_broken_window_claim_breaks_apart/,"First things first: **I don't exactly know for sure which theory this interpretation supports.** I'm newish to this case, and I've been back and forth on so many theories in the last few days after reading this sub that I can't say I *fully* ascribe to one in particular, although I do certainly have some leanings. That said, again, I'm not sure how to interpret this.

John has claimed that the window got broken anywhere from 'two months before' to 'the summer before' Christmas. I read several posts saying so earlier today. I know he has certainly changed his story multiple times, but when I read that initially, something in my mind... clicked. And now I can't let this go.

Here's the thing: I have lived in Massachusetts for most of the last six years. Massachusetts gets very cold in the winter. I used to live in an old house, and being exposed to the cold even through the relatively small cracks in our (stuck, but not broken) kitchen window or under our back door was...unpleasant. We couldn‚Äôt afford a ‚Äúfull‚Äù fix, so we avoided being around those holes and tried to plug them up with assorted objects whenever possible.

I also, a few summers ago, had an internship in a mountain town in California that was 5000+ feet above sea level. I lived there during the summer, and during the day, it would get anywhere from 75-90. But even so, the evenings were decidedly *not* warm ‚Äì we usually had to wear jackets and long pants or bring blankets if we wanted to hang out outside. It wasn't uncommon for the temperature to dip down to 30-45.

So consider the factors here:
(1) Colorado is a mountainous state (I know Boulder isn't *in* the mountains, but still)
(2) Colorado is not a state that is known for being warm
(3) *This was leading up to Christmas time.*

They definitely had the money to fix a window. I know John has said that the basement got warm sometimes, but with two young kids in the house, and, again, *winter coming*, you don't just knowingly leave broken glass lying around for months on end. 

My BDI friend suggested that maybe they just didn't care about the heating bill, but if this window has been this way for *multiple months,* it's not even about the cold after a certain point ‚Äì it's about rain coming in, or sleet, or hail, or leaves, or glass from the window, or random debris, or small animals, or who knows what. At best, it's a nuisance; at worst, it's a safety hazard! When I was a kid, we thought one of my neighbors' male cats was peeing around the outside of our basement window when he was in heat. My parents would 100% have never risked the possibility of him getting into our house, let alone anything else. 

Also: didn't John claim he had to break the window to get in through it when he was locked out? Wouldn't he have shared this with his family ‚Äì lest they be concerned about how and why the window got broken, or if the neighbors saw or heard a noise, or, IDK, if they saw *the multiple scars he would have gotten*? And wouldn‚Äôt they have all easily stated so when interviewed? I got a 3-inch-long scar on my forearm from scraping a piece of chainlink fence back in early October, and it was still visible on my arm until January. And that was just one scar! Unless John had had experience coming in broken windows, surely he would have had some kind of visible evidence on his face, torn clothing, etc. to show for it.

Again, I'm not an expert on this case, so please feel free to correct me if my facts are incorrect. I‚Äôm open to any civil criticism or debate. Thanks!"

Out of all the material we have gone through I tend to like the programming best.  I aced those classes and it seemed really fun.

I'm on the Big Island of Hawaii and there's no much of anything to be honest.  It gets depressing because I feel so alien out here.  They don't have much of a tech scene and I can't even score an internship out here.  It's kind of getting to me.

However, lately I have been feeling down.  I feel like my dream to go live there in turning bleak and unreachable.  I feel like sometimes I'm too old or I didn't make good life choices.

After reading Act Two, Torrance opted to browse through the security logs and systems of his Freighter Base rather than provoking any immediate confrontations with any crewperson. The system had - according to the experts - been since cleaned of the viral hacks and so on delivered by the First Spawn whilst resident. Apparently some recidivist Gek really had learned digital tricks from the Korvax. The KVC had helped secure the business end of the 'Triple V' yet the Grandmaster's Clone had found cunning ways beyond their protections. Ways perhaps only possible to one who had been trusted too much and given internal access to the hardware side but it still annoyed.

Torrance was mostly interested in the Korvax Chef the 'Cook' as the Gek insisted in calling that one in his story. Torrance supposed the First Spawn believed the lesser label better suited a member of the Slave Race. Listening to some of the speeches by the Gek was akin to going back in time to some barbarous age when sapient people were readily bought and sold. Although in fact, slaves were still far too regularly created by Space Pirates from their captives and even in these late times bartered like commodities at certain blackmarket waystations... 

Slavery was generally deemed - by most now - an illegal activity yet rumours abounded that some Gek Guilds and high ranking individuals found ways around the changing times to retain slaves of a new sort. Here I speak of locked away long suffering domestics as well as mine workers and so on that never saw the light of day. Often the latter slaves simply branded criminals - usually - unfortunate debtors serving out indentured sentences. Equally arguably some Vy'keen clans held some war captives too that were little better than slaves. Perhaps somethings never really changed out there they just got scrubbed up a little cleaner via some clever spinning of the facts and a few new labels.

Speaking of labels the 'Cook' - now just the 'Cook' to Torrance too - because he felt that one had lost some rights to a higher more respectful address by spying on his employer. Anyway the Cook was now in a new if identical Casing. Logs showed it had not departed the 'Triple V' since it was rehoused in a replacement body from storage. Torrance finding it interesting that the Cook had such an item squirreled away ready to go almost as if it had expected to have need of such. Although he also had to admit for all he knew many better off Korvax might keep a spare Casing or two against some difficult to correct mechanical issue or accident. 

Recent security logs showed the Cook remained constantly aboard including possibly during the time that it was supposed to have confronted the Prophet. However all that the cameras and sensors could monitor was the movement of the physical Casing not any digital chicanery that could be going on behind the hardware including Casing swaps the old digital travelling without moving trick.

Sadly, the records from the period of the actual atrocity had all been corrupted beyond even Korvax recovery or so all the Korvax asked claimed. Torrance knew that could have been the First Spawn wanting to keep the secrets of its craft hidden or just as easily been the KVC doing the same or more likely both parties individually looking to their own ends of separate parts in the dodgy business.

It was all especially frustrating, because even at his own base of operations Torrance knew he did not hold the highest hand in the deck. Even on the 'Triple V his Verbose Virulent Void' as he named her he was forever an outsider an Interloper merely meddling in the affairs of the locals. At least that was often how it felt to him. A cursed Atlas wrought documenting tourist just as the Gek accused.

He felt a bit of a fool now for - charging around acting the hero - how many times must the Atlas and others tell him directly or in more subtle indirect ways that there are no heroes in these domains. He had rescued the Gek Clone from its abhorrent captivity and brought it back to his mobile home and patted himself on the back for a good deed done well. He had seen himself in a glorious light as a selfless benefactor... it had made him feel good for a time. Silly really but that was how it happened.

Worse, he could not deny that he had read all about such entities as the 'Digital Echo of Grandmaster Muu' from Elder Torrance's logs and should have known better than to trust so much about the Gek Clone based on outward appearances, even if profound suffering and abuse was involved and written plain to see. A person could be a victim and yet in themselves be far from innocent.

Thinking about his role in the calamity he had to wonder if he had a longer journey to go before he became a proper Torrance. He had awoken and when he found his ship the name of Vik_T_Torrance was in the cockpit, that had pointed the way to the Anomalous Channel logs unlocking the history of other iterations and a key to a shared identity of sorts. Still, he was on a learning curve, as yet he had not even gone beyond Euclid or even simply visited near the mysterious glowing core of this Galaxy, things the Elder Torrance did ages ago.

In fact, because the Elder had done some of those historic things already he had felt less pushed to do the same now, he wondered about those choices too. Instead of doing what most Interlopers did he had gone his own way was that wise? Was it dutiful? Whilst the original had been born without any clear label or assured guidance beyond perhaps strange prophetic dreams of another world divined and Anomalous Channel omens read in a very Elder Torrance way. The self belief of the Elder often seemed strong was it stronger than his own interpretation of the logs of his other - past - lives if you could truly judge those that simplistically.

Would the Elder One have made such gross errors with the Gek Clone? Then again that one had professed to many a mistake too and perhaps only published the more acceptable errors. Arguably we all like to present a good front - or at least most folk like to most of the time - or so Torrance believed. With logs there was always as well the burning question of what might have been omitted never mind what might have a strong bias attached.

Sadly the plainer security logs and currently active monitoring systems were worse than useless. If useful data had ever been here it had been destroyed. Whilst he gained little other than a bad mood gazing through cameras at the Cook in real time as it went about its tasks in the recreational area kitchen. The Korvax now operating as if nothing momentous and diabolical had ever happened. To it the loss of its previous Casing possibly only a minor inconvenience part of what made his kind both more and less than biology. Although one of the first tasks it had undertaken had been to spirit away all the parts of its own cooked and dismembered former body. Once again the kitchen area was spotless, a product of a stern clean as you go policy. Even in heavy use the place often looked almost sterile as if newly generated. Apparently cleanliness was very Korvax. The Vy'keen Interns were certainly as a rule not so circumspect with the 'Triple V' furnishings they liked to play rough and make a mess.

Speaking of Vy'keen, and a little horribly to Torrance, it had not taken long for a new cadre of Vy'keen Interns to arrive keen to replace their fallen kin, bragging about getting revenge on all First Spawn and the Blood Cults. A few bold ones even daring to claim that they would have put up a sterner resistance although they were sure the dead had fought well enough to earn suitable honours from their passing - making martial merit to carry into their next cycle. He felt akin to a tourist with that too. There was no saying no to the Vy'keen Interns - there never had been - they arrived from the Clans and would not be dissuaded from service with the Mindwar Archive. It had become a strangely compulsive tradition. ""It is how it must be. A Torrance without Vy'keen Interns could not be a Torrance."" One Vy'keen Volunteer had once insisted when Torrance had thanked them all for their service after one successful operation.

That idea had been very odd to him in some ways as he still thought himself a bit of a lone wolf if a lone wolf with friends in various places.

Torrance did not think he would ever entirely comprehend the fullness of Vy'keen ways especially when it came to their almost love affair with death particularly with their own demises. Sure they were not all the same: Occasionally he had even met the odd cowardly Vy'keen on some lonely world desperate to escape any martial endeavour but cowards were not the sort that tended to volunteer for the Mindwar as roving cult busting vigilantes and assistants with the Hive World liberations from the Overmind.

At the last he didn't see the point in confronting the Korvax Cook about its probable service with the KVC it would just make future standard interactions with that one problematic. Out there beyond the Office Area it was already business as usual on the 'Triple V' and disrupting that routine seemed counter productive - it was in someways a rare blessing that return to normality. He would just take it under advisement that the Cook was an active on-board KVC agent. Perhaps he should have questioned the role of that Korvax deeper earlier. Yet the Korvax Chef had seemed so idiosyncratic and generally colourful in its ways with its over-protectiveness of its hyper advanced kitchen appliances and its insistence in making the most exotic and complex of dishes that Torrance had never thought much about it ever being anything other than entirely uniquely itself. In many ways it had seemed more a Korvax Rogue than a potential agent of the Convergence. Indeed he seemed to recall it claiming to be a Rogue once was that recorded in a log.

Death and rebirth for an Anomalous Interloper tended to put big holes in your memory. He had died a few times recently once due to a silly escapade involving cave flying. Madness, but death for an Interloper was not like death even for the Vy'keen. They all came back eventually, at least that is the legend here, but true Interlopers tended to come back far more quickly and somehow it was just different for some of his kind too Torrance was positive about that fact. Some of his own kind were simply not the same as the others in almost inexplicable ways. It was just another mystery of the Great Machine of Atlas. 

Returning to thoughts about the Cook though, he could recall that one once fending off a hungry mob of Vy'keen with naught but a wooden spoon prancing about like some robotic fencing master and it was the Vy'keen that had been forced into a general retreat cursing the humbling. No one messed with the Korvax Chef - not even the Torrance - as the nominal 'Captain of the Triple V' or even as the Prime Archivist of the Mindwar Archive such titles meant little if you trespassed in the Korvax Kitchen area.

Despite the recent calamity, thinking about some of that last stuff made him smile. Then he wondered if it was all just an act to bamboozle. That seemed painful, he wasn't sure he wanted to interact with others in a domain were such could be true. He preferred to think the Cook was simply the Cook and it just also happened to be entangled with the KVC maybe recruited only after it had gained its culinary position. Was that self delusion - perhaps. Still, it was not easy to say no to the KVC, might as well say no to Atlas. He cursed then but still strove to let it go.

They just calculated...

Perhaps they had done what they did to give the Gek a chance to reform on its own terms. If they had informed him of their suspicions that it had the digital soul of a Grandmaster within it - not been just an empty copy of the flesh - would that not have prejudiced him against it and robbed it of any chance to change by its own free will. Plus it was done now for good or ill. Even if he sacked the Cook for spying the KVC would just find some other cunning way to put an operative close to him. Clearly the KVC still saw the Torrances as their assets to some extent or at least individuals of interest to their objectives. We meddle too, he could not deny it, so they probably had good reason to want to keep a watch on the activities of any Torrance. Gryll was right about one thing: This was the Age of the Convergence, currently the Convergence was ascendant. Perhaps it was a cycle, each of the three having their own golden age if you like.

A magnet for martial troubles...

Of course he was, he hunted the infamous First Spawn Survivors and the cursed Gek Blood Cults, contested the Overmind of the Monopods and even fought Space Pirates at almost every available opportunity. It felt like all of that was just who he was and he did not even want to change those habits much. To him all those factions needed contested by someone and it helped take his mind off other issues such as being caged forever inside his suit.

Meanwhile, he still had to finish off reading the rest of the Dossier including listening to the rest of the Broken Prophets story in its many Acts. That was not easy, listening to that Gek's voice after witnessing the carnage it left behind. Those Interns that had been on-board and died - so messily - he had judged his friends, no more than that they had at times become more akin to part of an extended family. He had oft tried not to get too attached but... "
avddpr,1,2019-02-27,[M4F] Love Potion No. 9,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/avddpr/m4f_love_potion_no_9/,"I stepped into Tommy's Pub that night with a smile. After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! 

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

New to the industry. Did an unpaid internship for 7 months then a low paying position with another startup for 9 months.

I've been struggling with finding a a better overall position and I finally passed the interview process elsewhere. They wanted to see some samples of my recent code so I took some basic code I've written from my current position and privately displayed it to their lead. Once they sent me the job offer, I put in my 2 weeks.

I told my boss/ceo about the process and how I used some code snippets. He was cool with it at first but a week later, I guess he told the CTO and he flipped out.

My final day was Friday with the flexibility of working next week if I wanted extra $ but now they're cutting it down to Thursday. I'm told that I broke their NDA and if I asked permission it wouldn't have been an issue. They said the code that I shared was nothing critical but I still broke a legal contract. CEO said he could write a cease and desist letter but probably don't think they have to.

CEO went on to say that he feels like he has the moral obligation to notify my future employer about this situation but at this point he won't. He personally feels betrayed by my actions.

I apologized and mentioned that i may not fully understand their perspective. I didn't do anything maliciously but I messed up. I feel bad that he feels betrayed but I'm honestly feeling like he tried to make me feel as shitty as possible. Threatening future employment really hurt me.

avefdf,1,2019-02-27,My Ex girlfriend [20] who has autism broke up with me twice but still keeps attracting and repelling me [22]. I don't know what to do anymore,mr-thomazzz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avefdf/my_ex_girlfriend_20_who_has_autism_broke_up_with/,"**some background information**

&amp;#x200B;

Very short before we started dating she'd been diagnosed with Autism. I knew this from the start but it didn't really bother me. At times you couldn't even notice it, but it made some things like intimacy and talking about emotions a lot harder. She also has a history of depression and anxiety due to being bullied throughout high school which led her to  self harm and an attempt at suicide by overdosing on anti depressants. Now She's on anti depressants, goes weekly to a psychiatrist and psychologist and is still recovering.

&amp;#x200B;

Only after 2 months of dating we were actually in a relationship. She wanted to do everything slowly because she was afraid to get hurt. Considering her past I fully understand her. It was hard for her to believe that I truly loved her (still do) and wanted to have a relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**First break up**

&amp;#x200B;

The first time she broke up  with me ( 3 weeks into our relationship) was right before she was gonna meet my sister and brother in law. At first she said it was because she didn't have the same feelings for me as I did for her. Later she told me it was because we were moving to fast and she was afraid to meet my family. Also she had  fear of commitment. After that happened I kept pursuing her, told that she didn't have to be afraid, that we'd take things slowly and when she was uncomfortable with something we'd talk about it. We came back together and that's exactly what we did for 5 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

**During the 5 months we were together**

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said we took everything very slowly. During those 5 months we got really intimate with each other in the end. Talking about emotions kept being a struggle. There were times in the beginning where I'd say sweet things and say that I loved her and she wouldn't say a word cause she didn't know what to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although we only live 5 min apart we didn't see each other as much as you'd expect. She needed a lot of personal time and I respect that. Most of the times I would suggest that we'd do something together or come over but 90% of the time she'd say she was to tired or overstimulated (due to her autism). She had total control over when we'd see each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next to that, structure was really important. When we did things together it was necessary to have everything planned out or she would stress out and have a tantrum. changing plans or cancelling plans was a big no no.

&amp;#x200B;

There were a lot of things for me to take into account and it wasn't always easy. But I still managed to do it because she was worth it for me

&amp;#x200B;

**Second break up**

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was going well. I felt like she was finally coming out of her bubble. Not long ago she said she was happy again. But then she relapsed. I believe this was caused by tons of stress for her exams and her internship as midwife. Things started going downhill real fast. 

some examples:

* She didn't want to come over anymore
* Barely texted me or would tell me to leave her alone
* after a friend of hers cancelled on a planned dinner. I took the time to go with her the day before my exam, so time was short. After dinner she wanted to go on a walk. When I suggested to join her she replied ""no you should go home""
* ........

In short, she started repelling me which made me really paranoid that she'd break up with me again. And that's what happened, again....

&amp;#x200B;

She texted me saying she had doubts if she really wanted to have a relationship. Also saying that she felt bad the first time she broke up with me and that guilt played a role when we came back together. ( my self esteem took a hard hit right there). She told me she didn't have the energy to be in a relationship and that she needs to work on herself instead, and I kind of get that but it still hurts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now**

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I pursued her but this time I decided that I would stop putting in so much effort in trying. I'm afraid if I'd do the same thing as the first time it would go well for a while but she'd end up breaking up with me again. She's been texting me for over a month on a daily basis, but the things she said are very  contradictory. So far she has told me that:

* She wasn't together with me out of guilt, although it played its part
* She truly loved me
* She doesn't have the energy anymore
* She really misses being together
* She felt imprisoned during those 5 months and now feeling free again
* She prefers being alone

&amp;#x200B;

There are times where she keeps texting me about how she misses everything and me, but when asked if she wants to try again she replies ""I don't know"". Other times she texts me saying everything is better now and that we should stay separated. She keeps attracting and repelling me and it's not doing me any favors.

&amp;#x200B;

Deep down I still want to get together, but I also feel stupid for still wanting this after all that happened. I'm tired of being in this grey zone where I don't know what she wants. She can't be together but also can't let me go.

Now I have to appear for the retest in December this year and prepare everything on my own. I don't know why I'm envious of everyone who's calling home and their friends saying how they passed. My GPA is super low and I'm afraid if I'll  be able to get into a better graduate program or will I be able to get an internship abroad. Above all I don't know how to deal the feeling of being the only one left behind. What do I do?

avetu6,6,2019-02-27,"My Career as a Minerals Geologist (USA, female)",VAGeo12345,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/avetu6/my_career_as_a_minerals_geologist_usa_female/,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

  I've been job-searching recently (just landed one) and via my googling ended up on this site. I thought I'd contribute and share my experiences for those who may be interested in pursuing a career in economic geology, as the pros and cons have been very much in my mind over the last several months. I have not had a linear career path.

Me: undergraduate degree in environmental science from a public university in Virginia, but my advisor had an economic geology background and taught courses in the subject. After spending 3 months as a Geocorps America intern with the USFS Abandoned Mine Lands program, I decided I was more interested in the geology than environmental reclamation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Job #1: Major gold mining company ($300/day, 7 months). While applying to graduate programs, I also contacted mining companies looking for internships (my advisor gave me some contact info). Timing is everything. Gold was $1800/oz when I started reaching out and this company had just made a major discovery. A woman from a  major gold miner in Nevada told me that deadlines for internships had passed, but did I want a job instead? Obviously, I said yes. I was accepted to the graduate program of my choice--in large part because I had this job and the school saw a potential source of funding..see how that works?--and accepted. The company ended up covering the cost of my MS, and paid me for summer work during this time. Compared to other grad students, I was making bank and sitting pretty. Felt on top of the world. I had four job offers when I graduated, during a downturn, including one in Santiago. Turned it down bc I wanted to be with my boyfriend at the time..led me to...

&amp;#x200B;

Job #2: Same major gold mining company ($450/day, 5 months), another short-term contract. This was fly-in fly-out, but the prices had started to plummet and I knew the end was near. Brownfields gold exploration, I was the only geologist on the project. We hit nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Job #3: Major multi-commodity company ($68-70k/year, \~1 year three months). I had applied to a job at an underground mine outside of Denver, where my then-boyfriend (also a geo) lived. Miraculously, I got the job. Being a mine geo wasn't my dream but the location worked, it was a famous deposit, and I figured that mine jobs were safer during a downturn. Not true.

&amp;#x200B;

Job #4 (well-known/blue chip mining consulting firm, 2 years three months): $25/hr to start, then $71k, finished at $82k + bonus. The entire geology department at job #3 had been cut and the industry was looking very, very grim; most people I knew were out of work. I reached out to a well-known consulting firm that had given me a scholarship during grad school and they hired me on (on an hourly basis, at a low rate) on a trial basis. After two months they gave me full-time. I worked with the resource geology group (making 3D models, doing QAQC, and being the cheap 'field person' whenever field work came up). Got to travel (Mexico, Republic of Georgia, Colombia, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, South Carolina) and work on lots of interesting projects in interesting places. Salt deposits, gold deposits, uranium, iron ore, silver, frack sands. Learned a lot of software, became familiar with reporting standards and the advanced stages of the mining process. However, most of the work was office-based, I didn't love the culture of high-level consulting, and at the end of the day consulting is not a young person's game. I missed exploration; it's a different way of using your brain.

&amp;#x200B;

Job #5 (small Canadian consulting firm, 10 months): $38/hour, plus $60 per diem--worked out to just over $500/day. I felt I wasn't using my degree and was losing my passion for geology at Job #4, so I took a contract job at a consulting firm that did more exploration. I wanted to stay in my city at the time and this gave me time to explore my options. The project was very cool (pegmatite exploration), but there was zero stability and no benefits. The client opted not to progress after about 9 months of my working there and so I've spent the last two months looking for new work, with a focus on full-time jobs with benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, I was given at offer at the major gold mining company that supported me throughout grad school. In some ways it's a great option (good pay, good benefits, good experience). In other ways (location) it's not my ideal. There is no perfect job. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I have learned:

1. This industry requires a certain amount of stubborn optimism and self-belief. You get knocked down a lot. You have to really, really enjoy the work itself--I do, and I think people can feel that enthusiasm, and I think that's part of the reason why I've always been able to find work relatively quickly despite having what is really an impressive amount of turnover. 
2. If you really love the work, networking comes pretty naturally. I've never (really--not once) gotten a job where I didn't have a contact. By contact, I mean someone's email. You don't have to know them personally. It doesn't always work, but if you want to get a job somewhere the best question you can ask (of your friends, of your coworkers, at a conference) is: ""Do you know anyone at XYZ?"" I regularly maintain contact with the majority of the people I've worked with in the past, just touching base occasionally. Perfect the art of the cold call/cold email.
3. Being female is both a hurdle and a superpower. There are some very real lifestyle implications for women in this industry, and women make up \~13% of the workforce (despite being &gt;50% of graduating geoscience classes). That tells you something. Fewer than 1% of board members in mining are female. That's abysmal.  There's no such thing as 'flex time' in mining. Mobility is key to success; many male geologists have wives who don't work, but female geologists rarely do and so it is difficult to balance your career growth/the necessary mobility with your partner's needs and wants for their own career. Then there is the travel--if you want to have kids, that has to slow down and stop for a while, which is tough because it's how you advance. All this being said, there are great opportunities for women at a lot of companies and there's a big push for increasing diversity. My personal belief is that women in mining are going to have to ask, loudly, for what they need to be successful and achieve a workable balance between career progression and personal satisfaction.
4. It's a dying industry in the US. US-based jobs are tougher and tougher to get--and I mean, REALLY tough-- not because we don't have mineable resources but because public sentiment restricts industry growth to a huge degree. Americans love high-tech toys but we hate seeing where the components come from and have an 'out of sight, out of mind' mentality. The industry is healthy in Canada and in Australia. For American students who really want a plethora of options, I actually recommend getting your undergrad degree in the US and heading Can or Aus for graduate work--it's easier to get a job when you already live and have a visa in the country where those jobs are, and at the entry level you are wasting your time applying for jobs outside the US in most cases.
5. You need an emergency fund that will cover your expenses for 6 months, ideally. If you get laid off and have a hard time finding a job in six months (with work experience under your belt, hustling and really putting yourself out there), you're in a bad downturn and at that point I recommend returning to school, or looking at alternatives (environmental? hydro? geotechnical?). It's not bad experience to have.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've had fun. I've also been anxious/afraid and cried over work a lot.

I am a french student in web development looking for an internship in Copenhagen as part of my studies. It has to take place from March 18th to June 15th, but can be extended to the end of the month.

I have been applying since early january. Out of all my applications I only received a few answers, all negative. I even passed some tests in which I was asked to develop an API or a Web application without ever being contacted again (not even some feedback), despite sending several reminders. It's difficult to stay positive under these conditions.

Since I'm running out of time, I'm asking you Reddit. Do you know anyone who would be looking for a backend / app dev ? Do you have any suggestions that could help me in my search for an internship?

Send me a pm if you want a link to my LinkedIn profile or a resume (I don't think I'm allowed to post it directly since it would contain private information right ?). I know my way around databases, PHP (and Laravel), JavaScript (ES6), Node.JS, Express.JS, React.JS and React Native, Expo, APIs... 

Last precision: I don't ask for any salary for my internship, I'm ready to work for free. All I want is an opportunity to discover Copenhagen with my girlfriend, we've been dreaming about it for so long... She'll be so sad if I can't go with her.

Thank you very much for your answers.

1) i don‚Äôt feel connected to the sorority
2) i don‚Äôt have the time because i‚Äôm doing an internship, night classes, and other extracurricular activities
3) i frankly can‚Äôt afford it

to elaborate, since i have joined, i haven‚Äôt really been involved at all or gone to any sisterhoods because they conflict with my class time and other prior commitments. i have commitments for another activity pretty much every sunday, and that‚Äôs when meeting is. as i‚Äôm looking ahead, i‚Äôm not gonna be able to make most of the events, which is a waste of money. even for this spoils week, i‚Äôm flying home tonight (wednesday) for the entire weekend and only had the chance to receive one gift as i‚Äôll be out of town. furthermore, i‚Äôm missing big/little reveal day. 

i haven‚Äôt really been able to meet a lot of girls in my pledge class because of the above issue, that i haven‚Äôt been around to really be able to connect with anyone. i could go out of my way with social media, but i don‚Äôt have the time. i was stressing out these past few weeks over our sister dates where we meet our potential big. while the actives are great, i‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good enough reason for me to stay.

i guess my concern is that girls will judge me or hate me for dropping. i don‚Äôt really know why they would because i haven‚Äôt been showing up to anything so most of them probably don‚Äôt even know me, but it‚Äôs a fear of mine with the girls who do. we haven‚Äôt even been initiated yet or anything, so i‚Äôm technically not ‚Äúin,‚Äù so i figure now is the time to leave before i make any big commitments.

please let me know if you have any advice. on my trip home i‚Äôll be thinking a lot about this, because i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good move for me. "

You must be surprised receiving this picture from your friend suddenly. I was just going through my documents and there it was in my file. I thought I would just tear it up but I couldn't get myself to do it. Remember, I got it made by this artist in Bangkok? You were so excited about it! Well, I wouldn't let you have it because I wanted to keep it for myself. 

So, I tried collecting my thoughts on what to write. And there's so much, but I thought it's better I don't send it to you because then I'd long for an answer and reach out to you and all my progress would have ended. You know how many times I have caved. I still think you're the one. I always thought that, you know. And since we cannot, I have decided to move. I thought changing cities would help but nope. So, I'm changing countries. I resigned from my current job and I'm moving to Singapore for a new job. That's how I came across the picture. I decided I need a landscape change. This city is similar to where we spent four years together and everything here reminds me of you. Of the times we spent together. Of all the arguments we had. Of all the laughs we had. There's just so much to look back to, I just can't. I close my eyes and I see you. Still. After all this time. I know you miss me as well but I hope you're doing fine. I hope the guy you're dating treats you well and makes you ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. I hope you find what you're looking for. And I hope you find peace. I know how chaotic you are mentally.

I wish we were still on talking terms but I'm sorry for being selfish. I just cannot. I cannot talk to you and not long for you to be mine. I can't pretend. I miss you but I hope I can put all this behind. I have made progress though! I don't feel sad when I look back in the past. I feel happy when I talk about some experience that we went through. Remember that wasabi incident? And remember how we drank so much at Skybar? Stuff like that makes me happy when I recall the stories. You will always be a part of my life, no matter what. I just hope it was permanent. Because I know I would have loved that. 

I still have no one to talk to. It was just you, always. But yeah, it doesn't matter anymore. I'll be fine, I promise. 

I hope your kidney infection has passed on and you haven't lost anymore weight. 

Good luck on your upcoming internship. 

Goodbye. 

Yours truly :)"

But I've noticed that around 75% of the internships I find are software/computer engineering related, and most of the remaining 25% are MechE/CivE/Construction related. There are very few Chemistry/ChemE internship positions available, and I'm in a good location for them (Boston area) so I don't think location is the problem.


Does anyone have ChemE internship hunting tips? I'm thinking LinkedIn might not be the way to go

Edit:I've also tried the ""cold-calling"" approach mentioned in the sidebar about reaching out to smaller companies directly, but I've never gotten any responses from doing that."

SO, I‚Äôll just write up what I wish I had done differently, what I‚Äôm glad I did and what expectations I had that got me into trouble, and you can take what you will from it.  Cool?

I wish I had not put so much pressure on my wife to finish the nursery AND I‚Äôm glad the nursery is done.  My wife is a designer and an amazing painter with a great eye.  Our nursery is fantastic, but man did I hound her the whole second trimester to get moving and finish it.  It put a strain on our relationship and when I think about it, I was displacing my anxiety about a baby (I‚Äôm going to be responsible for another person forever and I‚Äôm freaking out!!) on my wife and a room.  I was taking her slow steady pace and indecision as a lack of urgency and then conflating that with her not taking the pregnancy and baby seriously.  ‚ÄúLike who cares what shade of peach it is, we need to get this done because that thing could fall out of you at any minute and you aren‚Äôt going to want to paint anymore when it‚Äôs here!  Just pick one! OHMY GOD!‚Äù ‚Äìon the inside.  On the outside I was just moody and dismissive.  To her credit she still loves me even after I was such an ass.  Babies don‚Äôt go in the nursery for 6 months and I didn‚Äôt really realize that until this week.  If I had it to do over again I‚Äôd have put a guest bed in there instead of a crib so one of us can tag off and get some uninterrupted sleep while the baby sleeps in the bassinet next to our bed.  It is, however, nice to have a finished nursery.  It's better to have it done that to live in fear of not completing it.  

I wish I knew that when my wife says ‚Äúthis thing hurts‚Äù or ‚Äúthis thing is swollen‚Äù or ‚Äúthis other thing is so tired‚Äù, she needs support and love, even if she says it all day, every day.  A pain/problem shared is one cut in half.  I think I‚Äôm pretty good about knowing when to say ‚Äúthat must be hard‚Äù and ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a solution‚Äù but it turns out, after the 40th ‚Äúthat must be hard‚Äù, I start to just angrily fire off solutions.  What I should have said was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, that must be hard, what can I do to help‚Äù and **Meant It**.  I did do that a lot, but not as much as I should have.  What I think we did right was talk about it and tried to focus on gratitude a lot, and that seemed to change the negativity spiral and reset things.  I wish we had ended each night with what we were grateful for.

We did not sleep almost the whole time we were in the hospital.  There are teams of people working on mom and the baby, there are records people, cleaning people, photographers, car seat people, hospitalists, and food delivery people and none of them are organizing or coordinating with each other (as far as I could tell).  So someone walked into our room every 30 minutes or so, even with do not disturb signs up and promises that no one will walk into our room.  This forced us to leave the hospital a day early.  I wish I had known that we would barely sleep the whole time in the hospital and it would have a terrible effect on my wife.  

I‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt really do a birth plan.  Our plan was to be flexible and easy and to trust the people around us.  The college intern that was watching her first birth was by far the most helpful person of the 30+ people we saw that day.  She couldn‚Äôt have been more personally helpful to my wife and I, going as far as taking pictures for us and constantly getting us extra things and stuff.  We had thought about saying no interns and no ancillary unneeded people but it worked out great.

I wish I had brought a hang-on-the-top of the door set of hooks thingy.  There was no place to hang anything!

I am so glad we did a few other things that really paid off.  

My wife bought a gown that opened in the back and the shoulder straps had snaps.  It‚Äôs meant to wear instead of a hospital gown and it was a life saver.  She was 1000 times more comfortable in that than the first gown they had her put on.

I‚Äôm so glad I brought my own pillow.

I‚Äôm so glad I brought a bunch of collapsible bags with us and filled them with all the supplies from the Hospital.  

I‚Äôm so glad I brought my own cooler of snacks, although the hospital cafeteria was pretty great.

I‚Äôm so glad I brought a power strip with a long cord.  There were almost no extra plugs so it was hard to opportunity charge my wife‚Äôs phone when she wasn‚Äôt using it.  Plugging in a power strip for our phones was a huge help and allowed my wife to distract herself while in bed.

I was so glad I got her foot prints on a keepsake, on top of the official paperwork, when they printed her feet.  

I wish I had read more of documents and pamphlets they give you in the hospital, especially the aftercare stuff for my wife.  There were a bunch of ‚ÄúYou should sleep on your stomach on top of a pillow the first night‚Äù kind of things we didn‚Äôt read until days later.  I also should have taken more notes in the hospital because the staff just fire off ‚Äúyou should _____‚Äù stuff all day and half of it doesn‚Äôt sink in. 

I‚Äôm glad I kept saying ‚ÄúLet me say back to you what you just said to me so we make sure I heard your right‚Äù over and over because sometimes, that isn‚Äôt what she meant at all and I was going to do the wrong thing.  This was important for me to do with my wife, and especially with the Hospital staff. 
Sometimes I would parrot back what they said they were going to do or what my expectation should be and then end it with ‚Äúand what should I do if that doesn‚Äôt happen/you don‚Äôt do that‚Äù and as long as I got all the tone out of my voice I got some really good answers.  It helped me manage my own expectations and helped my wife do the same thing.


I know this will apply to none of you but I‚Äôm so glad I did this. I brought a huge hear shaped box of candy and some scratch and sniff valentine‚Äôs day cards because she was induced the night before valentine‚Äôs day and I knew we‚Äôd be there all that day.  I gave out cards to all the staff whenever someone new came in the room.   I gave out 30 individual valentine‚Äôs day cards on just that day and ran out that night in the postpartum room. I was surprised how many different people came into the room we gave birth in.

I‚Äôm so glad we bought a used soft side bassinet for when we got home.  We got a Halo Swivel Sleeper second hand for $100 and it‚Äôs so worth it.  Not having to sit up to lift the baby over the side was invaluable for the first week while my wife healed.  It‚Äôs also nice to move out of the way to get out of bed.


I wish I had cleared out all the stuff from her bed side table before we got home.  That book that she‚Äôs been kind of reading for a year, the fit bit manual and box, the positive pregnancy test; all of it could be somewhere else in the house.  That drawer is for Lanolin, snacks, pads, depends, medicine, wipes, thermometers and nose suckers.  She and the baby spent the first few days in the bedroom and I wasn‚Äôt prepared for it.  

For me, Onzies make changing the diaper so easy and we change the diaper like 15 times a day.  I watched a ton of mommy blogs that were all about the zipper footie pajamas and when I try to use them they are so hard to put on and such a pain to change diapers in.    

I‚Äôm glad I learned the flaps on the shoulders of a onzie are for gripping and pulling the onzie down over the whole body of the baby, instead of undoing the snaps on the crotch.  This is in case you have a soiled onzie you don‚Äôt want to drag over your baby‚Äôs head.  

I wish I had not washed all the clothes we received as gifts in dreft and left them with the tags on.  There‚Äôs a ton of shit we would be returning or won‚Äôt be using and it‚Äôs all washed and folded and kind of worthless now.  

I am grateful I bagged up a bunch of ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù crock pot meals in Freezer bags ahead of time.

I‚Äôm glad we set up a second diaper changing station on the pack and play in the living room.  It makes it easier to relax at the end of the day and watch some tv, instead of constantly having to run up stairs/to another room.  I just need to start remembering to restock it at the end of every night.

I was surprised that I took the first week off work and got nothing I planned on done.  Like, I had a few projects and I got none of them done because I spent all my time just supporting my wife and the baby.  This is a good thing; my expectations were the problem.

I wish I had known that the first few days, the sound of my daughter‚Äôs cries would have such a startling effect on me when asleep/drifting off.  Like the ‚ÄúI forgot to do the project and its due tomorrow‚Äù stomach lurch that sets you bolt upright in bed.


I think that my wife would add that the ‚Äúbreast friend‚Äù breast feeding pillow strap on thingy is amazing and made life much easier.  It was hard for her to get into a position to breastfeed comfortably and the urgency and stress that comes from not knowing how to do it quite perfectly and that a screaming baby is hungry makes you rush and concentrate on the latch, but then realize that you are in a shitty position or uncomfortable or you forgot the Lanolin just out of reach or your cellphone is on the other side of the bed.  This thing made it easy to throw all that stuff into the pocket, strap it on and then feed.  We had/have a boppy which is kind of for the same thing but it just didn‚Äôt work well.  The third day the Breast friend arrived and things have been better.  


My baby‚Äôs butt loves AD ointment.  I wish we had purchased some sooner.


I wish I had known how expensive diapers are.  We got a ton at the shower and we quickly ran out of newborn sized diapers (they have a stripe where it tells you it‚Äôs wet! What a time to be alive) and I was flabbergasted at how expensive they are (I got that diaper money! I got that diaper money!)


I was surprised how fast the cord fell off and how, in my weakened emotional state, this would be like a punch in the gut, imagining her off to college the next day.  


Finally, I‚Äôm glad my expectation about sex were well managed ahead of time.  I had a tough time with wanting to have sex through the second half of the pregnancy.  My wife is so attractive and sexy and I want to take her in a rough and aggressive way, but it was hard to see her as my sex toy when there was a baby inside of her.  She had no sex drive the second half, so it wasn‚Äôt a huge issue.  We cuddled and were physically close daily but it never turned into sex.  My wife warned me that she will be in no shape for sex after birth for quite some time.  I was so surprised how veraciously my appetite for sex flooded back after we got home from the hospital.  It‚Äôs been mildly challenging for me to manage and I‚Äôm glad we had conversations about it well ahead of time so my expectations weren‚Äôt making it worse.  


To summarize:

I wish I had

* Been more patient and supportive

* Not worried about the nursery

* Put a bed in the nursery instead of a crib

* Known we wouldn‚Äôt sleep at the hospital

* Brought some hooks to the hospital

* Known how uncomfortable the birthing beds are.

* Not taken the tags off anything

* Owned more onzies

* Owned a breastfriend

* Used AD ointment more

* Not made plans to get stuff done on paternity leave

* Researched diaper costs

* Known how startling my baby‚Äôs cries would be

* Cleaned out the bedside table for my wife.

I‚Äôm so glad we:

* Brought to the hospital our own:

 *	Pillow

 * 	Food
 * 	Gown
 * 	Keepsake for foot prints
 * 	Extra bags
 * 	Extension cord

* 	Parroted things back to people.
* 	Asked ‚Äúwhat happens next/if that doesn‚Äôt happen‚Äù
* 	Didn‚Äôt do a birth plan
* 	Had a good basinet 
*   got a breastfeeding pillow
* 	Talked about sex


I had a lot of fun writing this and it's nice to really be grateful for such an easy birth and baby.  I hope you have the same!"

avhk1g,75,2019-02-27,Rant: Dangerous 'tech',MookieMoonn,VetTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/avhk1g/rant_dangerous_tech/,"I want to just rant and get this mostly off my chest. I work at a GP in a smaller town. This issue is infuriating and I'm very disappointed about how my management and head doctor dealt with this person. I feel like the are acting on the situation too late. But maybe something big will come of it after having 80% of all our staff (Doctors, techs, assistants, CSRs and kennel assistants) behind on the complaints with this person, as well as clients coming in and saying that they would like to have said tech NEVER touch or work with their animals. That alone should have been a red flag for this person.

But atlas, my team and I and the doctors are working to make sure something happens to prevent this tech (let's call her Z) from harming any animals or giving the wrong advise this week, so a solution is working. She has been working at my practice for about 6 months, labeled as a technician, but doesn't quite have the skills for it. And I just learned that she had only taken the tech cert test, and had not done anything else for the program.

However, here's a list of what Z has done:

- left a sedated dog, alone in a kennel with a muzzle on to go work on paperwork that could have waited

- gave the wrong medication to the wrong dog (Gave baytril instead of hydromorphone)

- gave the wrong pre med to the wrong dog (She got EXTREMELY lucky the dogs were similar sizes)

- Went over blood work results without speaking to a doctor or really knowing what the values meant (happened twice now)

- Gave the wrong advise that could have harmed a staff pet (Told her to feed when we needed the dog to fast) and then turned around a blantly lied to the head technician about it

- Taking charge and not providing our interns with the correct information. She was not approved to be teaching the interns anything.

- Threw a fit, tossing slides, pens, paper and stomping out of lab after being asked to take a room. Like a toddler. Then being so frustrated that she stormed in and announced that she was going to bring in a possible parvo dog through the building just to do a test. Huge no no for us, and threw another fit when someone told her no.

- Scheduling inappropriately (slang and timing) as well as after hours appointments without speaking to a doctor 1st (An after hour at home euthanasia on a weekend) 

- General inappropriate behavior, from the attitude mentioned above, to jumping on staff (like for a piggy back ride) and hugging, touching and pushing 'for fun' or she's just playing. Something that's ok if it's ok with the other person. But personally, she has chest pumped me out of nowhere and constantly points out my breast size. She is also loudly and inconsiderate of families dealing with an loss it getting bad news. And most importantly she is unable to take criticism. It's either a joke or she cries. She is also cocky, and over confident, especially ready to announce herself as head tech or act as if she's protected from repercussions because she's known the owner for her whole life.

This all has happened with in the last couple months, most in the last couple weeks. I know some of my higher ups are upset have spoken to her, but she either cries or gets defensive. Despite this, I and other staff members do not trust her with any of our animals or with our clients animals. We are short staffed, but we are not that short staffed to keep her around in my opinion.

We work in a small town so it's a small world and it feels like if my manager let's her go, she fears that Z will take shit about the hospital. Z works at the local grill and seems  to know everyone. Which honestly is a childish thing that a hospital that has been in town for 15 years and has won awards for years could withstand. 

Working solutions are suspension, retraining and down grading her to a level 1 vet assistant (only wellnesses and vx) or letting her go if she is not willing to work on herself.

What deepens the frustration is the fact that i know that if it were me, I would have been fired for a fraction of this. And I had been written up for one mistake that didn't actively place an animal in harm's way (Gave a probiotic at the wrong time) and she hasn't gotten one. Just stern talking tos by multiple people. 

Anyways, that's my rant. Thank you if you read it all, I'm not looking for anything in response, just a vessel to vent to."

I'm a soon-to-be college grad with a BA in Psych, and I've been trying to get a full time job lined up after I graduate in HR. I got plenty of phone interviews, but this is going to be the first in-person interview that I would be participating since going on this after-college job hunt (meeting with the company's HR Director). I just have a few questions on how I should fully prepare myself for this interview and any tips would be greatly appreciated.

I have a HR assistant internship lined up for my last quarter of school, but I didn't list it on my resume as I haven't started the internship yet, should I bring this up during the interview?

Also, I have made plans to get my aPHR  certification at the end of April, should I also tell them? (any suggestions on how I can prepare for this exam would be greatly appreciated as well; currently have a study book for PHR that I bought from Amazon, and I have some quizlet aPHR sets on my phone as well)

This position was originally supposed to be filled right now (from my understanding), but I was very transparent with the company that I would not be able to start full time until I graduate. I fully expected them to dismiss my application after telling them this during my phone interview, but a week later they are saying they want to interview me for ""June start date."" Does this potentially mean that they do have interest in me for this position, or should I not have my hopes up? 

Excuse me for this long post, I'm just quite nervous and excited for this interview! Thanks for reading! "

My loans are coming out of the grace period soon and would like some help developing a plan to pay both the private and federal loans down. I am a new RN and will make about 60-70k after my internship ends.

**Loans:**

* Sallie Mae: $21,625.41 @ 9.875%
* Nelnet 1: $3,595.96 @ 3.40%
* Nelnet 2: $4,645.32 @ 3.86%
* Nelnet 3: $2,395.89 @ 3.86%
* Nelnet 4: $5,592.36 @ 4.66%
* Nelnet 5: $5,581.44 @ 4.29%
* Nelnet 6: $4,000.00 @ 3.76%
* Nelnet 7: $3,712.10 @ 3.76%
* Nelnet 8: $2,596.74 @ 4.45%


For the federal loans, I've looked into a 25-year term payment plan to lower the minimum monthly payment and putting extra money into the higher rate ones.  The Sallie Mae loan is my biggest concern since it has such a high rate. I believe refinancing might be the move. Would it be better to refinance just the Sallie Mae loan or all of them into one? Any financial institutions I should look into for refinancing?

Thank you for your time!

Paige Hansen, V/O: ‚ÄúI have always dreamt of being a Doctor, ever since my mother was killed by a Doctor. I wish see could see me now, but she was born blind.‚Äù

She approaches 2 nurses, standing at a work station:

Paige: ‚ÄúHey Stereotypes, what‚Äôs the hot Gos?‚Äù

Nurse 1: ‚ÄúDid you hear, there is a hot new Doctor in the artificial insemination Lab‚Äù

Paige: ‚ÄúWell I can‚Äôt worry about male type people; I have to complete my residency to make my dead mother proud of me‚Äù

*Que Slow motion entrance of Dr Sex pants, wearing very tight pants*

Dr Sex Pants: ‚ÄúGreetings stereotypes, I am new here, I am Dr Stephen‚Äôs. Can you direct me to the fertility clinic?‚Äù

Stepping up to the bed, is a young scruffy looking cocky doctor.

Lee: ‚Äúflu shots. Because its flu season‚Äù

Tammy and Karem both: ‚Äúooohhh‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Paige giggles: ‚ÄúPaige Sex Pants‚Ä¶‚Äù

*An orderly, runs to the table, in a rush*

Orderly: ‚Äúcan anyone here swim?‚Äù

Tammy: ‚Äúare you a Doctor?‚Äù

Orderly: ‚Äúwhat? No‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Tammy: ‚Äúbye Felicia‚Äù

Paige: ‚Äúwhy do you need someone to swim?‚Äù

Sits forward excitedly:

Paige: ‚ÄúDid a boat capsize? Do you need a doctor to go do rescues on the water?‚Äù

Orderly: ‚Äúwhat? No that‚Äôs ridiculous. That‚Äôs what the coast guard does‚Äù

Paige: ‚Äúhas a kindergarten class gone swimming and they need rescued at a pool?‚Äù

Orderly: ‚Äúthere are life guards for that! We have a highly infections patient. She is only 7, She is in a sealed quarantine room. A pipe burst and now the room is flooding. It has shorted out the controls for the doors. We need someone to crawl through the duct work and get to her before its to late‚Äù

Karem stands with a look of determination in his eye.

Karem: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù

Karem, ever so determined: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vaccinated‚Äù

The Med students run to the sealed quarantined room. It is filling with water. It is already almost to the top of the girl‚Äôs bed. She curls up on the bed with her teddy bear, obviously scared

Doctor Sex Pants is there, trying to comfort her.

Maintenance workers mill about

Dr Sex Pants: ‚Äúwhy haven‚Äôt you turned of the water yet?‚Äù

Maintenance worker 1: ‚ÄúHey man, its break time. Union rules. Come on‚Äù

Maintenance worker 2: ‚Äúalso why are you here? Should you be in planned parenthood?‚Äù

Dr Sex Pants: ‚ÄúThis is my niece. Her parents are both dead. And her grandparents. And her great grandparents. I am all she has left. That why I asked she come here for treatment.‚Äù

*Dr Sex Pants looks at Paige, with a look of knowing and intensity*

Dr Sex Pants: ‚Äúwe have all lost somebody‚Äù

Paige, taken back by his handsomeness: ‚Äúhi‚Äù

Dr Sex Pants: ‚Äúsomebody do something!‚Äô

*Karem, stepping up. Climbs a ladder up passed the ceiling tile and begins to crawl across. They immediately break as they are not meant to bear any weight what so ever.*

Karem writhes on the floor, holding his knee from the impact of the fall covered in debris of ceiling tiles

Karem, hurt: ‚Äúthey do it in the movies‚Äù

By now Dr Sex Pants is pacing.

Dr Sex Pants: ‚ÄúI know she can swim. I am not worried about that. But when did she eat last?‚Äù

Nurse 1: ‚Äú29 minutes ago‚Äù

Everyone is disturbed by this revelation

Dr Sex pants: ‚ÄúShe could get a cramp‚Äù

Maintenance worker 1: ‚Äúits 30 minute after eating you can swim. Not 29. Not 29!‚Äù

Tammy runs away crying

Tammy: ‚Äúmy maternal instincts. my maternal instincts!‚Äù

Paige, again shaking her head, coming out of the daze of seeing Dr Sex Pants again

Paige: ‚ÄúI can swim‚Äù

She repositions the ladder. She climbs up over the glass partition and drops in to the rising water. She collects the young girl and hands her up to Lee who is waiting atop the ladder to pull her out

All are relieved

Standing on one side of the glass, Paige stares at Dr Sex Pants.

Dr Sex Pants: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to thank you‚Äù

Both lean toward the glass separating them from each other. He leans his forehead against it.

Paige with her eyes closed, continues towards it and begins Frenching against the glass

Dr Sex Pants: ‚Äúno‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶‚Äù

She continues Frenching the glass

Dr Sex Pants: ‚Äúno that‚Äôs quarantined... Super dirty‚Ä¶.‚Äù

Frenching intensifies

Dr Sex Pants gags: ‚Äúugh‚Ä¶‚Äù

avitya,2,2019-02-27,Finally successful after beating all the odds,mattlore,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/avitya/finally_successful_after_beating_all_the_odds/,"So I just wanted to talk about this because of how good I feel right now!! It's a long story, but I hope it serves as an inspiration for those who don't quite feel like their lives have clicked yet.

&amp;#x200B;

My story is as follows: I grew up in relative poverty. Living in the low income area of my small, blue collar worker town, being raised by a single, widowed mother. We never had a lot of money, but she always tried her best for me. She would always push and fight to make me into a respectable young man. High school life was somewhat uneventful. I had a small circle of geeky and nerdy friends that I could confide in, and helped me through the hard times like being bullied for my looks, my weight or just my odd mannerisms.

Other than that...I was an average to below average student. My grades weren't the best and sometimes I would just squeek by. But...I graduated and started my life as a working adult.

College never really appealed to me. Since we were so poor, college or university was never much of a discussion with my mother or I, so I just spent the next couple of years working ""Low skill"" jobs (fast food, call centers, parking garages, etc). I wasn't earning a ton of money, but it was fine for me.

It was also during this time that I started dating a friend from high school. We eventually moved out of my mom's house and into our own apartment. Money was tight, but we made it by all the same.

Things seemed to be going great for the next 6 years...That is until one day, she told me that she was done with me. Just out of the blue, that she didn't find me attractive anymore, that I was a failure in life, that I would never amount to anything and that she was sick of me...So she left.

Needless to say I was heart broken...I even tried suicide after that, thinking that what she said was true. Obviously I didn't succeed and after some pondering and soul searching, my depression and sadness turned to pure spite. I hated everything she did to me. I hated that she tore me asunder like she did. So I vowed to become more successful in life than she could ever hope to be.

I began researching colleges outside of my small town. At first I couldn't figure out what to apply for, but then I remembered that I was really good with computers, even being an ""on call"" IT guy for friends, family and co-workers to make a bit of dosh on the side. So I decided to go out for a CS, systems admin degree. 

I applied, dropped my $80 fee and crossed my fingers.

After they reviewed my high school transcript, they told me I would have to drive down there (3 hours) to take a math test as I didn't have grade 12 math credit and it was required for the test...Fuck...I hadn't done ANYTHING like that in the past 7 years since graduating and math was my worst subject. So...I begged my best friend (Who lived in the apartment above me) to tutor me in math.

Every night when I got home from work, he would come down, tutor me for 2-3 hours, assign me homework, and I would do said homework at my call center job inbetween calls. Lord was it exausting...But the day came for the test, and both of us drove 3 hours to the college, I took the test...And PASSED!! I was over the moon! I was going to be starting college in the next 4 months!

Though a new problem arose...I would need to get money together to move out. I had 0 savings, but the silver lining was that my work had wide open overtime...So I started working 14 hour shifts 5 days a week, for 3 months. I nearly killed myself with stress...But at the end of the day. I saved up enough for my first and last month rent on my new place...And I was off.

Fast forward the 3 years I was in college.

It was grulling, hard work that required me at one time to work 2 unpaid internships in IT AND work part time at a restaurant to make bill payments...But at the end of the 3 years, I graduated and ended up getting a job at an IT startup thanks to my connections from my internships.

It was a good job, but pay was awful...I was barely scraping by and was starting to feel distrought over everything...It was also at this time that everything I had been working for, everything I had sacrificed finally paid off. I got a job offer for a government IT analyst.

To finally end this story off...I'm finally living the life I've always wanted. I'm earning over double what I was earning at my old job, tons of benefits and best of all financial stability. Infact: I'm going on vacation to Japan next month that I've paid all by myself...

It just feels amazing to finally get here. That my 20s were such a time of hardship, sacrifice and the unknown, but now that I'm in my 30s things are finally starting to look up.

Thanks for listening all...And I'm not trying to brag, just happy that finally something good has happened in my life."

avjg3h,1,2019-02-27,"Weird break up with ex (M 22) happened over a month ago, only now the anger starting to hit me (F 21).",kiwi2108,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/avjg3h/weird_break_up_with_ex_m_22_happened_over_a_month/,"We were together for 2 years, from the time I was 18 and just met him at college until just after my 21st birthday. We had a complicated relationship, sometimes living 1 mile away, sometimes 50, and sometimes 6,000. He was an exchange student and we dated for one year at my university until he went back home and we broke up as we weren't going to see each other again, until he told me he was coming back to my country for an internship and we got back together soon after. After his internship we did long distance for a little bit and then I went to his country to study abroad at his university. We had a lot of problems in the last 6 months of our relationship, from him talking to other girls, to him saying he wants to be with other people, him having crushes on to my knowledge at least 2 other girls during the course of those last months. It was hell, he broke my heart so many times but I felt like I couldn't live and be abroad without him so I tried my best to keep us together. After we spent a week apart he came back and told me he was wrong and that he needs me etc. From that moment our relationship was pretty stable for the last 2-2.5 months or so but I still didn't trust him. He only did what he wanted and was selfish and didn't listen to me and would lie all the time. It was hell for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

When finally the time came for me to go back home, I started to feel like I was looking forward to leaving, while I was a bit sad since we had had a relatively healthy relationship other than the last couple months and I would miss the good moments, after I walked away from him I felt relieved. No longer did I have to care if he was talking to that girl or what he was saying about me, after I last saw him I didn't think I would contact him for a couple months, but lo and behold he texted me only a couple hours later. He basically said how sad he was and how much he was missing me, how he lost his best person etc, essentially all the things he should have known and realized and appreciated during our actual relationship, he asked to call and we did, he called me everyday for the next 4 days until I told him I couldn't do this, he was treating me like his girlfriend and it wasn't healthy. He was going on a trip to my fathers home country the next month so I promised beforehand I would help him with information for his travels but that's the only reason I will contact him. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went a couple weeks without talking and when we have talked it has only been about his travels. He has been on this crazy trip backpacking since I said goodbye to him and he will return back home in about 3 weeks. I can already feel things will be different when he gets home, he will be graduating university and then moving to a new city to start a new job working 8 am to 8 pm. He used me always as his emotional support/ therapist during the relationship and I know he will try and contact me and probably vent about his stresses to me (because I am the only one he can tell because he doesn't want to seem weak to his friends :/) Anyway I don't know what to do, I unfollowed his instagram but not blocked, and I muted his text chat, not blocked and we are still friends on facebook. A part of me wants to block him on everything, he can't see my life and I can't see his, but the soft side of me says no, be friends, he was important to you and will always be, but a part of me says fuck that him, he played me and treated me like trash and doesn't deserve my kindness. I have been so mad especially these last couple days, so mad I just need to punch a wall or hit something, I feel like such a bitter person, I hate it. I am left with a couple options, don't block him just move on but possibly see something of his come up or be tempted to check something and then be triggered, block him and have a calmer peace of mind but set a tone of tension, curse him out/ tell him how mad you are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me what I can do to get him out of my head, I met someone new who I quite like but I feel like I can't focus on him when I have this hatred inside me. thanks everyone

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: hate my ex and don't know how to interact with him going forward, just want to feel better. "
avjg81,3,2019-02-27,"Do I go on an internship abroad, or do I wait till I'm more stable?",thatlundgirl,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/avjg81/do_i_go_on_an_internship_abroad_or_do_i_wait_till/,"Long story short, I have an opportunity to travel to Sweden and do an internship in a publishing company. It's an amazing opportunity, and every time I think about it I get giddy with excitement. It'll change my life, probably. It'll be an experience I'll never get again, as I'm a second year student at university. 

 I can go for a minimum of 2 months--no less than that. I'm not sure whether I should wait until next summer, after I graduate from university (the university will help with funding for up to 12 months after graduation), or just do it this summer. My original plan was to go for a couple of months this summer and longer after I graduate, in the hopes that I will be offered a job. If I go this summer, I will get a taste of Sweden and publishing in Sweden beforehand, which will inform my judgement of how long I will be mentally able to stay in Sweden after I graduate depending on how I fare this summer. I've never been to Sweden before. 

However, there are a few things I'm really worried about. I've only been abroad once before, and I was thirteen. I have social anxiety and have episodic depression. Despite my learning, I'm not yet fluent in Swedish. I've read about Sweden and Swedish people so much, it's ridiculous, and most people say that it's very hard to make friends with Swedes because of their reserved nature, and it's even harder to fit into their society, as the cultural differences between Sweden and Britain are quite big. I'm not that good at making friends anyway, but to do so in a new country? That'll be very hard. I've also never lived all by myself--I live away from home with my friends, but they've become like a second family, and I do find it hard to be away from my family for so long. I guess my biggest concern is what will happen if I don't make any friends and I'm all alone for 60 days in another country, surrounded by a language I'm not fluent in. If it happens, I know, I just *know*, I will have a breakdown. But I don't want my mental health to hold me back. I desperately want to go, and my gut is telling me I need to. My parents have suggested that I don't go this summer, and save up some money and wait till after I graduate, but then I'm going to be even more anxious about it. 

What do I do? Do I forget all my anxieties and just get myself out there? Or do I just wait?"
avjt72,1,2019-02-27,[Help] Considering getting my first dog (German Shepherd),balenosaurus,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/avjt72/help_considering_getting_my_first_dog_german/,"Hi everyone, 

I have always wanted to raise a German Shepherd but was waiting for when I would be able to make money to support it. I am about to go on a 16-month internship and I was wondering if this would be a good time to get one. 

Here are some details I was considering as well as some questions related to them (italicized):

1. **Hours I will be away from home:** This job will be full-time but the mandatory hours to be at work is from 10-3 (with a lunch break) and then I can return to work later to complete the remaining 2.5 hours. I was thinking that I could wake up at 7:30 and walk/run with the dog for 1-2 hours, go to work, come back for lunch break, come back at 3 to walk the dog again, and return to work. I will be living close by so this is not a problem. *Will this schedule be sufficient such that the dog does not get lonely?*
2. **Living in an apartment:** I've read a lot about whether or not GSDs are suited for the apartment lifestyle. From my research, it seems that it is fine as long as you ensure they get the proper amount of exercise every day. I am happy to spend 4 hours a day outside with my dog. *Other than that, are there other considerations that I should make? Do they (GSDs) have a tendency to bark a lot?*
3. **After internship:** As I am currently a student, I will be returning to school following my internship. I go to school in the city and I am most likely going to take my dog with me. I feel that raising a dog will be easier as I can schedule my courses so that I can frequently go home. After graduating, I will most likely be moving close to wherever I work, and my parents can possibly help me with walks.
4. **Breeder vs Rescue**: I am open to either of the two options. I have been searching for reputable breeders my area and have been looking at adoption websites. I am looking to adopt a 1-3 year old GSD if it's the latter option. I know that it can be difficult to adopt a dog as a first-time dog owner due to the vetting process. *Would it be similarly difficult if I choose to buy from a breeder? Should I be concerned about behavioural issues if I adopt an older dog from a rescue? (Will it be hard for a first-time dog owner to help correct these issues?) If I buy from a breeder, it means I will be raising a puppy. Realistically, how difficult would this be more me?*

These are the main topics I was considering. Are there any other details I should be concerned with? Most importantly, do you feel that this is not the right time? (If possible, please let me know the reasons why.) Although I do want a dog, it's more important to me that they can grow up healthy and happy."
avmeyp,1,2019-02-27,"Cheap server for learning about networking and security, and with the ability to expand later on to use it for machine learning",aryzach,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/avmeyp/cheap_server_for_learning_about_networking_and/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

For now, I just want to be able to install Ubuntu and practice networking and security. I'll be using my 7 year old Mac Air for the monitor and keyboard. I'd like to be able to run VMs, build a Kali box, learn simple things like how to SSH, and practice programming. I was planning on using the Ubuntu Server distro. Eventually, I'd also like to be able to grow this into something for machine learning (GPU down the road). I don't do any gaming. 

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Ideally fairly cheap, but upgradable. $200-400

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Now

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

Just a small tower. No OS, monitor, keyboard, mouse

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

United States, and no, but I'll be flying to a city with one soon.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

2012ish Mac Air

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No, unless I feel super confident later doing machine learning stuff

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

hard drive and SSD. Im interested in RAID

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

ideally small and nothing flashy

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

no

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

I have a million questions, but I feel like the best way to learn this stuff is just to go for it. For example, do I need a usb port to install Ubuntu, or can I just somehow connect with my mac to install it? Do I need to manually connect, or can I do it through Wifi?  Here's a comment I left on another post to get a sense of where I'm coming from:

     hey I'm in almost the same boat as this. I landed an internship in networking and security. I've taken 2 programming classes (in C and python using IDE), but basically knew nothing about the net/sec side of computers before this. Now I'm busting my ass (mostly reading and watching videos) trying to catch up so I'm not totally lost when I'm trying to follow along in conversations. I currently have a mac laptop, and want to build a linux computer to practice these concepts, and get into capture the flag and pen testing like you mentioned. The only difference is that I don't game. What has been your experience learning this stuff, and any advice for somebody who's just starting? How do you like your build?
     side note, here's a list of things I knew absolutely nothing about before, but have read about and started to learn about since (and concepts I'd like to practice on the linux computer I build): SSH, VM, ubuntu, kali box, Cuckoo, XWIN, TCP/IP, NATs, DNS, DHCP, packet switching, firewalls, TLS, command line, PowerShell, tcpdump, wireshark, Snort, Splunk, BRO, write blocker, tunneling, UDP, ICMP, GET request, etc. I only had a vague idea of what a server was.
     I have almost no storage space left on my computer, and it's 7 years old. Ideally, I'd like to build a pc, and just use my laptop to connect to it right now. Any advice is appreciated!

I'm not going with this persons build because they game, and have slightly different needs, and it costs a bit more"

Then 3 months ago, I [passed P exam](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/9xfsu3/i_passed_p_exam/)! And started studying FM exam.

And finally couple days ago, I passed the exam! (and caught a cold so I was suffering through that past couple days)

&amp;#x200B;

As for my study method, I used Marcel B. Finan's  [**A Basic Course in the Theory of Interest and Derivatives Markets: A Preparation for the Actuarial Exam FM/2**](https://faculty.atu.edu/mfinan/actuarieshall/mainf.pdf) for this exam. But as many people pointed out, there were many changes to the Exam FM that I had to basically skip half of the pdf and study the study materials given by SOA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I guess I gotta start prepping for job applications and resume. I planned to find a job before this exam, but things didn't go as planned... If anyone's got some tips on that, that would be great! Any resource regarding internships or entry-level positions would be amazing as well. As always, I'm so thankful for all of you guys and your advice (even the ones that told me to quit and find some other jobs).  


**tl;dr:** I passed the FM and P exams and now moving on to finding some jobs

I am wondering if it‚Äôs possible to prepare for CFA level 1 December exam along with doing a full time MBA course. 

I am in India, so any particular advice from someone who has experienced Indian MBA colleges the like of IMT or SIIB (symbiosis) Pune. This would be my starting year of MBA and I have heard that the first couple of semesters are especially hectic and you rarely get anytime to do anything else. 

I am from an engineering background with BTech in Computer Science. I am done with all my interviews for admission so basically I have around 3-4 months completely free which I can devote to studying for CFA, but still since the exam is in December I would need to continue the preparation well into first semester of MBA. 

My plan is that if I clear CFA level 1 in December, then it would be a big advantage for me when I go for internship in summer of 2020, after 1st year of MBA. But I don‚Äôt want to take on it, if it negatively impacts either my MBA grades or chances of clearing CFA. 

And since 1 USD = 72 INR, giving level 1 of CFA costs around 80k INR (includes both exam fee and registration fee), so it‚Äôs not a decision I can take lightly. 

Sorry for the long post, but would really appreciate some advice on it. 

Thanks

She demeans me in front of co-workers and acts like I'm an idiot. She tells others I'm an idiot. Now, they have started treating me like an idiot. I have only been working there for six months. I just can't take it anymore. Sometimes, I think she is right. I make too many mistakes. If I look for a new job then I have to give  up my career that I have invested a lot of years and time in my career. My industry is very small so I can't just move to another company. Also, I have just moved to a new country so don't really have contacts to network with. Another obvious reason I'm having problems is because I'm in a new country and procedures are different here.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep telling myself to keep my head down and just keep working and learning, but man, this week was the worst. She is  the worst. I had a breakdown and told my boss. Now, my boss wants me to tell her everything, but if the girl  or her friends find out they will make me a target and make my life hell. I need this job. I'm going to keep my mouth shut and keep working. If they act like I'm an idiot and treat me like one, I just have to take it.

My parents are running out of money in my home country and keep asking if I have gotten promoted yet. I don't have any money. I live in a 10x10 room and I eat as little as I possibly can. I need a hobby or just someone to talk to. I keep imagining what my life would be like if I had money, someone who likes me (not even love me, I will take like over love) and plans things we can do together. It's just going to be amazing.

I just want to add she told me that she wasn't sure why they would hire me. Also, she got her roommate to yell at me because we (my intern and I)  were late on a project. It was embarrassing. My poor intern. She was just trying to be helpful.

I gave my parents a heads up. We went on vacation for christmas (which noone likes except nmom). While we were on vacation visiting my grandparents, theyd bring it up trying to change my mind. 

Little did they know that ever since I was 16 i dreamed of emancipating myself. I graduated college early and i got a job and internship straight out of college. I was in a position to finally be on my own. 

When back from the trip, I started looking into buying my own car and packing. I went over my boyfriends on the new years and stayed until the 2nd. When i got a text saying to be back by noon on the third, i am grounded, and can no longer use the car. Which I started work in two days, so they were trying to screw up my jobs. 

Morning of the third, woke up went to a car dealership and bought a used car. I drove home as fast as i could and got there at 12:15. Nmom was livid that I was late. The first thing that she said was ""why are you late? I made it very fucking clear to be home by noon. Theres no excuse.""

Guys, can i just say, i was 21. Diagnosed with major depressive disorder, ptsd, and generalized anxiety since I was 14 years old. A lot of shit has happened in my life. And i dont believe everything happens for a reason.

 But man, the look on nmoms face when i told her i bought a car was fucking priceless. Easily one of the best moments of my entire life. 

I packed all my stuff and moved out the same day. Talk about stressful!

Flash forward a year, and im in a whole different state. So free. Yet i find myself longing for their acceptance. I so desperately want to feel loved by my parents. I want to fill this void. Yet everytime I reach out (always me that reaches out) I find myself disappointed, but not surprised. 

I feel like its toxic for me to keep reaching out to them because i always feel like shit after. But i am dying to feel like im good enough for them (but i know i never will be). So im caught up in what i should do.

Everytime i talk to nmom, she talks about herself no matter what. I went on a roadtrip across country for a job interview, and she didnt ask about it. Instead she talked about how many turkeys have been in the backyard or a cat she saw at the humane society. I keep giving them chances to let them into my life. And im getting to the point, where i know its not worth it. As much as i want parental love, they just have none to give me. Just as a young adult, i guess i wish i had a better support system and someone i could always turn to for help. Just sucks sometimes, being alone.

Has anyone who moved out kept in contact with their narcissist? Does anyone feel like their relationship ever improved because of seperation? Is it worth even trying? Ill take any advice i can get. 

Thank you ‚ù§"

I‚Äôm currently a 5th year in pharmacy school. I have two more years to go till graduation. After going on rotation sites and visits, I‚Äôve realized I absolutely hate it and it‚Äôs not something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. However, I had just gotten my intern license and asked my parents for a car to go on rotations and work. Which they gave me. (I know I‚Äôm very lucky and privileged) I get stressed out just thinking about working in a pharmacy and counting pills all day. I also had something really terrible happen to me after this on campus and every time I‚Äôm here, it brings back really bad feelings. I live on campus, and I‚Äôm extremely depressed and miserable here. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my parents about going to school for something I was more passionate in and maybe transferring. But they won‚Äôt hear any of it. And said that it was my decision to go to pharmacy school and they had nothing to do with it. Which I think is complete bullshit. I want to leave, but I know for certain that my parents won‚Äôt support me and they constantly hang the fact that they gave me a car over my head. I would really like to spend the summer back at home, away from campus, and maybe finding something I‚Äôm passionate about. But my parents are really adamant on me staying on my miserable campus, working my miserable job, to work my miserable job to pay to live on my miserable campus because I asked for a car. And they call me selfish for changing my mind. I really want to give the car back, but they shipped it across the country costing $1000 dollars. 

I know this a huge responsibility and I think I would normally suck it up but, I feel like my happiness and my future are more important than this. 

Am I being a really big baby about this? What should I do? "

This semester, I am taking EECS 3311 and two other 3000 level EECS courses. According to my current projection, at the end of this semester, my EECS and MATH GPA will be below the requirement needed to get into the Lassonde co-op program.

Being an international student, I would need a co-op/internship work permit to work during the fall-winter session. Lassonde issues it to students who are in their co-op program.

My plan for summer 2019 is to undertake personal projects and build my portfolio because so far I have spent most of my time only doing coursework. I have not done anything besides that. I will start applying to companies on my own for the fall-winter session. I haven't shortlisted where to apply though yet.

My main question is if I am not a part of the Lassonde co-op program and hence I won't have a work permit issued to me via Lassonde, does that mean I will have no chance to get an offer/interview from any company to where I apply to? Is there any procedure for Lassonde where they help students seeking an internship if they are not a part of their co-op program? Is it a dead-end for me? Please help me guys with any information."

Everyone there is generally overworked and underpaid, and seemingly unhappy, because the vibe the other workers gave off from the get go was a very tense/stressed and awkward one. For example no one says hello or good morning to each other when they get in even though everyone works in one room.  Anyways, beyond the tension felt between my coworkers, the owners have a lot of personal dysfunction that bleeds into the rest of the company and contributes to the bad culture there. 
          I picked up on this a few months in but decided to just stay focused on the work and kick ass. In general it seemed like my boss was happy with my work, but I didn‚Äôt feel valued or like I was getting anywhere there, so I decided to start looking for new jobs and received an offer about a month ago! 
         I started working there part time while finishing up my other job, and the vibe there is totally different. People seem happy and coworkers chat with each other and say good morning to one another. Even though it‚Äôs not my dream job, just being in a better environment is giving me hope. 
          My last day at my old job today was awkward to say the least... between my two week notice and now my ex boss never bothered to have an exit interview with me or even touch base on where I was leaving things or say goodbye. Half my coworkers didn‚Äôt realize it was my last day and despite us having going away lunches for interns they didn‚Äôt have one for me. Also I found out some of my coworkers were bad mouthing me behind my back (one of my coworkers left a chat box open on her computer and I saw she had written something mean about me to another coworker). honestly it just reaffirms that I‚Äôm doing the right thing leaving that place. Now I just have to spend some time recovering from that energy and I‚Äôm really looking forward to going in to work at my new job tomorrow!
Have any of you guys had awkward last days? Or left toxic jobs situations? How did you recover?

I plan to join an accounting society, go to meet the firms, volunteer for VITA, and land an internship at a Big 4.

&amp;#x200B;

My options are: CSU Long Beach, CSU Fullerton, CSU Northridge, SJSU, CALPOLY SLO, UC DAVIS, UC IRIVNE, UC RIVERSIDE, UC SANTA BARBARA

&amp;#x200B;

My top choices are are UCSB &gt; Cal poly &gt; CSU fullerton &gt; UC Davis

&amp;#x200B;

UCSB would be great because they have a great accounting program, but it would be far away from home and rent for apartments would be pretty expensive. I don't mind going to Cal Poly, but I'm not sure how good the accounting program is. CSUF apparently has a good accounting program as well, but it's kind of far away and rent might make a dent in my pocket. All these school are far away and would cause me to pay around $600 - $1000 per month for rent.

&amp;#x200B;

UC Davis is the closest school to me. I can probably live at home with my parents if I attended there. I'm not really sure how strong the accounting program is there. They don't have a beta alpha psi so I'm not sure how much that will affect my process of networking and making connections. Also, they don't have an accounting major. I would have to get a major in managerial economy and minor in accounting. Even when I do that, I would still have to take 3 - 4 accounting classes at a different school (maybe a community college) because they don't offer them.

&amp;#x200B;

The opportunity cost of me going to CSUF, UCSB, or CAL POLY would be being in debt by $10,000 - $20,000, maybe even more (hopefully not). If I went to UC Davis, I can work on my side hustles, live at home, and have a healthy savings account after graduating and not be in debt but I'm not really sure how strong the accounting program is.

Depression and negativity is like an assassin of the soul only somehow it tricks you into wielding the knife into yourself. Torrance was on the edge of giving up. He did not talk to the Cook, in fact as he stood in the Office alone he was not of a mind to talk to anyone. The second Act had penetrated far deeper than he had initially realised despite some hasty earlier rationalisation. Overall he felt more isolated in his suit at that time than he could easily recall since he arrived within the Great Machine of Atlas. If the Great Machine had an off switch he might have been tempted to push that button just to be not.

His journeys had never felt more of a senseless and empty loop. His seconed skin instead of being a marvellous protection from ill things morphed into a barrier he feared to cross a bane to any real connection... 

Even light casts a shadow, everything has a potential negative side and when depression sneaks up on you and hands you that blade to stab into your own heart, shadows of darkness is all you see, it beckons like some ancient light devouring eldritch horror. Yet sometimes when you fall from all sense of inner grace you can only crawl back up from that pit into the warm light of life after you hit the very bottom.

Torrance metaphorically hit bottom, gazing into that monitor - watching the Cook - and thinking about it all again and again. He had come to some decisions of a sort but then had returned despite his own intent to watching the Cook again and that was when it all happened. For a horrible period all he saw whilst that Korvax served up to the new Interns was a dire loop that was going nowhere. He was going nowhere. The laughing Interns already fast comrades with one another became mocking - soon to be corpses - martial suicides in the making, nothing more than lost souls craving to die, yet for all of that desire stuck fast on the wheel of rebirth and doomed instead to live time and time again.

When some of their greatest heroes died they tore themselves asunder as if defiantly casting off incarnation.

For a depressing time all he beheld of the mighty marvel of the Great Machine was a sort of soul trap: A cage of infinity mirrors. No wonder so many seemed insane in here, bent out of shape by ages of captivity. How long had they been doing their eternal gyration to the false music of engineered spheres and never ever getting anywhere that mattered. They were all snared, just as the First Spawn were caught in the cycle of the behaviour of their sick perverse culture of suffering.

What was the point of it all? What reason existed to go on through the everlasting grind? What if he just stopped, as he had stopped short of the loop of going to the Core? What was the point? He repeated again, for that last one cycled in his head as another more intimate loop. What was the point? Then as he hit bottom, he glimpsed something else, another sharper point 'the point of the blade piercing him' - it was the metaphorical dagger the Gek had planted in his back - that Gek had purposely undertook its negative actions for negative results. It had purposely painted an almost blood magic abyss with the viscera of its victims and Torrance belatedly realised he had embraced that blade to leap into that almost sorcerous hellish void.

He had allowed the taint purposely left behind to mar his vision - his sense of reason and purpose his very core of positivity - he had allowed that ill disease beyond his guard, permitting it to fester and grow in his mind. The horror of the bloodletting had been cleared away - the 'Triple V' physically sterilised - all the mess seemingly gone - but not from where it mattered most: Not from deep inside himself - there it had remained - akin to a haunting presence. It was simple cause and effect, action and reaction. Yet belatedly, he appreciated, something different the Interns were not oppressed by the vile demises of their kin and it was not cruel indifference or a lust for oblivion that generated that attitude. He glimpsed something else of why they celebrated even that treacherous massacre almost akin to a victory.

Tonight, as so many other nights, they would gather, eat drink and toast whilst telling their stories in defiance of all the dark endings.

On a good day the Vy'keen did not embrace suicide - what they did was to spit in the eye of fate and oblivion - because they actually cherished every nanosecond of their lives. They did not seek death out to fall into nothingness even though on some level shadow knowledge of their place within the loop clearly oppressed their culture. In truth, they sought death out to wrestle with it to the very best of their martial abilities, to defy it, to make a stand and something grand out of that only seeming ending. 

Nothing really died here, but people were still separated by the cycle of seeming loss for a time. Yet in their minds - their deeds and deaths unified - told in the Sagas they were shared immortal treasures of cultural remembrance that decorated them and defied the entropy of the ages. Those stories far worthier items to hoard and share perhaps than say some mere physical object. In a way they truly carried their glory with them to the next life and beyond - as the Torrance carried the data of those logs for the next iteration: The bright stories of passage.

The Vy'keen were not bound to material things, they were far freer souls than that. 

Death did not end them, nor was it some senseless cycle without meaning not in the moments when they saw true. It was just that shadow before an inevitable new dawn a dark that they refused to let win, even as they perished as all things perish to be reformed if not always in the same configuration. Energy is not lost - it abides - it just recycles as if an ongoing Great Reality Shift update.

As to the KVC, they were still his friends and allies - fighting the same negative things he was - simply in their own esoteric digital mechanical way. Like the Torrances they carried some stains from the ills they opted to combat and the baggage of a long and complicated history but they choose to fight too rather than submit to slavery rather than ignore the perils of Tyrants. To expect otherwise, to expect folk in the fight to be without any sin was unreasonable. Besides, life is all those little imperfections as much as anything else it was the bad not just the good choices, and who could hope to choose true all of the time?

Torrance knew he was not so good.

He saw no perfect way forward, no ideal vector map not even he believed in any religious texts, at the last it came down to you and often a hard knock process of trial and error and you would fall and fail sometimes that was just part of the journey. What mattered was that you picked yourself back up and continued on. Burdens aplenty existed sometimes - seemingly - impossible to carry, especially if you try to bear them too alone, - too isolated - but in the end, in the end, life went on somehow just like the Vy'keen it defied being cast into oblivion every living soul living proof.

""You cannot be a Torrance without Vy'keen Interns.""

He thought he had understood the meaning of that line - he had not. It was too true, without such belated insight without defiant and glorious examples of comradeship in the face of the almighty loop who could hope to go on. For a moment he had only seen the shadow of the light, for a time he had fallen into the dark eye of the abyss.

Now conversely he was wondering if even that Grandmaster Gek might have found a way to escape its past to reach beyond its old loop - its old rut. So far he had seen only another more sophisticated plot, another ruse deeper and more complex but what if that First Spawn had somehow reformed? What if even the dire deeds it did here had in some small manner helped it along the path of redemption - proving at the last to it truly senseless - but in a positive way? Even if the initial intent was all ill and Torrance had almost let the burden of that illness overwhelm him.

Even a reborn First Spawn must hit bottom sometime, and potentially look up to think again. Your culture can be the hardest of all programs to break loose from after all it helps shape your identity of self from your conception it - labels you - but it need not be impossible if you opt to Believe Deeper.

Act Three waited. After Act Two he had almost considered deleting the rest of the file unread. The revelation about the Cook had - as just shown - proved hard work, the dagger planted doing its worst by cutting deep. Things in this story might get even more challenging - before they got better - but then sometimes that is just the dip in the arc when it is 'u' shaped. Only the fallen can pick themselves up and learn from their mistakes. 

Torrance realised he had to go into this mindful neither believing - or disbelieving - he needed to be open to all the possibilities and see them true. "
avqsct,7,2019-02-28,Chances of Interim Secret Clearance with History of Alcohol Abuse,scln,SecurityClearance,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityClearance/comments/avqsct/chances_of_interim_secret_clearance_with_history/,"I recently accepted a tentative offer from DHS/USCIS that requires me to carry a Secret clearance. Because it is offered under a direct hiring authority that is expiring soon the offer is contingent on me securing interim clearance and starting as soon as possible. So, I can't wait for a final adjudication.

My primary issue is that six years ago I was terminated from a law school internship with a local prosecutor's office because I showed up still intoxicated from the night before. I continued to drink afterwards, but have now been completely abstinent from alcohol for more than two years. Moreover, I have been under the continued care of a psychiatrist that specializes in alcohol abuse for the same two years, and I can count on her for a favorable review if contacted. I've read some sources that suggest pretty much any negative disclosure on the SF86, even if mitigated, will prevent an interim clerance from being granted and others that suggest that direct hire positions that need to be filled immediately can get some leniency.

I'm just wondering if anyone has any educated input on my chances of securing an interim clearance."

**1706** citizens *wandering pantless* for **10 years!**  
  
Come closer, children. It is time for me to tell you an ancient legend. That legend is, the Legend of r/eddit. 

A long, long time ago, in a faraway land known as Pantopia, a ruthless king ruled over the people. The king was disliked by many because he had made the people do a terrible thing.... He had made the people wear pants! There were protests by the people, and many battles were fought, but to no avail. Until one day, a pantless legend came out of the shadows. His name - u/RLiamWilloughby. Liam faced the king in his throne room, and after a fight that lasted for 5 days, he was victorious. He became the mayor of the now renamed - **TOWN OF REDDIT** and introduced a law that made pants illegal in the town. The people were happy, and the rest is history.

Now, the town is growing rapidly. New citizens are moving to town [every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/eddit/comments/akwo42/i_live_here_now/), and the town council have gone as far as to set up their [own currency.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eddit/comments/akzdhj/bot_faq/) Anything is possible in this town, from building a huge MANTA ray to trying to become it's mayor. So if you wanna start fresh, maybe r/eddit is for you!
  
I conducted an interview with a couple of city council members, and one of the members happened to be - our resident writer, u/verifypassword__.

&gt; #1. How did you discover r/eddit?

&gt;&gt; **u/verifypassword__** I'm sure I've stumbled across this sub a few times just out of boredom, but I found it after its pantsless renovation by stalking looking at the profiles of some people I used to mod with on another subreddit and just being like ""oh this looks cool"". After lurking on the sub for a bit, I was invited by RPG_Ivan (fellow SubredditOfTheDay mod and all-round cool guy) to mod this sub! ^(and the rest is history)

&gt;&gt; **u/RyMCon3** I misspelled Reddit once, idek how but i came right upon mayor Willoughby's thingy and I was like heeellllll yeah,and from there my character has become a furfucker and librarian. Id like to say that's not me irl, just in r/eddit. And occasionally when browsing other subs I accidentally stay in character... Killing a little bit of my karma, oh well.

&gt; #2. What is r/eddit all about?

&gt;&gt; **u/verifypassword__** This sub is about what you make it. Would you like to get married to a fellow Redditor? We've already got the venue booked to make you r/eddit official. Have a hunch communism could work on this sub? Join the communist revolution! Want to overthrow the mayor? Well, sure you can try. Just want to make an honest living by selling ice? Go ahead!

&gt;&gt; **u/RyMCon3** It's about being an insane wierdo and being a different character inside of this world, separate from the real one. It's a world where you can be anything but hateful and that's kinda magical. Really it's like if you can imagine it, it's a reality. A fake reality but a reality nonetheless. Also i think that's an oxymoron.

&gt; #3. Why should fellow Redditors join r/eddit?

&gt;&gt; **u/verifypassword__** You should join because you can start fresh and reinvent yourself as anything you want to be. Here's an example: outside this sub, you could be the most [notorious reposter](https://www.reddit.com/u/GallowBoob), for example, but when you come to this town, we don't mind - you can become a master of OC. Truly anything is possible in this town.

After busting my ass through the first half of summer semester, I was looking forward to grabbing a couple of drinks on my last night on campus. With a week off before the beginning of the second half, I was going to head home the next day to get my mind off of class and just unwind.

I hated to be *that guy*, but yes, I was at a bar by myself. My friends either went home for the summer or off to internships while I stayed on campus to knock out a few courses so I could graduate a semester early. 

So with the bar unusually quiet (this place turns into a ghost town in the summer), I saddled up at the bar next to a couple of townies and waved to the bartender. She was a good-looking girl, but I had never seen her before.

""Hi there,"" she greeted me with a wide smile. ""What can I get you?""

Usually, I'd just order a bottle of beer, but I was feeling pretty happy, so I thought I'd do something different. Little did I know that I'd utter five words that would change my life forever.

""Surprise me with something good.""

With a smirk, she nodded. ""Oh, I got something I think you'll like.""

She went to work making a drink, and seconds later, a rather fruity-looking drink was sitting on the bar across from me. The townies glanced over toward me and chuckled. 

""What is it?"" I asked.

""It's called Love Potion No. 9. Vodka, peach schnapps and ruby red grapefruit.""

I glared at her from my seat.

""What made you think I'd drink this?""

""Hun, you're at a bar by yourself on a Friday night. You could use a little love right now,"" she chuckled.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, she had a point. I had been spending so many hours studying and doing work that I made no time for a social (or love) life. My girlfriend and I broke up after she decided that I wasn't spending enough time with her, but my grades were slipping with each weekend trip here and date night there. It was a break that we both desperately needed.

My green eyes looked at the bartender, then down to her concoction, then back up to her. I shrugged and drank it as she tended to the townies. It wasn't bad at all. But as I drank more, I noticed something printed on the bottom of the glass.

*You're not in the dumps as much as you think,*

*But do yourself a favor and finish this drink!*

Odd. 

I did what the glass told me to do, and on cue, the girl came back around. ""Looks like I read your mind just right. Another?""

""Yeah, it wasn't bad. Why not?""

She nodded and went to work on my second 'dose' of Love Potion No. 9. After she handed it to me, I sipped on it while watching a baseball game on TV. As I reached the bottom, there was another note.

*You have a short time to witness this mystique,*

*It does not last forever; just for a week.*

Huh? A week?

""Excuse me,"" I said, getting the girl's attention. ""What is this? There was one in my first glass too."" 

I tilted the glass to show her the message at the bottom. She laughed.

""Oh, they're just little silly sayings we put there for anyone getting that drink. No big deal. Another?""

By now, my low tolerance for alcohol was coming into play. Luckily, I only had to walk back to my apartment. 

""Yeah, sure,"" I replied, a little slur in my speech.

She came back with a third, which I drank a little more quickly than the first two. As I expected, a third message was waiting for me.

*Want to see what makes this drink really unique?*

*All you need to do is get a kiss on the cheek.*

""So what happens if I get a kiss on the cheek?"" I asked the girl with a sly grin of my own.

""I'd show you if I wasn't working,"" she replied. ""But unfortunately, I can't be kissing customers. One more?""

I waved my hand dismissively. ""No, I think I'm good for the night. What do I owe you?""

""Consider these on the house.""

My face lit up. ""Really? Well, thank you. I'm Josh, by the way. What's your name?""

She smiled. ""Well, I go by my middle name of Anastasia, but my real first name is Ruth.""

""It was nice to meet you. See you soon?""

""I'm sure you will!""

With that, I headed out of Tommy's and walked back to my apartment. It wasn't until I got halfway down the street that I started to think about the messages. What happens when I get a kiss on the cheek? 

---

I woke up the next morning feeling horrific. I had no recollection of what I did the night before, and my head was throbbing. I hadn't blacked out like this since the night of my 21st birthday. With a shower and some aspirin helping me to feel a bit better, I managed to pack my things and get on the road toward home.

While I drove along the lonely highway, I still failed to piece together my evening. That meant that I didn't remember Anastasia and her drinks. It meant that I didn't remember the messages at the bottoms of the glasses. 

It meant that I had no idea what was going to happen upon returning home.

---

Good morning, DPP! 

Thanks for stopping by and reading my intro post for this prompt! 

This is an incest plot based on a senior in college who unknowingly consumes a love potion while on a night out. Any woman who kisses him on the cheek for the next week will be driven mad with lust for him. Since he's heading home to see his family...well, you can see where this is going.

So who falls victim to Love Potion No. 9? Is it his younger sister? How about his mom? An aunt or cousin? Hell, his grandmother probably remembers the song best of all of them!

While I would love and prefer for there to be more than one woman involved, I'm open to playing opposite just one character. 

My kinks are incest, cheating, clothed sex, heels/boots, hair-pulling, spanking, dirty talk/name-calling, public sex, sneaky sex, risk of impregnation and anal.

I won't do anything involving underage characters, animals, non-con, violence or bathroom play.

I'm looking forward to making some magic with you, so please send those orange envelopes my way! Thanks again for reading!"

I see many strange chromebook problems and equally strange users almost daily. 

It‚Äôs important to know, I‚Äôm not an admin on the system that manages all our cb. I have basic crosh and a small tool set to do all repairs. 


With that out of the way I have come across an  interesting issue that has come up twice in a week. If the monitor cable is plugged into the motherboard the machine acts like it‚Äôs bricked
-charge led wont turn on if plugged in
-all keyboard input is not working (pwr +esc +refresh) 
When the cable is removed the chrome book works fine. But that means it does not have a display. 
The two computers are both HPs chromebook 11 one an g6 EE and the other a g4 

I‚Äôll edit later with pictures of them. "
avs6al,4,2019-02-28,Guidance Please!,SJax7192,Psychic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/avs6al/guidance_please/,"Hi lovely friends! 

I was wondering if you could give me some insight into my life path.

Since my father passed away from a sudden heart attack in January of 2017, I've felt really imbalanced deep down. I've grown stronger mentally and emotionally and done great things for myself to discover who I am, but I still struggle with being at peace. I feel like I keep getting knocked down and can't catch my breath. 

So, I need some clarification on a few things, please!

1) Can you speak to spirit guides and if so, what are mine telling me? I try so hard to hear them and be closer to them, but I get so overwhelmed. I feel really blocked.

2) I'm back in school for another degree and I'm supposed to be doing an internship this summer. One internship I really looked forward to and thought was a great fit ended up falling through. Naturally, I'm rather devastated. I have another one possibly lined up. Can you see this second one being a great fit? As an intuitive and empath, I have felt it is but validation would be helpful. 

3) I'm going to ask it because I can. One of my friends read me and mentioned that I will find my future husband at a hockey game for my university. The season is almost over and I'm kind of losing hope of finding him. I've been really down as of late and struggling with my singleness. Will my future husband and I find each other soon?

4) I want to learn more about being an empath and intuitive, but don't know where to start. Do you see me getting a mentor or where should I start?


Thank you all for your help and guidance! Please PM me with your answers!

Blessings,

Jax"

I was an intern at a tech company over the Summer and they were very pro security so they will punish you if you tail gate (following someone through a door without scanning your badge).

Anyway I was heading out to lunch and I was going through our buildings main door which is badge protected and someone who's hands were full of boxes tried to get in, me not wanting to get in trouble pretty much close the door on their face as I exit while they were trying to get in. I assume they do have a badge and they got in but I refused to look back to see. So am I the asshole here or was I right to close the door on someones who hands were full of boxes."
avsrrx,1,2019-02-28,My boyfriend [M23] and I [F23] are on a break. It‚Äôs not like a typical break.,GuitarGirl3295,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avsrrx/my_boyfriend_m23_and_i_f23_are_on_a_break_its_not/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over three years. I have never given myself to the time or space to love myself, I‚Äôve been in long relationships since middle school. I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs something unhealthy and I regret not giving MYSELF the love &amp; respect that I deserve. My boyfriend has put up with a lot of my shit, my depression, my desire to quit school, work, and wanting to die. He‚Äôs literally the most loving &amp; caring person I have ever met but he has such a twist into his personality. He‚Äôs also funny and super outgoing. I feel like he neglected to take care of himself in our relationship because everything was about me &amp; when I was depressed or upset, it would affect him. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs perfect and he has hurt me before. 

It‚Äôs almost going to be a month that he was confused about us being together and I asked him if he wanted to break up and he said no! That he loves me and cares about me, but that he‚Äôs confused. We started with a break but we would promise to text each other when we were at work or got home after work. He works different shifts and drives a motorcycle so I worry about him when he gets out at midnight or later. I wake up super early (5AM).  I go to school and work. (Graduating in May). After a week and a half of texting ‚Äútwice a day‚Äù (it would turn into more text). I realized that I needed to do no contact for a while to work on myself and he needed to do the same. Overall though, we haven‚Äôt been able to stay away from each other longer than 5 days, we have agreed to not talk for the weekdays and see each other on weekends. 

I‚Äôve realized that there are so many things I want to change for myself. It‚Äôs weird that this situation took me out of my own head and out of depression, in a way. It made me realize what I have and made me want to better myself, but most importantly for my own future, whether it‚Äôs with him or not. I‚Äôm practicing on not being so controlling, a perfectionist, assuming, overthinking, and scared. I started therapy and it‚Äôs going great! 

Last week, he told me he missed me and he was sad that we couldn‚Äôt do the things we usually do. He said he had some time to think and he realized that he has always tried to make others happy but not himself. That he‚Äôs almost ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with making sure I‚Äôm okay, so he lost himself along the way. 

Overall, I wish I could show him that I‚Äôm really trying and realized what we need to do different to be a good/healthy couple. I started going to the gym, started playing the guitar again, journaling, and talking to my family more. I‚Äôm not sure how he‚Äôs doing so far, but sometimes he works 50+ hour weeks so I feel like he doesn‚Äôt have time. 

Since this post is already going long, let me get to the point or the advice I‚Äôm looking for. How do I show him that I want us to be together, but not overwhelming him? How do I provide support for him in figuring out what he wants? Overall, I love him so much that I would want him to make the best decision for himself, but I want to be with him. Although it seems like there‚Äôs a higher chance of us getting back together, there‚Äôs still a chance he might end things. I also got an internship offer (3 months) in a different state, which would start in June and he‚Äôs still being supportive of it. I don‚Äôt know if I should go. I‚Äôm using this time apart to work on myself and I hope he is too. 

Summary: My boyfriend (3 years) and I are taking a break so he can work on himself. I‚Äôm confused on what to do and if I can show him support without being overbearing. I want him to see that I want to change &amp; be with him. "

avtbtt,38,2019-02-28,College sexting tension with leads to a fun afternoon. 25[M] 32[F] (cheating),[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/avtbtt/college_sexting_tension_with_leads_to_a_fun/,"This is sparked by this person trying to add me on LinkedIn. I have her blocked on every form of social media but I didn't consider that one. At the time of this writing I'm in a strong stable relationship and I won't do anything to jeopardize that, so when she attempts to contact me I just block her. But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I miss our time playing around. 

This one is pretty mild in the scheme of things, but the chase turned me on so much that I prefer it over many lukewarm sexual encounters. This starts back in 2012 I decided to go back to college. I was 25 at the time and living in my parent's basement. I was in a committed relationship with someone, thin redhead with long hair and freckles all over. She was pretty damn cute and we had some of the best sex I've ever had, but this story isn't about her.

During the course of my education I was older than a fair number of the other students. I wasn't there to socialize so I didn't really interact with anyone beyond group projects. Eventually though I took an internship job at the same college and it was there I met another intern, we'll call her Josie.

She was a slightly bigger girl, pretty tall with brown hair and beautiful brown eyes, light complexion. She was in her early 30s if I recall correctly. As for me I'm a tall bearded guy with brown hair and green eyes, also on the slightly larger side. She sat caddy corner from my intern desk, her workspace was covered with pictures of her and her fianc√©. I thought she was pretty cute but given we were both committed to other people I didn't give it much thought beyond that.

I've never been very good at reading signals, but in retrospect it seemed pretty obvious she had a thing for me. Whenever I'd do some work in another part of the building she'd find an excuse to come along. There were times I swear she was staring at me but I assumed I was imagining it.
Since we often worked together, and took a bunch of classes together we ended up talking about alot of things, like our taste in music, TV shows, movies and we found we had alot in common.

One time over the summer we were assigned to do some work together in the student housing, just me and her alone as most of the students were gone. We'd walk from room to room doing maintenance work. The building was pretty hot and humid, most of the rooms had individual A/C units that weren't on, so we managed the best we cpuld

We were both glistening with sweat and I remember she looked pretty damn hot with her messy and moist hair. For some reason I find sweaty girls to be attractive. We kept inching closer to each other, but still talking about work related things mostly. We both kept finding reasons to ""accidentally"" bump into each other. She asked me if it was okay to take her shirt off since it was getting so hot, and I said sure. She had a tank top underneath so it was fairly innocent, or I assumed so anyway.

I never saw her in anything but large baggy clothes. She had a pretty decent pair of tits, which were way more obvious now. I just imagined getting down on one of the gross dorm beds with her and making out, but I wouldn't, because girlfriend. I also assumed she wasn't interested in me like that, but I was suppose I was wrong! 

That night I went home and as you can imagine I felt pretty restless. I was distracted thinking about Josie's soft, sweaty skin pressed against my own, with her soft slightly puffy lips locked in with my own. I couldn't concentrate on anything else so I looked her up on Facebook. She was fortunately an open book and she had years of pictures for me to look at. I waited for my girlfriend to go to bed and I stayed up, opened up her Facebook page, found just the right picture and went to town on myself.

Eventually we friended each other. I think I was the first to add her, but I'm not totally sure. We of course got into a ""poke war."" This was back when that feature was still there, and for me anyway it was the universal sign of ""she's into you.""

By this time I know my girlfriend was catching onto the fact I was spending most of my free time on Facebook. I was pretty good about covering my tracks, but she'd see her posting memes to my page alot. She shared something slightly sexual with me once and it took a whole evening of trying to convince her that she wasn't into me and it was just a joke. I'm not sure if she accepted it, or just decided to pretend it didn't exist.

Eventually we started sending each other selfies and hers were getting more and more risqu√©. We were still mostly speaking in code and innuendo at that point, and I remember feeling myself get numb and shaking with anticipation every time our messages got even more sexual. At one point she finally just said it; ""show me your phallus lol."" Framing it like a joke so presumably she could claim so. 

I decided to take a slight risk and I did just that, I got myself nice and hard and sent her a picture of my phallus. I was watching the screen like a hawk, and saw her type and delete several comments, eventually she sent back, ""oh my... ;)"" and thus began a long series of sexting.

Since we were both in relationships this never really broached the real world, at least not for awhile. Sometimes I would get guilty and tell her we needed to stop, but then she'd show me her tits and I'd break down. I kept telling her how much I wanted her to ride me, how much I wanted her tits in my face. She'd send me strip teases and I'd tell her when I was masterbating and send her dick pics. We were mutually masterbating at a distance and I loved every second of it.

When it came to the real world though, I was pretty well covered. My girlfriend and I had a very healthy sexual relationship and I found her to be more attractive than Josie overall. It was mostly the thrill I liked. However this all changed in early 2014.

My girlfriend wasn't able to find a job in her field where we were at she wanted to move somewhere where there was more opportunity. I didn't want to move, since my band and my friends were here but I did kind of string her along by claiming I was open to the idea. Eventually she started applying and eventually got a job down south. We decided to commit to a long term relationship, but I knew as soon as she was out of the picture, Josie and I would strike; and I was right.

I ended up taking a job in my field and I rarely attended classes at this point. Josie would show up at my band's shows, we'd call and sext often. I'd make plans to see her and break them over guilt. Eventually though I went back to take my final and she was there. We finished about the same time and struck up a conversation. This led to her getting in my SUV and we drove around talking. We eventually parked by the lake and I could smell her pheromones.

We were still playing coy for some reason, and we'd find excuses to let our hands slip and touch each other in some minor way. My SUV had a center console that kept us from really doing much, if it wasn't there we probably would of started there. However I eventually remember my parents asked me to stop by and take care of their dog while they were out of town. I told her and she came with me.

The house was empty. I'd moved out several months ago but I still had the key to my separate entrance. I helped her through the dark and we got upstairs. I fed the dog and sat at the kitchen table, and she took a place on one of the recliners, sitting backwards facing me over the back of the chair. We were looking at each other and I kept rolling my chair closer until we were almost face to face. I could feel her breath on my lips and there it happened, we magnetically latched and our lips were locked, our first kiss. It was like fireworks were going off, we were lashing our tounge against each other only separated for a few moments while I came over and got on top of her. We were completely clothed but just grinding against each other animalistically. I started rubbing her tits and pussy over her clothes, she squeezed my cock, which was the hardest I'd been in awhile. I loved her soft lips they were the softest and puffiest lips I've ever felt, I still think about them 5 years later.

Eventually I stood up and she was staring at me with intense eyes. We however both agreed not to have sex while we were both with someone, though I assume if I pushed the issue she would have relented. But I'm not really good at being assertive. 

I was still standing full mast and I really needed to do something about it. I cracked a joke about nobody wanting to watch me jerk off and she quietly said ""not true..."" and trailed off as her eyes focused on that area. I thought for a few moments and unzipped my pants and pulled it out. She had her eyes laser focused on it and licked her lips. I stroked it slowly giving her the best show I could. I sat back and opened my legs and started increasing my speed. I could hear her heavy breathing and it just motivated me to cum for her. Eventually I built it up and shot a huge load up into the air and it landed on my stomach. Her gasp when I came is still reverberating in my head. 

I cleaned myself up, but I was feeling really down. I cheated on my girlfriend it was the first time I ever physically cheated on someone. She could tell I was upset and tried to comfort me by saying ""we didn't really do anything."" I dropped her off at her car at the college and drove home. She called me that night ""just to talk"" we were having a semi normal conversation but I could tell from her breathing she was touching herself. 

We did eventually have sex, but I was going through some depression issues at the time and couldn't get hard enough for it to be satisfying. I still daydream about giving her a proper pounding, but even without having sex this moment is in my ""favorites"" when it comes to memories to jerk off to. "

I wish I‚Äôm not this way; it seems who I am fundamentally are making things more difficult for myself than what it could‚Äôve been if I‚Äôm just different.

It seems to me that to be a good human being you have to be extroverted so that you have more practice dealing with difficult/annoying people and have more compassion within you. Being that way also makes you a risk taker, a braver person, less sensitive to pressure etc. But instead here I am; I avoid risk as much as possible, I get offended easily, I yield easily under pressure etc. I couldn‚Äôt sacrifice my time for someone else, even if its someone close to me. I view people based on what they possess instead of who they are as humans. Anyone here feeling the same?

avu17q,1,2019-02-28,(M4A playing F) the ultimate open prompt list. Something for everyone hopefully! Pick your poison.. (Fairly long) (open prompts) (rp or chat),Soapydopey69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/avu17q/m4a_playing_f_the_ultimate_open_prompt_list/,"Hey people of DPP today i've got a few ideas for an RP and I really can't decide on the one I want. So I'm hoping that you can help me choose! I have left them fairly open just to make it easier, but I can provide much more detail over PM if one catches your gaze.

*(In no particular order, and feel free to mix and match!)*

**Fucking the MILF:** There's a few Milfs I know in real life, it'd be grand to fuck one! The twist is, that the people I know with kids aren't your run of the mill Lisa Ann style of mature Milfs but rather quite young!

You know the type.. The ones that got pregnant at 18 and are in their early twenties wondering where it all went wrong, still rocking a tight, fuckable body from their days of teasing and clubbing. Hoping that a guy with a thick cock and willing body would come by and fuck them some more.

I have a few ideas on who the Milf can be, if they are a co-worker, friend, friend of family etc. This RP can also have risky sex/impreg notes to it! Pretty open scenario when it comes to it aswell.

**Outercourse:** Lap dances, tittyfucking, handjobs, assjobs, pussyjobs.. You name it and it can happen! Maybe you're a concerned friend or a professional dancer that just can't help make me cum but something is stopping you from having full on sex with me!

This RP can be played in the nude or with some over the clothes fun! Think of a tittyfuck in a bikini, or an assjob in a pair of leggings!

**The Virgin:** I'm 18 and have had no luck with girls. Whenever I masturbate I always think of all the fantasies that go through my head, thinking about all the things i'd love to do with my favorite pornstars. Of course, I like to think of myself as the 'big man' lasting hours with my favorite big titted bitches.

The truth however is that when it comes to it, i'd probably cum in the first 10 thrusts.. For this prompt I would love for my friend, acquaintance, coworker, crush to find out that I am a virgin. This can then lead to a variety of sex scenes which can be light or dark. Wanna give me a blowjob out of pity? Done. Wanna present yourself doggystyle to me and let me fuck you for the 30 seconds I can before giving you a hefty creampie? Done. Wanna dominate my cock and milk as many loads out of my virgin cock as you can? Done. Let me know your ideas!

This RP can focus on domination, pity, multiple cumshots or whatever you want!

**The premature ejaculator:** Similar to the above prompt, but a bit more specific. I could be a virgin or could have some very bad luck. Whenever I perform sexual acts, I can't help but cum! But fortunately, there's little to no refractory period, meaning that I can carry on. Maybe you try to titfuck me for foreplay, sorry.. you're gonna have a sticky neck. Maybe you lick the tip of my cock and find yourself with a mouth full of cum. Maybe you try to grind on me using your ass and find your back and ass with streaks of my fluid darted across it. The possibilities are endless!

**Living with HyperSpermia:** This is a prompt that is a little more far fetched. The premise is that I have a 'condition' called HyperSpermia that causes my balls to produce semen at a faster rate than most people which means I have to empty them a lot more often. Side effects include no refractory period and very large loads.

We can have a concerned sibling, doctor or friend that finds out about my condition and 'helps' me. But there's a lot that could happen so go nuts.

**Tight clothing, CFNM with outercourse:** Title is self explanatory, think about all your favorite sexual acts and add clothing to them!

It's a big kink of mine to have sex without actual penetration! (It kinda works trust me) A tittyfuck with a bra/croptop on. An assjob with a tight pencil skirt on. Handjobs, blowjobs, general rubbing and dryhumping all while having clothes on!

Wanna have me fuck a military woman in her camo? Wanna have me fuck a firefighter in her heavy gear and gasmask? Wanna have me fuck a medical intern in her scrubs?

We can get as detailed and broad as we want from this. Uniforms, odd clothing, winter clothing, bikinis, cosplay. Pretty much any sex with any article of clothing and we're good to go!

**Futa Fun:** (I play Futa you play Female)
Pretty self explanatory, wanna fuck a chick with a dick? Wanna see a pair of bouncing tits while your holes get filled with warm cum?

**Incest is Wincest:** A bit of a controversial prompt depending on where your standing. But often enough I see fantasy posts about fucking your cousin/sibling and the taboo hotness surrounding it.

Pretty self explanatory really. Sexting, accidental walk in during masturbation, too horny to contain ourselves, accidental teasing, actual teasing.

Anything that's going to get us to have dirty taboo sex is open!

(PLEASE NOTE: I do not enjoy or tend to go for mother/son or father/daughter combos. Sorry!)

**Celebrity encounters:** Not one I explore enough! Got a female celebrity you really want to play as and see fucked? Seek no more!

My favorite celebrity RP's are that of A.J Cook and Elisha Cuthbert (Usually seperately, but if you want them both together you get major bonus points!)

A.J Cook is known best for her role in Criminal Minds. The tight blonde that works as 'communications liason' for the BAU. (No spoilers please). I have a fantasy of fucking her in her FBI kevlar vest. But the prompt is of course open.

Elisha Cuthbert is a bit more specific. Those who have watched 'The Girl Next Door' will know exactly what I'm talking about..

Celebrity prompt isn't contained to these two ladies though, send me your ideas!

**Pornstar encounters:** Similar to the celebrity prompt above, this one includes famous pornstars instead. If you interested I can tell you a few of my favorites over PM (Or you can send yours) I don't tend to enjoy asian, black or indian though, just to clarify.

This prompt can be explored in a cheesy porno styled scenario or maybe i'm a fan that 'wins' a day with you or maybe just a fan that comes across you in everyday life.

**The threesome with the two sisters:** (Major bonus points for this one) It's a simple threesome but with a bit of a twist. It is a threesome with my friend and her younger sister (All 18+).

Me and the family are fairly close so it is borderline incesty for me which adds to the taboo hotness of it all.

And for a little backstory.. The two sisters are D (22) C (20) [I will share their real names over PM for privacy reasons]. Well I've known D and C for a while and obviously when puberty hit I started noticing them for their bodies too. I've been more closer with D over the years. The prompt jumped in my brain when I saw them at work the other day!

I work in retail in the UK at a local supermarket, back during the warmer days of summer,they came in to buy some shopping and say hi and they were pretty much wearing matching daisy dukes. (Denim shorts if you're not aware of the term). With D's smaller but tight ass and C's big bouncy rump, I could barely turn away! The twist I want to incorporate is a kind of 'competition' between the two girls that eventually leads to a threesome? If that makes any sense..

I had an idea for an intro which would be D coming round my house after me and C had a night out in town. D would of been told by C that I had been groping her ass all night which would anger her. I would be worried that a sexual assault charge would be put upon me but instead D would start to get jealous.

Her jealousy would stem from me saying well ""Her ass was huge and I was drunk I just wanted to touch"" which would then make her self conscious slightly and would want to 'one up' her sister, and would eventually lead me to try touching her ass to compare the two.

After that, it could go back and forth, the sisters trying to one up eachother on a variety of bodily features and sexual acts until a full blown threesome!

**The new years eve tomboy:** What better way to start the new year than to create a prompt based on something that happened in the new year with a friend of mine!

Of course being young enough to go out to the club for new years is a must, and unfortunately my judgment got the better of me and I ended up going. But fortunately for me one of my friends invited me.

(I will be addressed her as 'AJ' which are her initials until we discuss further in PM's. Just as a privacy thing.)

AJ is about as tomboy as you can get. Jogging bottoms, baggy band shirts, hoodies, coats. If it covers her body in a baggy shroud it's something she would wear. We have been friends for quite some time now and it's been a purely friendly relationship.

But that night when she picked me up to take her back to her place for drinks before the night out.. My god..

A one piece grey dress that barely covered her ass is what she arrived to my house in. Her petite 5'6 body was incased in a tight dress that definitely showed off her curves. By my guess she was supporting a C cup chest, a very toned midriff and an ass to absolutely die for. Her red hair was let down which reached her lower back and she had a touch of makeup on.

Of course I was absolutely gobsmacked by her sudden shift in style but I wasn't one to complain. Fast forward to midnight and we were dancing casually and having a great time. Once closing time came about we started walking to the taxi service and that's where things got slightly heated.

I had my arm around the back of her holding her steady, which was innocent enough at first but in my drunken state my hand had been moved. Downwards of course, I had my palm against her peachy ass. I could blame the alcohol and the natural momentum of us walking but I was surprised when she didn't even flinch..

I had my hand on the huge ass of my tomboy friend and she wasn't telling me to stop. I squeezed and kind of moved around and she seemed to enjoy it..

For this prompt, it is VERY open. So go nuts!

avv1ym,50,2019-02-28,TH GreenBay to Hilbert back to GreenBay in less than a year,Booty_Grazer,TickTockManitowoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TickTockManitowoc/comments/avv1ym/th_greenbay_to_hilbert_back_to_greenbay_in_less/,"D Vogel set Petersen straight.... Even if LE sniped Steve in some fashion the case wouldn't end...Steve's immediate family could pursue and attorneys would proceed with a contingency case. (Only paid when won)

This case was a WINNER if only Petersen and Vogel were deposed, but Alas long comes Teresa.

It's important to look at dates here: DOJ &amp; MTSO knew when the Bernstein hairs were identified as NOT being Steve's on 02/2002 **""THEY WERE IN DIRE TROUBLE""**

Teresa was recommended by an unknow man in October/November 2003 who wanted to advertise a vehicle in Auto Trader. Dawn told him they no longer had a photographer in that area (Go look who Teresa replaced who just happen to work for the state of WI) Timing is was everything and Dawn couldn't identify the man who she spoke for the recommendation of Teresa. Teresa called Dawn very soon after the man made the recommendation.

Now here's a question....Teresa lived in GreenBay 4 years in college and 3 years proceeding college and still had her shared space in Tommy P's studio.

Now I ask you **why** would you choose to move back to Hilbert give up your VERY NICE apartment location in downtown GreenBay for a job that paid less than working at 7-11 and drive back to GreenBay on the days your studio was open?

Lets go back to Scott B for a second: Remember in early 2018 KZ's privet investigator worked out a deal to interview Scott? But when the investigator showed Scott was no longer willing to be interviewed???

Teresa wrote an email to her friend we've all read it ""where Scott was called a pig"" so why and how were the details of the rental of the property worked out? Did Scott lease the property or did Teresa lease the property from her parents?

Now Lets look at dollars and cents...surly sharing rent from a location that your parents owned would be a hell of a lot cheaper (if she paid anything)  than her apartment in GreenBay. She had her own studio space doing her own weddings and sittings its common sense her photography business should have generated more cash than when an intern for Tommy.

7 years plus your own PRIVET apartment sure your going to save money moving back to Hilbert  into a place your parents own, but why?

Back to Tommy boy...had anyone ever heard any details in how utilities were divided at the studio? How much Tommy was charging Teresa for the space? When Teresa had Tommy help her with weddings or vis versa what was the split? Tommy wasn't an idiot where's the written contract oh yea it was a hand shake BULLSHIT. **Not once** Tommy even mentioned in all his details of interviews any type monetary agreement with Teresa NOT ONCE.

IMO Teresa didn't pay one dime to Tommy....want proof where's her check book details? So Teresa had a business so its said was it an LLC or was she incorporated? Ok ready... anyone seen her 1040's of her profit and losses? Was she a DBA Corporation (C corp) or LLC or just filed a 1040 with her profits and losses?

She claims to be using a lab to develop her photos did she get bills from here to pay?

I'm pretty dam sure NO businesses person would enter into a blind agreement this is how lifetime friends go into business and end up hating each other because of the business and the agreements NOT written down.

I think Teresa was on a 1 year schedule. You do realize Teresa had already given Auto Trader her notice of leaving just weeks before her disappearance. Now why would you give up your privet apartment down town GreenBay then move out of your freebee apartment in Hilbert to need to move back to GreenBay? For what reason/s??? It sure wasn't auto trader or year around cough soccer practice LOL. Go back and reread the email KZ produced. TERESA WAS TIRED OF DRIVING which meant moving back to GreenBay.

IMHO this was all a laid out plan from the moment DOJ knew they were screwed on 05/2002. Show me the Tommy agreement show me the 1040's show me her check book&gt;&gt;&gt;. Deposits and charges were never discussed by JB &amp; DS only items on her credit card. No studio lab charges, no new film charges? This smells very much like dead fish... when your seeming to generate cash and can't show details is charges and income. But again JB and DS didn't have the money to look what her income was and **FROM WHERE. BULLSHIT**

&amp;#x200B;

**DID anyone ever think Teresa was already a  millionaire (Farm details Tim drew up AND or Richard left her that as her inherence)  drawing off a BLIND TRUST . Blind trust NO ONE KNOWS WHERE OR WHO'S PAYING your bills....This happens all the time on mortgages perfect way to live in secret : ) Tim could be on the trust so tracing it all leads back to only TIM. As long as Tim files the necessary information with the IRS the TRUST could have several UNKNOWN persons or C corp. OR llC members.**"

avveqy,1,2019-02-28,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/avveqy/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"*18+ looking for 18+ only. All characters are also 18+.*

*Prompt 1: Young intern/staffer + Young politician*

Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door.

*Intern + intern*

Who knew that taking a year off from college to work on a campaign could be so tiring? I mean, *I* knew that, and everybody who even thought about doing it probably did, too, but that doesn't mean that it didn't suck. I never thought that I'd wake up in the morning begging to have a 9am class to go to, but sometimes that felt better than having a 6am policy meeting.

The hardest part, though, was the absolute lack of a social life. Of course, having meetings and events to do most of the day didn't help matters, but we were also shuttling from city to city two to three times a week. You could meet a lot of interesting people that way, but you couldn't really hang out much.

That's probably why you and I became such fast friends. We're the only college students around, and we're probably the two youngest people working on the campaign. Ordinarily, people our age wouldn't be even close to being involved at his high a level in any campaign, but here we are. We hit it off instantly, and we've been friends ever since.

Unfortunately, that's not where it ends. See, I've had a crush on you for almost as long as I've known you (which admittedly isn't that long, but who's counting?). Obviously, I've never been in a position to pursue that.

Until now. For some reason, we needed to cut costs in our latest campaign stop, so they forced everybody to double up in small one-bed hotel rooms. Somebody higher up than us thought it'd be funny to put us in the same room.

Hey there, DPP! In this prompt, I'm looking to play one of the two campaign related prompts above. It's pretty open-ended, so you could play a variety of character personalities. My kinks include oral, anal, passionate but ""fun"" sex, young love, light teasing, facials, creampies, kissing, nipple play, and deep throating."

Hi. I've posted this previously and will try again as it is one of my major fantasies.  If you're interested message me and we can play it out. We can discuss the specifics but initially I'm thinking you're a young intern at my wifes work or a close friend. You've been over to our place for BBQs, supper etc. but on this occasion I'm out with some friends leaving you two alone.  I return home and hear noises from the bedroom/bathroom/home office (Your preference). The door is slightly ajar so I silently walk down the hall and peak in. What I see is disturbing and also very erotic, you and my wife are making out. Hopefully this scenario interests you. We can change things up depending on your interests and desires.

Some about myself and my wife. She doesn't know I chat online so won't be involved in the play herself. We're both 56 yo. She is very attractive with a nice body; long legs, a nice butt and smaller breasts. FYI - I will get involved in the play but the thought of catching you two and watching for awhile excites me. Anyways. I hope to hear from you and get to know a little about you before we begin. Oh, I prefer to talk in reddit chat but that is only a preference and not required.

Take care,

Paul"
avwh9o,4,2019-02-28,I feel like I am wasting my time.

Science major in Washington for 2 years and dropped out due to parents finding out about my weed habits that I've formed over there. Since then, I've been attempting to transfer credits to a community college here. Unfortunately, most of my core and gen ed. classes didn't transfer over. So the past two years since I've been taking a one or two classes here and there. I failed some of them, barely passed others.
I started to go to this free computer programming school called 42 in Fremont back in October 2018, and I've been learning so much more there than I ever did in college. I've stop going to community college recently to be there more often. But momentum has slowed since it is a far commute. 
Anyways, I feel like I'm a failure, I can't be successful in school and I know having a degree is important to get your foot in the door. I still have my parents supporting me, thinking that I will transfer soon to a university and finish up, but I'm nowhere close to that. Especially now since my gpa is incredibly low and the uni that I'm wanting to transfer to has a requirement of a minimum 3.5 gpa for their computer science program. So now, I'm relying on the programming school to give some leeway towards an opportunity to get a decent programming job within maybe a year or so (since they also help you prep for interviews and host job fairs for internships from various tech companies). But I feel there's alot of uncertainty with going that route.
The clock is ticking, time is passing by fast, and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do, I feel like fucked up royally in life, I feel like a spoiled manchild, and I feel that if I don't have some sort of plan to get my life on track, I'm set up for miserable life. "

avxwa7,60,2019-02-28,"'It's okay, my kids have adhd!'",zwadderaar,entitledparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/avxwa7/its_okay_my_kids_have_adhd/,"First of all: I want to apologize for any spelling and grammar mistakes. English isn't my first language.  Also, I'm sorry for the long post.

This happened a few years ago. I took an internship during the summer at a camping as part of the entertainment team. My job was basically to give the kids an awesome holiday by doing all kind of activities with them. Now, there was this family who stayed there every single weekend and holiday and because of that, they felt like they were entitled to getting some sort of vip treatment. Their kids (aged 8 and 10) were very bad behaved and my co-workers told me that they both had severe adhd and hated each other, even trying to drown each other in the pool. I was kinda shocked and wanted to prepare myself in the best way possible. So I did a little research because adhd or not, it's still my job to make their holiday an amazing one.

The brothers showed up on several activities, always being agressive and hurting the other children or each other. Now there was this treasure hunt coming up and both the brothers signed up. I volunteered to take the youngest on my team. The hunt starts and he's very demanding to get my attention, which I'm fine with. He holds my hand at all times, which is fine as well because at least he's not picking a fight with the other children on my team. Everything goes smooth for a while, until:

EK: You're prettyMe: nawh thank you, that's a very nice thing to sayEK: can I fuck you?

Now, I wasn't thinking a lot of it at first. Maybe he picked it up somewhere and had no idea what it meant, kids can do that. So I laughed and said that he probably didn't know what it meant yet but that it wasn't something that you can just say to people. He stopped walking, looked me dead in the eye and said:

EK: I know what it means. I want to fuck you.

I started feeling slightly uncomfortable. I wasn't scared of an 8 year old sexually harassing me, but there were other kids around as well, some of them really small and I didn't want any drama with them around.

Me: Well, that's never going to happen and I don't want you saying those things. Now let's see if we can find the next clue, shall we?

Then he started hitting me, screaming how stupid I was. The other kids were getting scared so I firmly took his arm and said:  'Look kid, I don't want you to hit me and I don't want you to say these kind of things. It's not right. Now let's just continue the treasure hunt and see if we can beat your brother by finding the treasure.' This calmed him down a for a while and we continued the search. At some point I sat down with the kids to take a break and we we're talking and laughing for a bit, until I felt a hand touching me. It was the EK and he was trying to work his way up my shirt. I immediatly got away from him, uncomfortable and slightly embarrased.

Me: that's it kid. I'm gonna have a talk with you parents after we get back.

EK: please don't do that, please! I'll be good, please!

I then realized that he knew that it was wrong was he was doing. This wasn't a kid being curious, although that would have been wrong as well, but at least it would have been a different situation.

I was really irritated as we started walking again and we came across the kids father by accident. I told the other kids to think about the next clue and explained the situation to the father as well as I could in a polite way. (Note that I have social anxiety and the man was really intimidating, but I tried my best) The father just laughed at first and said: 'Well, he's just like his father. He has a thing for the ladies.'

Me: excuse me sir, but this is also a bad example to the other children

ED: that's not my problem. We are here almost the entire year, the others come and go

Me: but that doesn't mean your son can do as he wants

ED: uh, yes it does?

EK: she even hit me daddy!

The dad stopped smiling at this point.

ED: \*loudly\* you did what!

Me: I didn't hit your son, sir. I only took his arm when he started hitting me and told him that I didn't want to see this behaviour.

ED: \*now screaming and walking up to me\* You. Are. Not. To. Touch. My. Child!

Me: He's also not to touch me, sir. And I never hurt him in any way.

EK: yes, you did!

ED: You're a goddamn piece of trash and I will see your boss right away! My son has adhd! It's not his fault that you can't handle him!

Me: with all respect sir, I'm fully aware of this but I'm not a pedagogue and therefor not trained or specialised in children with adhd. There's only so much that I can do.

ED: Then you better start doing your research lady! My kid didn't do anything wrong and you know it!  You just hate him for having adhd!

At this point the man was standing almost on top of me, screaming his lungs out. I heard the other kids crying and was about to myself, since he looked like he could start to beat me at any moment.

ED: Where's your boss? You bitch! Playing the victim while my kid is really the one who's scared and probably traumatised at this point!

(Note: the kid was fine now he realized that daddy dear took his side. Laughing, I might add.)

I told the man where he could find my boss and the two walked away, the father still screaming and shouting and cursing me. It took a long time before the other kids were calm again. We finished the treasure hunt with no other incidents. When I got back, my boss came up to me to hear my side of the story. It was a relief to know that he believed me, since there had been so many other incidents with the family.

Now flash forward a few weeks later. We had this mascot, a giant rabbit, and we took turns in dressing up. This time, it was my turn to be the rabbit while my co-worker would read a story to the other children. While in the suit, I noticed the EK sneaking up next to me. Now ,the kid knew that there was a person in the giant rabbit and since only two people were working that day, he was able to figure out which one of the two was in the suit. He was doing good, until I noticed that his hand was searching in the paw of the rabbit for my hand. He found it and I thought he just wanted to hold it. But no. No no no.

He actually took one of my fingers and slowly started bending it upwards. I couldn't do much, since we have a rule that no matter what happens, you don't blow the fantasy for the other children. Therefor, the mascot doesn't speak and certainly doesn't push a kid away from him. So the boy kepy on trying to bend my finger as hard as possible, until I was in real pain and almost screaming. I tried to get away from him without letting the other kids notice that something was wrong, but he took his other hand and held my hand in place. Once again: I could have easily freed myself but it would have involved pushing the kid away, which I wasn't allowed to do. Thankfully story time was over a minute after and I quickly went back to change. When I got back, the boy was still there. He just smiled at me in a creepy way and then made a run for it.

I told my boss about the incident and the family was banned from staying at the camping forever, due to all the other incidents adding up. I've seen a lot of kids and their parents come and go that summer, but this still gives me shivers when I think about it.

Edit: I just wanna say that I know adhd doesn't cause anyone to behave like this. The father may have used it as an excuse for his sons behaviour, but it had nothing to do with it."
