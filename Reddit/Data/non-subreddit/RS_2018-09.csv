9byzv7,531,2018-08-31,"The worst Magic cards of all time (at least, according to Gatherer)",Xenotechie,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/9byzv7/the_worst_magic_cards_of_all_time_at_least/,"MTG Arena recently got me hooked to this game. Seeing as that version of Magic only supports cards from Kaladesh onwards, it was only natural that I would check what are the cards I've been missing.

It turns out that for every Black Lotus, artefact land, or whatever card happens to have the Storm keyword... there's a lot of crap.

From there, a question formed. What was the worst card? Of course, that's highly subjective and all, but fortunately, Gatherer has its rating system to turn a whole lot of subjective opinions into something approaching an objective one. Barring the few cards that got a statistically insignificant number of ratings before the user interaction on that site got destroyed (and, of course, the cards printed after that), these are the top 10 worst cards of all time. Here's [the list](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=rating+&amp;action=advanced&amp;rating=%20%3C=[1]) for your own perusal.

----

#\#10: [\[\[Crazed Goblin\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=46078&amp;type=card)

A 1/1 for {R} which attacks whenever possible. Look in its eyes. [Stare deep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=46078&amp;type=card) into them. Truly, such a vile, cruel creature needs a downside to make it fair upon us mere mortals. Even then... yeah okay I can't keep this up any longer.

**Possible uses?** A...goblin deck? I mean, sure, there are far more options for if you need a goblin at that mana cost, but this way, you get to flaunt the fact you a) have a card from a 14 year old set and b)picked out that card from the set in question, the set that gave us [[Aether Vial]] and [[Skullclamp]].

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** [[Fanatical Firebrand]]. I mean, it's basically a Crazed Goblin, am I right? Except it has haste... and has a really useful tap effect... and is basically everything Crazed Goblin could have been, were it not for the unfortunate craziness bit.

----

#\#9: [\[\[Zephyr Spirit\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=88962)

How does a card named Zephyr Spirit not even fly? There are certain expectations tied to card names, and both of the words in this card's name suggest flying. I suppose they cancel each other out? Anyway, this is a 0/6 card for {5}{u}, which already makes it horrendously understatted, but also bounces back to your hand when you declare it as a blocker. Note the timing here: the designers didn't even give it the luxury of bouncing back when damage is declared, meaning it's completely useless against Trample creatures. This card has one job, and it's slacking off at the office.

**Possible uses?** Throw it into an actual zephyr to give it the keyword it deserves. Not that flying would help it much.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** Not only does [[Horizon Scholar]] fly, it uses its nerd cred to save you from the evils of not actually knowing what your [[Divination]] will draw for you. Sure, it has 2 less toughness, but what good is toughness if you can't even get properly use it cause you're that crap of a card?

----

#\#8: [\[\[Takeno's Cavalry\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74597)

I must admit I am not terribly familiar with the code of a Kamigawan Samurai. However, I am a good learner, and this card teaches me a few things.

 1. A 1/1 for {3}{W} is honourable. I can only assume giving an opponent an actual challenge would call for the seppukuest of seppukus.
 2. In the throes of battle, a samurai may call to Bushido and unleash his true power... a whopping temporary +1/+1. I wonder if the bonus applies for the aforementioned seppuku?
 3. Samurai marksmanship is so refined, it touches upon the spirit of the enemy... but only the spirit. You tap this card to hit a Spirit for 1. Kamigawan iron evidently does not lend itself well to fletching.

**Possible uses?** The weeniest white weenie deck. Combo with [[Little Girl]] for best effect.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** [[Gallant Cavalry]]. As we all know, an Oakeshott sword beats any puny Katana, and you get a 2 for one deal here! The creatures even get Vigilance, because these guys actually know how to handle a horse.

----

#\#7: [[[Numai Outcast]]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=50431)

Another Kawigawan Samurai, but wait! This one broke Bushido! Unfortunately, the fact that the Numai Outcast was smart enough to follow it in the first place did not bear well for her ronin career.

For one, her Bushido effect is stronger by one, bringing her up to a 3/3 in the throes of combat, all for the measly cost of {3}{B}. But wait, in the unlikely event such a master of a blade falls, you may regenerate her for a measly payment of one {B} and a quarter of your starting life total!

**Possible uses?** Strategic suicide deck. I don't know of any, but with as many cards as Magic has, it's existence is as sure as this card's suckosity.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** A lot of stuff, but I picked out [[Fathom Fleet Cutthroat]] because pirates&gt;samurai. Also, unconditional 3/3 with a side of pseudo-[[Murder]].

----

#\#6: [\[\[Mindless Null\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180415)

A 2/2 for {2}{B} is already pretty bad, but it comes with a downside. Apparently, it was even supposed to be a {1}{B} creature, but even then, it would have been worse that pretty much every other 2 mana drop in the game. Honestly, this card is remarkable in its badness in that it's just kind of... uninspired. It's the Magic equivalent of a crappy country song that plays on the radio for one month and then quickly gets forgotten by everyone, including its creator.

**Possible uses?** At least the art is good. Hang it on a wall next to your other favourite black cards. Place next to [[Surgical Extraction]] for mild similarity combo points.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** Resisting my urge to once again pirate it up, [[Lord of the Accused]]. Now there's a right proper zombie. 2/3, hypes his zombie bros (or, zombros, if you will) up, presumably has a mind. Solid 8/10 would start an apocalypse with.

----

#\#5: [\[\[Viashino Skeleton\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=175097)

Now, [[Drudge Skeletons]] have been around since Alpha, apparently. I am more familiar with their reassembling cousins. So, why does this card cost 3 more mana and 1 more mana to reskeletonise just for one extra power?

I can only imagine this discussion in R&amp;D:

&gt;-*Here's an idea: Red regenerating skeleton.*

&gt;-A red skeleton? A RED SKELETON? WHAT BLASPHEMY IS THIS?

&gt;-*Well... uhh... it costs four mana.*

&gt;-THIS PENANCE IS NOT SUITABLE. RED MEANS FIRE. NOT SPOOKY SKELETONS.

&gt;-*You also need black mana to regenerate it and you need to discard a card.*

&gt;-HMMM...ACCEPTABLE. DO NOT PUSH YOUR LUCK FURTHER, INTERN.

&gt;-*But I'm a-*

&gt;-INTERN.

Anyway, that's the story of how [[Heretic's Punishment]] got its effect cost. It was the first thing Gatherer gave me when I typed in Heretic, so it must be true.

**Possible uses?** Spook your Storm-playing opponent into a cardiac arrest by playing sketetons only! 0% of the time, it works every time.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** [[Hazoret the Fervent]], because there's no kill like overkill, and I don't want that skeleton to regenerate into my deck.

----

#\#4: [ \[\[Face of Fear\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=31738)

The only faces of fear elicited by this card were on the faces of, poor, innocent kinds opening their shiny Odyssey booster packs. I am not a psychologist, but somebody got traumatised by getting this instead of basically any other uncommon. A {5}{B} with a crappy version of [[Fear]] and 3/4 sounds like the kind of creature after an opponent throws four mana's worth of black weakening spells on what was a decent 6 drop.

**Possible uses?** Chuckle at the flavour text, then chuck it out.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** [[Feral Abomination]], a 5/5 with Deathtouch which skips the whole ""scare to death"" part and gets on with the actual death.

----

#\#3: [\[\[Bog Hoodlums\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=145966)

How do you make a card that costs as much as Face of Fear suck more that, well, Face of Fear? Well, for one, no blocking, can't organise hoodlums, of course. Makes sense. Second, add clashing? Give yourself and an opponent a free scry and pray they are playing a lot of weenies. If the deck-comparing contest goes your way, showing once and for all that you have a bigger deck, your hoodlums grow by +1/+1, making it exactly as vulnerable to [[Shock]] as it ever was.

**Possible uses?** An all-clash deck for alleviating any insecurities you may have about your deck. Continue playing it until this immature joke stops being funny to you.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** For a more classic example, [[Nightmare]]'s your steed, being a 6/6 with flying in most mono-black decks if played on curve. Truly a gift horse that keeps on giving.

----

#\#2: [\[\[Aven Trooper\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5584)

This card offends me, because, at a distance, it actually seems pretty cool! That red sun behind a leaping creature is some lovely art. Unfortunately, then it hits you with the already-familiar 1/1 for {3}{W}. And then it hits you further because it asks you to throw away a card to give it temporary +1/+2. And then it tries to hit you again, but because it sucks, it fails. However, that discard effect still costs {2}{W}. This card came from Torment. There couldn't be a more appropriate set name.

**Possible uses?** Make a deck with the previous eight cards, then throw them into the ~~garbage bin~~ graveyard with this card, because that's just what they deserve.

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** [[Aeronaut Admiral]]... is not really the best of cards either. However, it actually has a niche, it actually has stats, and it's a part of Kaladesh, which makes it automatically a cool card in my book on the art alone. I could have went for a proper legendary creature, but Kaladesh.

----

#\#1: [\[\[Razor Boomerang\]\]](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=198395)

The only non-creature is apparently the worst of the lot, and, well... it deserves it. Gentlemen, ladies, the quick guide to playing Razor Boomerang.

 1. Play Razor Boomerang for 3 mana.
 2. Equip it on a poor, undeserving creature of your choice for 2 mana.
 3. Tap the creature, hitting a target of your choice for an astonishing one damage point
 4. Repeat until you either lose the game, or force the enemy to concede due to uncontrollable laugher.

**Possible uses?** Use in place of [[Blacker Lotus]] in a casual game. (I would have used a different word here, but automod didn't like it. Sorry for the resubmit, mod team!)

**What does that mana get you in Standard?** [[Forebear's Blade]], the stickiest sharp stick to ever stick. Throw it into a pirates deck to recreate a game in Arena I horribly lost!

Growing up, I have always been on the bigger side. Played sports in high school, used to be pretty strong but always carried fat as well. I'm in college now and looking for some advice on how to lose some weight.

I study environmental biology, and live a fairly active lifestyle. I don't know how to convey that to you guys, but I usually average about 6k - 10k steps a day according to my Galaxy S8.

The problem: My main issue is my damn sweet tooth/snacking in general. I find it incredibly difficult to cut out pizza, ice cream, and sugary sports drinks such as gatorade. I would also say that I struggle with over eating and at times binge eating when stressed. Could definitely use tips on how to cope/overcome that.

My other main issue here lies with cooking/recipes. I can follow recipes well, and can cook up some good food on my own. Unfortunately, I am balling on a budget being a 5th year college student. I can only eat chicken, rice, and broccoli so many days in a row before I get sick of it though. I'm a bit of an environmentalist, and hate how much meat is consumed by humans on a daily basis. I would love to learn of some *cheap vegetarian recipes, or even recipes involving meat/fish that I do not have to slave over for hours late at night after class/lab. I've thought about meal prepping but have never been able to make myself actually do it. I feel like cooked food tastes bad after it has been in the fridge for a few days.

I had an internship over the summer, and now that I am back at my University, I have begun working out once again. This semester it is my goal to be able to run a 5K, so I decided to download the couch to 5K app. I'm one week in so far. I play basketball recreationally with my roommate when we have time, and we are going to try and squeeze in some time to pump some iron when I am not in one of my 5 classes or 3 labs.

Any advice that you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. I am not happy with the way I look, and would like to change that. I need to lose weight to improve my overall cardiovascular health, my mental and emotional health, and in order to do the hobbies that I want to take up such as hiking/backpacking. (And let's be honest, we all want to get in shape to look good naked as well.)"

I am a new grad with less than year's worth of technical writing experience. I worked through college at low paying retail jobs and internships so the idea of anyone paying me even a decent wage is foreign to me. However, despite my lack of direct experience, I feel like I am a strong candidate and should ask for as much as I can.

The position would be at public software company in the Bay Area. They offered $75K for a base salary. When I checked Glassdoor this seemed like the average pay for a comparable company but I also saw a wide range of salary quotes. 

When I asked around someone suggested I shouldn't take anything less than $85K. Is it reasonable to ask for $10K more? I happen to know that the salary range for entry level positions at this company is supposed to be $60K - $80K but I don't know if that is a hard and fast rule. 

tl;dr: Should I ask for more than $75K for a Bay Area entry level position? "

Please help me maintain perspective.",very_confused_boi,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9c1rtd/i_blocked_her_yesterday_having_doubts_today/,"Hey. I need some perspective and convincing that I did the right thing.


My then girlfriend now ex girlfriend basically broke up with me through a slow and prolonged process of rejecting any suggestions to hang out for 2+ months, often through responding with passive aggressive comments that border on gaslighting. She finally cracked one day and told me she just wanted to be friends because she wasn't sure she'd be able to stay in the country (originally arrived here for an internship). We've tried to remain friends since, but it's just been weird, like she'll do things like unfollow my instagram but still creep on my insta-stories and when I ask her about it she'll tell me my instagram is annoying.


I finally said ""fuck it"" yesterday because it's hurting me so much how she's kind of in my life but at the same time not in my life at all. I don't understand what she wants from me but she seems incapable of having an adult conversation and acts with the same emotional grace as a 13-year-old (she's 28, a year old than me). I've been holding on for nearly three months now that anything would shift, telling myself that I just need to be there for her so she can get comfortable and finally open herself up. But yesterday it got too painful. I looked on her social media for the first time in weeks, and she seemed to already have moved on with her life, having fun with friends and so on. I just felt like a mess, so I texted her and told her that I had realized a friendship was never going to work out because my feelings wouldn't go away, then I blocked her.

The thing that is eating at me now is that when I looked at her Facebook page for the last time, she had just made a post that she had applied for a work permit to stay in the country. A part of me is telling me if I had just held on for a while longer maybe she would've felt secure and approach me again because of it, but the reasonable side of me is saying that she's been treating me like an inconvenience for 3 months now and that if she had really cared about me, surely she would've *told me* that this was something she was working on, or that I should stick around or whatever.

My friends tell me she sounds selfish because she found it more important to not expose herself to emotional discomfort and talk to me about things, and would rather just ignore me and push me away. I think they're right. I'm just not in a place where I can see it clearly. I even dreamt about her yesterday and woke up today feeling like I had made a mistake, but the relationship has already been dead for months now. If she really cared she would've reached out. She still has my phone number. I can't keep trying to rationalize her behavior where I have to be the only one acting like an understanding adult while she does whatever the hell she wants. Is it obvious I'm having troubles letting go? haha.

Anyway, just typing this out to clear my head. Please just help me affirm that this person ultimately would've been bad news if I had hung on. I keep feeling like I made a mistake, but I've been suffering so much now. I miss her and I love her, but I need to love myself too."

1. Would talk down to me like I was incompetant

2. Would command me to do things, including in public, she was mistaken for my mother on multiple occasions and would then go home and yell at me that I looked too young and that's why they kept thinking she was my mother. (we are 3 years apart but she is very overweight which ages her)

3. She would always say I was too sensitive and that many problems I had were things I made up because I remembered wrong or was just bitter/paranoid.

4. She tried to get in the way of me doing things that I enjoyed if she didn't also enjoy them because that meant they weren't acceptable past times.

5. Would bad mouth me to others then tell me about it.

6. Invite me to things and expect me to say no if she didn't really want me there or expect me to say yes if she did even if I was already doing something like studying.

7. She'd talk about how having siblings was like the same as having kids.

8. She'd hound me about things she wanted me to do even if I told her to back off and I'd have to end up trying to avoid her.

My brother always had anger management issues but overall was way more reasonable and tolerable than my sister. My problem now is that I'm realizing that he's mirroring her in a lot of ways (just to a lesser degree). This became much more intense after he turned 20 like he thinks he's the man of the house now because my dad is a push over... I am almost 5 years older than him but he tries to command me to do things and says that I'm going through ""teenage rebellion"" because I get irritable if he tries to do this. 

I always hoped I could have a good relationship with at least one of my siblings but today he was talking about how he thinks of what raising a kid would be like when he's talking to me and I realized that he's showing all the same signs as my sister (just not as extreme).

I don't think I can fix it because he told me he doesn't think I'm very smart or consistent. I'm just counting down until he goes back to college and I move to start my internship I guess.

Side note: My mom treats my dad a similar way. I inherited my dad's temperament and my siblings inherited my mom's temperament."

- Class rank: 2/420, might become 3 (instate).
- EC’s: robotics, UIL math (only distinction so far is a 2nd place district as a team last year), starting UIL cs and trying some coding competitions this year, NASA internship last summer, applying to the NASA HAS program this year but idk if I’ll get in, currently hand coding a website for my school to help kids prepare academically
- SAT: took it in August and since the test was already released I looked at the curve and it seems to be 1510 +- 20 (first time I took it so I still got time to improve if it’s worse)
- all ap classes so far
- interests: basically applied math, cs, and physics. Because UT’s aero program is very multidisciplinary I hope that those interest are sufficient

I bounced and spun like a diminutive ball thrown at full-force inside a narrow gap between walls. However, everything I hit was soft and tender and slimy and terribly sticky, which set my entrails roiling and built up an unbidden vomit.

When I ceased bouncing around, I drew a deep, lingering breath to convince myself I was still alive. I felt at my arms, face and legs. My hauberk and sword were gone, lost amidst this gluey chaos of disgusting noises. Fortunately, I was seemingly unscathed.

It was only then when I opened my eyes, and peered around. The blackness was deep inside the chicken-whale's mouth, save for a tiny, hovering red light in the distance.
""Is everyone alright?"" I asked, my words echoed through this vast place.

Three grunts followed, all slightly different, yet all very familiar. We'd all apparently made it. I sighed a sigh of relief. I’d been afraid of get slaughtered for lacking the wisdom of the golden apple.

""Tell me there's no water in here,"" Ramses said, and his skin started glowing inches away from me, bathing the place just enough to properly see some details.

We were all laying in the chicken-whale's enormous tongue. It was an unappealing sight, for it gleamed with slime and moved as if it were desperately trying to find a place it would never find.

Grandma, of course, started knitting and hovering in the air, strings of slobber hanging down her arms like flaccid icicles. ""There's no water here. As the golden apple had said, a pocket of air awaited inside the mouth of Timmy.""

Ramses shone brighter as he heard those words. His grin spun and spiraled wildly in his face, and his skin shone fiery and fiercely, giving us a proper view of our surroundings.
In front of us, a tall, wide, damp and blue tunnel-like pathway stretched into shadows. 

Judging by the fact that the tongue extended all the way through there too, I guessed it lead to the end of the chicken-whale's mouth and down its throat. A risky place to discover, but that strange, hovering light lay there, and now that we were here, I wanted answers.

I turned and my eyes grew wide with fear. Endless rows of teeth thrice my size lay beneath the tongue like a river of sharp, bloodthirsty spears. I tightened my grip, lest a sudden movement threw me into my death.

""Timmy?"" I asked, bemused. ""This thing is called Timmy? How do you know this one is Timmy?"" Then, the uninvited vomit finally took shape and propelled itself out of my body, and for a moment I turned into an endless well of sundry scalding substances.

""Timmy is the only chicken-whale who swims near the surface,"" Landren said as Not White pecked and swallowed the slime out of his hair. ""Everyone knows that.""

""Yes, Tom,"" Ramses said and shook his head. ""Everyone knows that. It's like not knowing that there are many things to do.""

""Many things to do,"" Grandma said, absentmindedly. ""Where do we go? Where do we go-go-go?""

""There's a peculiar light in the distance,"" I said and pointed ahead, deeper into Timmy's mouth. Then, I wiped off the errant pieces of vomit out of my face. ""I believe we should chase it.""

""I knew it!"" Ramses yelled and pointed a long, crooked finger at me. ""You are a moth-man. Your irresistible urge to follow and chase lights confirms it."" He burst into circular laughter. ""I knew it.""

I frowned. What a weird, changing effect the golden apple was having on Ramses. Grandma's was much more consistent. She was idly knitting, and she knew well there were many things to do. Ramses was simply all over the place with his emotions, and Landren, well, I couldn't tell. For all I knew, the golden apple had already consumed him.

""I'm not a moth-man, Ramses,"" I said and sighed. ""What I'm saying is that it's pointless to stay here, close to this river of teeth. Any sudden movement of Timmy’s tongue can kill us. We should go deeper, chase the light, and find some answers..."" I trailed off, brows wrenching down. ""What are we even seeking answers for? What we doing here? The idea was to capture one of these chicken-whale, not the other way around.""

""All in the right time,"" Landre said and stretched. ""All in the right time. We are following the steps of the golden apple. I know it can be frustrating not to heard its wisdom, but you've heard it once, and you knew all the answers to all questions. You knew every step you had to take to reach your objective. You knew the way of all things, didn't you?""

""I guess you could say that,"" I said and grimaced. It was true. In a inexplicable way, it was true. I didn't know why I did the things I did, but I didn't need to know to know they were the right things to do. If that makes any sense. ""Fine, I will trust you. I will trust the words of the golden apple. What should we do?""

""Go toward the light,"" Ramses said and swung his hand across the many teeth of the chicken-whale. Then, he nodded to me. I caught a glimpse of his eyes and closed mine, yet I had seen my worst nightmare already and I was left shaking like a sheared sheep in a vile winter.

""That's half-correct a quarter-right and a quarter-truth,"" Grandma said, the quick clinking of her knitting needles a sweet melody amidst the bowel-like sounds of Timmy’s mouth.

""Let's go. The clock is ticking, and there are many things to do,"" Landren said, Not White cawed and per
ched atop his head, and he stared ambling toward the light, whistling softly to himself.

We trailed behind him, studying the encompassing walls. Ramses served well as a lantern. There were white, thin ring-like protrusions bulging out the dark blue roof of Timmy's mouth. And of course, the strange tender light in the distance.

""Silence is not what the golden apple wants,"" Grandma said and shook her head. ""We should talk and talk and talk.""

""That's quite correct, quite correct, quite correct,"" Landren said and Not White cawed three times. ""Why don't we make a bet?""

""A wager,"" Ramses added, nodding to himself as if pleased. ""Bets are for the bandits and urchins, wagers are for fine gentlemen. I wager seven chicken soup coupons, four golden apples, seventeen stories told by a bare-footed blind man, and three cherries.""

""What's the *wager?*"" I asked as we advanced, getting nearer to the alien light, yet its source was still indistinguishable.

""What's holding that light, of course,"" Landren said gravelly. ""I will bet three Not White feathers, four golden apples and half my beard. My guess is a fairy in a green dress.""

""I burned that one alive,"" Grandma said and snickered. ""I will wage an infinite amount of woolen sweaters, and say that what's holding the light is nothing at all.""

""How do you know there's something holding it?"" I asked and they all looked at me through golden eyes. I sighed. ""I will wage my… my tabard I guess, and say it's a string of slime set afire being held by Timmy itself. What about you Ramses?""

""What about me?"" he said as we advanced. 

""You said what your wager was, but you never said your guess,"" Grandma said.

""Oh yes, you are right Mother Knitter,"" Ramses said and chuckled. ""How foolish of me.""

We kept walking in silence, Landren, Grandma and I sharing looks. Ramses trick was too obvious to fool us.

""Speak your guess now, Ramses,"" Landren said, ""or you are out of the wager.""

Ramses grunted, but sighed at last. ""I'm sorry. I wanted to get a visual advantage over you guys. I played unfair, and I hope you can pardon me someday. It's in my nature. Being demon often goes hand in hand with being a trickster. We have a lot of travel empathizing, but we are great at feigning it when someone has chicken soup.

""Besides, I'm hungry and craving perfect chicken soup. I can't remember when was the last time I had one, honestly. Feels like centuries ago. I can't imagine not knowing what my perfect chicken soup is, Tom. I pity you real--""

""Ramses is out of the wager,"" Landren declared.

""A lollipop!"" Ramses screamed. ""That's my guess.""

""A lollipop?"" We all said in unison.

""I'm not good under pressure,"" the demon of the fiery skin said and shook his head. ""But I should pay for my actions, because there are many things to do and those things can't be done wrong.""

Soon, we got near enough to distinguish what the light was, and what was holding it in place.

""I win!"" Ramses claimed, and lifted all his four arms in victory.

""That's a ghost trout not a lollipop,"" I said and frowned at the phantom fish. It was reading a book while holding a lantern just like ours. He stood above a dark, damp pit.

It was only when we got exactly beside the trout that it pushed its glasses down and examined all of us through haughty, round eyes.

""I'm Trout Troutington the Eleventh,"" he said and the book fell slowly to the tongue ground, as if it were a feather. ""I'm Timmy's proud butler. How can I help you today?""

""How can you hold a lantern and a book with those tiny fins?"" Grandma asked, frowning. ""Also, I'm sure you do many things, what things do you do?""

Trout Troutington removed his fin from the lantern's handle, and it stayed hovering as if he he was still holding it. ""It would be impossible to hold them. I simply use a little bit of magic, of course.""

""Could you guide us to Timmy's stomach and toward the red apple?"" Landren said and Not White nodded.

""Red apple?"" I asked. ""Why would we want to go get a red apple?""

""It's our ticket back to The Hall, sweetheart,"" Grandma said and gave me a grandmotherly smile.

""Of course I can guide you, gentlemen and lady,"" Troutington said and nodded. ""But I'm not sure if it will be so safe for you down there."" He rocked his head at the pit before us, which I was sure was the throat.

I burst in laughter, slapping my knee. ""Please, Troutington, don't joke with me like that. I survived Death, war, falling into an abyss and being eaten by a chicken-whale. This is child's play."" It was then when a doubt emerged from the deepest depths of my mind. I'd also survived a dragon-chicken made of nothing but bones, and I still didn't know from where their meat came from. I looked at Ramses.

He was no where to be seen.

A familiar laugh echoed far down the pit.

""Grandma, can you knit another woolen umbrella for me?""

Seconds later, she gave me another one, and we all jumped into Timmy's throat.

I still didn't have a clue of how we were going to take Timmy to The Hall so we could craft the perfect chicken soup and start building up our army to fight Death.

**Important:** I know I didn't post in a long while, and in case you couldn't read the sidebar what happened was that my intern's father was at the hospital and he had to be with him. That rendered him unable to work for these past days. He did have time to write at night when he came back from the hospital but he didn't feel in the right place to do it.

Luckily all went great, and he's back grinding now.

Especially painful for running node-sass, React, and mongoDB. 9 times out of 10 I end up having to kill node with task manager.

I went through a bootcamp and noticed that everybody else could just stop and start node with no issues, except for me. I have a custom build at home with a Ryzen 7 1700 and 16GB of RAM and Node has no issues. The same with the Mac book Pro ~2015 I had in my internship. 

I can't afford a new laptop right now. Would a viable solution to this be to add 4-8GB of RAM?"

But I kinda want to hear what's Women Advice about my situation. I'm Male, 21 Years Old.

I met this bi girl in 2015 (She's 18 right now), where we know each other and started a relationship. After 3 weeks she broke up with me because the person on her head, wasn't me, I accepted and tried recover the relationship when after 3 months i gave up and moved on, but we remain friends. On September of the same year, she started a relationship with a girl, when things went wrong I was there to support her, she cried and I was with her helping on her emotions. On May of next year she and her girlfriend broke up (Dealing with LR), and after 2 weeks or 1 month she started new one, with another girl. That girl prohibited her from talking to me, out of the blue we stopped texting, I asked her one day if wanna go out for cinema or go walk, and her girlfriend said whenever she goes with me, I will go too, I was like: fine by me (never happened). For 2 years my brain couldn't stop thinking what happened.

After 2 years she randomly texted me saying ""Hey wanna go out?"" I was like: Hey.. Sure? This was on a weekend, she was doing her school internship and would back again to finish it and start the contract they made to her. So we hanged out for 3 days (cinema, going for a walk, talk about what happened between this 2 years, etc) on the last weekend day (3rd) we went for dinner and cinema, I challenged her to text me during August month, where between 12-14 she started saying ""I forgot sorry"", I was like: ....?

Today I dreamed about her about we both getting hands and I texted her saying how it's going, She said would quit that contract because she's tired of the business stories, I told her how my professional situation was and she ignored me. Again.

Sometimes I feel that she's just using me, but sometimes I feel she isn't. I don't know what to do about this, any advice? please?

She says I'm her best friend, too. She have a very reserved mind too.

I declined.",Maduiz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9c64oh/me25m_with_my_gf20f_15_months_gf_got_mad_and_left/,"I live together with my best friend (27M). My gf started an internship on monday and didn't have much opportunity to talk or hang out with me. She wanted to come to me on Saturday to spend the weekend with me, but I was eager to see her and asked her to come over on Friday, with the note that I would go to the gym on Saturday morning. She agreed that this would not be a problem.

After going to the gym I noticed my GF was upset about something, I asked her what was on her mind but she didn't feel like talking about it so I let it be. She kept making remarks about how she didn't enjoy this day and expected today to be different than how it was going. 

I had told my friend that we would eat something after working out together (the three of us) and that after that me and the GF would go do something on our own. So my friend went out of the house to do something for herself and my GF was very upset. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that she was expecting today to go different because it was our 15 month anniversary. She had the idea to go have lunch somewhere together but never asked me about it. She was making a big deal, in my opinion, out of nothing. So I told her that I was sorry that it took a bit longer than expected but we could still go and do something fun (it was 3 PM at this point). But she got fed up with emotions and was angry at me and crying, after a bit of arguing she told me she hated being in my appartment and threathened with leaving to go home (to her parents house). I said I would be dissapointed if she'd leave, but she did anyway. I did not go after her because at this point I was fed up with her overreaction aswell.

She started texting and called me an hour later to tell me she was sorry she reacted in this way and shouldn't have gone home, but I had already gone to the supermarket with my friend to get some diner and we invited another friend to come over to eat with us. I told her we could meet up and talk about it after I would've had dinner but she then got upset I didn't skip dinner for her and why I didnt come to her. I said I would text her after having dinner and we'll see what we would do. 

After dinner, she told me I could come over to her, but as she was the one who stormed out of the house I told her I would appreciate it if she would come over instead of me coming to her. But she said she would not come because she did not like being at my appartment, I told I would still be living here for a few years so if this would stay an issue we would have to fix it. Now a few hours later she hasn't texted me anymore and I'm wondering if I'm at the right spot with my reaction. I feel like I should not accept this kind of behavior and that is why I do not want to go over to her. Because if I do come over it feels like I accept this kind of behavior and it could come back more often. 

I would like to hear your opinions on this matter.

TLDR: GF got mad at me for not giving my full attention to her all day. She went home while mad and apologized later and asked me to come over, I declined and told her I do not accept this kind of behavior and asked her to come to me instead because she was the one who left my place. She declined aswell. Looking for opinions."

9c6pez,36,2018-09-01,RANT: I wish we lived in a world where women felt more comfortable rejecting men honestly (and I’m not saying this is necessarily women’s fault).,hangingchadpenington,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9c6pez/rant_i_wish_we_lived_in_a_world_where_women_felt/,"So I (26M) have recently been going through a somewhat frustrating mixed signals situation with a woman (29F) I’m interested in and I’m kind of in limbo with her right now. I won’t go into too much detail, but I had asked her to come with me to an obstacle gym with me and she agreed to it and definitely seemed interested, but she has a very busy schedule (she lives a very active lifestyle and wears many hats) and it was tough for us to find a day to do it. When we eventually found  a day that might work she tried to see if she was available, but when she found out she was going to be busy she eventually said we may have to wait until “someways down the road” when she’s “not so busy with life.”

Now the thing is, based on what I know about her, I believe (for the most part) she was being sincere. She had shown signs that suggested she might be interested in me and she definitely has a busy lifestyle, and based on what I know about her dating does not seem to be high on her priority list at this point in her life. But there’s still a part of me that wonders if she’s just trying to protect my feelings.

I don’t like wondering whether or not someone whose company I enjoy is lying to me. I would much rather have an honest, straightforward yes or no answer so I wouldn’t have to wonder.

But I understand that a lot of times when women reject men, men don’t take it well, and sometimes react very inappropriately, so it can be scary for a woman to honestly and plainly reject a man.

So I’m asking my fellow heterosexual men: when you are rejected in a clear way by a woman, take it gracefully. I don’t like having to play these guessing games because of assholes who feel entitled to a woman’s attention penalizing them for their right to reject them. And as long as women are afraid that they will be penalized, berated, or even attacked for rejecting a man, we will continue to have to wonder what they really mean when they give us ambiguous responses to our approaches.

I was texting a woman (26F) last night who I used to go to college and intern with and who I am Facebook friends with after I saw her post on Facebook that she had bought a home. I hadn’t seen her in a while but I texted her to congratulate her and also to see how she was doing otherwise. We had a fun, friendly text convo. I discovered that she was doing really well for herself and I found out that her new home was near where I work. I suggested that we meet up at some point and catch up and asked if she had any free time anytime soon. She said probably not in the near future. I took the hint and told her: “I guess when you’re killing it that’s the curse it comes with lol. If your schedule does free up feel free to let me know.” Bam. Accepted the rejection, paid her a compliment, and left the ball in her court if she changes her mind without trying to pressure her.

WOMEN DO NOT OWE YOU SHIT. The only thing they owe you is honesty, and that’s not even a man-woman thing, that’s just a human thing. And the reason that sometimes we can’t be sure whether or not they are giving us honesty, the thing that people actually do deserve from each other, is because some of us act like they owe us something more.

Now I’m not saying that men and women need to be completely 100% open about every feeling and intention they have. Sometimes mystery is part of the fun. But we shouldn’t feel the need to lie to each other or be dishonest. If we’re not comfortable being honest then there’s a problem.

And, at least for me, I’m much more inclined to get upset with a woman for misleading me than for honestly rejecting me.

So I’m hoping men can find ways to make women feel more comfortable with honestly rejecting us, and I’m hoping women can muster up more courage to approach us with that rejection. Because I’m tired of playing guessing games."
9c72mj,2,2018-09-01,LÜM - My story and solution for finding new music,curtopaliss,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/9c72mj/lüm_my_story_and_solution_for_finding_new_music/,"Hello r/music,

Like so many of you, music has made an enormous impact on my life. I remember as a kid I would actually look forward to the bus rides before and after school because it was two 30-40 minute intervals where I could plug in some headphones and listen to whatever was my most recent download. Music quickly had become a personal part of my life. There’s just something about music that resonates with humans, it has its own way of connecting and influencing us.

I started college at University of Wisconsin - Madison in 2014 where I dove deep into music on Soundcloud while the electronic, house, and dubstep genres were starting to boom. I had gotten a little sick of mainstream music at this point and had pretty much stopped using Spotify. The music on there all sounded the same and only seemed to be relevant in my life when there was an ongoing internet meme with the most popular music at the time. What I shortly discovered was that the music I found myself most frequently listening to were the songs I had found on Soundcloud that had less than a 1000 plays or 100 likes. The music was good though, I had these songs on repeat. Finding my next favorite songs had started to feel like playing a game. It was incredibly satisfying to find that next hidden gem of a song and then share it with my friends.

Because music was so personal to me, seeing my friends jamming out to the undiscovered music I had shared made me feel accepted and valued in my social group. It was cool to be known as the “music guy” who had all the newest and best songs for everyone to listen to. One of the struggles I had ran into though was that there wasn’t a clearcut way to share music. Soundcloud has their share button, but there was no social aspect to music sharing, something my generation was used to having.

The people I had befriended that freshman year ended up being the people I was best friends with throughout college. Music had its place in our lives as we would always be looking for the next concert to go to with our favorite up and coming artists. I remember when Chance the Rapper and Chainsmokers had played a free concert for the student body on campus right before they had gone viral and were known by the entire nation. We were also big followers of G-Eazy and Jon Bellion before they were well known and it’s crazy to think about how far they have come since I had first heard their music. It seemed as if there were talented artists everyone in an age where any 14 year old could make my next favorite song with their laptop. How could I find them all? There just wasn’t a good way.

At this point I had started to fed up Soundcloud, as much as I had loved it, it seemed like it was going away from its roots of being the hub for newer and emerging artists to upload their music and was becoming more mainstream and corporate, essentially, just another version of Spotify.

During my senior year in at college (starting Fall of 2017) my friends and I had started a think tank. We were about to finish college and wanted to at least try to do something with our lives instead of going through with a traditional boring office job. We ended up deciding to start a company to address the issues that I had previously noticed with Spotify and Soundcloud.

After researching the music industry, we came away with this:

The barrier for making money as an artist through streaming was astronomically high, even though streaming, in general, is growing exponentially.

Current streaming alternatives are ineffective for promoting music as an artist, and equally ineffective for discovering music as a fan.

Concerts, tours, music festivals, and live music entertainment still created the best opportunity for all artists to earn income.

These realities helped us shape our platform to fit with our overall objective. We planned to use streaming as a means to an end to get emerging artists into live entertainment, and eventually signed by artist management and promotion companies.

Like I had mentioned earlier, the real issue is that current streaming platforms are predominantly tailored to mainstream music. More than 99% of audio streaming on current platforms consisted of the top 10% of streamed tracks. This meant that less than 1% of streams account for all other music. These streaming services increase the disparity in music promotion rather than reduce it. By focusing solely on up and coming music, coupled with passionate fans who want to discover all of the real music out there, we hope to change the way people view the success of the music industry. We will only hold music from up and coming artists with the goal of circulating more new music between friends and local areas to increase artist and music discovery so that we can grow the careers of the undiscovered artists out there. We had a place to start, now it was all about executing the plan and vision we had set out for ourselves. [**Live Undiscovered Music**](http://www.liveundiscoveredmusic.com/) (LÜM pronounced loom) was born, the first music streaming service built onto a social network designed to make the most connections possible between fans, artists, and venues.

After putting in a ton of man hours we had finally finished making our app and I am happy to say it is now available on the App Store for iOS in the United States. [**Here**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/l%C3%BCm-live-undiscovered-music/id1362731569?mt=8&amp;app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4) is the link for the download!

I have found songs on my app that I have played on repeat for consecutive days. The music is so good and the artists are so talented! The variety of music makes it so you’re always getting a new experience when you’re on the app. Some of my favorites are Flutter by Voog, Drowning by Philip Parchment, and Outsider by SATOS if you want to check them out and see for yourself some of the talent that is hidden out there. It’s incredible to think about how good these songs are, songs I would consider on par if not better than the music you hear pushed on the radio, Spotify, or Soundcloud.

I hope you enjoy the app as much as I enjoyed working on it with my team of Co Founders and interns. See you on [**LÜM**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/l%C3%BCm-live-undiscovered-music/id1362731569?mt=8&amp;app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4)!

TLDR; My college friends and I wanted a better way to discover and share new music so we made an app you can find [**here**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/l%C3%BCm-live-undiscovered-music/id1362731569?mt=8&amp;app=itunes&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4)**.**"

I'm also trying to look for small local companies in my area or cold calling to try to get an internship or part time position.

9c7efg,76,2018-09-01,[Serious]Women scare me.... I don't know how to look at them anymore,okaybody,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/9c7efg/seriouswomen_scare_me_i_dont_know_how_to_look_at/,"Hello. A little background, I'm currently a university student studying computer science. While I grew up my entire life thinking that I was liberal, I found out that my dating values and how I treated sex, relationship, and marriage was very conservative compared to my peers. I was in a serious relationship with a girl for 2 years before I found out that she cheated on me. She would talk to other guys online during our relationship that she'd just call ""friends"", but I didn't know she'd literally go out with another guy she met on Tinder and have sex with him. Finding this out broke me apart like as if my world was split in half and everything I knew and believed in was a lie. I started questioning every interaction with her. At one point I was desperate for an answer, I started blaming myself her for cheating on me. When I confronted her about this, she'd laugh in my face like as if she was taking joy in seeing me suffering. Weakened and humiliated, I broke up with her seeing as if she was fine with this new man she met.  
  

Few months later, she came back begging me to come back to her. I later found out through her that the man she cheated on me with was a drug addict nobody and she saw no future in him. She even said it herself that she felt no love or dedication from him as he only used her for sex. I, on the other hand,, at the time received an internship opportunity at a tech company that was willing to pay me to finish my degree while working under them. Upon finding that out, my ex was pretending like her whole ""cheating"" episode never happened and wanted me back. She told me how she wanted to have a family with me and how she'd be okay being a housewife taking care of ""our"" kids. She kept feeding me bullshit telling me how there was no guy in the world that loved her like I did. I still clearly remember her response when I asked about her infidelity. She told me proudly like as if she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth ""So what? So what if I had sex with another guy. It's just SEX."" I was disgusted and ashamed that this was the woman I took seriously for 2 years and was even considering marriage at some point.  
  

After I left her, I started to do research. I found out about MGTOW, read up on redpilling anecdotes and experiences, the concept of hypergamy, and other literature that went in depth about what I experienced. At first I was skeptical and thought there was no way all women were like my ex, but then I started to hear from my friends similar experiences and how they had it worse. I tried dating other girls, but found out that these girls also had other sexual aspirations. This one girl wanted to be in a relationship with me but also wanted to fuck around with another guy. As much as I appreciated her honesty unlike my ex, I was blown away at what I was hearing.  
  

So here I am looking for advice. I don't know how to look at women anymore. I always thought as long as I loved, protected, and worked hard for my partner and my partner in return remained faithful and supportive and at tough times remained by my side, we'd be able to raise a happy family and take on any challenge that came at us. II want to be fair, but because of my experience now I look at women as evil, vile, disgusting emotionally unstable whores that's willing to sell their bodies and relationships out for quick highs. I'm afraid to commit to any woman fearing that I would once again be in a vulnerable position like I was with my ex. I don't want to experience that humiliation and disgust ever again. My friends tell me to just pump and dump women. Use women like how they use us, but I don't take delight in other people's pain and suffering like how my ex did. I'm also the type that doesn't seek pleasure in having sex with random women. "

The idea kinda floated around in my head and recently I’ve started to try and take on the new lifestyle.

So 9 days ago I left for a design internship abroad. I thought this was a good chance to try it out because it may be easier as I am out of my comfortzone. So after leaving behind the comfort of my house, my video games, weed and ofcourse family and friends, my journey began. 

Right at this moment I’ve managed to take on this lifestyle pretty well, far from perfect may I proudly say. So today was one of the best things I’ve experienced in a while. Whilst I was showering I started to think of rap verses. Since Eminem dropped his Kamikaze album I’ve been listening to and thinking of  his music all the time. (You can tell I’m a big fan) so whilst I was thinking of rhymes with a bit of struglle here and there, this empowering energy started arising.
I gave myself into this and started feeling like I was being possesed.
Rhymes started to flow like crazy and without much thinking. It just spawned. 

So what I’ve learned that the lifestyle change unlocked me to feel this way again. When going to the club I go with this feeling and think less about rejection and opinions of others.This “possesion power” is a double edged sword though. As today is also the day that this state of mind affected my decision making. I decided to give into my urges. 
However I am still grateful for both experiences. 


Tldr: 9 days ago started. Noticed that nofap gives me a intense sensation of power, motivation, detication and inspiration. Feeling of possesion, wrote a rap verse out of thin air. Using this power to battle insecurity and doubt. Downside, this “possesion” feeling makes is harder to steer your away from urges. 

For anyone, thanks for reading! "
9c7ffq,1,2018-09-01,My (20M) girlfriend (19M) no longer wants to have sex,throwaway102917,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9c7ffq/my_20m_girlfriend_19m_no_longer_wants_to_have_sex/,"Hey everyone, I've been thinking about posting on this subreddit for awhile recently but after what has transpired today I feel it's necessary. There's a lot to unpack, so I hope I don't turn anyone away from the length of my post. I'll try to stick to the main points.

This all started around August 13th. Before this semester began, my girlfriend was working at an internship studying wildlife over the summer. Things went well during this period, we managed to make things work while she was away. She would drive back most weekends and spend them with me at my apartment. The weekend of the 12th happened to be her birthday; she drove back into town and we both celebrated it as long as we could. I think she enjoyed the time spent with me that weekend. After this, though, things began to change. During her last week of her internship she became distant, her messages were either very cold, or she'd simply wait hours to respond or not respond at all. At one point during this stint I went over a day without hearing from her so I sent her a message asking what the hell was up. To add to all of this, and what some of you might consider a possible cause to this, she had to live in a cabin with a few guys during this last week. I wasn't exactly comfortable with this, but it wasn't in either of our control so I didn't say anything since I trust her. During this time, I recall her mentioning one guy spent some time with her on a hike watching the sunset for her birthday. This same night I didn't hear back from her until the following morning. I don't think anything happened, but it still bothers me that she spent alone time with another guy on her birthday, and I didn't even really hear from her. Not to say that I want her to be alone on her special day, but I still feel as though a boundary was crossed when she went on a hike with this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

She came back that week on Thursday. We had planned to see each other the following day, and I worked until around 7:30 that night so I was pumped to see her. Turns out her friend was coming in from out of town, so she said she couldn't see me that Friday. I was bummed about this but I understood, since she likely wouldn't see this friend for a long period of time. Then the next day came, and she and her friend went to a mutual friend's ""apartment warming"" party. I was actually really hurt when I saw this from a mutual friend's post. My girlfriend didn't have any authority to invite me, but she and I both knew the girl who threw the party very well, and had been to her gatherings in the past. So I was a bit surprised I wasn't invited, but I tried to let it go since I don't think my girlfriend had anything to do with me not being invited, who knows though. Anyway, moving forward I didn't end up getting to see her at all until that following Monday even though she had been in town since Thursday. Funny enough, that Monday when we were set to hang out she said she was shopping with her friends for her apartment. I confronted her about this, and why she was flaking, and she ended up seeing me about 15 minutes after confronting her. Things seemed good once we were in person. Our text messages at this point were still pretty cold. She stopped sending goodnight messages like she normally would, so I did too as to not seem clingy or needy.

  
Over the week we saw each other a few times, and I guess it went okay, but that's about as much as I can say. She seemed pretty withdrawn At this point, she had actually started turning me down for sex which is uncommon, and kissing her felt almost empty. The following weekend she spent the night, and in the morning I tried initiating sex. She turned me down again, and feeling rejected I got up to take a shower. I came back and she asked what we were gonna do that day. I said I don't know, I don't really feel like getting breakfast anymore. She said it seemed like I didn't want her there anymore, and I didn't really respond. She left a few minutes after this. I'll admit here that I feel I was wrong to do this, but it hurts being turned down and especially after all that has happened to this point. We had a big argument/discussion over text but it almost seemed like we made up and I apologized for what I did earlier later that night at a party we were both going to. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past week though, things were worse. She stopped replying to my texts Monday afternoon, and texted me about a day later. I was mad about this, so I did the same. Then she didn't reply for almost two days before I asked why we were doing all of this. We had a long talk but came to the conclusion that we both wanted to continue dating and that we would work on our communication. That brings us to today. She and I hung out and went to a local park with a bunch of trails. After that we ended up having sex, except during sex she told me to stop because things didn't feel right. I was really upset, because I thought things were beginning to seem to improve and she dropped this on me. I've never felt more rejected than I did when she said that. It wasn't bad either, we both seemed to enjoy what was going on but I suppose I am wrong about that. Afterwards, we got into an argument and she basically said she didn't want to have sex anymore. I don't know why this is all happening. I don't know how this all started, if something happened or if it's her hormones or birth control or what. I really love this girl and don't want to lose the great relationship we have had prior to this, but I only have so much patience. I want to work with her through this if this is genuinely a libido issue like she said, she said she still loves me, but I'm scared she might just be saying that because it definitely doesn't feel like it lately. I don't know what to do. I don't even know how to go about improving where we have gotten."
9c7p5e,3,2018-09-01,I think i have thrown my life away,ToastiChron,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9c7p5e/i_think_i_have_thrown_my_life_away/,"Hey guys, i have a little story for you all. I am sorry for the formating in advance. I am not sure if i should put a trigger warning for depressed people. Here it is i guess.

I think this downward spiral started when i dropped out of my bankclerk apprenticeship almost 7 years ago. I figured i'd get another shot at something to do. Something that would befit me better than lying to people. The bank i was with was good at first, but there was no individual care for the apprentices, we were 20 at the time.

After dropping out i thought about what to do with my life, eventually i started working shifts in a factory. It was a good time, but not something i would want to do for the rest of my life.

Afterwards i did some internships for different newspapers. Again, it was fun, but i was barely paid anything.

I think the four years i spent in the military were probably the best i had. I have no idea why i left. I had it good there, but now the damage is done.

Spin back time over a year ago. I left the military of my country to become a digital media artist in a pretty nice school in a big town. I'd have to move away, but somehow fate meant it well with me and the first flat i looked at, was the one i ended up getting.

I was hyped, i was motivated. New people, new friends. All these new experiences. I was 24 at the time, now 25.

But over time, my passion for 3D modeling seems to have faided into the abyss. Enthusiasm turned into a daily grind. Getting up from bed was nearly impossible. I kept questioning why i am doing this to myself. It's not that i didn't have free time. It was just that i didn't leave my flat. At all. I mean, yea i went to the school. But that's about it. 

I was never one to go out and socialize, even though i think being social is one of my strengths. I have no idea what caused it. It was like a switch was flipped. I stopped going to school. I didn't tell anyone.

I don't think anyone tried to contact me. Or i was too scared to check. Being scared turned into the new status quo. Before at least i went outside to school. Now i was totally shutting down my social activities. The only time i really left my flat was to go shop groceries. And even that i didn't do if i thought i could manage a day without food.

It's been half a year in this perpetual nightmare. Two weeks ago i wanted to end it, but i think i am glad i didn't. A friend called me and i talked with them and they comforted me on the phone. It was the most i have really talked with anyone for a long time.

My mother and father came visit, like four times in the year i was away from home. When my father visited he wanted me to show him the city. I was afraid i would meet someone i know and that they would ask me where i have disappeared to. I have not told my parents that i have been out of school, without telling anyone, for six months now.

My mother jokingly asked that one time she visited. I think she knows. But i lied to her. I lied her straight to the face.

The worst thing is, i received governmental support during the time i was studying. I should've told them, but i didn't. I don't know why i didn't tell them. I was scared. 

For half a year i have lied to everyone i know. I don't want to disappoint everyone but tomorrow i will face it. I'll visit my parents and confess them everything. I hope they will understand, if they don't i don't know what i will do.

I don't receive healthcare and i don't have the money anymore to go see a psychiatrist. I should've cancelled the rental of this flat two months ago. I still haven't. It costs too much and i wont be able to afford it much longer.

If i'm lucky i'm not going to prison for fraud. If I'm lucky i will only have to pay back 25000$. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. The only thing i am living for right now is the fact that i am leading a D&amp;D campaign. It's the only thing that keeps me going. I don't think they'd want to play with me if they knew. Some, perhaps. I find great joy in sharing stories. I think it's the only thing i am good at, other than letting people down and lying.

This is the only place i was able to vent. I don't know if it feels good to get this off my chest. This probably reads like a jambled mess, i am sorry.

I had three breakdowns last week. The realization that i would've been dead if it wasn't for that call still hits me hard. TO imagine i would've never seen my parents again. I am not sure if i should be thankful. Or if this is just an extension of the torment. I'm not even sure which of my feelings real anymore. Today i started crying again. I wanted to. It felt good to let it out. But for some reason i stopped, and i had this feeling that wanted me to stop. It felt like nothing. Like it would be better to just put my emotions in a jar and seal it. I didn't want this, but it happened anyway. Then i freaked out. And then i totally calmed down and took out the trash. It seems bizarre. It is bizarre. I don't even know anymore.

I might update this, i will see how tomorrow will go. I hope my parents will be able to help me. I hope i can be helped."

Introweek at school.
-

I didn't have high hopes for the week. David cancelled on me and Jesper had a bruised foot. I mainly took care of the ""childeren"". The group was a lot of fun. The good thing was, was that we sticked together. We spent evenings and our mornings together. When didn't want to participate we chilled at one of our houses, and even watched a movie at the theater.

The feeling of being a leader, of being in front. Being important, it gave me so much energy. Even in mornings with little sleep I could wake up easily because in my head I had to. I had to set an example, and I loved to.

I drank a lot this week and was mostly tired and sick. So I didn't really have time to write. To summarize the things I endured during these days:

- I bruised my leg. Me and Martijn played American football, and he kicked the ball in the sky. I chased the ball looking towards the sky, tripping over a table and bruising my leg. My mobile phone is also curved now in the shape of my leg.
- I puked. But I wanted to, because if you did you'd get a ribbon. I was so proud when finally that ray of sunshine left my face.
- I sang Linkin park ""in the end"" in the club. For me this was an important moment. After asking for it 2 times. They finally put it on. Me and some other dudes were screaming along with. But then they stopped the song for another, but we kept singing, so they turned it back on. Dope moment.
- I danced like a maniac. At one moment I had a cloth in front of my face, and couldn't see anything. I felt a girl and danced like a lunatic with her. I put of my cloth and noticed who she was. The same girl I earlier had a crush on, but she didn't like me. Once noticed I went away, didn't want old feelings coming back. And I did the worm in front of random people.
- Watched the movie blackklansman in the theater, was fun.

HOLD ME TIGHT, AIGHT?
-
In the final moments of the week we held a feedback moment. I stood there in a circle with others, and behind me Irene grabbed me with her hand. Putting it on my stomach, and her face on my left shoulder. I grabbed her hand my right hand and played with her hand. I put my face softly against her head. We stood there for about 15 minutes with other people seeing us. Why would she suddenly do this? Not like I didn't like it. It's just that we don't know each other that well. Every time I see her I give her a hug. But that's all. We never had any real conversations. Despite it all, perhaps it was just friendly, perhaps she was just tired. In any case she felt comfortable enough to touch me, in a weird way I consider this alone to be a good thing.

AIRBORNE WALK
-
Originally we were supposed to walk with just us three. But a day before Lou cancelled. Maxime asked if I would prefer to walk with others or just us two. I said both are fine with me but still inching towards just us two because I want to know her better. We ended up going with the others. The walk was just 10 kilometers. But with my painful foots and bruised leg it was a bit difficult.

It was crowded and I don't really have a close click with the others (12 total). I did have a good time talking with Nicki, but with Maxime it felt off. I said some weird things and overal it was a bit awkward. At the end I was glad it was over. I wished I went with Jisse and his family. At the board night with his family I felt comfortable. In the future I do hope to attent more marathons.


The next weeks I don't have a internship because I still need to arrange something. During this free time i'm going to work on my diary and try to catch up."

Obviously working in IT instead of data entry for the season is sort of the best case scenario, but even if it's just an off-season gig I can work with that."

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

**CEO Caught Outside Sex Club!**

*Chief Executive Spanker!*

While we here at The Dirtload will go to most lengths to expose the juciest secrets of NYC's elite, we tend to stop short of putting ourselves in cages to get a scoop. Luckily, a fearless photog just happened to be on-site when Omera CEO Maliar Sade (click here for photo gallery) was caught leaving notorious Manhattan BDSM club Ebony &amp; Lace at 3 am last Saturday morning.

The 30k admission fee was surely no big ask for the kinky billionaire CEO - at least, it wasn't on Saturday. Today, the stock price has been whipped down a whopping 13%, and our forecasters at TheStockDrop predict it'll slide even further. Talk about getting fucked!

Funny. After all the doom-and-gloom predictions about Omera's cutting-edge gene splicing practices, who would've thought the company would go bankrupt because of the one thing no man can cut out of his DNA. 

But hey, don't tell him we said that. Last thing any of us needs is a spanking from a guy who looks like he could bench press a truck...

""I think we should just deny it.""

All eyes are on me when Trevor makes this suggestion.

""Deny what,"" I ask.

The five men around the conference table, the inner-circle of the company I founded, avert their eyes or cough into their fists. Everyone except Trevor, who might as well be sharpening a dagger right there at our oakwood table.

""You know Colbert did a whole three-minute piece on you last night, Maliar.""

""I liked him more when he was on Comedy Central."" In fact, I remember watching The Colbert Report back in my dorm, when I first started working on my company. Those were the days. back when I could buy a coil of rope and a ballgag without the whole world finding out.

""You should've seen how he opened the bit. I think it was, 'The BDSM gene.' No, wait, it was -""

""Trevor, enough."" Eric, the no-nonsense, BYU-educated CFO of our company, finally puts his foot down. Thank God. Eric and I have been close ever since the company was founded. I appreciate his capacity for work, even knowing he thinks what we do is some sort of mission from Mormon God. He could worship Satan for all I care; whatever the man does to get us funding is truly a miracle.

Now that Eric, in all his Latter-Day squeamishness about sex, has entered the conversation, even Trevor has to shut his fucking mouth.

""There's no sense in denying what's out there. I'm not going to tell any lies."" I pause. ""Besides... It's only a matter of time before someone at the club sells their story.""

""And uh, what would, erm, their story... be?"" Kevin, our Marketing head and de facto media manager, has no idea how to approach this issue. I guess Yale doesn't cover 'so your boss is a kinky fuck' courses in its Communications Department.

""Nothing interesting, if it's true.""

""It won't be,"" sighs Eric. ""They'll embellish and exaggerate and make sure it swarms social media.""

""Then we'll sue for slander,"" sneers Trevor.

""That could take ages, and we'll only fuel the public's interest. Even if we win, it's a pyrrhic victory.""

I know damn well Trevor has no clue what 'pyrrhic' means, but he huffs and crosses his arms all the same.

The group argues for a while. I stay mostly silent, knowing this is an issue better left to the rest. Still, the inability to lead infuriates me.

I started my own company to have control. I enjoy giving the commands and, when necessary, taking the heat. It's what being a boss is all about.

And a Dom.

There's no doubt here that I've fucked up. The club was a bore, not even worth going to. Has anyone stopped to think why I left at such an early hour? Of course not. These lot think 'SSC' and 'RACK' are CRISPr knock-offs. The people who read the dretch about me believe whatever they want. I'm all alone here - just like I was at the club.

One little fuck-up. A pitiful attempt to reassert some control over my sex life.

And look what happens.

""You know,"" says Trevor, ""there's an easy solution to all of this.""

The room goes silent again. All of them have about a dozen fires to put out in their own departments. Anything that gets them back to the work they know how to handle is good by them.

Trevor won't say it in front of me.

""You want me to step down,"" I say to the stunned audience.

""Well, of course not,"" he says with a flippant shrug. ""I only mean to suggest..."" He waves off the end of his sentence, knowing damn well that getting me out of the way is his ticket to my office.

Like hell if I'm going to let that happen. Losing is just not in my vocabulary - especially when it's losing to trustfund dicks like Trevor Buller.

It takes all of my self-control to remain patient and not strangle the douche from across the table. If my arms were a few inches longer, maybe I would.

Eric senses this. He's always had a nack for that kind of thing. Having 6 kids by the time you turn 25 must do something to a man.

""Any shakeup of our top brass would require a vote from the board,"" he says slowly. ""We can approach this topic next month during the meeting.""

""Or we could call an emergency vote.""

""I don't think that's -""

""The stock's about to slide another 6%. I think the eggheads would like to know.""

The silence in the room is so thick you could cut it with a knife. If you're into knife-play, at least.

I'm not.

""Where did you hear that?"" asks Kevin in a panic.

Trevor responds with another shrug. ""y'know, people.""

People. Trevor gets away with all kinds of underhanded shit - insider trading, for one, the source of his clandestine info. Not scandalous enough for the gossip rags or the SEC.

""Gentlemen,"" I say, standing. ""It's late. If the Board wants to call a vote, they'll inform Eric and I soon enough."" I take in a breath. ""And whatever decision they make... I'm prepared to follow.""

Follow. Not lead.

I swallow the bile in my throat and leave the building.

----

""There's another option, you know.""

Eric knew I'd be on the roof, looking out over the city. If I'm really going to be forced out of the company then I'll have to take every opportunity I can to look out on the view. Stare across the river and you can see the campus dorm halls where I started this venture. Look down to the first floor and you'll see the dusty sub-basement where we rented our first office. Now we're in the top 10 floors, most expensive real estate in the city, and we're looking to expand.

Were. With the way our quarterlies are looking now, thanks to me, we'll be lucky to keep our rooftop access till December.

Eric hands me a beer. Lord knows I need one. He's even got a sparkling water for himself. That's when you know things are bad.

I clink my can against his in a gesture he legitimately doesn't understand. He doesn't ask.

I listen after he takes a large swig.

""At the core, this is really an image problem, right?""

I lean over the roof, staring across the buildings, and nod. 

""Bigger they are, I guess."" Being a 30-year-old billionaire start-up founder made me as big of a target as anyone else in this city. I figured being a bachelor would keep me out of any potential sex scandals. Private life and public face could've been separate.

For someone like Eric, maybe. 

Not for me.

Just wasn't born that way.

""I'm not asking you to change who you are, Maliar,"" says Eric. ""You know I'd never do that.""

""Out with it, buddy.""

Eric places his can on the ledge. ""You need to get married.""

I stand up straight. ""Want me to start going to church, too?""

""You know I do.""

""I was being sarcastic.""

""I'm aware. Maybe you could put that aside for a moment and think about this. We're in a real pickle here, Maliar.""

A 'pickle.' That's Eric's version of 'fucked,' though it somehow carries even more deadly weight.

""I don't want to see you leave this company. I know you don't either. And yet we can't have a guy making our day-to-day decisions when the public thinks he's...""

I look at Eric.

""...Well, you know,"" he says, picking up his can to drink more bubble water.

I let out a deep breath. Eric's religion isn't the only thing keeping him back from tell me what he really thinks. He's a good guy, but he's just like everyone else. 

Vanilla.

""How is Jessica anyway?"" I ask.

""She's great. Trying for number 7 right now. She can't wait.""

That's great for him. It really is. The idea of having one child, let alone seven, is simply terrifying.

More than that - marriage? Settling down with one woman? I wouldn't even know where to begin.

Well, actually...

""I guess I could start looking for someone to settle down with."" A nice, keen submissive girl who knows how to handle a flogger on her tits.

Eric must see me smiling, because he snatches my beer away.

""No. Maliar. No.""

""I didn't say anything.""

""I *know* what you're thinking. If you go back to that club then we're just going deeper into hell. You need to find someone closer to God. Oh stop making that face, these are metaphors!""

I rub my eyes. ""you want me to find some goody-goody Mormon girl, some doe-eyed virgin who'll make me look squeaky clean.""

""She doesn't have to be Mormon.""

""Some kind of Christian.""

To that, he says nothing.

""As long as she's not Unitarian,"" he mumbles, taking down the rest of his drink.

So there it is.

Step down, or get married.

To someone pure.

Like that would ever work.

-----

I should be at work right now. 

Kevin, Eric, Trevor, and the rest of our staff, even the interns, are currently slaving away (no pun intended, and we pay well) on the latest research that will cure myriad diseases and unleash a new spectrum of possibilties for medicine, food, and health. Everyone except the PR department - which is denying interview requests left and right - is pursuing our one noble goal: to make the world a better place.

Right now, I'm staring down a Muchos Nachoes appetizer and a frozen margarita that's quickly turning to liquid.

What a way to meet your new wife.

When I agreed to this - with the board's approval and Trevor's sardonic smirk - I did so with some stipulations. I'd marry the girl. Whomever they picked. But once the stock went up, I could divorce her, no questions asked. I'd maintain my position as CEO and no, there would be no baby contract. This wasn't something absurd.

Just an arranged marraige between me and a stable, good-hearted, well-educated young woman chosen by a matchmaking service.

Simple.

I don't have to love her. I don't even have to like her. I just have to keep up appearances long enough for the story to pass over.

Then, we're through.

""Um, Mr. Sade?""

I don't even look at you, but I do stand up. All 6 foot 2 of me, sliding out of a chair silently, wiping my hand on the clean and colorful Tex-Mex napkin before extending it to you.

A handshake with my fiancee. How romantic.

When I lay eyes on you, I can only imagine putting my hands somewhere else.

You are fucking stunning.

""The service, um, sent me over.""

Fuck me.

Those quivering lips. Those big doe eyes. How much did they tell you? What do you think you were sent here to do?

What do you know about me?

Everything - or nothing?

And what am I going to do with you once we're married?

Right now, all I can think of is having you to myself. Fuck the club and fuck the company. We'll build a dungeon of our own and I'll keep you there when you're not on my arm at fancy galas and keynote speeches.

You are exactly what I need.

And once I train you, you'll be exactly what I want.

The world wants to see me tamed.

When I wrap my arms around your waist and pull you into me - my fiancee, my wife, my slave - I know I'm anything but docile.

I'm ravenous for you.

And soon, you'll be all mine."
9ca5t0,19,2018-09-02,What is the quickest way your party has derailed the campaign?,phiv555,dndnext,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/9ca5t0/what_is_the_quickest_way_your_party_has_derailed/,"So, I've been DMing a weekly homebrew campaign on Roll20 and just had a session this past week that really derailed the original tone and plot of the campaign by messing up super-hard and I absolutely love it.

The set-up was that the party (which composes the Wavemeet county chapter of the Bureau of Prohibition intent on ending organized crime in the county) was following up on a lead that the church of Lathander in the city of Wavemeet and specifically the leader of this church, Virtue, was involved with the importation of prohibited alcohol through planar portals. One of the PCs is a Horizon Walker ranger who can pick up on these portals and discovered that there was one located in the belltower, so they tried to go through the front door, but there were mercenary guards, so they created a ruse where one of the party members was a bell-maintenance guy, so he was let in and the invisible sorcerer made his way in too. They went to the belltower and tied a rope around a secure hold and shot the other end of the rope across to the roof of a residence across the street, in order to create a means of approach to the belltower for the next session, He left and the sorcerer stayed in the belltower, invisible for a few more minutes.

Cut to the most recent session: they decide to wait until nightfall to act, so the 2 members on the ground hang out while the sorcerer whose invisibility has run out hides in the tower that really lacks any good hiding place from anyone who would come up the stairs. He then hears the creaking of stairs as someone comes up the stairs and prepares a Scorching Ray at the figure that is approaching. Once the figure is in line of sight, he fires, then realizes it was the church's 2nd in command, the denim-vestment-clad Bishop Bluejeans (absolutely stole this from The Adventure Zone) who had let them in to look at the bell in the first place. At this point, it's clear that Bishop Bluejeans is heavily injured, but alive, so, in initiative order, he casts Thaumaturgy and yells at 3 times the volume of his normal voice, ""Help! Intruder in the belltower!"", to alert the mercenary guards at the front doors and proceeds to run back down the stairs. The sorcerer decides the best course of action is to attempt to leap down the stairwell and try to knock the bishop flat on the stairs and restrain him with his sword to his throat. He rolls a natural 1 (total of 3) on the acrobatics check. He has inspiration, so I allow him to roll again for advantage. Another friggin natural 1. With these rolls, it's inevitable that the sorcerer then falls down the middle of this 3-story spiral stairwell and lands prone at the ground-floor landing, taking 6 damage. 

At this point, the 2 party members outside have heard the Thaumaturgy of the bishop and proceed to head from the side of the cathedral to the front doors. The bishop continues to go down the stairs and opens the door to the ground-floor stairwell landing to the main chamber of the cathedral. The sorcerer gets up from the ground and moves to put his longsword against the throat of the bishop. The 2 mercenary guards at the front doors move into the chamber with heavy crossbows raised as they see the sorcerer with his longsword to the bishop's throat as the ranger and the warlock proceed around to the front of the cathedral. The sorcerer now succeeds on his grapple check to use the bishop as a human shield and has taken him hostage, blade against throat. The mercenaries and the sorcerer agree to lower their weapons and the sorcerer starts to question the bishop about the portal and the operation (which, unbeknownst to the sorcerer, the bishop isn't aware of, at all), getting more and more aggressive with this interrogation as he presses his blade against the throat of the bishop to draw blood as the bishop denies knowing anything and as the ranger comes through the doors pretending to be the guild-master who supervises the sorcerer, claiming the sorcerer was doing this out of being simply misguided by his passion and misinterpretation of a fictional guild's teachings to try and give the sorcerer an out. The sorcerer uses the Message cantrip to tell the ranger that he has an exit strategy (in so many words) and the ranger whispers back that if the sorcerer doesn't leave with the ranger, the ranger will leave him to his fate AND kill the sorcerer on sight if he ever sees him again. 

The sorcerer has reduced the bishop to fearful tears at this point, as the warlock asks if she can make the first godsforsaken Insight check of the night to see if the bishop is being honest with his denial and his tears. She fails this check, but this metagame potential inspires the sorcerer to make such a check and he finally determines that the bishop doesn't know anything and seems to be entirely innocent. The sorcerer decides to cast Haste on himself to try and make a quick escape, so the mercenaries fire crossbow bolts at him in response to this very apparent spellcasting, but miss as the ranger and warlock walk away from the situation and the sorcerer pushes the bishop aside to double Dash up the stairs to the rope line that runs to the roof across the street. He takes his now-sheathed sword, running it over the slanted rope-line, and slides down the rope to the roof across the street by grabbing either side. He then Firebolts the end of the rope-line tied to the cathedral belltower to cut through it, which he manages to do, but also setting the rope on fire as it falls to the cobblestone road below. He climbs down the rope to the ground and double Dashes back off the the office of the Bureau of Prohibition, failing to put out the flaming rope he left behind him (which will absolutely have consequences) as the other 2 head to the dockside tavern that their unpaid intern and NPC goblin bard hireling, Grumbles, lives at in order to find him and drink their woes away, illegally. This all took place within a less than 2 hour session.

Tl;dr - The party I DM for has really messed up and changed the original dynamic of the campaign and I love it.

So, what's the quickest that your party has ever derailed a campaign? How did it work out in the end?

9ca6d5,2,2018-09-02,just some venting,BackgroundPerformer,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9ca6d5/just_some_venting/," I just transferred to another uni (for the 2nd time) and I'm pretty stressed. On top of that, every-time I talk with my dad, who is helping me financially, says unstable things that really make me extremely paranoid about my future/life. 

He'll say things like:

\- ""well, I'm going to call your school and get my money back and you're going to drop out and you can just go support yourself""

\- ""well you can't drop out of college and go work, you need to get a degree!""

\- ""why do you keep applying to jobs and internships, school is your job! You're not working there!""

It's extremely draining and volatile, and he gets upset at me mostly for my 'miserable' and 'mentally ill' attitude/personality (i.e. depression.) I have seriously thought about taking out loans for school, and I have talked with my parents about it to which they laugh at. I don't know what they want from me, I'm always worried what they're thinking and it drives me insane. I can't ask them for help with loans and I don't qualify for government aide or anything. I'm applying to positions all around right now, but I seriously am just considering dropping out of uni and working full-time. It's not that I'm a bad student (I actually made Deans List), I just can't take this scary uncertainty of whether I'll still be a student or homeless the next day. 

During Freshman year of college I actually had to withdraw from a class because I was failing pretty badly. Ever since then, every-time I tell my parents that I'm struggling in a class, they threaten to withdraw me from my college. I know I sound super entitled and whatever, but again I can't talk to them about helping me with loans, etc. because they just laugh it off and sometimes yell at me if I bring it up. I'm only 19, but I feel like I should know how to apply for loans at least. 

My dad is also pretty upset that I don't really have a social life at college. I feel embarrassed on their behalf, almost like a criminal. I wish I could've been the pretty girl that got excited for prom, but that wasn't me. I really am trying to get out more though (jobs, volunteering, etc.), but they don't see it --- they always say that I'm 'too isolated' and that I should 'get a life.' I am fairly successful regarding jobs and school --- but socially, I'm pathetic, I have no close friends 

I'm embarrassed to tell them my career goals because they see me as some mentally ill person who ""can't ever help other people since you clearly can't help yourself."" I have asked them SO many times if they think I have a mental illness to which they say 'no' but then they say the opposite. I have been to doctors and a therapist who don't believe it's anything or only that it's mild depression and I've been off low-dose meds for about a year (yay!) and I do feel happy, but I tend to keep that happiness from my parents because I fear that they will trample it --- ditto goes for my career goals, because having that goal brings me so much joy and hope. I actually didn't want my parents to meet my roommate because I told her my personal career goal and I was scared she'd accidentally tell my parents (lol Im so petty and paranoid)

I personally don't think I am mentally ill or incapable of holding down a job or helping other people --- but I dont know, on one hand my parents know me better than anybody but on another hand I low-key have trust issues with them. I also have some great moments with them, but the bad definitely drown them out. Of course I know half of this is on me, but I just feel like I'm an unstable and insane person whenever I'm around them. 

I know I sound entitled, so people have real issues, but I have just been so depressed over this coupled with some other things going down in my life rn. thanks if you read the whole thing

9cagfk,1,2018-09-02,Privacy Issue With Parents,punny-mcgee,u_punny-mcgee,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_punny-mcgee/comments/9cagfk/privacy_issue_with_parents/,"So I'm living at home with my parents while I'm going to College to save money on dorming, and it works fine except for the fact that my parents won't let me lock my bedroom door. I am 22 years old, have never gone to or had an illegal party, never done drugs, never smoked, never hung out with gang members or Shady characters or whatever. Basically the only thing I do in my room are draw or read or just kind of lay around naked whenever my parents aren't home. 

However, a few years ago I found out my parents were going through my room when I wasn't home even though they had no reason to. I never gave them any incentive or reason to doubt me, but I randomly got a text from my mother one day asking why there was a bottle of vodka under my bed. Granted, I was 19 at the time so I was underage, but I was holding the bottle for one of my friends who had just moved into an apartment with one of his friends who had a small child and didn't want alcohol in the house, so I was holding on to it until he found someone to give it to (other than me of course).

Again, before this I had done absolutely nothing to warrant my parents searching through my room without my knowledge or permission, so the text came as a surprise and not a good one. I had fully trusted my parents to respect my privacy and the small personal space that I had that was my bedroom without having a lock on it, and that one text completely shattered that. That text told me that they not only didn't trust me, but instead of talking to me they decided it was a good idea to go behind my back and look through all of my stuff to see if there was anything bad, and instead of talking to me about the bottle of vodka, they accused me of being an alcoholic. (They were actually kind of late for that phase of my life because that was 16-18 year-old me when I was super depressed and kind of suicidal and they had no idea but that's another can of worms I'm not going to open right now). 

I'm sorry but I don't care if you own the house and if it's legally ""your space"" but if you're basically lending it to me then it's MY space and as an adult, I should be able to have the security of locking the door to MY room where all of MY things are. 

Anyways, at that point I thought I had the right to ensure that my privacy would not be violated again, so I went to Home Depot and I bought a new lock for my door that looks like the one I had but with a keyhole and could actually lock. I went home and that night after my parents went to bed, I very very quietly replaced the door knob on my door with the new one that locked and hid to the old one to be thrown out later. Now my parents had no idea that I had done this until I made the mistake one day of letting my paranoia get the best of me that they were going to go through my room while I was at class and I locked my door. 

My instincts were right and later that day I got a text from my mother yelling at me because my door was locked and she couldn't get in. This devolved into an hour and a half long text shouting argument about how I wasn't allowed to lock my door because it wasn't my house and I didn't pay rent and a myriad of other excuses why I wasn't allowed to have any privacy in my own home, let alone my own bedroom. I finally said fuck it, fine, when I come home I will put the old door knob back on. My father then demanded that I hand over the new door knob (that I had bought with my own money) so that I couldn't put it back on.

I was then expected to apologize to them for violating THEIR rights. Yes, I understand it's their house, but I am legally, physically, and mentally an adult and I should be able to have at least some semblance of privacy in the place that I call home. I felt really truly angry for the first time in a very very long time and so personally violated that I could not even have this small measure of assurance. When I went to ""apologize"" to my parents, my voice cracked a lot and I started crying tears of frustration, which my parents saw as tears of remorse and they looked like they felt nothing when they saw me like that. There was literally nothing in their faces that even remotely look like regret or shame for reducing me to this state. 

I went into my room and I cried for a very long time. Mind you, I had barely shed a tear since my dog died 4 years prior. That was how angry and violated I felt by this whole situation. But that day I had truly lost all the trust I had for my parents and quite a decent amount of respect, as well.

This is getting lengthy so time skip to the present day, I am now 22 years old so it's been three years since that incident, I have incredible paranoia about my privacy being invaded and my things touched or moved or taken without my knowledge that I keep absolutely everything of value or consequence on my person. Oh, and I am still not allowed to have a lock on my door. However, I have since replaced the door knob once again to one that locks, albeit this one is much more subtle and is not unlocked by a key but is unlocked by one of those little rods that you poked in the tiny hole in the doorknob. It looks exactly like my other door knob so my parents have yet to catch on that it can lock. They'll go away for weekends sometimes and I get really really paranoid when I am alone in the house for long periods of time, so I'll lock the door at night when I sleep. It helps a lot because before I wouldn't be able to sleep at all when they went away because I didn't feel safe. (They don't believe me when I say I have paranoia and insomnia but again, another can of worms to be opened at a later date).

My problem is, I don't want the door knob to be a secret. I want them to know about it and I also want them to RESPECT it and me. I want them to know that I don't want the lock on my door so that I can do ""secret terrible self-destructive things"" without them knowing because I don't do those in the first place. I want them to understand that my sense of privacy - that I haven't felt in those three years since I first found out that they go into my room and look through all of my stuff - is important to me and is not a personal attack against them. I've thought about sitting them down and talking to them about it, but I know that if I even asked for a lock on my door, they're going to suspect that I've already put one on and that's going to set them off. 

I am almost done with school but unfortunately have not been able to land a job or an internship in my field during my time there. I also have crippling social anxiety (that again, my parents don't believe I have), so much so that it actually interferes with my ability to work a part-time or full-time job such as food service, customer service, or even a cashier job. I'm an artist so I'm trying to build my fan base so that I can make my living off of commissions and hopefully catch the eye of some small company that will hire me to draw art for them. Then I can actually have a stable income enough so that I can move out and actually have my own lock without having to worry about someone telling me I'm not allowed to have it.

(( Not going to lie though, if I don't feel safe in my own house then my parents are obviously not doing their job entirely correct, especially if their reaction to me taking measures to make myself feel safer is to yell at and emotionally degrade me and then take those measures away and make me feel like absolute shit for trying to make myself feel safer. ))

TL;DR - I'm 22yo, I want a lock on my door, and my parents are very against it and won't listen to me when I try to explain why I want a lock on my door. 

Should I keep the new lock on my door that I put on anyways, or should I put the old lock on and then ask them if I can have a proper doorknob that locks? "

So, title tells it all i guess? 

My current choice is UI, because its the nearest from home (even tho technically its still categorized as ""far"") and with a lot of internship connection (not sure tho, but im planing to earn money after graduate and this seems like a big opportunity). 

UGM, because people always told me that Jogja is the most inexpensive city in term of living cost.

ITB, cuz people said that they excelled both UI and UGM in term of STEM, which is the subject I really like.

Still, more research is needed, but yeah, any suggestion? I'm considering getting Computer Science (cuz again, people said its easier to get job), but TBH Bio-Chem has been my fav since I entered high school.

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this.

Being the least enjoyable moment of my life in my list (worse than the loss of a dog, y'all know) I recently started to have pain again in the flank, but on the right. So far no hematuria but I'm scared and stressed as hell because of it. Since the first one I drank a lot of water everyday and got a blood analysis done.

My calcium levels in the morning before any eating are on the verge of hypercalcemia, and I have several ideas, trying to target the issue because I really want to escape the pain again.
The reason for my first stone seems to be a Uvedose (Vitamin D 100 000 UI) I took before leaving for Ireland, to compensate the lack of sunlight etc... Little did I know, it also stabbed me in the back with the kidney stone.

Know it got me thinking, is it possible that stones develop in both kidneys anyway but might fall out differently ? I heard that the left kidney is less irrigated and I thought it might have played with dehydration and all that.

What do you think ? Does both kidneys usually go rogue on you ? I certainly hope not, if it was, I just hope that this will be the last one... (6 months after the first one it's a shitty comeback)

Thanks a lot, I needed to vent off here and I'm really thankful for people here"
9cc5o7,2,2018-09-02,I'm tired of feeling so fucking lonely,altaccount72413,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9cc5o7/im_tired_of_feeling_so_fucking_lonely/,"I \[21M\] am about to start my 4th and final year of college, I have zero meaningful relationships in my life, and I don't know how to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hate it. I don't have many people to talk to, and the friends I have at college are basically just people I live with and/or people I get high with. I don't feel any bond beyond that with them, and come a year or two, I don't feel like I'll keep in contact with many, if any, of them. I've tried to join clubs and stuff and talk to people in class, but I basically just end up with a few introductory conversations and that's it. Maybe I'll add them on Facebook or follow them on Instagram, but that's it. I never really move beyond acquaintance . I guess I'm always terrified of appearing too forward or too weird, so I never really end up talking to people or doing anything with them. I'd like to think I'm reasonably pleasant since people stay acquaintances and are friendly when I talk to then if and when I run into them again, but my internal doubt on that point definitely gnaws at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent this last summer at an internship in a wonderful city, and I liked my job and liked the city, the same problem hit me again. I spent most of the summer getting high by myself in my room and going on Reddit or playing video games. Maybe every once every couple weeks I'd go to happy hour with a couple of people. I dunno, I guess I was just fine with it, because my internship the summer before had me in a not-so-nice city and I had crippling and borderline suicidal depression for most of the summer, which I hid from everyone else by putting on a happy face. This past summer wasn't that, my mood was generally upbeat and until now, right as the summer is coming to a close, I didn't have any emotional breakdowns. Maybe that's why I was so willing to ignore the issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time the weekend comes around, I want to do *something*. Dunno what, but something. And my brain tells me it's weird to go to random places alone, so I gotta find people to do stuff with, and well... I want to travel I guess, but my brain (and my parents) keeping hammering the point to me that I have to find people to travel with or else it's not worth going. And even if I did go somewhere I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I suppose my only friends at this point are internet friends. I'll talk in some Discords or subreddits (on my real account) as if it's some substitute for a social life, but that empty feeling keeps gnawing at me, that it's all bullshit.

I have a couple creative hobbies - making music and taking photos - but I haven't been able to form friendships over these nor any group to go do these with. I have a couple money-spendy hobbies, and every once in a while I'll spend some money in the hopes that it'll fill that hole, but it never does. I guess I fell into some online communities cause of them, which is saving me from complete isolation.

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously can't keep - hell, form - a romantic relationship of any kind, obviously. In part because I'm not really in the greatest shape, which I've been slowly trying to change but with less rigor than I'd hope, leading to only very very slow progress. Only very slowly shedding the weight I gained a few years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have this problem in high school, but right at the end I had felt pushed out by the friend circle I had felt closest to and that totally messed me up then - I wonder if all my issues over the past few years have been the result of not being able to properly cope with that. I gained a bunch of weight then too. I've been trying recently to eat better and stop drinking beers when I'm just by myself, and cut out weed entirely. Also been trying to sleep at better times. I want to go to the gym but I just can't get myself to regularly go.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with my parents is pretty much transactional at this point - I know my mom loves me and wants me to succeed, but I just can't relate to her on anything. We're so far apart on values, we share no common interests, and I don't think she's ever done a good job of connecting with me emotionally. Every time I call I just get a news bulletin of the previous week, and get the standard issue platitudes ""make friends"" and ""don't do drugs"" - I just feel like I have nothing to talk about. I just talk about how work/school is going, lie about having made friends, and lie about what fun things I apparently did that week. Oh, and my dad is an alcoholic who teeters between high functioning and hospitalized.  I'm just scared if I reveal the truth to my parents about how broken I am I'm just going to get lambasted for being such a fuckup.

&amp;#x200B;

And that's what I feel like - a high functioning fuckup. I'm doing fine enough in school I guess, probably not well enough to go to grad school like my parents hope (or at least the elite ones they're hoping for), but well enough to get a job at the company I just interned for. I have money, that's no issue, but I just feel so empty. I have no purpose, I have no relationships, I have nothing to live for. I don't even really feel alive, just sapient.

Maybe it helps just having written it down. I don't know one way or another. I'm just tired of hearing the usual platitudes - ""just put yourself out there"" and ""just go out and make friends."""

SSRI's?",HahaThisAccountIsATh,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/9ccper/internal_frame_extremely_weak_dont_know_how_to/,"Title. My ""internal"" frame is extremely weak, and I want to figure out how to fix that in y'alls opinion. 

Who I am:

Body: 21, 6'2"" white, low bodyfat, I'm muscly but not quite jacked yet. Have a fade haircut. Sizeable wrist tattoo. I already like my body, improving it won't improve my self-esteem.

Careerwise: Studying Engineering. Had an internship, looks good going into the future. At some point I think I'll want to go back to college to study Mathematics, but I won't do that until I've built up a bit of money first.

Interests: Math. I read a shite ton of mathy stuff because I'm interested in it. And not numberphile tier stuff, books like Radically Elementary Probability theory, alternatives to Von-Neumann Expected Utility, a tiny bit of quantum, etc. I'm also extremely interested in cognitive science. In my opinion, Where Mathematics Comes From will be instrumental in creating General Intelligence. Whenever I get bored, I usually do High Intensity workouts.

Social life: Didn't even have one until last year. I never had real friends until last year, just acquaintances. This fucked me up in high school, and it fucked me up in the beginning of college. My freshman year of college I didn't socialize. Had some housemates that high school me would love to be friends with, but they were such beta bitches I couldn't respect them. They are actually the reason I switched into Engineering from Computer Science. Computer Science has become the default major for thirsty Betas. My housemates showed me I didn't want to be like them. I started spiraling. Weak internal frame begets weak internal frame. Sophomore year I joined a professional fraternity. Internal frame was still extremely weak back then, made bad choices, creeped people the fucked out. I was sexually assaulted by someone in the fraternity when I was drunk. Didn't say anything for a semester, then told someone in my leadership. They basically let the school deal with it, and banned the both of us until the investigation ended. Did not help my reputation in the fraternity. I had nearly no evidence, the school wouldn't take any action against him. Fraternity unbanned us both after investigation ended. According to the fraternity he has as much right to go to their events as much as I do and i refuse to be in the same room as him, so they have effectively removed me from the fraternity. Junior year. Get purple pilled, use red pill principles to start sating this girl. Start acting beta around her, she breaks up with me for not being ""physically attractive"". Fuck. Join professional organization, made some friends, now a senior in college. This is my last year to not fuck myself up, but I'm alreay starting to make the mistakes I made with my fraternity around my new friend group. Not fun.

Sex: Fucked girl in high school, got none since. The girl I dated when I was a junior I never fucked, which is embarrassing. Feel cucked by life itself. Fuck man. 

Main problem: I know from the red pill how to act, how to hold frame, etc, but when it actually comes down to it, I fuck it up and I completely lose frame. It's incredibly difficult for me to apply frame to reality. 

Solution: Don't know. I think I should start taking SSRI's to fix my moodswings. When I get bad, I make horrible decisions that lose my frame horribly, I think this has been the source of most of my issues. Not sure though. I used to be incredibly against them, thinking all I had to do was change myself, but it's become really apparent that that plan didn't work out. I think it will modulate myself and my actions, just enough so I can actually apply red pill principles. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

What do you think about SSRI's?"

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9ceamr,0,2018-09-02,"[Advice] How do I build back the trust of my partner again. She has said that she wants to rebuild our relationship, but I need help",Random1090,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/9ceamr/advice_how_do_i_build_back_the_trust_of_my/,"Before I proceed with this post, I'd like to straight away admit my guilt and I absolutely agree with the fact that I have been wrong in doing what I have done. Also, I apologise in advance if I get carried away and this post gets too corny or mushy. All of this is kinda hard for me to process, and I don't really know what I will end up typing as I start to.

But getting to the point of it, I was in a relationship for three years with my girlfriend. Everything was going great. Except for the past 7 months. I had interned at a place in January, and I met a girl there. High society, super rich, conventionally would be considered unattractive but tried to make up for it by hooking up with as attractive men as she could. From the beginning it was quite obvious she was into me, along with some other girls, but I ended up kissing her one night after work at a bar. I woke up the next morning feeling like the most terrible person in the world, and I called up my girlfriend to tell her. Her phone was switched off. I tried to call her the entire day, until the next morning, when she called me that she was in the ICU because of a serious infection. Her voice sounded faint and weak, and to be honest, I didn't have the strength to tell her then. My world crashed around me, and I personally held myself responsible for whatever was happening to her. This girl tried to comfort me, but I pushed her away. I told her that this was something which was a mistake and this is it. But we had the entire duration of the internship and we ended up becoming friends. We had the same childhood experiences, same circles and what not, and admittedly she was fun to hang out with and easy to talk to. She constantly kept trying to get physical with, kept trying to touch me but I pushed her away and after a while she stopped. And I thought that I was having feelings for her. Me thinking this way was cemented when she called me up one night and told me about how her boyfriend had tried to force himself on her, and I could not just leave it at that. I can't say I have experienced the same thing, but I have had my own experiences of personal trauma where I couldn't do anything, and I wasn't going to run away from this situation. I comforted her, and that was when I thought I actually had feelings for her. In that moment, I didn't think about the love of my life, with whom I had planned my entire life around, but at that moment it was just this girl. I told her that I liked her and she made this entire thing to be relationship, and I never had the heart to not say no. I think I would be lying here if I said I didn't have the heart to. In my interactions with her, I had seen how much she enjoyed messing up people's lives and in her own words, she said ' I live for drama'. Anyway, we had sex twice. The first time it happened, she had invited me to her home because her mother wanted to meet me, and she cried while telling me about how much she likes me, and she hasn't ever felt this way about anyone this way apart from her ex of 4 years. I tried to do it, but stopped mid way because I couldn't maintain my erection. I just felt too guilty. I stopped midway and I left soon after. The second time it happened, it was week after week of one worded messages to her, not really talking to her, frankly because I didn't want to, because I realised what a mistake I had made, and I felt immensely guilty. I tried to end things on some occasions, but then she used to howl and cry and tell me about how much she likes me, and what all she has done for me ( she basically told the entire social circle of my city that she was dating someone who has a girlfriend), and time after time I didn't break it off. I resigned myself to living this freaking terrible double life. I didn't meet this other girl a lot, never really responded a lot to her messages, didn't talk to her on the phone, basically did everything I could so that she'd stop liking me. But she held on, I kept telling her that I can't sleep with you, I can't kiss you, I can't do anything that you want, I feel too guilty and I don't want to. But this 'relationship' continued, until I just couldn't take it anymore. She goes to London to spend her summers, so I decided breaking this off at that point would be the best. She'd have this to cool down and get over it, but she didn't. She used to message me, and ask me to talk to her, I didn't budge for a while, but then I did talk to her. The conversation used to be small talk for the first 10 minutes or so and then she proceeded to ream me out about how I haven't been nice to her, about how she can't sleep because of this, about how she had to go the hospital because of her migraines which had spurted up, and I used to do nothing but listen to it, and apologise profusely. She came back, wanted to meet me, I kept stalling it. Until one day, she dropped the ultimatum that she's going to tell my girlfriend. I told her not to, but she didn't budge.

I had planned to tell my girlfriend after she was done with her job interviews which were going on at the time. I basically planned to tell her when she was in a good place in her life and she could kick me out of her life and not get so messed up. But she didn't budge, so I ended up meeting my girlfriend and telling her. I told her everything as it was, and she cried and she told me that she needs some time and she'll call me. I felt relieved for the first time in 7 months, but then this girl called my girlfriend at night and filled her with lies. And she proceeded to do this for the next couple of days. About how I asked her hand for marriage, about how I talk shit about my girlfriend to her, just terrible made up things. I talked to my girlfriend about all of this, and she realized that this girl is lying and she has ulterior motives. But in all this tirade, my girlfriend stopped trusting me. She told me that she doesn't believe whatever I say anymore. We had the most precious moments we have ever had in these past 7 months. We'd finally come to the conclusion that we want to spend our lives together, and we'd started working on making it happen, sorting out our jobs and what not.

She wants to forget all about those 7 months. I cried for days after telling her, she blocked me from everywhere. I drank myself to numbness. I have become a smoker now, I used to smoke ocassionally, but now I'm addicted. I don't dare touch alcohol, because I don't get drunk anymore. I just keep drinking until I just can't hold it anymore, and then I sob until I go to sleep.

I talked to my girlfriend after a few days, she told me that I did all of this because of some messed up reasons she can't comprehend and she can't help me with. She said that she wants to forget all of this, live her life until she's strong enough to try all of this again. She told me that she blindly trusted me, and I broke that trust and she doesn't know how will she be able to trust me again. Since the day I confessed, I have told her nothing but the truth, but I can't really blame her now, can I. I've been ostracized by her friends, and that also includes my best friend of 8 years. I haven't spoken about this to anyone, about my side. It's not like I tried, I tried to speak to her friends but they didn't care to listen, or believe me.

So yes, it's been one month and 8 days since I last saw her face, and 22 days since I last heard her voice, and I don't know what to do. I don't know what I can say or do, that will convey the fact that I couldn't bear to sleep with anyone else except her, and I tried. They say that time heals things, but the pain keeps increasing day by day, I don't know how to process any of it.

I'm a stereotypical man brought up by traditional notions of masculinity, and I'm not someone who expresses his emotions. I don't know how to process any of it. I've been depressed, I've had suicidal thoughts, but the only thing that has kept me going is that one day she'll call me, and I will get to see her again.

I keep thinking about her all the time, but I can't bear to think about her during the day or the evening, I don't know how many men would be hitting on her, who would touch what I have touched.

All this while I kept thinking to myself, why did I do all of this. What I did was inherently wrong, and I keep thinking about why I acted out like this, why did I keep this charade for so long. Speaking honestly, intitially I enjoyed the attention I got from the other girl. I had always kind of felt unwanted with my girlfriend, somewhat I felt I was less than her. Going back to how we started dating, it makes sense.

So, we were classmates in high school and I had a crush on her for the longest time until I manned up and told her. She didn't reciprocate and I was left feeling unwanted for upwards of a year. I did everything I could in my power, but that didn't really translate to anything. I mean I helped her out with the guy she liked and it didn't really work out by the end of it. Anyway, fast forward a year, and I decide to give up. A few weeks later, she calls me up to tell me that she likes me and voila, we started dating soon after. Though I was headlong into this relationship, in love with her from step one. She didn't feel the same way initially. But she did fall in love with me eventually, and she loved me intensely and truly. We had the most beautiful relationship, with it's shares of fights and disagreements but there were no grudges. But I always felt lesser than her. This was cemented when we broke up a year back. It was over some issue which we wouldn't budge over, and she finally decided that she has to protect herself first before me, so she decided to break up with me. I ended up calling her, telling her that I think differently about it, now. I can't bear to be without you. The fight was over the fact, that I would eventually in the future want to sexually explore someone else. She was my first and only, and I felt that I was missing out. But exploration had nothing over being with her. And at that time I felt lesser.

Right now I feel lesser than her. I dream about her almost every night. I wake up and it takes me a few hours to put on a facade of me being okay. Before this, I hadn't cried in years, but these days, I'm afraid to be alone, lest I break down again. I can't listen to music, I can't watch movies, I can't fucking bear to see other couples, and I keep looking for her features in other women. It sucks to be this way.

I have gone on a long tirade and typed all of this out, and to those noble souls who have taken the time to read this in entirety, is there anything that can be done? What do I do to bring that infallible trust again? How do I bear with this period of being alone, because this gets worse as time passes. I did wrong by her, but what can I do to show her that this episode made me realise that there is nothing in other women for me? And what do you think of this entire mess that I've managed to create?

tl;dr I cheated on my girlfriend of 3 years. Tried sleeping with the other girl but could not, but still counts because I did use to kiss her and everything. My girlfriend doesn't trust me anymore, wants to build this back up again but I don't know what to do to get her trust back again.

In that moment, I didn't think about the love of my life, with whom I had planned my entire life around, but at that moment it was just this girl. I told her that I liked her and she made this entire thing to be relationship, and I never had the heart to not say no. I think I would be lying here if I said I didn't have the heart to. In my interactions with her, I had seen how much she enjoyed messing up people's lives and in her own words, she said ' I live for drama'. Anyway, we had sex twice. The first time it happened, she had invited me to her home because her mother wanted to meet me, and she cried while telling me about how much she likes me, and she hasn't ever felt this way about anyone this way apart from her ex of 4 years. I tried to do it, but stopped mid way because I couldn't maintain my erection. I just felt too guilty. I stopped midway and I left soon after. The second time it happened, it was week after week of one worded messages to her, not really talking to her, frankly because I didn't want to, because I realised what a mistake I had made, and I felt immensely guilty. I tried to end things on some occasions, but then she used to howl and cry and tell me about how much she likes me, and what all she has done for me ( she basically told the entire social circle of my city that she was dating someone who has a girlfriend), and time after time I didn't break it off. I resigned myself to living this freaking terrible double life. I didn't meet this other girl a lot, never really responded a lot to her messages, didn't talk to her on the phone, basically did everything I could so that she'd stop liking me. But she held on, I kept telling her that I can't sleep with you, I can't kiss you, I can't do anything that you want, I feel too guilty and I don't want to. But this 'relationship' continued, until I just couldn't take it anymore. She goes to London to spend her summers, so I decided breaking this off at that point would be the best. She'd have this to cool down and get over it, but she didn't. She used to message me, and ask me to talk to her, I didn't budge for a while, but then I did talk to her. The conversation used to be small talk for the first 10 minutes or so and then she proceeded to ream me out about how I haven't been nice to her, about how she can't sleep because of this, about how she had to go the hospital because of her migraines which had spurted up, and I used to do nothing but listen to it, and apologise profusely. She came back, wanted to meet me, I kept stalling it. Until one day, she dropped the ultimatum that she's going to tell my girlfriend. I told her not to, but she didn't budge.

I had planned to tell my girlfriend after she was done with her job interviews which were going on at the time. I basically planned to tell her when she was in a good place in her life and she could kick me out of her life and not get so messed up. But she didn't budge, so I ended up meeting my girlfriend and telling her. I told her everything as it was, and she cried and she told me that she needs some time and she'll call me. I felt relieved for the first time in 7 months, but then this girl called my girlfriend at night and filled her with lies. And she proceeded to do this for the next couple of days. About how I asked her hand for marriage, about how I talk shit about my girlfriend to her, just terrible made up things. I talked to my girlfriend about all of this, and she realized that this girl is lying and she has ulterior motives. But in all this tirade, my girlfriend stopped trusting me. She told me that she doesn't believe whatever I say anymore. We had the most precious moments we have ever had in these past 7 months. We'd finally come to the conclusion that we want to spend our lives together, and we'd started working on making it happen, sorting out our jobs and what not.

She wants to forget all about those 7 months. I cried for days after telling her, she blocked me from everywhere. I drank myself to numbness. I have become a smoker now, I used to smoke ocassionally, but now I'm addicted. I don't dare touch alcohol, because I don't get drunk anymore. I just keep drinking until I just can't hold it anymore, and then I sob until I go to sleep.

I talked to my girlfriend after a few days, she told me that I did all of this because of some messed up reasons she can't comprehend and she can't help me with. She said that she wants to forget all of this, live her life until she's strong enough to try all of this again. She told me that she blindly trusted me, and I broke that trust and she doesn't know how will she be able to trust me again. Since the day I confessed, I have told her nothing but the truth, but I can't really blame her now, can I. I've been ostracized by her friends, and that also includes my best friend of 8 years. I haven't spoken about this to anyone, about my side. It's not like I tried, I tried to speak to her friends but they didn't care to listen, or believe me.

So yes, it's been one month and 8 days since I last saw her face, and 22 days since I last heard her voice, and I don't know what to do. I don't know what I can say or do, that will convey the fact that I couldn't bear to sleep with anyone else except her, and I tried. They say that time heals things, but the pain keeps increasing day by day, I don't know how to process any of it.

I'm a stereotypical man brought up by traditional notions of masculinity, and I'm not someone who expresses his emotions. I don't know how to process any of it. I've been depressed, I've had suicidal thoughts, but the only thing that has kept me going is that one day she'll call me, and I will get to see her again.

I keep thinking about her all the time, but I can't bear to think about her during the day or the evening, I don't know how many men would be hitting on her, who would touch what I have touched.

All this while I kept thinking to myself, why did I do all of this. What I did was inherently wrong, and I keep thinking about why I acted out like this, why did I keep this charade for so long. Speaking honestly, intitially I enjoyed the attention I got from the other girl. I had always kind of felt unwanted with my girlfriend, somewhat I felt I was less than her. Going back to how we started dating, it makes sense.

So, we were classmates in high school and I had a crush on her for the longest time until I manned up and told her. She didn't reciprocate and I was left feeling unwanted for upwards of a year. I did everything I could in my power, but that didn't really translate to anything. I mean I helped her out with the guy she liked and it didn't really work out by the end of it. Anyway, fast forward a year, and I decide to give up. A few weeks later, she calls me up to tell me that she likes me and voila, we started dating soon after. Though I was headlong into this relationship, in love with her from step one. She didn't feel the same way initially. But she did fall in love with me eventually, and she loved me intensely and truly. We had the most beautiful relationship, with it's shares of fights and disagreements but there were no grudges. But I always felt lesser than her. This was cemented when we broke up a year back. It was over some issue which we wouldn't budge over, and she finally decided that she has to protect herself first before me, so she decided to break up with me. I ended up calling her, telling her that I think differently about it, now. I can't bear to be without you. The fight was over the fact, that I would eventually in the future want to sexually explore someone else. She was my first and only, and I felt that I was missing out. But exploration had nothing over being with her. And at that time I felt lesser.

Right now I feel lesser than her. I dream about her almost every night. I wake up and it takes me a few hours to put on a facade of me being okay. Before this, I hadn't cried in years, but these days, I'm afraid to be alone, lest I break down again. I can't listen to music, I can't watch movies, I can't fucking bear to see other couples, and I keep looking for her features in other women. It sucks to be this way.

I have gone on a long tirade and typed all of this out, and to those noble souls who have taken the time to read this in entirety, is there anything that can be done? What do I do to bring that infallible trust again? How do I bear with this period of being alone, because this gets worse as time passes. I did wrong by her, but what can I do to show her that this episode made me realise that there is nothing in other women for me? And what do you think of this entire mess that I've managed to create?

tl;dr I cheated on my girlfriend of 3 years. Tried sleeping with the other girl but could not, but still counts because I did use to kiss her and everything. My girlfriend doesn't trust me anymore, wants to build this back up again but I don't know what to do to get her trust back again."

9cf7rm,1,2018-09-02,"Computer science college student on full ride with $28,000 saved up – what’s next?",PolarityConsultant,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9cf7rm/computer_science_college_student_on_full_ride/,"Here is some background information: 

* Male, single
* On the verge of turning 21
* Full-time computer science major at a large state school (University of …. )
* Will graduate debt free (Tuition + room + board all paid for via scholarships)  
* Did a full-time internship with and currently work ~20 hrs/week for an application development company who I have been with for a year now (and love)
* 3rd year in college but plan on graduating a year early in May 2019
* $28,000 saved up total. $18,000 in a Vanguard S&amp;P index fund and the rest in savings
* If I do receive a full-time job offer from my company, it is estimated I will start out making somewhere between $60,000 – $70,000 annually
* I plan on staying unmarried in my 20s and don’t plan on having kids for the foreseeable future (if ever)


If for some reason things don’t work out and my current company doesn’t offer me a full-time job after graduating, I could always push my graduation back a semester or 2 (which opens up some opportunities) or accept a job offer with another company.

My biggest problem is in spending money. I grew up in a very frugal life style where I only spent money on items I needed or items I really wanted (spent weeks dreaming about). 

Now I have some disposable income, but I’m struggling to feel happy spending some of it – I know this feeling will only amplify once I get a full-time job. 

Outside of work, I don’t really have a whole lot of hobbies. I lift weights, DJ, occasionally grab dinner with friends, and go to concerts/shows (which usually involve traveling).  

Since I truly believe in reddit, I’m looking for advice on how to allocate my money during my last year of college and beyond. I don’t want to die rich (monetarily speaking), but I also don’t want to die in debt.

9cfjf0,3,2018-09-02,"As requested, here’s my MIP experience (US, age 19 at the time)",cheddar742,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/9cfjf0/as_requested_heres_my_mip_experience_us_age_19_at/,"I got an MIP last year for driving with an almost empty bottle in the vehicle (hadn’t been drinking at all that day, it was left over from a camping trip that I forgot to take out). I had to go to the municipal courthouse twice, the first time only to be told I may have my license suspended since a vehicle was involved (again, not for a DUI, only possession; the cop didn’t even feel the need to breathalyze me) and the judge would need me to return for a more focused hearing *months* later or some nonsense like that. Let me reiterate that because I was driving, rather than walking down the street, in possession of an open alcohol container, I could have been charged with *aggravated fucking assault*. I got pulled over for rolling through a stop sign on an empty road at night. If I were an aggravated criminal who shouldn’t have a license, you’d think they’d suspend it on the spot, rather than letting me set my second court date several months out (so that I could work for the summer as long as possible on the off chance they suspended my license and I’d have to quit and apply at a local fast food place or grocery store).

The whole ordeal cost me almost $500, which might not sound like a ton, but as a broke ass college student who works like a motherfucker to have some spending money to enjoy myself occasionally, it was enough to really piss me off.

What’s worse is now I have to be doubly careful until I turn 21. A second MIP in my state is a *minimum* $1,000 fine and a guaranteed 6-12 month suspension of my license. Losing my license would mean I wouldn’t be able to drive to work, meaning I’d lose the internship I earned through years of hard work in and out of school (much of that volunteer work in my community), which is an internship that will likely land me a very nice job right out of college. 

Knowing this, I’m not sure if it means I ought to drink more or less. Right now, it’s definitely more, but in much more secluded, private places. I’m very fortunate that the judge let me off “easy” with only a couple hundred dollars court fee and a few sessions of paid alcohol education at my university. I’ll be absolutely fucked if I didn’t get hammered after sitting through that bullshit (half of it was about sexual assault, which sickens me to think they were implying that because I got an MIP, I’m a more likely candidate to commit any form of sexual assault than some dry bastard who goes to parties just to pick up drunk girls to take home. I know some of those people and I’d trust a blackout drunk 10 times out of 10 before one of them).

What this all has taught me is no level of government in the US, county, state, or federal, gives a flying fuck about you as soon as you crack open a can, smoke a joint, or otherwise seek a couple hours to unwind after working absolutely non-stop to earn those few hours. Doubly so if you’re under 21 (I’m 20, when I got MIPed I was 19). I have younger brother and the advice I’ve given him is that no alcohol laws, besides driving under the influence, matter unless a cop shows up, and to just call me so he can come drink at my place with his friends in safety when he’s a little older. The amount of bologna you have to put up with the get a drink as a young man in your high school or early college years is insane, and I live in a pretty liberal state with legal weed and everything. I can’t imagine what other states force on their broke, depressed students. "

R34 Ideas inside.,Television-RP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9cg98s/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_r34_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, bubble butt opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Game of Thrones**; Daario or Robb Stark would be my top choices. Maybe even Mero! I'd like for them to be fucking a Dany impersonator with a great curvy body. [For more information on this idea, click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6oinsu/f4m_the_queen_of_anal_daenerys_targaryen/)

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Trial And Error**; Josh the lawyer, please! A backwards little town with him fucking a gorgeous new intern or simply having a night of fun.

♥ **Great News**; A few ideas that mostly revolve around sneaking, fucking during a live broadcast, etc. If you play Greg, I would like to be a secretary, reporter, a celebrity guest on the show, etc!

♥ **A.P Bio**; Glenn Howerton does such a great job in this show! I think having him pound a student's mother would be fun. Whether she's a sweetheart, or a bratty PTA mother who needs to be humbled.

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. My preferences would be Jeff fucking a librarian/tutor/new spanish teacher/nurse/etc.

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **Daredevil**; I'm solely interested in Matt! I would like to play as a female criminal such as Black Cat! Other than that, a secretary/intern/woman coming for help to his office would be ideal.

♥ **Luke Cage**; You play as... *gasp*! Luke Cage. I'm very open minded for this but that body of his manhandling a curvy gorgeous woman? Let's do it!

♥ **WWE**; There's a bunch of people I love there, both present and former! I can play people ranging from fans, to sexy referees, announcers, interviewers and new divas!

♥ **Limitless**; The TV show! Not expecting many people who've seen this but you playing as Brian would be the best!

♥ **MTV's The Challenge**; A bit of a niche show! If you're familiar with it, I'd love to discuss the possibilities we could play out.

♥ **Big Brother (US)**; ^ Read above!

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

♥ **Man From U.N.C.L.E**; Illya, Napoleon or both! Having either or both pumping a sexy spy, informant, daughter of their target, etc for information is just too perfect, isn't it?

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. **Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot!** I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love; anal, creampies, rimming(giving/recieving), roughness and dirty talking. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"
9cgckf,16,2018-09-02,KNOWLEDGE REPORT - Part 1 of 2,Larry_Toomajan,scientology,https://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/9cgckf/knowledge_report_part_1_of_2/,"INTRODUCTION

Earlier in my life, a Scientologist whose job is to open accounts for people at the church, didn't open one for me intentionally. Her actions helped Scientologists to swindle me out of any money they can get their hands on and any opportunity for recourse or justice.

At first, I thought everything that was happening was my fault so, I searched for any mistake I was making to correct it. But, in my search I learned Scientologists harm people under the guise of religion instead.

Any person with knowledge of a crime to report, that doesn't report it and/or conceals facts about it, is guilty of the same crime themselves.

KNOWLEDGE REPORT - Part 1 of 2

I was born in 1959 in Elizabeth, NJ to car dealership manager Thomas Toomajan and his wife Jessica. I was their 4th and last child. I have 2 sisters, Helen and Lorraine, and 1 brother, Thomas. My name is Lawrence. My mother was an incompetent sort of person and unemployed for my whole life. But, I was blamed for my family's problems, neglected, denied things, unjustly punished and beaten. When I was 13 and in 8th grade, my sister Helen's now ex-husband and my brother, shared their marijuana with me. I was ignorant of the consequences and it impacted my future. We moved 6 times. I attended 7 schools in 2 cities for a diploma. My family bought or found on the street and adopted 4 dogs and 4 cats they fed, housed, supplied veterinary care to and bought gifts for that came first before me. I lived in fear of the future. My sister Lorraine, was in New York and bought a Dianetics book from a Scientologist selling them on the street. She brought the book home, read some of it and put it in a box in the basement. In 10th grade I found the book and read it. I wrote to a Church of Scientology listed in the back of the book for more information. A person wrote back, I called there, someone called back, I was invited to the church in New York on W. 74th Street and I went there alone one morning. I fled the only home I knew secretly to save my own life.

A girl Debbie Kagan (registrar) introduced me to church staff who gave me IQ and personality tests, things to read and an interview on an e-meter. I was issued a written technical estimate of over 250 hours of auditing at a cost of about $25,000.00 starting with 75 hours of Life Repair auditing. The staff said auditing will erase any sources of uncertainty I have in life forever and give me new abilities. I took the estimate home to my parents, but we couldn't afford it. A week later Debbie Kagan, came to our house unannounced. Normally, my mother would have been home alone, but I was home from school that day too. Debbie opened an account for me at the church with $10 of her own money for a TR's course. I went back and repaid her $10 the next week and started the course. After 2 days, an ethics officer Sally Allerdice, took me off the course for not having a parent or guardian with me and sent me home without one either. My mother and I then went to the church and my mother met with Sally. Afterward, a staff member wrote and called my house saying to bring both my parents to the church for a meeting on a Saturday with 2 Sea Org members Karla Bennett and Frank Caporale. I did and at the meeting I agreed to wait until I am 18 to do the course and see Sally Allerdice before starting.

When I turned 18, I called the church and made an appointment to come in. Sally Allerdice was Day staff so she was usually there weekdays. I got there around 10:30 a.m. on a Thursday. Carmen Pino Vilinsky (receptionist) said when I got there that Sally Allerdice couldn't be there. Cathy MacMurray Ondreicka (registrar), greeted me instead and took me to her office and introduced me to Susan Christie Davis (treasurer). Cathy, Carmen and Susan were Foundation staff, so they only worked evenings and weekends normally. Susan and Cathy claimed I don't need to see Sally. They took the Day church files under my name gotten from when I was a minor and switched them to the FDN church files so the church was credited twice for getting me in, signed up, paid for and on a course once. Cathy took me to the course room, introduced me to the course supervisor Bart Dobin, and I started the course. I liked the course and got a ""Student of the Week"" award for good attendance and academics. I remember my first real win on the course. I was so truly excited. I went to see Cathy MacMurray Ondreicka to share it with her, not knowing who else to tell. Even though she listened, she had a resentment toward me in her eyes I will always remember. It is the first time I ever saw a person feel hatred toward me. I saw Sally Allerdice around the church and I thought she would be happy to see me but, she wasn't and she didn't care that I started the course without seeing her first, and she was annoyed about me wanting to talk to her. She eventually became President of the church in New York and joined the Sea Org at Flag. Mid-way through the course, the supervisor Bart Dobin, started pressuring me to ""hurry up"" ""speed it up"" because he needed students to graduate by Friday night. I was also hounded by staff and Sea Org to work there and told my auditing and training are free if I join staff and auditors make $12.00 an hour. The minimum wage was $2.30 at that time so, I joined NY FDN staff not feeling ready for the Sea Org. I was still in the middle of my first course when I became temporary staff. I was not officially contracted. I worked 36 hours 7-days a week evenings and weekends and was paid about $4.85 a week. My supervisor Bob Cucarullo, hung an oversized stained torn Confederate U.S. flag on the window of our office for curtains. Commuting to New York by train round trip from New Jersey took over 2 hours and cost over $5.00 daily not including food. So, I was already paying out of my pocket to work at the church to get more training to become permanent staff. I wanted to be an auditor.

I was in the church's central files room gathering folders to bring to a staff all-hands letter writing party. I found letters on file exchanged years earlier between my sister Lorraine and Susan Christie Davis regarding if Lorraine had read the Dianetics book she bought or not and was she interested in learning more about Scientology. Lorraine wrote back that she wasn't interested. 

Many church staff worked for Scientologists outside the church and were paid cash without taxes deducted from their earnings. Raymond Baiardi the NY FDN Executive Director, had an untaxed pillow making business called Livingcraft in a 2nd-floor loft he rented at 110 W. 17th Street. NY FDN staff members Carmen Pino Vilinsky and Frank Tiernan worked there. I was given a job there I didn't want. Carmen Pino Vilinsky's husband Peter Vilinsky (NY FDN staff) ran a sales office with a Jewish girl named Rivkah on the upper west side. They sold bulk ginseng roots and offered me a job there paying untaxed cash only so, I turned it down. NY FDN Staff member Margaret Isaeff offered me a job as her replacement at a furniture manufacturing plant at 120 W. 20th Street called Loftcraft that she was leaving. The company paid taxes so I accepted. I worked part-time in the Loftcraft offices on weekdays and at the church evenings and weekends. Loftcraft was owned by Randolph Parsons (NY FDN student) and his wife Isabelle Szuldiner Falcaro Parsons (NY FDN auditor). L. Ron Hubbard written church policy states, anyone with a terminal illness may not join staff, the Sea Org or get auditing or training at any church organization. Randolph Parsons died of blood cancer (leukemia) and it was not widely known he had this disease until he died, despite the fact that he received training and auditing at more than one church and was well known and liked. Isabelle was a very temperamental girl and announced to the church that people she was in the middle of auditing were not qualified to be audited. She would cease auditing them and request in writing they be declared. I recall one guy she did this to named Raul Batista who was very upset about it. The Parson's gave L. Ron Hubbard a bed made by Loftcraft on his 67th birthday and he wrote them back a letter Isabelle read to the staff at staff muster where he thanked them for the gift. Public Scientologist George Goodrich was Loftcraft's General Manager. My senior was Marcia Valente-Cruz (NY FDN staff) who told me not to talk about Scientology with people there that are not Scientologists.

I did not own a car, but Isabelle did and was driving for over 10 years. She sent me to the DMV to register Randolph's car, that by law could only be done by him in person. A DMV official told me Randolph must register his car in person. I told Isabelle this when I got back and she acted like she never heard of this policy yet. Loftcraft was cited by the city of New York for over 65 building safety and workplace code violations. Prior to a follow-up inspection by the city Isabelle had me go through the entire building (several floors) and remove anything in sight associated with Scientology. A large heavy wall mounted Org Board fell on my left arm while being removed from the main office area and a 2"" long screw protruding from it caused a deep gash leaving a scar that can still be seen today. Not one person at Loftcraft even offered me so much as a band-aid. I used toilet paper from the men's room and scotch tape from the office to bandage my arm until I got home. Marcia snapped ""Get your fucking TR's in"". I could not report the accident to the State of New York or it would draw attention to Loftcraft and/or the church. So, I was required to write a Knowledge Report to a certain person at the church and the matter would be addressed within the church. I never reported it to anyone. It took a couple of weeks for my arm to heal. At this time, I was in the middle of the Student Hat course at the church. Within 1-week of the accident, Isabelle told me I was PTS and fired me.

I was a promiscuous person at one time and I shared some of the details of my sex life with my boss Bob Cucarullo at the church thinking it would be confidential between us. But, he reported me to NY FDN ethics officer and Loftcraft employee Nancy Garcia. I went to her office to be interviewed and she said I was PTS and she wanted to know who the SP is that's influencing me to act this way. I could not verify with her who the SP is she that she is talking about so she said I must petition the Guardian Office in writing for permission to be in Scientology instead. I sent a petition to NY Assistant Guardian Antros ""Andy"" Savas, explaining to him somehow that I was PTS and needed to be a Scientologist. I then waited for his response. Raymond Baiardi the NY FDN ED, sent me to a mission on 6th Ave. in Greenwich Village to work while my petition was under review. Mr. and Mrs. Howard and Mary Rower were the mission holders. I typed up documents and letters, distributed church literature, assisted students, ran errands for the staff and helped at public events. I worked on the New York Dianetics Book Campaign at the mission as well, to get Dianetics books out to local book retailers.

Debbie Kagan (NY Day registrar) now worked for the GO with her new husband Pat Ward. In spring 1978 she invited me to work for the GO on the 4th floor of the church. I signed a $10,000.00 non-disclosure bond never to speak of my activities in the GO to anyone. I divided my time between the mission, the GO and the church. In the GO I fund-raised, typed, ran errands and was issued a small cassette tape recorder with headphones attached to it. I listened through the headphones to cassettes playing on the recorder and typed everything I heard chronologically into documents verbatim. On the cassettes, were recorded conversations that took place on the phone or in person between Scientologists and people believed by the church to be church enemies. The enemies were never informed they were being secretly tape-recorded. When a Scientologist arrived at their door handing them an envelope containing typed transcripts of their conversations to convince them to change their position on Scientology, they found out. Susan Becher, of the NY GO, sent me to the Waldorf Astoria in a taxi one night to give an envelope full of documents like this to a male guest staying there. One of the GO's biggest enemies was New York journalist Paulette Cooper, who gave Scientology negative reviews in the press. In 1973 Ms. Cooper was indicted for sending bomb threats through the mail to the church. In 1977, while she was awaiting trial, the FBI raided Scientology churches. In addition to finding what they raided the church for in the first place, they found evidence the GO mailed fake bomb threats to the church on stationary with Paulette's fingerprints on it to frame her. I got to the GO one afternoon and it was filled with girls talking and talking. A girl stepped out of a side office door and showed everyone the shoes she had on and said, ""And, they're in style too!"" The other girls looked at her and at each other and waved and said, ""Hi Paulette!"" ""Hey, Paulette!"" ""Oh, Paulette!"" Included in the FBI's findings was proof the church also hired a body double to impersonate Paulette and stage crimes in New York that she could also be framed for. The girl who stepped out of the side office door in the GO that afternoon and showed us her shoes was Paulette Cooper's body double. This is the reason everyone there greeted her and each other as Paulette. I had not yet heard of Paulette Cooper at the time.

Debbie Kagan Ward and Raymond Baiardi (NY FDN ED) held a briefing for church staff I attended to announce the GO has uncovered that INTERPOL is a drug smuggling ring. Debbie Kagan Ward said if I was not busy in the GO, to word clear students in the church academy. Neil Levin (EO Nancy Garcia's husband) and Mike Spallino were the NY FDN academy supervisors. I was never trained to be a word clearer and the materials I word cleared people on were way above and beyond my own training and auditing level. People came to the church and bought training and auditing at full price and I word cleared them. They then helped other church public or staff through their auditing and training. One woman I word cleared Vicki Farrara, was on the Hubbard Standard Dianetics auditor course and she eventually left the church to become a very vocal critic of it on public TV. Her name is now Vicki Farrara Marshall. An auditor must do an internship at the church to be certified as an auditor. A 15-year-old girl Bonnie Bea Blake with no working papers, no high school diploma and no training as an auditor, supervised paid public and staff internships. Her mother Eva Blake was a NY FDN auditor.

Staff incompetence caused people to leave the church, become upset and request refunds. One guy was bullied by course supervisor Bart Dobin and other church staff so his back was to a wall as they berated him for questioning their qualifications. NY Day staff members Angelo Petruolo and Aldona Calinore had a shouting match out the front door of the church as he walked off his job. A well dressed, literate young woman came in to complete a step by step form the church gave her, to be issued a refund. She got to the step on the form that took place in the department where I was seated at one of the tables inside of at the time studying something. The man in charge Ron Pratt, (NY FDN Qualifications Secretary) ignored her, eyeballed her, smirked, chuckled and made her stand in the room unattended as staff just walked by and ignored her for over 10 minutes.

Busloads of Scientologists (over 150), went from NY to Washington DC to protest outside the FBI building about the 1977 raids carried out on the church. The trip was sponsored by Howard &amp; Mary Rower at whose mission I worked so, I was asked to go. It was on the 6:00 p.m. TV news. The Rower's held a GO fundraiser at their Hudson Street loft with Scientologist Arthur Maren as the guest speaker. He was just released from jail for refusing to comply with a grand jury investigating Scientology.

I never heard back on my petition to the GO. So, I asked Bob Cucarullo about it and he said to re-submit it. I petitioned L. Ron Hubbard this time. A month later, I didn't get a response from him either. So, I wrote him separately to inquire and asked that he send his response to my home address instead of the church. I then heard back from him within 10 days. He said, he had approved my petition and sent it back to me weeks before and was concerned I didn't get it so, he sent me a copy. With this, I got a job with an apparel designer in New York who wasn't a Scientologist and I stopped working at the church, the mission and the GO. A staff member at the Rower mission David Simon, upon learning I was leaving spat insults at me that he said he meant to tell me months ago and he didn't know what stopped him.

Loftcraft went bankrupt and the Parson's along with George Goodrich and his wife Dina moved to Los Angeles and opened a diner called New York George's on Fountain Ave. that eventually burned down. It was located across the street from a former hospital complex the church bought and turned into a Scientology university-like complex.

I thought perhaps the NY church was just poorly run as it was staffed by public people instead of Sea Org. So, I bought a course called the Hubbard Personal Ethics and Integrity Course from a Sea Org staffed church. To do it, I had to go to ASHO FDN in Los Angeles. My registrar there Karen Jensen was arranging for a job and place for me to stay in L.A. in advance. While she was doing this, I got calls and letters from SO members who persuaded me to join the Sea Org. I packed my things and went to L.A. to be in the SO instead and made Karen Jensen aware of the change in plans. I stayed at a hotel in Hollywood called the Hollywood Inn the church owned. Sea Org members lived there and worked at the church about 1 or 2 miles away. Men slept several to a room in bunk beds. I walked to work, took a bus or got a ride from a SO member. For several weeks I worked at FOLO WEUS. The group was housed in the former hospital complex the church bought. I was given manual labor to do 80% of the time and got 1 day off every 13 days if my production high. I worked part-time at AOLA across the street in the office of Fred and Gretchen Schwartz (the Flag Service Consultants). Church food was rationed, unhealthy and some of it made from white powder mixed with water. I ate most of my meals outside the church with my own money. I was not paid anything the whole time I worked there. My senior Grace Brown was paid $1.50 a week. I was given auditing and security checking but no training.

A big linoleum floor at FOLO WEUS had to be mopped and the mop and bucket were filthy. There was no detergent, no bleach and no money to buy any. I mopped the floor with plain water as staff walked all over it as I mopped. I asked Grace Brown for a solution and she said, ""try using warmer water"" and ""hurry up because the commanding officer is complaining the floor is dirty"". I left the floor dirty. I went to Celebrity Center in office clothes to tear up rugs that had ¾"" long carpet tacks sticking out of them without protective gloves on. I was assigned to clean a Sea Org kitchen that had 2"" roaches crawling in it and mouse droppings everywhere. Everyone at FOLO WEUS was on a course except me. I could not persuade Grace Brown to let me do the course I paid for at ASHO FDN. She said I was going to Flag to be trained as an auditor and must buy an e-meter and books with the money on my account at ASHO FDN instead. I was not qualified to own or use an e-meter yet but, I followed her orders and went to ASHO FDN to make the purchase. I was not asked for ID or proof I had the right to buy an e-meter. I was only asked for the name on the account being used to pay.

I decided the Sea Org was just not for me and I went roller skating rather than to a staff meeting. I returned and was dismissed from the Sea Org on sight by some guy I had never even seen before. Grace Brown issued me a list of auditing and training to be completed before re-applying for the Sea Org. I left the books I bought at FOLO WEUS because they were too heavy to carry in my luggage and I brought just the e-meter home with me. I received my auditing folder from FOLO WEUS in the mail with instructions to give it to Cathy MacMurray Ondreicka at the church in New York, which I did. I don't know what she did with it. That same night, I went to see the Flag Service Consultant in the building to discuss doing my Sea Org re-entry program at Flag. The FSC was a Sea Org woman whose name I didn't get because she wouldn't tell it to me or, take my personal contact information or money to open a Flag account for me with or, tell me anything about Flag other than to say the weather is ""still warm down there."" She finally blurted out point blank ""You've got a problem! Look! I'm really busy and I don't have time for this, OK?"" There was no one else waiting to see her. She didn't ask me to come back at a later time. I said I would try to come back later and she waved her hand and said, ""Why don't you!"" I left as the church was closing for the night. At a Flag event in New York the following year, this woman was the emcee and introduced herself to the audience as Kitti Georgius Kahn. I was in the audience or else I might never have learned her name. Music artist Amanda Ambrose was performing at this event that night and needed help setting up the stage for her performance so, I volunteered. After Amanda performed I went backstage and she thanked me. We were talking, and Kitti Georgius Kahn came in the room and interrupted us to laugh and tell Amanda I was a joke. I went home shortly after. Howard Rower was at this event with his wife Mary. I went to see him at the mission once to ask him for money for Flag services but he said no. I contacted Flag myself by phone and through the mail from home and opened an account at Flag with a small initial deposit on my own.

A Sea Org member is viewed as a dedicated Scientologist by staff and public. The examples that Sea Org members set are supposed to be ones to be followed at all times. I saw Kitti Georgius Kahn verbally confessing O/W's to people at the church more than once, instead of in writing to an auditor, security checker or ethics officer like she is supposed to do per church policy. I didn't have any experience communicating O/W's to anyone myself yet when I first observed her doing this so, as far as I could tell she was doing what a Sea Org member is supposed to do.

At this point, I took a brief break from Scientology to re-think things.

I got a letter from NY FDN ethics officer Alma Jamieson and I went to see her. She showed me some references by L. Ron Hubbard and asked me to write up my O/W's and turn them into her. I was only free on weekends, so I spent a few hours each weekend during the spring and summer of 1979 writing up O/W's for the first time. Alma went to Flag for training and 3 other EO's stepped in instead; Mario Zea, Tom Ondreicka and Anna Balash in that order, one replacing the other. So, I basically had 4 ethics officers for the same interview. When I finally had no more O/W's to confess, I attested I was finished and I felt like a very ethical person ready for any amends I had to do. 98% Of my O/W's were from years before Scientology. I had no felonies to report or outstanding warrants. I was not a criminal church member so, I was very excited about it but, I got no help from any Scientologist anywhere regarding how to do my amends. So, using a book by L. Ron Hubbard as a guide, I did my amends on my own outside the church in writing with the appropriate authorities. Naturally, I wanted to share this win with the church too, but unfortunately that is not possible either. Anna Balash took over and said she was a Dianetics Clear and had found several key points that disqualified me from Scientology that were overlooked that the GO would have to review before I continue any training or auditing. These are the key points.

1. SUPPRESSIVE GROUP MEMBER: I wrote a letter to the Church of Satan when I was 15 to ask a question about their religion. Someone from there wrote me back with an answer and added me to their mailing list. Anna said communicating to them ""constitutes membership in the group because they operate on intention"".

2. ATTEMPTED SUICIDE: I was playing with my father's gun when I was 16 and fired it by mistake. I told Anna ""I'm lucky I didn't kill myself"". One night I took too many Nytol (an over the counter sleep aid) to try and sleep and was nauseous. One afternoon I took too many buffered aspirins and had a ringing in my ear for about 1 day. Anna said, ""that constitutes attempted suicide.""

3. PROMISCUITY: I was sexually promiscuous when I was young. Without making excuses, the same way 26 million other teenagers are. It is not acceptable in Scientology however.

4. FALSE PETITION: L. Ron Hubbard sent a copy of my approved petition by mail, directly to me at home instead of sending it to me at the church because for some reason I never got the first letter he sent me. I never showed this letter to anyone. Anna said, ""your approved petition from L. Ron Hubbard is canceled.""

It's not possible to do a program based on these Anna Balash findings without either being crazy already or being made crazy trying to do it. Where am I supposed to find proof I'm a member of the Church of Satan when I'm not or that I tried to kill myself when I didn't? Who is going to believe me and give me false evidence to submit to the church as proof their actions are correct? No one!

I stopped being promiscuous on my own. I didn't need the church to help me.

The petition to the GO I never heard back on and the letter from L. Ron Hubbard I never got were stolen by NY FDN ED Raymond Baiardi. He used them to influence other staff to create fake services for me to pay them for at the church until I ""wised up"". Stealing something from church founder L. Ron Hubbard is a crime in Scientology that carries a mandatory penalty of expulsion from the church and a lengthy amends program called Steps A to E to get back in. Raymond was never expelled, meaning he is ""qualified church staff"".

Anna created an ""ethics program"" based Raymond Baiardi's stolen documents and guidance. This is the program.

1. LIFE HISTORY WRITE-UP: Not just O/W's. Every person, school, magazine subscription, address, bank account, job, police report, church, credit card, doctor and group etc. etc. etc. I was ever associated with in any way.

2. AFFIDAVITS: A notarized affidavit for each disqualification stating it to be true.

3. LIABILITY WAIVER: A notarized waiver expressing the church is not liable to anyone for any results stemming from doing this program.

4. SECURITY CHECK: A Guardian Office World Wide Form 5 Green Form Security Check sold in 12½ hour intensives at full public donation rates.

5. PETITION: A new petition to the GO.

The program when done would be sent to the GO as a package for approval. It is a form of spiritual blackmail. As long as my lack of knowledge holds out, the profits for the church look good. Anna, typed up all the documents to be brought back notarized and took me to the registrar to pay for the security check. NY FDN ED Raymond Baiardi was now a NY FDN registrar. Anna gave him my ethics folder to review. Ethics folders are never supposed to be given to registrars to write comments in, make changes to or review. Raymond wanted $2,800.00 for 1 intensive of 12½ hours of security checking to start. I gave him $22 in 2 visits, got 2 receipts and never went back. On my last visit I was offered a ride home to New Jersey by NY FDN student Susan Cox Mongiovi and her boyfriend who live near me. I asked them to drop me off someplace else instead of home. Church officials then announced all donations for church services will be increasing by 10% each month. People were urged to donate before the next increase.

In June 1979, L. Ron Hubbard issued a new policy that anyone who has ever used LSD or Angel Dust may no longer join the Sea Org. The policy was sent to me in the mail by a Sea Org recruiter at Flag. It was never shown to me by anyone at the church, not even the ethics officers who read my O/W write-ups in which I noted using LSD 4 times in high school. I no longer qualify for the Sea Org but can have anything else the church offers that doesn't require Sea Org membership. I am therefore, exclusively a public person. Why would anyone want to be on staff for if the Sea Org exists?

The New York church moved to 227 W. 46th Street in 1980.

My sister Helen got pregnant by a neighbor Jonah. They never got married. Their relationship ended in domestic violence when their daughter Jolie was 5. Jonah moved away and met someone else he married. Helen gave my mother the job of raising Jolie full-time so she could go to college one day. My sister Lorraine went to nursing school. My brother Tommy was saving for a house with his fiancee. My father then threw me out of the house so they could realize their goals. I had a high school diploma, $135.00 in the bank and believed something evil the church keeps confidential from people will happen to me without auditing or training. It was the most frightening scene imaginable.

For 4 years I engaged in immoral acts to get money for the church, locate a career and keep a roof over my head. I sent written reports of my activities to the ethics officer at NY FDN in the mail prompting a PTS Type III Declare to be issued on me. I was told about the declare over the phone. Despite this, I got as many as 20 letters a week and phone calls from Florida, California, Washington D.C. and New York Scientologists asking me to accept church amnesty and start fresh, buy books, training, auditing or e-meters or join staff or the Sea Org. I bought over $1,800.00 in books and buying these books is the only thing in Scientology I regret ever doing. Because, the church never followed up with me on my book purchase, all they wanted was a sale. I moved and had no way to carry a 300 lb. library of books with me, nowhere to store them and no one to give or sell them to so, I threw them away. My sister Lorraine was playing with the e-meter the church sold me and she broke one of the knobs on it so, I threw it away too.

Joan Woods (a NY Day treasurer) called me to say I left my church job without permission and must pay the church an $1,100.00 Freeloader's Debt in exchange for the free training I got when I worked there. I was never even on a staff contract but she did not want to listen. A friend was with me when she called and he got on the phone and told her if she calls back the police will be notified. It was not my idea for him to say that to her but, I never heard back from her on the matter again. If she could have gotten money out of me under false pretenses she would have regardless of where I wound up afterward.

My church records had gaps in them, were altered or missing. In June 1986, I went to Clearwater, Florida, found a place to live and lived there for 3 years. I stopped reporting my activities in the mail to the church. I quit any recreational drug use. I quit drinking alcohol and smoking. I eventually became vegan and interested in fitness. While in Clearwater, I went to Flag.

Im sad all the fucking time and i NEVER have a good day. Nothing ever goes the way that I plan it too. I have 0 passion for anything and I find nothing interesting at all. Everyday that I wake up I get sad because I know I have experience all these terrible feelings that I have all over again and it frustrates me. I’m a college student at the most boring college ever studying a major I despise (I’m in too deep to switch out), I have no friend because all my friends from my freshman year have just disappeared and stopped talking to me. I try to keep busy and workout, study, watch TV, but after a while these thing get really boring. I would like to have friends to do something with. Now that I am entering my 3rd year it has become difficult to make friends since everyone already has their group of people. I only ever came to college because it seemed like something I was suppose to do, truth is I never really liked school because it makes me anxious. All the studying and tests, worrying about GPA’s and internships, and trying to figure out what you want to do after you graduate all give me intense anxieties. When I see other people doing all these things and I’m not… I feel like a failure. I’m not doing well in school so far I’ve failed 5 classes, I don’t think I’m dumb (I certainly not smart either), but its really hard to do well in classes when you have 0 interest. It makes it hard to study and pay attention. I used to be so happy go lucky but now I’ve seem to turn into a negative nancy to the point where I don’t like who I have become. I feel so bored and over life when I’m only 20 years old. I’ve tried to express these feeling to others but all I get in return is “just be positive” “push through” “You’re being dramatic” and i sincerely get where they’re coming from and I try to do all of those things but at the end of the day I can’t help feel the way I feel. I’m like a dog always chasing its tail, Im alway hoping things will turn around, but its been a year and the feelings I have alway seem to get worse. I think my mom sensed that something was wrong and asked if I wanted to see a therapist or something, but of course I said no because I feel super uncomfortable with he idea, and she hasn’t push it since. Sometimes I just wish I was dead. I would never kill myself because the thought of pain or ending up in a worse situation than I already am sounds horrible. If I was given a magical button that would make me disappear…I would press it with no hesitation. I really don’t understand why I feel like this, my life could be a million times worse I really don’t have anything to complain about. I have a loving family, a roof over my head, food in a belly, I have the opportunity to go to college, but yet I still want to disappear. I just want to be happy like I used to be. I used to genuinely laugh and smile all the time, now I just fake it and cry at night. I would like to drop out of college, but I know my parents would be livid with me. I fear not being able to find work because I wouldn’t have a degree and that's the only reason that I stay. Sometimes it makes me sad to see all my old friends hanging out, but I’m never extended an invitation.  I understand if someone doesn’t want to be friends with you because you can’t force people into a friendship. I don’t particularly like to go to parties or smoke weed and drink and so maybe they find me to be dull. I’m kinda of annoying and dorky and that's probably why that don’t like to hang out with me. When we were falling out they seemed to always act like they are too cool for me. It almost felt  like being the younger sibling that tries tries to hang out with your older sisters friends and no one wants you there so everyone ignores you. It sucks. I didn’t know at 20 years old people would still act like middle school kids. I have one friends that I used to have a really strong connection with, but now all she does is message me about how she misses me…but when I make plans to hang out she always bails on me. It makes me wonder whats wrong with me. The only “friend” I do have is really only friends with me because we have the same major and tend to also have the same classes so we study often together, but we never really do anything else besides that. She’s friends with all the girls I had a falling out with and tends to always have arguments and issues with them and that’s the only time she’ll hang out with me. But as soon as they make up, she goes running back to them and seems to forget about me. I wish she would hang our with me like she does them. So this year my mission is to join some type of club. I’ve tried to join clubs before but when it comes to socializing with strangers I get really nervous. Even though on the outside I appear fine and outgoing on the inside I’m terrified. So its hard to make friends when you’re nervous just to go up and talk to people. When I see people with their boyfriends and friends I am genuinely curious how they manage to build such relationship and whenever I try to do the same it crumbles. So here I sit alone in my room, sitting on my bed like I always do... all day. I just hope time flies by so I can finally graduate and move on and find out what I want in life and discover what I’m passionate about because here in college I feel like I’m unable to do that. Instead of college helping me grow I have definitely gone back into my shell and I don’t like this sad person I’ve turned into. I don’t know how to fix myself…"
9chl40,117,2018-09-02,Why do we have no posts in here about success stories?,AfriKev,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9chl40/why_do_we_have_no_posts_in_here_about_success/,"Hello friends! I'd like to start by saying I feel for each and every one of you dealing with your anxiety and I'm so happy that we have a community to share.

​

I have noticed, however, that after months of watching this page there are so few success and triumph stories posted. I know I personally abandon and distance myself from all thoughts of anxiety whenever things are going well in my life and I wish that were not the case. I wish we were better about sharing how we all got past a particularly difficult spot in our lives and I am here to share two of my own.

​

See for me, every bout with anxiety has been a learning experience about myself, but it has not gone away. I have learned that *change,* namely big life transitions have been the biggest catalyst in bring my anxiety back. In 10 years, I have been through almost as many therapists, medications, and episodes. It is hard sometimes (especially now) to maintain faith that it will go away. But maybe we have to learn to live with it like an auto-immune disease or allergy, where we have to be mindful of the medications and precautions we must be consistent about.

​

One of my hardest and most successful battles with anxiety took place my Sophomore through Junior year of college. I was at a low coming back to school, with a failing long-distance relationship, difficulty finding the right combination of medicines, no clue what I wanted to do with my life, poor grades, low-self esteem, and a general belief that I would never have to grow up. After my overly co-dependent relationship ended, which I would soon learn I had been using as a crutch for my anxiety, I started a 5-week outpatient program. That program allowed me to have some balance in my life, if only temporarily, but the time it helped me pass was crucial. It allowed my meds to settle in (I believe sertraline at this time), helped me meet new people, remind me what I was truly capable of and help me focus in school. Junior and Senior years ended up being the best I ever had. I had great internships, was meeting people, and staying positive. Most importantly, my anxiety was still there, but it was as manageable as taking vitamins. I felt like myself and for once I was doing ***ME***\*.\* It led me to my next girlfriend, reaching my goals, and being truly happy.

​

Unfortunately, I soon learned a new lesson about myself and change - when I get comfortable, I forget that change is imminent. So today I am back in a similar place, perhaps even worse, to where I was starting college. I am starting a new outpatient program soon, because I again became too co-dependent on a girl and forgot that change was coming. The worst part was it cost me the girl of my dreams. Now more than ever, I know I **NEED** to learn to love and believe in myself.

​

Even though I have all but given up, I have learned that taking care of  and prioritizing ourselves may be the best cure to anxiety and depression. Every set back we have is an opportunity to learn but we must always be working towards loving ourselves over everyone else. I encourage you all to do the same, and share your triumphs, whether temporary or permanent, with this community and anyone else who needs it.

I'm a senior executive at a company where you work as an IT analyst. I've been surfing the web at work, exploring femdom sites, looking for a chat partner or maybe even a playmate. Of course, I'm not supposed to be doing any of this at work. My posts are clear about what I'm curious about - generally milder things like light bondage, blindfolds, light punishment like spankings, and maybe being shared by a domme and her (female) friends. You check my history and you see I've chatted with a few people but nothing ever developed. You just happen to share some of the same interests so you set up a profile to reply to my posts anonymously. We set up a meeting and I arrive at your studio to find you dressed as a domme, with a mask and wig concealing your identity. It's only after I'm tied that you reveal who you are. I am blackmailed into becoming a client of yours, with our sessions becoming more intense and my limits tested over time.

2. As a variation, you're my secretary. I make the mistake of leaving my office to get a coffee without locking my screen, when you come in to leave some papers for me to sign. You see my screen, explore a bit, smile, note my user name and the site I'm on, and set up an account for yourself to arrange for us to meet.

3. I'm your older neighbor. A busy man, successful, but not too tech-savvy. You're the nice-looking young lady who lives in a condo down the hall. I know you work in IT, and I've asked you to help me configure a new home network. You get everything set up but I don't know that you also installed a back door to remotely monitor my activity. You discover my browsing history and decide to have some fun. The next time I'm surfing, I see a popup message: ""I know what you've been looking at"". I'm a bit concerned, but I close the message. A couple of days later, there's a knock at my door. I open it and see you standing there, and invite you in. All you say is those same seven words: ""I know what you've been looking at"". Then you add, ""I'm here to help you explore."" 

4. I'm a rich executive. You're a poor college student. We find each other on a site that specializes in matching up people in our situations. We meet, and agree to enter into a ""mutually beneficial"" relationship. Things go well, but after a few dates, I suggest trying something a bit different - tying you. You seem hesitant, so I say you can tie me instead if you're more comfortable with that. You still seem uncertain and tell me you'll think about it, but on the inside, you're smiling. When I arrive at your place for our next date, you answer the door dressed as a domme. You lead me to the spare bedroom in your apartment, which you have set up as your ""chamber"". 

5. I'm a senior manager at a large firm. You're an intern, assigned to my department one or two days per week as part of your college education. We start off with a civil, professional relationship, but after working together on a couple of projects we become more friendly and eventually we start flirting, joking about getting together after work and having fun, but nothing ever comes of it. I don't have any personal photos in my office and I don't wear a ring, so you have no way to know that I'm married and have been for some time. As an intern, you're invited to office functions like the Christmas party. You arrive a bit late, and see me with someone new, and discover that she's my wife. You manage to sneak away before I know you were even there. The next week, when we're flirting, you suggest we go to your place after work. I accept, not realizing you're serious, and just thinking it's part of the game. Eventually I make it over, and you tell me to relax in the living room while you change into something more comfortable. I hear you speaking as you walk down the hall, saying ""why didn't you tell me you were married?"" When you step into my field of vision, I see you dressed as a domme.

6. I come in to a small pub and see you sitting alone. After a while, I offer to join you and you accept. We chat, making small-talk, even flirting a bit, generally getting along well. When the  manager announces that it's closing time, I am surprised to hear you suggest that we go back to your place, and I accept. After another drink, we wind up in your bedroom, where you tell me to get comfortable, while you step behind a screen to change, coming out dressed as a domme.  It turns out you had this planned, and I was tonight's prey.

-----

If you're interested in seeing where any of these openings could lead, or if you have anything similar in mind, feel free to send me a message. I'm hoping we can turn this into an ongoing chat/role-playing relationship, either by private messages here, by email or something interactive like Skype. I am not going to share voice, pictures or camera, and I won't expect you to either.

9chqc3,8,2018-09-02,Thoughts on doing an internship in-house after a full-time position at an agency?,wichbich,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/9chqc3/thoughts_on_doing_an_internship_inhouse_after_a/,"I currently have about 1.75 years of experience at a PR agency but have been applying for in-house positions for a variety of reasons. I had two phone interviews and now have an in-person interview with 3 team members next week for an in-house PR internship role at a big name organization I really, really like and in an industry I can see myself working in the long term.

I'm a bit hesitant for a few reasons: 

1. I already have almost two years of experience in PR and this would pretty much be a downgrade on paper. However, this internship is in a completely different industry/expertise and the internship hopefully focuses on learning the nuances of this industry versus teaching me the basics of PR.

2. I'm leaving a stable full-time job for an internship that might not convert into a permanent position (it still offers all the benefits as it's a full-time internship).

These are two things I would have loved to clarify in my phone interviews, but there wasn't enough time/opportunity for me to ask questions during either of my conversations. The position listing states a requirement of 1-3 years of prior relevant PR/comms/marketing agency experience, but I'm also conflicted because I've searched past intern profiles and many did not have even half a year of PR experience.

I would really appreciate any insights from you all on whether you would move forward with this opportunity if you were in my shoes. I don't hate my current job/coworkers, but it's been really draining lately as my clients are in an industry I have zero interest in and the pay is very low. This internship would pay more, more work/life balance and in an industry I actually like, though I realize it's a risky move.

Honestly, my expectations are pretty low on getting this job as it's competitive, but I do want to make sure I phrase my answers as well as possible - should I try to take the angle where I acknowledge that I know all the basics of PR and want to focus on learning the industry through the internship? Is it okay to emphasize that I just want the internship if it's typical for interns to convert to a full-time employee (dependent on performance)? Or should I leave it open ended and let the interviewers address these topics instead of me bringing it up? Also, is it okay to show my passion in this industry, or does that come off as too much of a ""fanboy""?"
9ci471,2,2018-09-02,My [20'sM] Girlfriend [20'sF] of 8 years has been speaking and hanging out with a guy without my knowledge for over a year,dontknowwhattodo789,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ci471/my_20sm_girlfriend_20sf_of_8_years_has_been/,"Hey everyone, I read a lot of posts here but I never thought I would have to post a problem myself. I'll just get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend now since Highschool. We've had our ups and downs, especially when I had to go away a few times for internships during college. But for the most part we have been happy. When I went away for my first internship a few years ago an incident occurred at her gym with some guy we'll call ""Ken"". Ken had a been a regular at my girlfriend's gym and I had even met him a few times when my gym was closed for whatever reason. He always seemed nice enough, but my girlfriend called me crying that summer telling me that he was acting crazy. According to her he had been pushing for them to start a relationship and for her to dump me. He had also apparently threatened that he would ""kick my ass"" as well. He had escalated the situation and posted pictures of text messages that were allegedly from my girlfriend in which the way she was responding made it seem like they were legitimately in a relationship. She told me that the messages were fake and that she was freaking out and blocked him on all of my social media accounts so he couldn't contact me. At this point we had been together for 6 years and I thought the guy was kind of shady when I met him, so I believed her. Her and her mom attempted to get a restraining order on him and called the police department. The officer who handled the case told them that it sounded like my girlfriend had been leading him and they didn't push it farther. I guess that should have been somewhat of a red flag.. She cut contact with Ken and stopped attending the same gym as him, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a bit. For the past year I have been working full time and I live about 4 hours from the city I used to live in. Me and my girlfriend are still together doing the long distance thing. I still drive out to see her every other weekend sometimes more. This has been especially hard on her because she doesn't really have any friends for various reasons I guess (a whole separate issue). During this time she develops depression, which I'm pretty sure she has had for many years but was just never diagnosed. In the past few months I felt our relationship slipping. We have only had sex like 5 times in the past year (although to be honest I thought this was mostly from the depression), and she seemed to be pretty withdrawn or angry when she was with me. We had a few arguments over it and she would always say something along the lines of ""Well you're never around"". I had considered breaking it off for a month or two as I really wasn't too happy, but our relationship began to seem better the past month or so, until now.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight my girlfriend calls me crying again. She went to a fair with a mutual friend of ours and apparently she ran into this guy again. Her brother saw her at the fair and called their mom to tell her. I'm assuming her mom then called her and had a bunch of questions because this was the same guy they attempted to get a restraining order against. So, she's crying telling me that since I've been gone she's been hanging out with this guy again because he apologized to her and that she now goes to that same gym she left before. I managed to get some information from her while she was hysterically crying before I decided to just end the call. Pretty sure she's been going to a completely different gym than I thought for the past year. Apparently she hangs out with him just by themselves sometimes after the gym. She said she just goes on errands with him, but who the fuck knows what they're doing since it's just them. She ""apparently"" had been meaning to tell me for a while and stopped going to the gym for the past month or two after we went on vacation with each other because she felt bad. She still never even so much as mentioned anything about it. At this point the whole year+ is basically a mystery besides for the weekends I've been home.  All I can think about now is that she hasn't been so distant and withdrawn because of her depression and our

&amp;#x200B;

I want to believe that she wanted to tell me... She is swearing to me nothing has happened between them, and that she's only friends with him because she's been lonely since I've been gone. But the only reason she's even telling me now is because she knows her moms going to say something to me. And she's lied to me about hanging out with this guy now for a year. I just feel like my trust in her is broken. Especially because I've been very careful about the friends I choose, especially females because I didn't want to hurt her in some way. But I guess she didn't really care to think about my feelings when she was hanging out with this dude.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem is now I kind of look like an idiot. My parents asked me one day if she switched back to Ken's gym (the one she had left earlier) because they saw something on one of the gyms social media pages mentioning her. I didn't think anything of it, told them that she wasn't attending that gym and I didn't even bother asking her because I just trusted her. My parents also saw Ken one day at a stoplight in his truck, when he noticed them (my dad had also attended the same gym) he immediately did a U-Turn and sped away. They told me about the situation and asked me if she was still talking to him, I said no thinking nothing of it. So now they're probably going to hear about this and they're not going to trust her either. I guess my line of reasoning here is: If I can't even explain to them why they can trust her, how can I?

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is kind of a long rant, I guess I'm mostly just venting online as all of my friends are currently on vacation at the moment. Do you any of you think this relationship is salvageable? I mean it has been 8 years and I feel like I shouldn't just give up on such a long standing relationship, especially when we haven't had any real SERIOUS issues before. But at the same time I don't know if even want to put in the work to salvage this.. I just feel like I can't trust anything she says now. Plus the fact that we will still be long distance for over a year will make salvaging this even harder.. I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here. Really any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Girlfriend cuts contact with guy from the gym that was attempting to start a relationship with her. She also attempts to get a restraining order against him and switches gyms. Find out 1.5 years later that she has been withholding the fact that she forgave him over a year ago(?) and has been attending the same gym as him again, working out with him and hanging out with him by herself afterwards.

9ci4mt,2,2018-09-02,3 year relationships with (21f) and in 3 weeks she’s moved on,lidaperson,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/9ci4mt/3_year_relationships_with_21f_and_in_3_weeks_shes/,"It’s a long read but I don’t know who to tell this to and I’m tired of this deepness in my chest. 

We broke up because in the 3 years we’ve been together, I (19m) initiated and followed through on 3 separate coffee/lunch dates with 3 separate girls I used to like prior to the relationship. I didn’t have feelings for them when I met them, they moved away from my home country to go to uni so when they came back for the summer I wanted to catch up with them. I told my ex I was going to these things but didn’t tell her I used to like them cause I didn’t want her to worry/get hurt. Those 3 instances happened and ended at those times because we had arguments on my motives, didn’t talk or meet them after.

Fast forward, she goes out with this guy that used to like her to catch up and that’s cool then 6 months later he wants to catch up again so I make a fuss about it saying if you’re just acquaintances what major life event is there to catch up on in 6 months..so she doesn’t meet him and that was that. She starts interning and we start getting out of touch. We hadn’t had physical intimacy in 2 months (privacy at home issues) and with her work schedule we only met for dinner or movies on Sunday where she would be so tired during and after. At this time she was doing so much fun stuff at work (camp, archery, futsal) so I started getting insecure about my place in all this and a lot of arguments break out and we took a few short breaks. She says she’s trying and I kept saying she should put more effort/sacrifice in our relationship because I felt secondary. (I had a lot of time at this point - homeschooling myself so not just free leisure time - and I looked forward to seeing her a lot when I could) 

During one of our breaks this Canadian guy at her work starts getting friendly with her, she told me when we reconciled. We were still in a shaky place during one of her free weekends when she told me they had dinner together and I was fine with it. 2 days after we had a movie night and another fight on the lack of physical intimacy. The day after, she tells me she’s gonna have dinner with the Canadian guy again which I disagree to cause we weren’t in the best place and dinner again one-on-one with this dude didn’t seem like the best idea. She brings up all the coffee/lunch dates I had with girls that I used to like and pointed out the hypocrisy in my train of thought. I was dumbfounded and that night she called and said we should spend some time apart and just stay friends. 

The following week I was a wreck. I texted her twice to which she replied along the lines ‘there’s no us’ ‘I can’t trust you’ ‘good luck take care’ and it just felt shit. Called her and she was so cold. Didn’t speak to her for another week and asked to meet for closure. The meeting dragged on to the 3rd week of our breakup (4 days ago) and we just talked and said maybe it’s for the best we move on and we both agreed. The time apart did make me realize maybe we weren’t the best pair, that I shouldn’t have expected so much and accepted what I could get y’know. The choice to move on rested heavily on the reality that come next year she would graduate university and I would’ve just started it so the timing wasn’t right. Funny thing is her internship ended 2 weeks after the break up so if I was more patient maybe things wouldn’t be like this. 

Anyways, here’s the real kicker. When I was staying with her I found out her Instagram password on her laptop (I know, dick move) and was checking her messages when I found out that the day after our closure talk, she went out clubbing and drunkenly made out with some random dude and the day after, she had a date with the Canadian guy and he came over her place. I was fine until I found this out, the 3 weeks of barely any contact helped me forget her and accept that it’s over but finding this out breaks my heart all over again. It’s like it really is over and it ended so abruptly.

I’m so conflicted on what to think. I keep having the picture of her making out with the other guy and her being with the Canadian. What are your thoughts? Is it immature for me to be so broken by this? Do you think she had feelings for her coworker while we were together? Is it a good idea if I give her her space then try to be friends?

TL;DR: Ex broke up with me, barely any contact for 3 weeks, met for closure, day after closure meeting ex drunkenly makes out with this guy at a club and day after that, has a date with her coworker who was the cause of our big fight that ended things. Conflicted on what to think and where to go.

We had a perfect long distance relationship for 2,5 years and then she finally came to live with me and my dad. Our dream came true.

Everything went downhill from there. She got a full-time job, but with late shifts. I got a normal 9-5 internship, I had my studies, my sports and I was in a board. We were both so busy and thus only had time in the weekends. She also didn't like living at my place and couldn't get along with my dad. So we were looking for our own place, but couldn't find anything. She tried to break up with me after 3 months, but gave me a second chance. She eventually left me after 5 months.

My life has been ruined. I was already suffering from some sort of depression since my childhood, probably dystymic, but now I got diagnosed with having a severe acute depression. I feel so empty without her, so alone. I keep thinking of my time with her and how happy I was, and how stupid I am for ruining it not once but twice! I absolutely hate myself. I have so much guilt and regrets for nkt being able to make her happy. I'm also scared of the future as I don't know what I want to do or could do, and I'm already 24. I have days were I only sleep and don't even eat or drink. 

In the past 3 months I've had emotional ups and downs within days, sometimes hours. I switch between being sad, desperate, angry and somewhat motivated constantly. I can't control it. I hardly do anything. The only thing I did was finding a place for myself and get help. I still haven't moved in though and I just started seeing  a psychologist.

I don't know why I acted the way I did towards my ex. I was selfish, unloving, immature, irresponsible, mean and just not investing time in her. I love her so much though. It's this immense feeling deep inside me, but it's like I can't really express it her. It's as if there are two persons in my head. One who is positive, motivated, wants to give love and wants to take action. The other is negative, inactive, and not empathetic. Usually the last one wins. It's like I wasn't really in control the last months of the relationship. I feel so conflicted with myself. My head feels like exploding and my heart as if it could stop anytime. I just want to die every day. Just so everything stops. I thought of slitting my wrists, electrocuting myself or taking sleeping pills. I almost cut my wrist, but I couldn't do it. I just can't anymore...

I did some small tests which are indicating I could have narcissistic personality disorder, borderline, anxiety, autism, and sociopathic traits. So that's on top of my depression. It makes me feel like I am dysfunctional. I don't even know if I should tell my ex once I get the diagnosis. I want her back, but I fear it will only push her away. Besides that, she is leaving the country around March. I don't wanna lose her forever...

I just want to be happy again. I need help and could use people who understand... please help me.

9cldwi,18,2018-09-03,Starter’s guide: LONG-TERM stays in Japan as a healthy vegan (on a budget),happyprocrastination,veganinjapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganinjapan/comments/9cldwi/starters_guide_longterm_stays_in_japan_as_a/,"**This is going to be a long one. Excuse my inability to keep things short.**

Being a vegan in Japan is pretty hard. Soy milk that contains actual milk? Animal-derived ingredients in the restaurant that were never indicated in the menu? No bread without milk? (this might be a very German thing to complain about, forgive me here). Meat in every dish at the restaurant? Dashi? Ridiculously expensive fruit and veggies at the super market, even if frozen? Check.

Yeah, I’ve been through that, too. I was an intern at a university in a rural/suburban area near Nara, Japan and after the 6 months I spent in Japan (including some traveling and day trips) I think I’ve got it figured out quite well. Some of these might be no-brainers but I thought I’d just compile a list of things that have helped me besides the usual “use HappyCow” and such, because this won’t work if you’re staying long-term(-ish). I’m not gonna pretend I’m an expert at all. I’m sure many people on this sub have stayed in Japan for much longer than I have and I've also been home for a while now – so if anyone has additions to these tips, just comment them beneath :) Feel free to ask about things I forgot to cover as well. I really hope this might be of help to someone.

​

**1) Try to find local farmer’s markets**

There was a weekly super-small farmer’s market near my place where you could get fresh fruit/veggies for like 1/3rd of the price you’d pay in the ordinary supermarket. There was also a local farmer’s supermarket near my Aeon mall where stuff, given it was in season, was affordable. THEY EVEN HAD VEGAN BREAD (too bad I realized this like 2 weeks before I left).

​

**2) Speaking of bread**

Sometimes there’s vegan bread in bakeries, but you’ll have to ask staff about it. You might have chances with darker kinds of bread. Otherwise I substituted it for crackers. Not great, but worked for me when I craved to eat some sort of spread.

​

**3) Use the Google Translate** ***app***

Because this app has one life-saving feature if you can't read Japanese: written text recognition. Take a picture of the ingredients on something you want to buy, the app will scan it and translate the ingredients for you.

​

**4) Check out the “Please eat today”-shelf**

In supermarkets, there’s often a shelf with supposedly almost bad fruit and veggies. If I hit the jackpot, they had perfectly ripe bananas for like 100 yen for 4 of them. Most of the time, the stuff is in a totally fine condition. Sometimes you just save a little bit of money, but you still save.

​

**5) Don’t have your hopes too high for organic-food-stores if you’re on a budget**

I’ve been to a couple ones in the cities. Yes, they had some vegan things and a bigger assortment of plant-based milks and stuff. But they were super freaking expensive so I never bought anything there. As I've read here, some stuff can be ordered online as well, but I personally never bothered doing this.

​

**6) Instead, foreign import stores are your friend**

This is maybe the most important one. Every mall I’ve seen and many department stores have one of these “coffee” import stores like Kaldi’s Coffee Farm. Not only did they have many kinds of products I was used to from home and could hardly find in the normal supermarket shelves, but they also have many canned legumes and chopped tomato for around 100-150 yen each in stock, plus a couple of vegan sauces, sriracha, maple syrup, molasses, tahini, big tubs of  shortening (good as a fat for baking! you will have a hard time finding margarine) … and also vegan chocolate. Because almost all dark chocolate you find in usual supermarkets is not going to be vegan, except for the extremely bitter 95% one. Here you could not only find the usual bittersweet chocolate, but also a kind of lighter vegan chocolate.

​

**7) Keep your eyes open - sometimes you’ll find random vegan stuff where you'd least expect it**

There was one vegan dark chocolate, and the best I’ve had in Japan, in DAISO (100-yen-store). I kid you not.

​

**8) Ya better learn how to cook**

Unfortunately, there's no way around it. Depending on what you’re up to you will be off most healthy just prepping a lunch in the morning and bringing it with you. Especially useful if you go on day trips and do not want to spend a lot of your time looking for restaurants. Or if you're traveling for some days, you should maybe also look for places to stay that have a kitchen.

However, your workplace also is unlikely to have options, my university cafeteria didn't either except for a tomato salad. Also, you might consider using a little more fat in your homecooking than you’re used to, since you will often eat raw veggies in restaurants. But maybe the french fries you’ll also often eat make up for it. Dunno. By default, many homes do not come with an oven, so consider getting a toaster oven. I bought one at a second hand store for only 1200 yen, it was old but did the job.

​

**9) You didn’t bring anything with you but you’re starving.**

Well whoops. Convenience store it is, eh? If you’re not too picky, there will most likely be some sort of onigiri you can get (like inari tofu, pickled plum or just plain red bean and sesame), juice/smoothies or maybe mochi/bean paste sweets. Watch out with the latter, they are often stored next to desserts containing gelatine. 7/11 also often had edamame and snacks like that.

​

**10) Eating out**

Before you go out with other people, again, you might consider eating at home because chances are you’ll only get snack dishes. If you have a choice when it comes to the places (and this might be a no-brainer again), choose places that have a buffet or a choice of small plates. This way, you at least get enough, even if you have to eat the same thing multiple times. スシロー/ Sushiro (Sushiroll?) worked well for me, for example. If I needed to change up a dish or ask about ingredients, colleagues were happy to help me communicate that as well. I found even though veganism is almost non-existent in Japan, there's less of a stigma around it.

​

**11) Avoid gambling**

My rule of thumb became: If there’s just a slightest suspicion someone could for some reason put animal products into the product you’re considering – they probably did. Best example is that one day I tried to find a vegan veggie broth in Aeon. I checked all products. I checked the import store. Every “veggie broth” still contained meat of some sort, even though there were also the usual beef and chicken broth and such. After that, I didn’t really trust any product anymore. I'd also not trust products labeled as ""veggie"" or ""vegetarian"", ""no meat"", or ""vegetable \[something\]"" actually being veggie without reading labels. They often contain fish, for example.

​

**12) Is it vegan? Japan**

Generally, this website was helpful for me to find out which product might be vegan and which not (it’s no longer updated though): r/[https://isitveganjapan.com/](https://isitveganjapan.com/)

​

**13) Products I frequently bought:**

\- Marusan Soy Yogurt. Because it’s pretty much your only vegan yogurt option lol. But it’s easy to spice up if you don’t like plain unsweetened yogurt, I frequently used marmalade for this.

\- Almond Breeze (because it contains calcium – the usual Japanese soy milks do not. Even though it was like three times the price)

\- Frozen edamame. Cook them for some minutes and you got your perfect quick healthy snack

\- All kinds of canned legumes at the import stores

​

**14) Track nutrients on Cronometer (or a similar platform) until you’ve figured it out.**

**15) How I got creative for some of my nutrients that I watched I was running rather short on (according to Cronometer, that is):**

\- Vitamin E: Almond Breeze also contains Vitamin E. Eat sunflower seeds, sometimes almonds. Sunflower/olive oil might also help

\- Potassium: I wasn’t up for potatoes, avocado, bananas and tomato sauce all day every day, and raw tomatoes which I would usually consume back in Germany were sinfully expensive. I resorted to drinking tomato juice as a healthy afternoon snack. I actually liked it more than any of the ones I’ve since found at home, because in Japan, many of them were salt-free. But my friends tell me I’m crazy for hating salt in tomato juice, so maybe that’s not your problem.

\- Omega 3: I don’t recall seeing flax seeds anywhere. Chia seeds were available in the health food shelves at Aeon, but again pretty expensive. Sometimes I got lucky and they were reduced. Try incorporating more walnuts and blueberries maybe.

\- Iron: Actually I had no problems with this, but wanted to include it as well. If you eat enough legumes and make use of soybeans being cheap, you should be good. Also TOFU. I loved the supermarket fried tofu and silken tofu was good for sweeter foods. This way, you also can get in quite a lot of protein. Tomato sauce is also good for iron. Farmer’s markets will also often have fresh spinach and other green less expensive than greens in the supermarket.

\- B12: I guess they have it or you can order online but you might want to get your stash of B12 supplements and just bring them to Japan. Same for Vitamin D if you want to supplement this.

\- Calcium: Fortified drinks, molasses from the import store.  Tahini. Some greens on top and you should be fine.

​

**16) Don’t despair about what you’ll see.**

Depending on the country you’re from, how Japanese society handles animals and animal products can seem pretty shocking. Most people will never have considered meat might be bad, they barely know anything about the industry’s impact on the environment. Often, you’ll see meat/fish places celebrated on TV that look like huge halls full of corpses to you. I’ll give you a pat on the back. Talk to people who are interested in your lifestyle, but don’t expect them to understand right away. Or at all.

​

**17) Shit happens. Don’t beat yourself up.**

I’ll admit – at first I wasn’t so strict and did consume a very few selected animal products here and there (e.g. occasional soup that probably contained dashi in my university cafeteria, cereal with milk powder as it was fortified with iron). I think it’s avoidable if you don’t want to though and I think I’d also not do this anymore. I wasn't completely vegan (say 95%) when I first went to Japan. Good thing is, I was after, because I realized how easy it is at home in comparison.

But I also had a quite a few accidents where I accidentally bought some sort of animal product I didn’t want. Like meat in the sauce of a dish that I'd previously gotten vegan and the likes. It can happen, sometimes just through miscommunication with waitresses and such. You are trying your best and making a difference already, so don’t hate yourself if this happens."
9clzlg,13,2018-09-03,"I straight out got called an ""attractive guy"" today on my first day of my internship",iDislikeSn0w,lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/9clzlg/i_straight_out_got_called_an_attractive_guy_today/,"Sorry if this comes along as braggy or something, I just really felt the need to share.  

I'm quite the loner, don't really have a social life and no girlfriend either at the moment. Of course that can lead to doubting myself and my looks at times.  

I was nearly done working, just 20 minutes ago when a woman from another part of the IT floor came in for help.  

She chatted with another girl for a while before turning to me and flat out said: ""It's really a change of heart to finally have an attractive guy working here as an intern instead of the typical nerds you often come across in this sector"".  

I was really flattered when she said that, so I simply replied with ""Haha, thanks!"".  

Keep in mind, this conversation didn't take place in English but I translated it the best I could.  

I know this sounds really dumb, but this comment probably made my week. I never get called attractive or good looking outside of my parents/family. What a nice day!"
9cm0rj,290,2018-09-03,Here is what I learned in my 112 active days of online dating...and Ive stopped bc ironically I found someone in-person,Death_Star_,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/9cm0rj/here_is_what_i_learned_in_my_112_active_days_of/,"What I learned or had reaffirmed from my dating blitz**^1** (31 different girls, 78 dates,!nearly 10 new “bed post notches,” over $2,500 spent on dates, app subscriptions, clothes, etc)

* whether you believe you’re out of their league or you’re not (overall, not just in the looks department), ***you are right***. 

Confidence really is everything. And insecurity really kills boners and lady boners. 

* It’s a lot more feasible to follow Rules 1 and 2 than you believe — but it takes work

Sure, genetics rule all. 

But if you work out, get a fitting haircut, take care of yourself overall (nice skin, healthy skin color, healthy looking eyes, not-yellow teeth) and you show some sort of effort in fashion, you’ll be ahead of the curve so much that you’ll be considered physically attractive. 

I am not conventionally good-looking. But I workout, take care of myself, dress well when needed, and I’m an awesome person. 

I’ve gotten feedback such as “you’re fucking addicting” and “you’re extremely attractive...official 12/10 rating” and “no, you’re cute” (after I passively texted “oh that’s cute” to a dog pic) etc. 

But fret not...

* It’s like the worst-kept secret that guys typically take terrible pics 

...and the ones that take great ones usually disappoint and/or are narcissist (just from the many anecdotes I heard). 

I got so many “wow you look so much better than your pics” and “why do guys always take such bad pics?”

Because we are guys. 

Of course, that brings up the quandary of whether you should knowingly put up a bad pic or try too hard by putting up a try-hard pic. Obviously, the answer is neither — though even our best pics still don’t do us justice. 

But isn’t that better than being photogenic? Even for a dating app? Better that than disappointing someone IRL. 

* your first online messaging convo should be 10 minutes MAX

Just some flirting, some clear signals of attraction and suggestive comments for activities, then mention that you’re jumping off the app to do something else and — this is up to you — either give them your number or ask for theirs.

I’ve had great success just saying “k gotta go but we should totally [get pancakes for dinner] so text me at 9118675309” and like 80% of the time I get a text within 3 minutes, 95% of the time I get a text. 

* girls are way too good at taking pics. Beware. 

No body pics nearly always means they’re hiding it. You may be into it. You may not be. I’m just pointing it out. 

Even the hot girls don’t look as hot in person. 

Why?

Girls have literally 1000s of pictures of themselves, on average. Imagine their top 0.5%. They are not going to look their 99.5% best the first time nor every time. 

But that’s obviously ok. 

* There is such a thing as having too many dates and it’s a shitty thing to do

It just is. It’s narcissism. I had that streak. And I got my penance for it. I did shit like slept over at a tinder girl’s date then showed up at an 11am brunch date with a girl I actually liked 20 min late because the previous girl’s shower felt like Chinese water torture, and I showed up in the only clean shirt I had — that girl’s souvenir Toronto tourism T-shirt that smelled like a girl. 

But the worst was having to try to be mature and break it off with girls I had been on 3-4+ dates with.  

It broke me. It humbled me. I don’t ever want to feel that way again. No it’s not a good problem to have. What the fuck will you do with all the dates? Naturally you’ll be seeing like 4-5 people for the 3rd or 4th time — it just doesn’t work. 

* Do not talk dating with dates

Obvious. But not so much. I did this early and got punished and stopped. 

Many others still did this. 

* Hope for guys: the quality of the dating pool for girls may be deep in numbers but shallow in quality

So don’t worry about how there are so many guys. You cannot control that anyway.

Change what you have control over — yourself. 

* Personality goes a long fucking way

We all know this. Imagine being with a hot girl or guy who is vapid and stupid. Now imagine being with a moderately cute girl or guy who makes you laugh and makes your heart sink when her name pops up in your phone. 

* Improve yourself for you. Sincerely. Then, dating benefits will come 

I’m done convincing people of this. Either you get it or you don’t. But I’m comfortable calling this a truth. It works. Trust the process. But you should be doing it for yourself — you owe it to yourself. 

Here’s what scared me straight: imagining meeting a multiverse version of me who was the best version of me and picturing what he’d be like and how terrible he’d make me feel. I tried to become that guy. 

* Asian guys: stop making excuses

It’s not because you’re Asian. It’s because you’re letting it get to your head. 

I dated like 50/25/25 white/asian/other. All the girls were attractive physically. I even had a pseudo relationship with a hot black girl (until she tried to propose to me, yikes). 

Rid your insecurity and do away with excuses. And hitting the gym may help. 

But yeah, there are girls not into asian guys. But then again, this summer I heard at least from a dozen different girls “I never thought I’d _____ with an Asian guy.” 

Oh also, asian guys who are violently and/or emotionally abusive, go fuck yourselves. The stereotype is strong according to too many anecdotes. 

* Tinder has gotten worse very quickly, but Tinder Vegas is awesome

If you’re looking to just hook up in Vegas, fire up that Tinder and spring for Gold. 

I feel like Tinder in Vegas brings the app back to its roots: a user base comprising mostly young and hot people looking for no strings hooking up. 

Just put in your bio you’re in Vegas for XYZ period. It will work. And like 9/10 profiles are HOT. 

As mentioned I was 35 now 36, and hooked up with two smoking hot girls (age 26 was fine but age 23 made me feel a bit creepy...until we were hooking up...what?) back to back nights and we haven’t talked since.

* If you’re looking for relationships, CMB and Hinge worked well for me

Bumble must run on college interns because Bumble was fine early May then just got worse and worse over the summer. 

I get high quality matches and likes on Hinge for free. 

I get high volume and occasional high quality matches on CMB. 

Tinder is hit or miss. 

* Value NOT “shared interests” but ***shared principles***

No one gives a shit if you guys both like At The Drive-In or Godspeed You Black Emperor.  Congrats, you both listen to the ultimate hipster music before hipsters were a thing. Who cares?

I already have people in my life who share interests with me, people with whom I get along well — they’re called friends. 

You want to share relationship and life-outlook principles with your significant other. Quoting your favorite GB Shaw quote during a fight won’t do shit. 

If anything, having different interests makes it more fun. Lots of new things to try. And you know it’s real when you find yourself staring at her as she discusses her hobby passionately and you just keep thinking of how to participate with her or get her something thoughtfully related as a gift. 

* actions speak louder than words

What they say matters little. What they do matters a lot. 

We should know this by now. 

This is how I knew the one I’m with now is the one I want to be with for the long haul: she was the 31st different girl I had met, and I had a second date after a great first one — and for the first and only time, I showed up to a date 15 minutes early instead of 1-2 min early or late. I did it because I really liked her. She noticed (since I was picking her up) and she later told me she saw it as a good sign from me. 

* it’s not them it’s you

More times than not, this is the answer to “why can’t I find anyone?”

* it’s much better to show physical affection early than to play it safe

This is how you get ghosted even by people who liked you. 

No surprise, many girls (and everyone else) like to feel wanted. 

Don’t play games, don’t play it safe, don’t be gross. You’re on a date. You already find each other attractive. 

**SHE COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MOMENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE OR NOTHING AT ALL...BUT SHE IS THERE WITH YOU ON PURPOSE**

Yes it’s from Hitch. Doesn’t mean he’s not right. 

The date is yours to fuck up. Everything is in place. 

Little things like putting your hand on her back or shoulder blade for two seconds, or grabbing her hand to help her out of the car, or a playful slap of her arm. They work. 

Also, pick up on cues. If she’s on your left and totally moving her hair to the other side while talking to you, she is giving you signs. Too many signs to list. Research them. Act on them. 

You may get rejected, sure. 

Better than being ghosted and “not knowing” where it went wrong. 

* Don’t lie 

Duh. It’s a lose lose. If you get serious with her, she will find out. It’s also social and sexual fraud. 

* The One doesn’t exist. But Your One does. And that person may be online, or you might meet that person in real life. 

I didn’t learn this so much as it just reaffirmed something that didn’t need reaffirming. 

Stop looking for him or her. Fate nor destiny doesn’t exist. There is no grand plan. There is no cupid. Etc. 

This is all comforting. It means that it’s in our own hands. (Sure, “luck” is involved, but not so much luck as it is just fortuitous timing and placement in a completely chaotic world where we have virtually no control over what happens, and even then, we have no knowledge of what could have been or what could be). 

But the bottom line is that you don’t have to worry about there being only one or “the only one” out there — the only thing you should and can worry about is what you can control: yourself (your self-identity, your appearance and grooming and hygiene and style and look, your fitness shape, parts of your personality that are more pliable and definitely the negative traits, etc). 

For me to have met my current (and likely last) SO, sooooo many things outside of my control had to have happened. Even if, for example, I happened to show up to my yoga class 5 minutes later that day then she and I 100% wouldn’t have ever met since she went to my class for the first and only time, and I met her ***in real life*** (poetic how I spend all this time and effort and money on online dating only to find My One**^2** through in-person interaction).  

What I could control was my fitness, appearance, my sense of humor, and the ability to muster up enough “courage” to ask her out after a yoga class (probably what some/many girls would just hate happening in their yoga classes, especially if more men came just to make it “a place for guys to meet and ask out girls” but I legitimately do yoga twice a week to balance out my exercises). 

**And she said yes**. (And I don’t think that’ll be the last time I’ll say those 4 words about her and me asking her an important yes/no question; though technically she “rejected me” when I asked if she wanted to grab some coffee afterwards only to find me on FB that night — we had talked a little bit outside before class began — and apologize and explain that she was a bit taken aback and flattered and blushing when I asked her out, and that she mainly said “no” because she “felt gross and sweaty” after hot yoga, but that she wanted to grab dinner instead...and the rest is hopefully history forever in the making)

As I said, SO many things had to happen for us to even date. None of that I could control. But I could’ve been a disheveled slob and likely not gotten a date with her even if the stars aligned...but I can control whether or not I look presentable. 

* Bottom line: it’s chaotic out there, online and in the real world. Take solace in the fact that you can only worry about what you can control, and relative to the chaos, there’s very little to control 

Again, just physically, you can turn yourself from a 5/10 or 6/10 — depending on just how “off” you are with grooming yourself or how bad your haircut is etc — into even an 8.5/10 or something. 

**Step 1**: get a proper and possibly new hair style/cut. GO TO AN EXPENSIVE STYLIST JUST ONCE TO GET A RECOMMENDATION. Even a place that costs $35 for a haircut. They’ll tell you what best fits you. 

A haircut can make you look like a bum while another can make you look handsome AF. Compare World War Z Brad Pitt to Oceans 13 Brad Pitt, Limitless Bradley Cooper to Limitless Bradley Cooper after he has “cleaned up,” or *NSYNC Justin Timberlake to Justin Timberlake, or John Krasinski in the early seasons of The Office to his final season...and he keeps getting better looking now that he’s RIPPED....

**Step 2^^: hit the gym and watch what you eat. You don’t have to go full John Krasinski but there’s like a 95% chance that you can improve your physical health/looks, whether it’s trimming some fat, gaining some muscle, ridding yourself of the cancer patient look, dripping down from obesity, etc. 

Biologically, women are *generally* attracted to “healthy looks,” like good skin color, healthy shape, healthy hair/skin, ample muscle tone, etc. Many of these things help with producing better offspring and protecting the offspring. 

**Step 3**: Overhaul your wardrobe if it “sucks.” Hell, you can spend a few hundred dollars at H&amp;M and have enough “stylish” clothes for years as a guy. 

There’s no single style. Pick one that suits both your personality and body type. Maybe you like skinny jeans but you’re overweight — don’t do it. Maybe you like the grunge look but weigh 130lbs at 5’8”. Well you can’t even wear loose flannel without looking like a girl who slept over at a guy’s house. 

Pick out stylish clothes that accentuate your best features. I have a strong jaw line and high cheek bones, so I keep my hair rather short and choose shirts and jackets that have collars that accentuate my jawline. I have nice arms and shoulders apparently (I had better have them, I worked out for them), and I often get complimented about them because I wear NOT *tight* shirts but shirts just loosely above “fitted” where it’s almost like I’m hiding them. 

**Step 4**: General grooming 

Accentuate your features, but also choose a style that matches your personality and life stage. Don’t be wearing lettermen jackets if you’re 38, unless you look young or are black (in which case they look young too). 

Grow a beard if your jawline is “missing.” Shave if you have a jawline and/or can’t grow a glorious beard. 

Cut your hair short or shave it if you’re balding. Grow it long if you have a small head and round face. Cut your hair if you have a square face and/or jawline, as long hair looks AWFUL on square jaws. 

Have the right facial hair. If you can’t grow it fully just go clean. 

Shower shower shower. Not just on date nights. Bacteria accumulate. You don’t want to have trouble getting rid of BO because you haven’t showered in 4 days. 

Wear clean clothes. 

Footwear is important. Don’t wear the same 2-3 pairs of shoes unless all 3 are very different, fashionable, clean, and they can match your clothes. And this applies only to first and second dates. Don’t wear your Jordan’s for a second time on your 4th date...at a steakhouse. That shit may have flown on your second date playing mini-golf and going casual because it’s summer and outdoors but good god man have some shoes that you can wear at a place that has cloth that doesn’t have unlimited breadsticks. And no, work shoes don’t count. 

FIND YOUR *OWN* SCENT. Believe it or not, that Light Blue cologne from Dolce &amp; Gabana that you believe smells great? Yeah, only like 10,000 other guys in your area think so, too....and thus, it’s popular. You don’t want to end up smelling like everyone else. 

You can still wear popular colognes but I suggest ***trying Axe body spray*** to BLEND, not MIX or COMBINE, the scents. 

Yes.  Body spray. For 2 reasons (if you need another, I’ve had at least 5 girls tell me I smell great unprompted on dates, and another 4-5 friends say the same)

1) Reddit will tell you that Axe is for 13-year olds. Largely, they’re correct. But you’re not using it as your catch-all tool to smell like you’ve showered. You’re using it as a non-cologne fragrance undertone to blend with your cologne and make something totally ***unique as a fragrance that girls can only associate with you***. Of course, this matters more with girls you go on 3rd+ dates with or are in a relationship with. The body spray goes UNDER your outfit while the cologne outside if, with some cologne underneath. Small dabs though. 

2) you want to smell good naked, not just like deodorant but body spray and a hint of cologne, whereas with clothes on you want to smell like cologne with hints of body spray. 

Just do NOT smell like the last guy she just had dinner with. You WILL encounter that if you just wear cologne from Macy’s (nothing at all against Macy’s; they have all colognes that even the stores themselves don’t carry in stock, but it also means many men go there and buy the same ones you’re wearing). 

* **FINALLY: yes, self-improvement is the key. But do not do it for anyone but yourself. Do it for dating and you will never attain the level of improvement you need. It’s a catch 22. Thankfully.**

**TLDR: either you read it or didn’t. It’s your dating life. These are words from someone who dated nearly 3 dozen girls in a short time and learned a great deal.**


———————————————————–

**^1**

I’m fortunate to have been able to date at all. Yes I was the best version of myself. But...

First off, I’m an Asian guy — strike 1 for online dating, I’m 36 — strike 2, and my pictures are all years old because I don’t take selfies and I’ve had to I untagged myself from many Facebook pics during a job search a half decade ago — strike 3. Many will tell you that being an Asian guy alone = zero dates, and many will tell you being over 30 and especially 35 will hinder you, nope...still got dates. Oh, and I used pics from like 2011...which many girls called misleading because....well, I’ve gotten countless comments on me being “far more attractive” in person (someone even rated me as a 12/10). 

**^2**

Yeah it’s early but while age is just a number, it can also be an indicator of dating and relationship experience. We are both around our mid-30s, but no kids or divorces....just bad “luck,” and we both have and had zero desperation in finding a partner because we were both on the verge of taking a break from dating...

...but we managed to bump into each other and we are already in ***marriage***-talk mode, which, if we weren’t in our 30s with extensive dating and LTR experience each and we were 24 instead, we’d probably be focused more on ***wedding***-talk, as the former focuses more on how we’d operate as partners and things we notice that makes us great partners and the latter focuses on just being swept up in love — or infatuation — and *getting married* instead of *staying married*....it’s just two young kids not wanting a good thing to stop, without thinking about how the good thing can last and how much work it takes. My Also, since my SO and I have had many LTRs, this is one of the cases where we have bot the “just know” feeling but we’ve also logically thought it out)"

I had an awful summer, full of disappointments and I feel no desire to improve it. God I forgot last time I was happy, after a shitty internship which had me so stressed that I couldn't even sleep and had massive headaches. I met a nice girl with who I thought I had a connection but everything ended badly, should I mention that I never had a girlfriend and is killing me inside. My efforts to lose weight are stalling and is driving me mad.

​

After everything I thought I would recover but I feel no desire to do anything, NOTHING! I waste time playing games I don't even like anymore and I think is a copping mechanism. And after that awful internship I doubt how my future career will be like. I know that suicide is bad but man is looking very attractive, the thought of total silence...my life sucks! I will try to improve it but man is hard, especially when you feel no hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Hurtling down interstate 95, chilling in the left lane doing about 80 and cruising past the old heads to my right, Steve screamed the words of Freddie Mercury like the white boy he was.

“Fiiiiind-me somebody to loooooovefind me somebody to loooovefind-” What he hadn’t noticed was the red Toyota Camry, driven by a who who had been following him ever since he set foot outside his Hamilton Heights apartment.

“Turn right in, 200 feet onto exit sixty-nine, Devil’s Point Road, Buckinghamshire Street East,” blurtingly bleated Google Maps. He sighed, defeatisly, at humanity’s imminent defeat to the machines and the bacterias of the world.

“Click-click-click-click,” clicked the turn signal, as he hung a ralphie on to the ramp. Red Camry Man followed suit. “Whistle-whistle,” his phone whistled. That was his girl’s distinctive text tone. His eyes and attention remained on the road before him. He clickety-clicked a right turn into the redlining-era development of formulaic, mass-produced, single-family homes with lovely front and back yards, and a highly-regarded public education system. Red Camry man continued to follow him into the development.

Steve pulled up in front of a particular one of these houses as Red Camry Man drove away to go get something to eat before returning later. The front yard of this house was particularly overgrown, making the home a conspicuous and notable presence on this otherwise-quiet drive. Rather than pulling into the narrow driveway, he parked his car out front in order to prevent blocking the egress of the family’s cars.

As he clutched and tugged the handle and opened his door, he grabbed the jumbo trash bag from the passenger seat and flung the ten-pound bag over his shoulder upon exit. As he began towards the house. Moisture flicked up from the patchy green lawn onto my straight brown hair, NYU hoodie and black joggers as he cut through the jungle to save time and distance in walking to the door, utterly disregarding the threat of tick bites and lyme disease.

Steve turned the doorknob and it gave, no unlocking necessary. he was immediately struck by the stench of marijuana all throughout the house. “That’s what’s up,” he affirmed. Faced with a pitch black panorama in front of him, he fumbled around to find some semblance of a wall to orient myself. Grabbing onto a door frame, he peered into a bedroom and observed a caucasian woman in her 50’s asleep atop a queen-size mattress. He tiptoed into the dark room to conduct an unscientific study. She wore a cast which completely covered the area from her right hip to her ankle. One crutch laid on the bed with her, and after a brief search, he discovered the other one on the floor. On the bedside table was an orange pill bottle containing Oxycontin, and the papers largely consisted of envelopes from. the government’s Department of Disability Checks. It was as if she had been asleep for months on end, only waking to take another pill, while somebody hand-delivered this mail for whenever she decided to rise.

He didn’t bother to close the door behind him and as he made his way up the stairs, the pot smell strengthened. *Las escaleras* creaked as he walked up blindly in the dark. The first thing he noticed when he entered the room was the weed-green walls. The roof of the house cut off a corner of the room, giving it a trapezoidal prism shape. Bongs, pipes, blowtorches, dab rigs, small rubber containers, ziploc bags, video game controllers and hundred-dollar bills littered the various surfaces of tables and dressers. A triple-beam balance and a bag vacuum-sealer were regarded with a higher status, as they were placed prominently on the center of the dresser on top of his safe. The room contained four ashtrays and yet tiny piles of ash still littered the coffee table in front of the TV, the focal point of the room. A head of brown hair staring at GTA on the screen peeked above the couch.

“Rashid!” Rashid’s head turned around.

He smiled and exclaimed “Steve! My dude! Break out the shit!” as he stood up, dropping the controller onto the coffee table. Relieved to be free of the large bag, Steve dumped its contents onto the white-and-red striped couch. Ten vacuum-packed bags of California cannabis sat beside a blue 76ers blanket and pillows set. They looked into each other’s eyes and smiled. Still playing a sort of staring contest while stifling huge grins, he opened the safe and he extracted and casually handed me $22,000.

“Duuuuuuude stacks on stacks!,” he yelled, high-fiving Rashid.

“Yeah bro,” he replied. “we are the fucking KINGS around here!”

He put his hands on his hips and began to survey the room. “It’s a shame what’s been happening to, uh, you know, like, our competition around here.”

Steve made a confused face. “What do you mean?”

“You mean you haven’t been hearing what’s been going on around here?”, Rashid asked, mouth ajar.

Steve shook his head. “I’m not in the loop around here, anymore, dude.”

Hands on his hips, Rashid looked down and shook his head.

“What?…..Tell me, bro!”

He looked me in the eyes. “They’re overdosing and dying, bro. Drug dealers. All the big-timers around here.”

“Wait, so Dylan Parker is dead?”

“Yup. Fentanyl in his heroin.”

“Steven Majewski?”

“Yup. Fentanyl. From China.”

“Greg Taylor? Mikey Schiavone? Brendan Berger? Bertram Anderson? Jeff Davis? Cole Lafleur?”

“Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. They’re all dead. 10 of em, so far. In fact, all the big dealers around here are dead except for me.”

Steve was dumbfounded. “You mean to tell me that the all of the big drug dealers in Levittown have systematically, one-by-one died of heroin overdoses that are laced with fentanyl, and you’re the only one left?”

“Since the start of this year, yes.”

Now Steve looked at his friend with a glance of confusion and bewilderment. “Well, you’re gonna be ok, right? I mean, you’re not shooting up with this shit, are you?”

Rashid said nothing.

“Sheed??”

“Dude, relax! The guy I get it from makes it himself, pure as diamonds. There is no fentanyl in it, whatsoever.”

Steve slammed his hand to his forehead in disbelief. “Dude, at least tell me you’re not dealing the shit as well.” Rashid said nothing.

Steve grabbed Rashid’s arm angrily and pulled him towards the door. “Dude, come with me, now. I’m getting you to rehab.”

Now Rashid was angry, too. “No way, dude. No way you’re just gonna come down from your high horse up in Manhattan, and come down here to tell me how to live my life, asshole.”

Steve was fuming. “Hey, fuck you dude! Don’t hate cause I’m great!”, he said, shoving Rashid.

Rashid shoved back. “Oh yeah?”

Now it was a shoving match. “Yeah, man.” And the two men embraced in each other arms aggressively and began to punch each other in a writhing mass on the ground. The human rat-king moved along the floor with arms punching bodies and faces, heels kicking groins, etc, before it finally came to a stop when Rashid managed to reach under his couch and pull out a large pistol.

Steve immediately released and backed away, hands up. “Whoa, dude, take it easy man. Don’t fucking shoot all right.” Rashid continued to point the firearm at Steve’s head. “I was just trying to help you, man. You and your Mom need some help man.”

“Click,” said the gun as it cocked.

“DUDE!”, Steve pleaded. “Please! All right, all right, no rehab, ok? Can we just sit down and chill out and play some video games like we used to? Come on, man, put on Madden and try and stop me as I inevitably crush you.”

Rashid smiled and put the gun down. “All right, man. I could never shoot you, bro.”

They hugged as Steve shook his head and as they de-embraced, he continued to shake his head. “Don’t ever point that thing at me again, you motherfucker.”

“Fine,” Rashid said as he pointed the gun at Steve’s feet. “Don’t ever try and put me in that rehab bullshit again.”

“Fine,” Steve said nervously, dancing away from of the splash zone. Rashid returned the gun back to the secret compartment under the couch where it lived.

Rashid turned on the PS4, inserted the Madden disk and they began to play the game. It was about to be a thrilling and evenly-matched game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Philadelphia Eagles. Rashid paused for a minute to unscrew the grinder, take out a pinch of ground kush, and pack the glass pipe on the table.

“Want some of this, dude?”

“Nah, I quit recently.”

“How come?”

“Eh, I smoked some laced shit. Tripped out, ended up in the hospital. It was a whole thing, though. But now, like, I don’t know. Ever since I stopped, I just feel better. I enjoy life a lot more. I say ‘yes’ a lot more.”

“No yeah,” Rashid replied. “For sure.” They were both interestedly attempting to decide whether he wanted his team to wear the away white jersey, black jersey, or throwback jersey, and who would wear which.

“How close are you to paying off your student loans?”, Rashid asked.

Steve tapped the stack of $22,000 which was on the table. “Seventeen thousand dollars away, bro.”

They both smiled. “Congrats, dude. You finally made up for your Dad’s major fuck-up.”

Steve chuckled loudly. “Ha! Fuck you, dude. And fuck the banks most of all.”

“I’ll blaze to that,” Rashid said as he puffed the doobie.

“420 blaze it.”

Rashid exhaled, blowing perfect smoke rings. “So what’s the rest of the five g’s for?”

“Oh, just my rent for the rest of the summer and for the entire school year. Hashtag unpaid intern life.”

Rashid chuckled. Suddenly, there was a noise outside just as Jake Elliot was about to kick the opening kickoff.

“Fuck was that?” Steve demanded.

“Somebody is pulling into the driveway,” said Rashid, worriedly as he glanced at the window. What was clearly a car door slammed loudly, and Rashid urgently ran over to the window, Steve right behind. There, they looked out into the driveway and witnessed a Red Toyota Camry, driverless, sitting there at the end of Rashid’s driveway, blocking the egress of the family’s cars.

“I wonder who that might be,” said Rashid as he waited for the doorbell to ring.

“It is me,” said a deep masculine voice from right behind them, as Red Camry Man strongly gripped both young men by the mouth and smeared their faces with chloroform-soaked rags until they fell unconscious onto the dirty carpeted floor."

I (somehow) qualified for MTH171 and am currently enrolled in it, but I'm worried it might be overkill. I recently did an internship at an AI research institute, and it seemed like many of the researchers there were mathematicians who knew how to code, rather than computer scientists. For this reason, I'm very interested in getting as advanced and sound a foundation in mathematics as possible.

On the other hand, I'm not really that *into* math, the instructor called the class ""marine bootcamp for the brain"" on day 1, and most of my friends are recommending that I just drop down to 150, the normal math course for CompSci students.

Am I overvaluing the role of complex math in subjects like neural networks and cryptography, or am I going to have to soldier through this course?"

Ever since I was kid, I've wanted to work at JPL because of its reputation and amazing community. Now, I'm a sophomore at UT Austin majoring in physics with a 3.97 GPA, and I would like to get an internship at JPL in the summer of 2019, but I'm not sure how to increase my chances of landing one.

I participate in organizations such as the Society of Physics Students and Astronomy Students Association, and have some prior research experience in high school (in chemistry education, I know it's unrelated, but at least it's something). 

I have looked at some of the preferred qualities/skills of applicants on the NASA and JPL website, and many of them ask for experience in programming and Bayesian statistics, both of which I don't have much experience in, if at all. So, if anybody has some good resources for learning these, I would highly appreciate it.

Basically, I want to increase my chances of landing an internship this summer within the next 6 months, as that's when the applications are due. Any and all advice is highly appreciated. Thanks so much!"
9cqe9y,27,2018-09-03,experienced FFIL's incredibly troubling behavior on our 3rd meeting. a new record? probably not.,casanier,Justnofil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Justnofil/comments/9cqe9y/experienced_ffils_incredibly_troubling_behavior/,"after much debating, i'm here y'all. here to pour out my most recent, illuminating experience with this man that i guess i must call my FFIL

although i am not married to BF, i am planning in the future to do so. we met last summer in [Southern City] while i was there for an internship, fell in love, and have been maintaining an LDR while i study in [Mid-Atlantic City]. he told me in advance some background about his family dynamic. a sister 8 years older with a son and a Puerto-Rican redneck husband (yes you read that right), he was the marriage-saving baby because his father couldn't stop fucking bar flies, a mother who is sweet and kind but gets walked all over like a mat, and a father who fucked up BF's sense of self-worth and masculinity. well, we all have messy dynamics so i prepared for the worst, but the first two times i visited his family were relatively fun!

let's dive straight into the 3rd (and most recent) time i visited his family with him for a weekend though, because this is when FFIL's true colors become apparent to me

the first two times were during major family events: a new year's brunch and BF's nephew's 1st birthday. i got along with his family! i breathed a sigh of relief, because i'm a ~yankee artist~ intruding on True American Culture. but everyone was pretty welcoming and chill! 


i came into this 3rd visit with the expectation that it would be like the other times. oh-ho-ho, spring chicken, so naive you were. the difference is this: those past two visits were during events that had at least a dozen people that he could be ~entertained~ by, so i only had to interact with him briefly. this trip? just the FMIL, FFIL, and occasionally FSIL (+ her husband and child). 

HIGHLIGHT #1:
FFIL was getting figgity FUCKED up before 5 pm off beer, planning on grilling for dinner, as BF has told me he gets way too drunk way too often as has for a while. i'm trying to catch up with FMIL and FSIL in the kitchen because i genuinely enjoy their personalities and input, but he's too busy staggering about, interrupting, and making comments about being my ""future daddy-in-law"" and grandchildren.

pause...


yes. 


gag.

thankfully it was only when he was blasted that he was obnoxious about that, but god i swear if they bring it up again i'll announce the beginning of a fun new game! it's gonna be called ""None of Your Fucking Business"" and anytime anyone brings up grandchildren or marriage in socially inappropriate ways, and tries to guilt me into marriage or children, i'll add another 2 years to when i was comfortable with the idea of marriage or children! try me old man! you have less time on this earth than i do! we can freeze embryos now! i can go for decades! 

i feel like there's a beauty in social interactions where everyone understands ""ah yes, this couple is obviously very serious but let's not embarrass or harass them"" that he just ...... ignored. 

HIGHLIGHT #2
all of us were hanging out in the living room while FFIL sat in his chair and squawked about Millennials and their laziness as we all had to take witness in his glory and knowledge. god. not to psychologically analyze another human but i feel he likes control over others, whether it be belittling them, or lecturing them, or commanding their attention with his anger. he loves being in a room and going off about his F A C T S about the world. i have never experience a ""conversation"" with this man. simply being told things or being made fun of when trying to converse with him. 

BF comes from a more conservative family but is very left, and i always feel him physically and emotionally deflate when we're with his family. i won't go into details, but basically FFIL is a Piece of Shit and FMIL and FSIL feel that it's better to just let ""boys be boys"" 

i would say dinner went by quickly but not without FFIL commenting continually about how ""little"" i put on my plate and making it seem like i hated the wings he grilled. nah man, i'm just not trying to be overweight anymore. don't drag me down with you. 


the night couldn't have been complete without him touching me  intimately (small of back, almost my ass, literally wtf) while incredibly drunk and just while walking by. even though i make it a point to not hug him when saying hello/goodbye? it would happen with others around in what felt in a very strategic power move. i'd like to tell myself that if he does that the next time i visit, i'll be sure to remind him that just because i like his son's touch doesn't mean i like his. 

HIGHLIGHT #3
he also does this REALLY fun thing, where each time i say something to contribute to a conversation he turns it into a moment to embarrass me or belittle me. EX: me complimenting FMIL's banana pudding (because holy shit, it's incredible guys), and mentioning i feel like i love banana pudding so much because i associate it with my childhood summer camp days. he uses the opportunity to say, in a voice that reminds me of the way a PRE-K teacher tells a kid about how sharing-is-caring, ""well, casanier, we're not at camp right now are we? *looking around the table* Are we?"". the tone was the equivalent to ""god this bitch won't stop saying stupid shit"". sorry FFIL, i'm simply a human, trying to convey emotions, trying to connect with others, trying to establish myself as a human. i know that's hard to understand from a sack of Delicate Ego like you, but! try!

BF got me and him OUT after dinner to hang with his high school friends that were in town and had an absolute ball. i regained some sanity by drinking and socializing in genuinely energizing ways. 

that was short-lived. 

HIGHLIGHT #4
breakfast happened. and when i tell you i experienced a kind of misogyny that gave me whiplash-- I EXPERIENCED A KIND OF MISOGYNY THAT GAVE ME WHIPLASH. 

FMIL was buzzing around FFIL, catering to his every whim. getting his plate, coffee, creamer, refilling it when it was empty, etc. etc. when FMIL came back with another cup of coffee from the kitchen he looked across the table at me real serious and goes, in the most condescending voice, ""you see this, casanier? can you remember this?"" and other things to that degree, implying that my place is to fetch things for my beloved master-- oh fuck, i mean husband. it was reminiscent of high school and the kitchen jokes, except coming from a fully-grown man. 

my BF sighed, and i replied in the most sarcastic voice, ""oh, YES. i understand, sir!""

thankfully breakfast was over at that point so BF and i packed up and left, much to everyone's disappointment. oh no! sorry! we have a 2 hour car ride to do and i have a flight to catch afterwards! we're just SO tired. 

the car ride was filled with a serious discussion about not spending more than 36 hours with his family, he happily accepted. i was also filled in on more family background and i emphasized to my BF that i can only hold off on his father's behavior for so long before i calmly let his father know that he can suck his own dick. fortunately all the ways FFIL mistreated BF have made BF more than happy to minimize contact with him.

BF visited his family this weekend and when BF and i were catching up i asked if he let his family know i wouldn't be seeing them until december and january, he said they were sad about it. oh no :- ( it's almost like i have an education i'm trying to fully experience and that i don't want to come down to be touched, ridiculed, and mocked by a incredibly horrid man. 


so y'all will probably hear from me in 3 months, and hopefully it's a story of me calling out the man in front of all his family.

Reminiscing about Sanders and the conspiracy that stopped him.

Mentions include: Chris Hedges, Jared Beck, Caitlin Johnstone, QAnon, Unity4j.


&gt;The death of hope can push us into a very dark place, but that darkness is the birth canal of real change.

&gt;**The Dream**

&gt;For some people, hope came in the form of a red hat, with stenciled letters embracing their foreheads promising to Make America Great Again. My hopes were pinned instead on Bernie Sanders: my idealistic, naive trust was uniquely attached to the blue and white of the Bernie sticker I placed on the bumper of my car. Words can’t adequately describe the innocent hope I attached to those colors. As Jared Beck writes in his book, What Happened To Bernie Sanders:

&gt;*“In 2016, the dream was shared by over twelve million Democratic primary voters, as well as nearly 2.5 million campaign donors, that for the first time in forty-four years, a genuinely progressive candidate might run for President of the United States as a major party candidate… In seeking the explanation for how the dreams of millions of Americans came to be shattered in this manner, I have found it necessary to come to terms with the potential demise of my own dreamscape – one that has propelled my life path since my middle school days in a small suburban community outside Albany, New York.”*

&gt;Jared Beck and his wife Elizabeth Lee Beck are attorneys for the plaintiffs in the DNC Fraud lawsuit. *What Happened To Bernie Sanders* diagrams the reasoning behind Beck’s disillusionment with the efficacy of both the legal system and the Democratic Party. Ultimately, Beck concludes that the DNC is beyond saving and has successfully engineered the nomination process to such an extent that, in his opinion, there is no way in which an anti-establishment progressive could hope to be nominated as a Democratic Party Presidential candidate. He concludes that the only way for progressive ideals to germinate lies outside the DNC.

&gt;Like many others, I believed that Bernie Sanders intended to create a grassroots movement that served all of us, in contrast with Hillary Clinton’s overtly self-centered “I’m with her” campaign slogan. I thought Sanders would spearhead a challenge to the corrupt political establishment. This was the Sanders that inspired me. When he spoke about a movement that was made up of the people, not centered on the person who led it, I believed him.

&gt;In September 2015, my week was made infinitely better when a fellow Bernie supporter left the above note anonymously on my windshield. For me, this was an example of a fellowship among those who supported Sanders: one based on positivity, inclusiveness and genuine hope.

&gt;Such goodwill was epitomized by the famous incident in spring 2016 when a small bird landed on Sanders’s podium as he spoke to a packed rally in Oregon. The event inspired viral memes and articles almost instantaneously. Like so many others, my emotions and hopes were tied up in what I felt Sanders’s campaign represented: a movement driven by all of us, and that together we could make changes that were beautiful and real. The finch-on-the-podium embodied that emotion.

&gt;The near-biblical overtone of the finch landing on Sanders’ podium did not go unnoticed. Local press at the time reported Sanders’s remarks: “I think there’s some symbolism here, I know it may not look like it, but that bird is really a dove asking us for world peace.” There is nothing like a little divine intervention to inspire the emotions of a crowd, and that is exactly what the bird-on-the-podium moment did.

&gt;**The Death Of The Dream**

&gt;Faith keeps many of us in situations we might otherwise walk away from, whether in our personal lives, our professional spheres or on a national level. As a small-scale example, hope and a treasured ideal in relationship allows a person to ignore the cheating or violence of their partner, in hopes that next time they really mean it when they say they love you, and that they are telling the truth when they claim that whatever variety of betrayal won’t happen again. The death of that dream – the realization that the relationship will never change and that there is no hope for a different future with that person – is what finally frees one to leave the situation.

&gt;As Caitlin Johnstone puts it:

&gt;*Forgiveness is a key foundational element in most abusive relationships. The abusee is manipulated or bullied into forgiving the abuser again and again, without ever holding a grudge. This is true of a battered spouse, and it is true of an oppressed populace.*

&gt;In a larger sense, the only way we can begin to tangibly change an unacceptable national reality is to begin by facing it head on: hope allows us to continue to live in unacceptable conditions. To run from the death of dreams, then, is to run from the death of an illusion that prevents change.

&gt;As a Sanders supporter, the dream didn’t die when he was cheated out of the Democratic nomination in the spring of 2016. It finally burned out only when Sanders refused to confront the rigging of the election by the DNC, and again when he endorsed the neo-Mccarthyist agenda engineered to deflect from the election rigging that stole the nomination from him. This represented a betrayal of the millions of people who spent their food and rent money to raise more than $200 million in support of his campaign.

&gt;Sanders didn’t stop at quietly allowing lies to circulate, he actively participated in perpetuating and endorsing them. Even as Clintonite trolls and hack jobs continued to blame him and his supporters for Clinton’s loss, spewing hatred at the same people they rigged an election to cheat, Sanders did not stand up for those who voted for him. Instead, he validated the lies used to silence them.

&gt;In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Sanders said: “We have a major government, the Russian government, led by Mr. Putin, actively interfering in our elections, determining, trying to do everything that they could to make sure that Mr. Trump won the election,” Sanders said. “Now, there may not yet be any evidence of direct collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign… Perhaps today we do not know, but clearly, this is an issue of enormous consequence.”

&gt;*We do know the truth about the 2016 election. The Democratic Party, the corporate owned media, and the entire foreign policy establishment colluded to screw the only candidate that could beat Donald Trump in the general election. I’m blanking on that candidate’s name … https://t.co/CXKfxpIrxc — redacted tonight (@RedactedTonight) August 24, 2018*

&gt;In response to the farcical Mueller indictments, USA Today reported Sanders’s sentiments: *“It has been clear to everyone (except Donald Trump) that Russia was deeply involved in the 2016 election and intends to be involved in 2018… It is the American people who should be deciding the political future of our country, not Mr. Putin and the Russian oligarchs… It is absolutely imperative that the Mueller investigation be allowed to go forward without obstruction from the Trump administration or Congress.”*

&gt;Again: Sanders had the gall to state that it is the American people who should be deciding the political future of our country, while duplicitously ignoring the interference in that process that robbed his supporters of their democratic voice and ensured a Trump victory.

&gt;Sanders’ stance was not a simple betrayal of some abstract concept we label truth or justice. It represents a deep stab in the back of every person who donated to his cause, who believed in him and reflected that trust in their contribution and vote. It was a validation of the very corrupt forces Sanders spent his entire campaign railing against.

&gt;His 180-degree turn was one that ran so deeply counter to the courage of the Sanders I supported in 2015 and early 2016, that there was no possible way to reconcile the two. It was at this moment that the dream inspired by his campaign had to die, because it wasn’t based on reality.

&gt;No matter how painful, this is the challenge facing all of us as we move forward – or refuse to – in a world that is continually lying to us and hooking into our emotions to do so. This is the case, whether in terms of Sanders, Trump, Qanon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or anyone else who promises to buck the establishment while fully endorsing its harmful narratives.

&gt;

&gt;*John McCain’s legacy represents an unparalleled example of human decency and American service.*

&gt;*As an intern, I learned a lot about the power of humanity in government through his deep friendship with Sen. Kennedy.*

&gt;*He meant so much, to so many. My prayers are with his family. https://t.co/iu28V3snDm— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) August 26, 2018*

&gt;The focus on Sanders in this article is entirely based on the fact that his campaign and his response to it being undermined by the DNC served as the specific impetus for this writer’s current understanding of the dangerous nature of misplaced hope. However, the basic premise is the same no matter who your savior is.

&gt;*First @realDonaldTrump gave us hope, then #qanon gave us hope….We were told to trust Sessons, trust the plan, that gave us hope. 25,000 sealed indictments gave us hope. After 2yrs of hoping I'm for one am burned out. Even when crimes are uncovered, nothing. Now what?— Gary Bivens (@GaryBivens7) August 25, 2018*

&gt;Unfortunately, the more intensely we feel we cannot survive without the dreams we hold dearest, the more likely we are to refuse to let such hopes go when they fail to conform with reality as it is. The deeper the suffering we seek to hold at bay with misplaced hopes, the more cognitive dissonance is provoked when evidence challenges such dreams.

&gt;The incomparable Caitlin Johnstone has written eloquently about the way in which manipulators have harnessed our most cherished dreams in order to abuse us. As Johnstone points out, we must recognize that our ability to feel is viewed by the sociopathic and psychopathic among us as a weakness to be harnessed and exploited.

&gt;As the plutocracy tightens its grip on the throat of the US public, demanding that people work themselves to death while barely able to avoid homelessness and hunger, justified misery will result in escalating desperation to find hope whether in an 8chan-based-persona or in opioid addiction. Hope that things aren’t as bad as they seem. Hope that if we wait a little longer, the ‘storm will come‘ and the corrupt unelected power structure will be swept away. Hope that even for a short time we can escape reality.

&gt;This article is not intended to demean anyone who feels this way: much of it is focused on my experience as a Sanders supporter to emphasize that this is something I’ve experienced, and is not meant to ‘look down on’ anyone.

&gt;The collective pain driving the need for respite from reality among the American working-class is near-unimaginable, with suicide rates increasing drastically across the country between 1999 and 2016. The Huffington Post reports that the experience of the United States’s working-poor is ‘pure hell.’

&gt;As Chris Hedges recently wrote: *“We live in a new feudalism. We have been stripped of political power. Workers are trapped in menial jobs, forced into crippling debt and paid stagnant or declining wages. Chronic poverty and exploitative working conditions in many parts of the world, and increasingly in the United States, replicate the hell endured by industrial workers at the end of the 19th century. The complete capture of ruling institutions by corporations and their oligarchic elites, including the two dominant political parties, the courts and the press, means there is no mechanism left by which we can reform the system or protect ourselves from mounting abuse.”*

&gt;The deeper we sink into such unfathomable misery, the more desperate the public will be to believe in the promises of false saviors, no matter how obvious the sham is. The establishment is fully aware in that the more devastated we are by striving to make end meets, the more vulnerable we are to manipulation and the less likely we are to fight back against them.

&gt;Thus the betrayal by Bernie Sanders of the same public who he sold the dream of grassroots-change is doubly poisonous.

&gt;**Moving Forward**

&gt;This opinion is not a call for nihilism. It is intended to advocate that each of us realize our own power rather than hand it over to others. You, the reader – yes I am referring specifically to you as a unique individual – are the only one that can change a single thing about the world around you. You are powerful, and your choices have meaning and impact.

&gt;This is the same exhortation I’ve expressed multiple times during the Unity4J online vigils. You the reader are the ones who must act; you cannot merely watch a vigil, read an article, vote for a candidate or read Qanon posts and hope that reality will change thanks to someone else’s action. Fully realizing your own power is the ultimate goal and outcome of letting go of hollow dreams.

&gt;When we stop using false hopes to beat back the all-consuming darkness we sense around us, we are empowered to respond in a tangible way to the pain and suffering that exists. Only when we face reality as it is, is it possible for real change to start to unfold. It does not grow on its own – it is reliant on each of our individual choices.

&gt;Intentionally dousing a proverbial false light – no matter how reassuring – might seem ludicrous. Everything in our bodies screams at us that if we lose this source of comfort, we will be alone in the wilderness: however, it is only when we extinguish the flame, that our eyes can adjust enough to see what is actually around us. Our sincere, dearly-held hopes and misplaced dreams figuratively blinded us to our real surroundings.

&gt;Once we let go of the symbolic fire that we believed crucial to our survival, our adjusted vision enables us to become truly empowered as opposed to pacified. To find our own direction instead of interpreting the shadows on the wall thrown by the flame, to reference Plato’s cave allegory.

&gt;As in the prior comparison between the death of a dream and the birth of tangible change, after the cessation of a misleading light we are enveloped by pitch-black starless night for a moment, the space of a breath, as our eyes adjust.

&gt;In summation: it is only when we let go of our heroes that we can begin to save ourselves

It was with a guy I had met on tinder, and we potentially were going to date. I found out I was pregnant January 13th, 2017, when I took my first pregnancy test. The entire month and a half I knew something was up anyways. I stopped drinking and smoking cold turkey. The pregnancy test was as positive as could be. I was so happy. Terrified, but excited. Names started whirling through my mind already, despite only being a few weeks. The next day, an even brighter test. The next day... the bleeding stated to happen. And towards the night, the terrible clotting. Something was terribly wrong, I never ever have clots during my period. And when I passed a pretty large clot, I knew my baby was gone. The hospital visit later that night confirmed. 
It’s been very horrifically tough for me since then. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I still am very much in contact with the father, we spend a lot of time together but I feel as though I am not allowed to talk about it with him, he never wants to talk about it. 
Even my friends, they really don’t understand. None of them have been through anything slightly as traumatic as a miscarriage, and it’s been almost 9 months now so it seems they don’t feel like talking about it anymore, as if I should be over it by now. As if I ever will be. 

I have named my angel Nova, as I felt like she would’ve been a girl. Nova because she is my star. 
Magnificent things in nature have proved to me, one who never believed in these “signs” and “omens”, that she is up above as my guardian angel, listening to me. 

One night after a terrible argument with the father, I was going to kill myself. I drove my brothers girlfriend who was visiting that night back to her internship and then sat in the car in my driveway for two hours, sobbing and screaming and then telling Nova I was “coming to see you finally tonight”. I told her to send a shooting star across the night sky to tell me not to kill myself. Because what are the odds of that right? Well I put my glasses back on and got out of the car and looked up to see the stars. What do I see? A shooting star, of course. I cried myself to sleep that night. 

And during the middle of August, the Perseid meteor shower was happening, and I sat on a lawn chair in my backyard until 5am watching the meteors and wishing on them for Nova. When I finally got up to go inside at 5am, as I walked to my sliding door I said “goodnight Nova. I love you.” And as I said “Nova. I love you,” a brilliant purple meteor flew above my head. I also cried myself to sleep that night. 

September 22nd was supposed to be my due date. Ever since that big clot and the hospital visit on January 15th, I have been planning to kill myself on that day, and finally go meet my baby. I have been simultaneously counting down the days and also trying to ignore it. But it’s coming soon. I have no one to talk to about this, my shitty therapist didn’t even want to talk about it with me. 

This has been the worst fucking year of my life, and so much pain is festering inside me that I am also getting physically ill as the days go on. I don’t give a fuck about myself anymore. My hygiene is terrible because I just don’t care, who am I trying to impress anyways?
Putting on a fake smile is getting to be impossible. And I can’t do it for much longer. 

I haven’t planned exactly how I’m going to kill myself in 20 days, but I have ideas. 

I don’t know why I’m posting this on here. Maybe as a cry for help? Maybe just so at least someone knows my story? And the actual reason why I’ll be gone? I don’t know. 
I’m sorry everyone. "

I found out they put me on a client an hour and a half away (on a good day) to a 2 hour commute near the nyc office. That’s not my home office at all. I know this is a stepping stone but I feel like the crazy hours we work plus that commute,  I will have an anxiety attack early and quickly. I talked to my counselor but my concern fell on deaf ears. Can’t believe the internship had me believe I would work on clients near my home office again. Is there any advice anyone can give me?

9crm7j,1,2018-09-03,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9crm7j/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

N1njastar28

Hope to rp soon!

I was raised in a traditional Hispanic family.",yvbz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9crsgh/f_23_how_to_tell_my_parents_m_57_f55_i_plan_on/,"I’ve never been away from home for more than 1 month (for an internship). I love my parents- they’re very supportive, always want the best for me, offer to help me in any way they can. I'm so grateful and lucky.

However, they’re very traditional Hispanic parents. When I go out, I have to tell them with who, where, what we’re doing, etc. I’ve gotten used to it, but lately I’ve realized it's a very controlling dynamic, especially me being 23. Granted, I live under their roof and I understand “my house, my rules.” 

I have a B.S. in Biology, currently have a full-time job making ~1,600 after taxes. I also recently just started going to school to take 1 class I need to apply to med school. I have ~$25,000 saved up. (I always save more than half of my checks-I don’t have any debt/loans, children, or major bills). My car is paid off. For the most part I'm frugal, and have a budget (which sometimes I don't strictly stick to but never live beyond my means).

I think there’s things you can’t learn until you’re on your own and have to fend for yourself.  They pay for my car insurance,  and my job pays for my phone line. I cover my own gas, food, school expenses, etc.  I do pay them $400 each month to contribute to the household. But I do think I have the funds to be on my own (w/ a roommate of course) and pay for my necessities + some 'fun' money. 

If you've been in a similar situation, do you have any input? How you handled it, and how everything turned out, etc.? Thanks so much for any feedback/advice.

TLDR: I was raised in very traditional Hispanic household. I don’t live in a toxic/abusive household (my parents are loving &amp; supportive)- but I want to live my own life and not have to answer to anyone as if I’m still a child/teen. Any advice on telling very traditional parents I plan on moving out, and how it worked out in the end for you?

9csj81,0,2018-09-04,Conditional discharge in Canada (Ontario) PLEASE HELP,theaccountant95,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/9csj81/conditional_discharge_in_canada_ontario_please/,"So in Nov of 2015 I was charged and on Aug 2016 I received a 3 year conditional discharge and as part of the discharge I had to do 18 months probation. I am done the probation part and now I am waiting on the 3 year mark before it gets purged. This should be around Aug 2019.  Also with the 3 year conditional discharge I received a 10 year weapons prohibition period.  Anyways By Sept 2019 I am hoping to do an internship or start working because hopefully I will be in the final year of my degree. I was wondering what are my next steps and how do I know it will get purged. Also I was told about a file destruction and was wondering can I ask for a file destruction for a conditional discharge. 

The first time I got arrested I was photographed at the police station and my thumb prints taken.   
Then I got another photograph taken at the detention center.

The second time I was caught for breach however at the end of the trial, the breach charges were dropped. For those charged I was once again fingerprinted and was taken photographs.

The at the end of the trial period when I received my conditional discharge I was thumb printed again at the courthouse and , my blood sample was taken and that was it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I was wondering out of all these times is it possible to get these removed completely like every file. Also I have never entered the US except once when I was a kid like 4 years old. I don't plan to travel to the US any time soon however the career I plan to do might require me to travel to to the us often. Is there a way that can I assure that there will be no problems whenever I travel across the country. Also will a conditional discharge be on high level security clearance levels or the 10 years weapons prohibition charge? Honestly what do I do please someone help. I am getting old and I am trying to break into my industry by the age time limit is up. However the conditional discharge is supposed to be purge Aug 2019, what records will it still stay on?

I am pleased to present you all with an update to my Internal Medicine Clerkship Anki Deck, effectively nicknamed, ""The Doc Deck."" These cards are based off of Step-Up to Medicine, with OnlineMedEd serving as a complementary source of information and pictures. Step-Up to Medicine is an in-depth, comprehensive resource with gorgeous organization that walks you through disease recognization, differential diagnoses, and treatment. The issue, however, is that many of the details presented in Step Up to Medicine are low-yield, requiring skill to decipher what is important. This is where OnlineMedEd shines, as their videos are high-yield, concise, and presented in a way that focuses on the “next best steps” and appropriate first line treatment options for each condition. They are focused on the most high-yield details and will often leave some of the fine details out. So these cards aim to strike the balance between the overly-detailed Step-Up to Medicine and the overly-simplified OnlineMedEd. 

These cards are VERY influenced by the Zanki Step I deck. One major difference that you will find is that there are multiple cloze deletions in each card. The reason for this is to help you when you get pimped on this information. Attendings and residents do not give you as many memory cues as Step I did, so these cards reflect that fact. In general, for most diseases, one card will require you to recall disease pathophysiology, one card will require you to recall disease clinical picture/diagnosis, and one card will require you to recall treatment. I have heavily focused on these three areas, because at the end of the day that is what matters for your patients, your shelf, and your Step II exam. **Speaking of Zanki... This deck should NOT replace a uWorld deck. For EVERY shelf, uWorld is still king; therefore, you should use [Zanki Step II](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/8g27fp/zanki_step_2/) or [WiWa Step II](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/97ssh3/wiwa_deck_for_step_ii_ck_reupload/) alongside/after you do uWorld.** Read below for a brief synopsis on each chapter/subdeck.

Examsoft ruined a large number of updates that I made. And for the last six subdecks, I had to re-edit from scratch. As a result, I never re-edited the skin subdeck, and only fixed half of the ambulatory subdeck. A list of changes that I've made include:

* Corrected hundreds of typos

* Added clues into some of those terrible ""guess what I'm thinking"" cards that actually test your knowledge as opposed to testing your mind-reading abilities

* Deleted duplicates

* Rewrote some terribly worded cards

**[The Complete Doc Deck](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QxF_nx8ksUJvW_21oWrpaDNm2WajUsWr) - Card count: 1604**

Diseases of the Cardiovascular System - So this chapter was phenomenal and relatively high-yield, especially in the beginning. The cards get a little bit into the weeds with CAD, but CAD is important and especially pimp-worthy. **For some reason, these cards go to your default folder. Someone help...**

Diseases of the Pulmonary System - Holy crap, the majority of the information in this chapter is incredibly low-yield. Seriously, this chapter freaking sucked. The only high-yield topics covered in this chapter are COPD, asthma, lung cancer, and pulmonary embolism; everything else in here is super low-yield. And I will argue that they didn't even have enough information for lung cancer. There is profanity in the extra section of these cards because this chapter was so poorly put together. With that said, I tried to significantly trim the fat here. Whereas the cardio chapter is comprehensive for SU2M, this chapter is much more tailored towards OME, while stealing the organization and flow from SU2M. For the OME haters/SU2M lovers out there, give these cards a chance as they still cover the majority of the SU2M material in the SU2M order, they just cover it in a way that will benefit a MS3 getting pimped, studying for a shelf, and studying for Step II, rather than a pulm/crit care fellow studying for boards. **There have been significant edits to this chapter. Consider this update V2 for the pulmonary chapter. These cards may also be found in the default folder... Someone... Anyone... Help...**

Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System - This chapter found the mid-way point between the phenomenal Cardiac chapter and the phenomenally terrible Pulm chapter. As a result, I used more SU2M than I did during the Pulm chapter. OME was not the greatest with this organ system, therefore I used a lot of AMBOSS to key in on the high-yield points. This chapter is severely lacking on pictures. A future update should fix this problem.

Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases - Being completely biased, I thought that this chapter was pretty darn good, as the endocrine system is my favorite system. I tried to avoid getting bogged down by the details, therefore you may notice that some basic info about the diseases may be absent, due to the fact that you should know them by now (Example: T1DM requires insulin to live, whereas T2DM can be managed with diet and exercise). Also there is not a single pathway in these cards, as they are not relevant for Step II and it is very unlikely that you will get pimped on hormone pathways. HOWEVER, knowing these pathways MAY be helpful for understanding some of the finer points concerning each disease (Example: the cortisol/ACTH pathway may be helpful for understanding why hyperpigmentation is a symptom of certain adrenal insufficiency syndromes, but not all), therefore, it may be useful for you to add some Zanki Step I cards to this section if you feel that you will need the basic science to understand the clinical picture.

Diseases of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems - This was a very good chapter. SU2M and OME both did an excellent job of breaking down the diseases for a organ system that traditionally gives medical students fits. You will find a nice blend of both resources here.

Connective Tissue and Joint Diseases - First and foremost... Rheum is pretty complicated. This deck is NOT catered towards success on the wards (although it is unlikely for you to get pimped on Rheum, since most general hospitalists know very little about rheumatological diseases). This deck is shamelessly aimed solely at your IM shelf and Step II CK exam. With that in mind, OME shined for this unit, while SU2M kept continuously getting lost in the weeds. The organization matches SU2M but you will find the bulk of the information that is in SU2M, is absent from these cards. I am sure that these cards are sufficient for your purposes as a MS3 (and probably as an intern).

Diseases of the Renal and Genitourinary Systems - See below

Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid-Base Disorders - As a person who loves the kidneys and acid-base disturbances, I just wanna say that these chapters were absolute garbage in SU2M. The organization for the renal chapters was TURRIBLE and their presentation of the electrolytes and acid-base disorders was confusing and severely lacked in explanations. These chapters challenged the pulmonary chapter to a steel cage match and neither of them figured out how to climb out. So they both starved to death inside of it. On the flip side, this may have been OME's best section. They absolutely rocked it and made nephrology super easy to understand. The net result, these cards are very OME-heavy with SU2M sprinkled in to fill in the gaps.

Hematologic Diseases and Neoplasms - This is a rare chapter where I felt that neither SU2M or OME went into enough detail. They also did not match up very well. I tried to include all the big points from both resources, and believe that this is a very good deck, but for those of you who don't use both SU2M and OME, you may get frustrated doing these cards.

Infectious Diseases - HOLY CRUD! This infective disease chapter is dense AF! The one topic that has continually kicked my ass on uWorld, ward pimping, and small groups is infectious disease. So I tried to ensure that you would know infectious disease by the time you finish this deck, but this deck is HUGE, you've been warned. Now, some specifics... You may want to suspend or delete every card with the word ""treat"" in it. Antibiotics frigging suck because there are so many choices for almost every disease. Also, SU2M and OME NEVER agreed on what the right treatment was. So my recommendation is to ignore all treatment cards and learn it from uWorld/Zanki/WiWa. Also, OnlineMedEd has an excellent video with a VERY generic approach to antibiotics that will help you on the wards. I recommend you [watch it](https://onlinemeded.org/spa/infectious-disease/antibiotic-ladder) or [peep the notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kY_vUmEq10hWb_hnMauAFPnuzkGR7zn-) (P.S. If you like these notes, I strongly recommend you buy OME Premium, these notes have been gold for me during small groups and lectures). One more time for the people in the back, this a big deck designed to help you shine on the wards, but forget treatment!

Diseases of the Skin and Hypersensitivity Disorders - OME sucked for this unit and SU2M was organized very poorly, but at this point, I am so numb that I didn't care at all. These cards are good, considering that they are covering dermatology.

Ambulatory Medicine - This chapter was much longer and more detailed than I realized. With that said, I think it will be the most helpful subdeck out of all of them. This is one of the only chapters where OME was more detailed than SU2M. I believe this is because almost every topic that this chapter hits on is incredibly high-yield and relevant. I enjoyed reading this chapter and 100% recommend this chapter (and the derm chapter) to anyone currently grinding through family medicine.

The next update to this deck will not be for quite a while. I plan on combining this deck with WiWa's uWorld deck. For more information, peep [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/9bp6t4/a_quick_word_on_the_doc_deck_and_wiwa/)."

**Month 0 Recap: The Story So Far**

&amp;#x200B;

Intro: 26 years old INTP, depressed, estimated $500k in debt from first business's collapse, \~$40k in student loans, no permanent residence, family hates me, no assets, no income, &lt;$100 in cash, daughter's mother left for her home state and took daughter with her a year and haven't seen either of them since, driver's license expired (not that I've *ever* had a car anyway), haven't done taxes for couple years, no college degree, barely graduated high school, never had a full-time job, only internship's job reference completely burned. Daughter's mother sues for child support, I did a terrible job providing evidence for my financial affidavit, judge rules on 8/1 that I owe $264/mo on my $0/mo income and backdates the order 4 months so I'm immediately over a thousand bucks behind in support obligations. If I fall back far enough, I could go to jail - then I\* reall\*y won't be able to do anything for my daughter there.

None of the above is said with any spin - just reporting facts. **In the end, I am responsible for my own actions and choices, and I am largely where I am as a result of myself**.

**What I DO have**: God. Friends I'd gladly die for, especially one who's helped me tremendously. **A generally healthy and able body**. Safe places to sleep, free computer &amp; internet access, free phone usage. **And, knowing how to start and run a business**.

Some steps I took in Month 0 (August 2018):

1. Set and committed to a daily schedule.
2. First thing's first: in order to make money and support my daughter, I need to start a business. In order to start a business, I need to first file bankruptcy. In order to file bankruptcy, I need an attorney. In order to hire an attorney, I need money. I have no money. So I began calling attorneys around looking for just ONE who might feel compelled to help me pro bono.
3. With no residence, I have no mailing address. I *need* a mailing address to do things such as file bankruptcy, do my taxes, apply for food stamps, register my business, open bank accounts. I learned about General Delivery and set myself up to receive mail **for free** through General Delivery at my local post office.
4. Applied for food stamps so I stop eating the unhealthy free food I've lived on for a year.
5. Got approved for food stamps! Started eating better and felt physical, mental, and emotional improvements immediately.
6. Started picking up some of the 20 or so random nasty calls I get per day from creditors, explaining that I'm filing bankruptcy and asking for mailing/account info that I'll need for bankruptcy. Kept a detailed log of every single call, who I speak to, what was discussed, and any dates and numbers mentioned.
7. The calls immediately began decreasing.
8. Did some yardwork for $40.
9. Started reaching out to people who got burned by my first business's collapse offering sincere apologies, explaining that I'm filing bankruptcy and will need their mailing addresses, and putting my foot forward in offering whatever I can to begin mending our relationship. **I've always believed that (given enough time) there is NO bridge worth leaving burnt**.
10. **Humbled down to the floor** when all 3 out of the 3 people ***most*** affected by my first business ***all*** respond with forgiveness, understanding, and cooperation.
11. Began communicating with my daughter's mother again, little by little, rebuilding whatever trust we can. I need to have *a* relationship with my daughter's mother if I am to have one with my daughter.
12. Began making an effort to *slowly* mend my relationship with my little sister.
13. Learned a LOT about bankruptcy.
14. Learned EVEN MORE about bankruptcy until my head was about to explode.
15. After adding the debts up, learned that the total is $865,200.21
16. Took a LOT of time to CORRECTLY AND ACCURATELY fill out my bankruptcy forms for filing, probably over 80 hours. My forms comprise about 100 pages.
17. Also completed application on my bankruptcy filing for a waiver of the $335 filing fee given my financial situation.
18. Took my forms to my local Bankruptcy Assistance Desk for free help.
19. Got frustrated at how much I was begging lawyers for free help. Wanting to feel good instead about giving something for someone else, went to donate blood. Like a stubborn idiot, ignored the phlebotomist's caution to sit down to recover afterwards and went to immediately physically exert myself rushing to the post office because I didn't want to waste time. Passed out cold on the pavement 4-5 times in broad daylight until a crowd gathered, forced me to stay down (I kept trying to keep going), called an ambulance, and sent me to the hospital, where I was kept for 4 hours.
20. Got more and more sick of begging lawyers for free services. Began looking into filing without one, despite it being ***heavily recommended against by just about everyone***.
21. Applied for a waiver of the $10 fee for a credit counseling course that's mandatory for people filing bankruptcy.
22. Got approved for the waiver, took the course.
23. **Made the decision to file bankruptcy without an attorney.**
24. Asked my little sister to trust me and let me use her university's login to print my bankruptcy forms. To my surprise and GREAT benefit, she said yes!
25. Took my forms once again to the Bankruptcy Assistance Desk for more help
26. Filed bankruptcy on **Monday 8/27** and started working on my new business the same day.
27. Found out **I was approved for the $335 filing waiver** I applied for! And unable to express how grateful I am for this, as it TRULY enables me to make this thing work.

I'll leave the recap at that. The business stuff I started these last 5 days of August I'll just save for next month's recap.

Been too occupied to make any new update posts since Day 4 (Thurs 8/30), but I expect to get to it tomorrow.

9cteau,0,2018-09-04,I [22M] am interested in this girl [22F]. She says she wants to focus on her career/not want to date but her actions speak differently?,Newflyer3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9cteau/i_22m_am_interested_in_this_girl_22f_she_says_she/,"I met this girl about a year ago at a mutual friend's party. I knew who she was and we followed each other on Instagram before that, but didn't have a chance to know each other until last year. I went out with her and said mutual friend back in March at a restaurant and I clicked with her. The three of us ended up playing 'never have I ever' while we were at a restaurant. I mustered the courage to ask her out a week after, and she said she wasn't interested in even going on a date, citing how she wasn't in the position to know anyone intimately and that she was focusing on her career and upcoming internship for the summer (I find this excuse to be her easy way of putting me down because at what point does one decide to find someone and settle down anyway when their career progresses and gets harder?). Okay, not a big deal and I wasn't gonna be a douchebag so I left her alone, moved on for the semester and that was that.


Midway through the summer, after shift from my restaurant job, I was craving bubble tea and randomly bumped into the two at the shop coincidentally. We had a good chat, we were all friendly, and admittedly my interest was piqued once again. She mentioned that she never had a chance to drive despite having her learners permit, and she has had no chance to. As my in, I suggested giving her driving lessons and she accepted. Between then and now (late July to September), we have gone out 3 times to drive, she has done exceptionally well and I am in the process of teaching her how to park properly. 


During these outings, we also do activities such as get food at restaurants, the mall to shop and run any errands that we need to during the weekend due to her commitments from M-F. My way of making it fun and enjoyable for her and maybe warm her up a little to know me personally rather than just a teacher. After our first lesson, we have conversations over text messages often, sometimes late into the night about our own lives, I've started a streak with her on Snapchat and even stole the heart between her and said mutual friend in about a week. (Mutual friend was pissed since they had it for a year but that's another story). She and said friend attended my birthday as well, and they got me a sweet bomber jacket gift. In the process of knowing her, I've learned that she has had a 'poor' upbringing where the dad is no longer in the picture. Her mom is unemployed, and the internship I mentioned is basically their family's main source of income. Mom never drove, they don't have a car, she physically doesn't even have the chance to drive. I have a feeling that these struggles and the burden of her needing to support her family is what inspires her to be successful and career oriented which is great. (She's got 500+ linkedin connections, networks a ton, gets professional invitations all the time and even gets basic admin jobs handed to her on a plate). At the same time, she says she wants to be independent and how years ago, she treated boys like a hobby and was too dependent on them. However, I feel that she isn't dependent on me at all, and if anything my presence compliments her existing life. I'm not clingy, I communicate with her in reasonable amounts, and my interaction with her has been nothing but positive so far.


I'm texting her one night and asked if she wanted to see a movie with me. She asks me if I'm still interested in her. I said 'yes, a little' and she replied that her response was the exact same as before (ugh). She says that she doesn't want to lead me on, and how if we were to see a movie, she would want to bring a friend along. I sorta shut the conversation down to avoid it escalating into an awkward situation. I'm just confused because we are compatible in terms of our culture, language, kids, hobbies, interests and tastes. One night, I asked if she wanted to get bubble tea that same night on the fly and she decided to come out. When I was driving her back home, she did make a comment once to me about how she thinks I'm not 'ambitious enough' or how I don't put enough effort into my career. I just graduated university with a degree in Accounting, and I'm in the process of looking for full time to article for CPA so even though I never had internship experience like her, it's not like I'm some deadbeat loser struggling to get up and brush my teeth in the morning. I actually found that comment to be a bit of a slap in the face tbh considering how I never asked for her opinion. 


Our last outing, I decided to take us to a brunch buffet, and to spend time with me at the city park attending Pride Day events and to do a photo shoot. I just find it odd how she is willing to go out and spend time with me to the above activities (which I find to be more intimate), but won't even consider the idea of us going to a movie, or doing some cliche date activity. I'm a big believer that effort is the biggest indicator of interest, and the fact that she makes time to spend with me would suggest she is naturally interested, but the fact that she said she doesn't want to date is making me somewhat pessimistic about this whole situation. We come off like a couple, there's some tension that I at least can feel and she doesn't want to meet my mom to save face.  Should I just try to move on and maybe distance myself again to avoid wasted efforts and to spare my emotions, or maybe keep up my efforts in hope that she may be interested and one day she will come around? If I have to move on, how do I distance myself from how close I got so soon without coming off like an ass?


**TL:DR** Girl says she's not interested in a relationship, yet spends time with me, tells me about her personal life and is willing to put effort into knowing me on a personal level. Conflicted by her actions and words."

Er zijn ongeveer 2.000 mensen met ZEVMB in Nederland. Naar schatting zijn ruim 400 kinderen ouder dan 18 en hebben een curator. In veel gevallen zijn dat de ouders.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Van de Raad voor de rechtspraak heeft de Minister voor Rechtsbescherming vernomen dat kantonrechters voor personen met ZEVMB niet altijd onder curatele instellen. Soms stelt de kantonrechter een combinatie van beschermingsbewind en mentorschap in.   
&amp;nbsp;    
3       
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven welke formulieren ouders van kinderen met ZEVMB in moeten vullen om curator te worden van hun kinderen? Hoe vaak moeten deze formulieren ingevuld worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Om curatele te verzoeken en tot curator te worden benoemd, moeten ouders een aanvraagformulier invullen en dit aan de griffie van de rechtbank sturen. De kantonrechter beslist op het verzoek. Zodra de kantonrechter het verzoek heeft toegewezen, moet de curator eenmalig een boedelbeschrijving indienen. De curator is gehouden jaarlijks rekening en verantwoording af te leggen &amp;#40;hiervoor is een formulier van de rechtspraak beschikbaar&amp;#41;, tenzij de kantonrechter een andere termijn bepaalt. Om de vijf jaar dient de curator de periodieke evaluatie in te vullen &amp;#40;art. 1:385, tweede lid, Burgerlijk Wetboek&amp;#41;. Hieronder schets ik de achtergrond van deze evaluatie, die ook van belang is bij de beantwoording van de volgende vragen van de leden Bergkamp en Van Toorenburg.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het burgerlijk recht staat zelfbeschikking voorop. Omdat curatele, beschermingsbewind en mentorschap een beperking van de zelfbeschikking van het individu vormen, mogen deze beschermingsmaatregelen niet verder ingrijpen en niet langer duren dan noodzakelijk is. In dit licht is de periodieke evaluatie geïntroduceerd bij de Wet wijziging curatele, beschermingsbewind en mentorschap &amp;#40;hierna ook: de wetswijziging; Stb. 2013, 414&amp;#41;. Een van de uitgangspunten van de wetswijziging is dat beschermingsmaatregelen passend zijn en – waar mogelijk – de zelfredzaamheid bevorderen &amp;#40;TK 2011-2012, 33054, nr. 3, p. 3&amp;#41;. Daarbij past dat periodiek wordt bezien of de maatregel nog moet voortduren of door een andere, meer passende maatregel kan worden vervangen. Met het opnemen van deze evaluatieplicht in de wet werd een reeds bestaande kantonrechterlijke praktijk op wetsniveau geformaliseerd &amp;#40;TK 2011-2012, 33054, nr. 3, p. 15-16&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Genoemde wetswijziging komt mede voort uit het VN-verdrag inzake de rechten van personen met een handicap dat bepaalt dat maatregelen zoals curatele, beschermingsbewind en mentorschap de rechten, wil en voorkeuren van de betrokkene respecteren, proportioneel zijn en toegesneden op de omstandigheden van de betrokkene, van toepassing zijn gedurende een zo kort mogelijke periode en onderworpen zijn aan een regelmatige beoordeling door een bevoegde, onafhankelijke en onpartijdige autoriteit of gerechtelijke instantie &amp;#40;art. 12, vierde lid&amp;#41;. De Nederlandse wet geeft hiervan rekenschap door als uitgangspunt te nemen dat een beschermingsmaatregel niet verder ingrijpt dan in de gegeven situatie noodzakelijk is en door de periodieke evaluatie.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Met name indien er een mogelijkheid is tot herstel van de situatie die tot de maatregel aanleiding heeft gegeven, is van belang dat de curator, beschermingsbewindvoerder of mentor de kantonrechter hierover periodiek rapporteert. Indien de aanleiding voor de beschermingsmaatregel is verdwenen, kan de curator, beschermingsbewindvoerder of mentor opheffing van de maatregel verzoeken &amp;#40;TK 2011-2012, 33054, nr. 3, p. 12&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals toegezegd bij de plenaire behandeling van de Wet wijziging curatele, beschermingsbewind en mentorschap in de Tweede Kamer, is de wetswijziging na drie jaar geëvalueerd. De uitkomsten van de evaluatie zijn recentelijk door de Minister voor Rechtsbescherming aan uw Kamer gezonden &amp;#40;TK II 2017-2018, 33054, nr. 23&amp;#41;. De periodieke evaluatie van de beschermingsmaatregelen maakt deel uit van deze wetsevaluatie. Kantonrechters oordelen positief over de periodieke evaluaties, omdat deze leiden tot opschoning van achterhaalde dossiers en dikwijls tot beëindiging of overheveling naar een lichtere maatregel. Curatoren, beschermingsbewindvoerders en mentoren oordelen uiteenlopend over de periodieke evaluaties. Als sterk punt wordt vooral het reflectiemoment op de noodzaak tot voortzetting van de maatregel ervaren. Weerstanden tegen de periodieke evaluatie bestaan onder andere bij onveranderbare situaties, zoals bij mensen met ZEVMB &amp;#40;WODC, ‘Werking Wet wijziging curatele, beschermingsbewind en mentorschap’, Bureau Bartels, juli 2018, p. 23-28&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening van onderzoekers van de Rijksuniversiteit Groningen dat gezien 'de specifieke problemen' die de kinderen met ZEVMB hebben en de gevolgen, dat 'erkenning van de eigenheid van deze groep en van de gezinnen met deze kinderen noodzakelijk' is? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, zoals de onderzoekers beschrijven is erkenning van de eigenheid van deze kinderen en gezinnen als aparte subgroep binnen de groep mensen met een verstandelijke beperking belangrijk. De combinatie van de ernstige lichamelijke en verstandelijke beperking en de bijkomende medische problematiek maakt dat mensen met ZEVMB 24 uur per dag 7 dagen in de week intensieve zorg nodig hebben. Dit maakt ook dat deze mensen een uniek ontwikkelingsprofiel hebben en daarbij passende eigen ondersteuningsbehoeften. Om recht te kunnen doen aan de zeer intensieve zorgbehoefte en te kunnen komen tot een passende benadering en passende ondersteuning, is het belangrijk deze groep te onderscheiden van andere &amp;#40;aanverwante&amp;#41; doelgroepen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de brief aan uw Kamer van 6 juli 2017 &amp;#40;TK 2016-2017, 34104, nr. 162&amp;#41; staat daarom dat de definitie zoals opgesteld door de Rijksuniversiteit Groningen uitgangspunt is voor de Werkgroep Wij zien je Wel &amp;#40;hierna ook: de Werkgroep&amp;#41;. De Werkgroep is door mijn voorganger ingesteld om een impuls te geven aan de kwaliteit van leven van mensen met ZEVMB en hun gezinnen en om de organisatie van de zorg te vereenvoudigen &amp;#40;zie ook www.wijzienjewel.nl&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5        
&amp;nbsp;    
Erkent u dat het ontwikkelperspectief van kinderen met ZEVMB op het gebied van zelfredzaamheid over het algemeen zeer beperkt is, ondanks het feit dat dit niet betekent dat er geen mogelijkheid tot leren of ontplooiing is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, de aanwezige beperkingen bij deze groep zijn zo ernstig dat deze mensen vanuit zichzelf geen tot minimale mogelijkheden hebben. Dat betekent dat zij, ook voor de uiterst primaire levensbehoeften zoals eten en drinken, volledig afhankelijk zijn van anderen. Het ontwikkelingsperspectief is over het algemeen zeer beperkt en de volledige afhankelijkheid blijft levenslang bestaan.    
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
6        
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u voorts de mening dat vragen op evaluatieformulieren, zoals ‘wat heeft u de afgelopen 5 jaar gedaan om de zelfredzaamheid van betrokkene te bevorderen’ of ‘wat denkt u de aankomende 5 jaar te doen om de zelfredzaamheid van betrokkene te bevorderen’, confronterend en pijnlijk kunnen zijn voor ouders van kinderen met ZEVMB? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, ik kan mij goed voorstellen dat terugkerende vragen over de zelfredzaamheid van kinderen met ZEVMB confronterend en pijnlijk kunnen zijn voor ouders.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7      
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid de uitkomst van het overleg dat, volgens de berichtgeving 3&amp;#41;, gevoerd gaat worden binnen de rechtbank Midden-Nederland te delen met de Kamer? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
8        
&amp;nbsp;    
Bestaat op dit moment de mogelijkheid om op formulieren die ouders van kinderen met ZEVMB in moeten vullen, bijvoorbeeld vanuit hun rol als curator, vragen over te slaan of ‘niet van toepassing’ aan te geven? Zo niet, zijn de ministers bereid om de mogelijkheid te onderzoeken en de Kamer hier voor het einde van 2018 over te informeren? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
9        
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid te bezien of de formulieren die ingevuld moeten worden door ouders van kinderen met ZEVMB geen onnodig confronterende en pijnlijke vragen bevatten, deze vragen zo veel mogelijk aan te passen en de Kamer hierover voor het einde van 2018 te informeren? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7, 8 en 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Raad voor de rechtspraak bericht de Minister voor Rechtsbescherming dat meerdere klachten zijn ontvangen van ouders die curator of bewindvoerder zijn &amp;#40;zgn. familievertegenwoordigers&amp;#41; voor hun gehandicapte kind. Naar aanleiding van deze klachten heeft de landelijke kantonrechtelijke expertgroep Curatele, Bewind en Mentorschap van het Landelijk Overleg Vakinhoud Civiel, Kanton en Toezicht &amp;#40;hierna: de expertgroep&amp;#41; gesproken over de vraagstelling in het evaluatieformulier en de wijze waarop het is opgesteld. Dit heeft geleid tot herziening van het formulier: bij de tweede periodieke evaluatie kan de beantwoording van de vragen veel korter zijn via een ‘afslag’, die specifiek is gericht op ZEVMB. Hierdoor kunnen curatoren en bewindvoerders vragen overslaan als zij aantonen dat sprake is van ZEVMB, bijvoorbeeld door bij het evaluatieformulier een medische verklaring te verstrekken. Indien nog voor de eerste periodieke evaluatie een medische verklaring aan de kantonrechter wordt overlegd, zou dit voor hem aanleiding kunnen zijn om reeds bij de eerste periodieke evaluatie te beslissen dat vragen overgeslagen kunnen worden; het is aan de kantonrechter om hierover in individuele gevallen te beslissen. Op deze manier wordt de confrontatie voor familievertegenwoordigers met vragen over de zelfredzaamheid van degenen die zij bijstaan beperkt. De expertgroep is voornemens het gewijzigde evaluatieformulier voor het einde van dit jaar voor familievertegenwoordigers beschikbaar te maken. Van de rechtbank Midden-Nederland begrijp ik dat het via twitter aangekondigde overleg bij de rechtbank een intern overleg betreft.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals is aangegeven in de beantwoording van vraag 3 maakt de periodieke evaluatie onderdeel uit van de recentelijk afgeronde wetsevaluatie. Naar aanleiding van die evaluatie is de Minister voor Rechtsbescherming voornemens een stakeholderbijeenkomst te organiseren met onder meer de Raad voor de rechtspraak en de &amp;#40;branche&amp;#41;verenigingen van curatoren, beschermingsbewindvoerders en mentoren. Deze bijeenkomst dient ertoe inzicht te krijgen welke uitkomsten van de evaluatie aanleiding zouden kunnen geven tot veranderingen in de praktijk of aanpassing van regelgeving. De periodieke evaluatie maakt onderdeel uit van het gesprek met de praktijk, dat uiterlijk dit najaar zal plaatsvinden. Hierin zal ook de vraag worden betrokken op welke manier het beste kan worden omgegaan met de periodieke evaluatie in onveranderbare situaties, zoals bij mensen met ZEVMB. De Werkgroep Wij zien je Wel heeft mij bericht hiervoor input te leveren vanuit het perspectief van ouders die curator zijn. Na het gesprek met de praktijk zal de Minister voor Rechtsbescherming uw Kamer nader informeren.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Van ouders begrijp ik dat ook andere instanties vragen stellen die confronterend zijn voor ouders van kinderen met ZEVMB. Zoals aangegeven in mijn brief over cliëntondersteuning &amp;#40;TK 2017 2018, 31 476, nr. 22&amp;#41; start in september 2018 een pilot met gespecialiseerde cliëntondersteuners &amp;#40;co-piloten genoemd&amp;#41; voor gezinnen met een ZEVMB kind. Ik zal aan de Werkgroep Wij zien je Wel vragen om via deze co-piloten te inventariseren of, en zo ja welke, formulieren onnodig confronterende en pijnlijke vragen bevatten. Ik verwacht dat de Werkgroep aandacht besteedt aan dit onderwerp in de voortgangsrapportage, die in september 2018 verschijnt.

“I expected order when I woke up this morning. I got up early and walked all the way down here to make breakfast to only find this place still trashed.” Bailey Powell was pacing in front of her kittens now. She had a simple white blouse with a black pencil skirt. Her heels were red and kept catching Karina’s eye as she watched her president walked. Bailey looked very professional with her box braids up in a bun. The black woman was ready for her day at work and had taken her time thinking of whether to punish the freshman or not.

“You kittens are supposed to clean after every party. This place should be spotless, yet you all stand here among the trash. You all need to make this whole house spotless by the time I come back from my internship. Understood?”

“Yes Ma’am!” They all chorused and got to work. By the time the freshman were done they only had a few minutes to line up at the door to wait for Bailey to arrive. She had given them instructions through a group text to be in their underwear when she arrived.

They knew she meant their nicest underwear so the ladies had dressed up a bit. Karina was a freshman and loved this kind of attention from Bailey. It was no secret she sometimes even sought out punishments just so she could be bent over Bailey’s leg.

The door creaked open as Bailey stepped in. She took a survey of the living room and kitchen before making her way over to the kittens. She nodded her approval at the outfits they chose.

“Good job ladies.” She let a smile show as she surveyed the room. “You all look lovely and cleaned the kitchen as I asked. Because of that, those who do not wish to participate or have prior engagements may leave. The rest can stay if they wish to get a spanking from me for their behavior last night.”

Only a few of the freshman left. This signaled to Karina that she was not the only one who enjoyed being toyed with by Bailey. The woman had a power about her when it came to things like this. Bailey sat in what the kittens called her throne to prepare. The chair had no arms but was the nicest in the room. Bailey beckoned the first freshman forward after getting settled.

“Lily, why didn’t you clean last night huh?” Bailey gave a soft swat and squeeze to the girls ass. She had a soft brown butt. Lily had decided to wear a pear colored thong with a matching lace bra. Bailey gave a couple more gentle spanks before pinching the freshman’s behind. That meant her time was up.

Bailey knew each girl and knew what they liked when being spanked. She gave it exactly how they liked. The next girl was Micaela.

“Come her slut, bend over.” Bailey demanded. Her tone had changed to be demanding rather than soothing as before. She started with hard slaps and alternated each cheek.

“You like that? Being hit so hard your sore, do you? Answer me!” Bailey raised her voice at the command. “Yes ma’am! I love it.” Micaela was breathless at this point and when she was asked to stand everyone saw the wet spot at the front of her underwear. Karina was gleeful as she watched. She had stood at the end hoping to be last for Bailey. The freshman wanted to the president to take as long as possible with her.

As the line moved down Bailey switched from playful to hard hitting depending on the person. When she reached Karina there was a gleam in her eye. She knew Karina liked to be worked up from soft to hard and even enjoyed her pussy getting spanked. Bailey was going to have fun with this.

“Karina, come lay across my knee. Good girl.” Bailey started to massage each cheeks as she thought of what to say. “You cleaned so nicely. I know you worked hard to get a reward today.” The leader smacked her ass hard enough it stung. She went right back to rubbing it to mix the pain with pleasure.

“Somehow though, I feel like you also were the one who told the others not to clean.” Bailey gave her another sharp hit on each cheek. The senior was right. Karina had convinced everyone to go to bed and they would clean in the morning. She knew Bailey would be angry enough to issue at least a spanking order to everyone.

“I’m sorry ma’am.” Karina stated the apology with no remorse in her voice. In fact as she was bent over her presidents leg smiling. Sensing the pride in Karina, Bailey amped up her hits.

“You don’t fuck with me. Got that?” Bailey spanked her harshly a couple times before rubbing. She then alternated her rhythm. Instead of doing short spanks and soothing, she started to give more spankings with less massages between.

“You like it right kitten? You did all this just to get my attention. Well you have it now bad girl. Scheming behind my back to get me to touch you. So naughty.” Bailey looked at Karina’s rosy olive cheeks and was proud of herself. Karina was loving it so much she was dripping down her leg with wetness.

“Kitten, you can’t be that from me spanking you, stand up.” Bailey demanded. As Karina stood up Bailey walked over to the wall and got her crop. “Take off your underwear.” Karina obeyed quickly and now stood bottomless with a red lacey bra.

“I am going to spank your pussy now. Lay on the floor with your legs up.” Karina obeyed and that’s when she noticed the rest of the house watching. They had all stopped to see how far Bailey would go since finding out Karina was the one who had orchestrated the whole cleaning fiasco.

“You like the attention kitten? The abuse? You’re such a naughty girl having all these people watch you get spanked.” Bailey started hitting different her lips then rubbing at them between each slap. The sound of it filled the room as they watched with baited breathe. Some had started to palm themselves through their panties as they saw it happen.

“You’re such a naughty girl doing this. Being slutty for others. Prove you’re a good kitten for me, I’m going to let the senior sisters ride your face.” Karina shivered at the words of her president. She loved being owned like this.

As the first sister arrived Karina stuck out her tongue. This woman was on a mission as she rode Karina’s face.

“Take her juices. You love it right kitten? Fuck you’re hot like this.” Bailey was getting super turned on by just watching. Her spanking had gotten distracted so now she was simply rubbing Karina with the crop. She knew Karina didn’t like to be penetrated so she didn’t stick it where she desired out of respect. However, she knew what she wanted after the fourth sister got a turn on Karina.

“Alright kitten. You’ve done well,” at Bailey’s words Karina smiled proudly with pussy juices all over her face. Bailey pulled her skirt off to reveal nothing underneath. She opens her legs as she lowers herself onto Karina.

“Here is your reward,” Bailey pressed her wet pussy onto Karina’s.

“Thank you ma’am,” moaned Karina. “Fuck I love it when you scissor me, your lips are so soft.”

“Yes you do, you’re such a naughty girl anyone could fuck you and you’d say that. Fuck, for the next week you’re mine. This pussy is mine and you are to stay in my room. I only fuck you and kiss you. You want my attention you’re going to have it.” Bailey explained while grinding against Karina.

“Yes Bailey, fuck, I’m yours. Only yours!” Karina moaned as she had her orgasm.

Internship started a couple months ago, there is no break and time-off apart from being able to come home by 5 pm and going back to work in the next morning.  

Considering it lucky, where I normally have to stay awake for 36 hours during my duty (24h+12h), this month I enjoy the luxury of working 8 hours/day.

My close friends are being assigned away from me,  my parents and siblings are living aboard, although they do send me messages and videos to greet me today.  But life is so quiet and lonely here.

To those who share the same birthday as mine.  I wish you all the best in what you do or planning to do.  I'm 33 today and life still offering me plenty, I hope it's the same with you too. 

Happy birthday.

9cul0n,5,2018-09-04,"25 year old Canadian living in the UK with £10,000. How to invest with an uncertain future?",CanadaStang,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/9cul0n/25_year_old_canadian_living_in_the_uk_with_10000/,"Hello UKPF!
Long time lurker in the UK, Canadian and US Personal Finance subs, but have made a new account just for this. I am hoping for some investing advice as a 25 year old Canadian living in the UK for 2 years (arrived 1 year ago), with the potential to work here indefinitely. I’m feeling overwhelmed with options and trying to find the best returns! Hopefully I have explained myself clearly enough.

Current Situation:
I have $10,000 CAD in savings back home in a Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA) which has earned me 7.5% over the past 2 years and am quite happy with. In the UK, I am earning £15,000/year (graduate/intern). I have £6,000 in savings from the past year and can continue to save £500/month for the next year, at which point my salary would likely increase to £35,000.

My main issue is that because I do not know how long I will stay in the UK for (family ties in Canada), I don’t know what my best options for investing are, and there seems like so many possibilities!

Here are my thoughts so far:
- I am likely not eligible for any contribution matching schemes at work this year as an intern (but will still inquire)
- If staying in the UK until retirement or looking to buy a house, the LISA sounds like an amazing deal. Free £1,000 bonus every year on top of regular Investments options (~6%)? I don’t necessarily like the idea of being tied to a house in the near future, but it sounds like one of the best returns for my money. Could I buy a house with the money and sell shortly afterwards? Or just keep it as an investment property? However if I leave the UK, I won’t be able to continue to contribute or access this money without penalty until I turn 60? Will I have to pay taxes to Canada on any of the earnings within the LISA? So many questions!
- I could send money back to Canada and continue contributing to my TFSA which shelters tax on any investments within the TFSA wrapper. I’ll have already had to pay taxes to the UK so wouldn’t make sense to contribute to an RRSP for example (tax deferred until withdrawal).
- Is buying real estate now a better return on my money? Could I try to get a loan and make a deposit with my existing savings (£10,000), maybe using a help to buy scheme? I could guarantee tennants through my work for a 4 bedroom house in Bicester for at least 2 years charging ~£1800/month in rent and living there myself but don’t know if I would be able to get the loan? This would also prevent me from using a LISA scheme for a house in the future.
- Are there any other investment options I should be considering? For example, would an offshore account be relevant to my situation?

Any insight would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!"
9cvder,212,2018-09-04,Cross post from r/choosingbeggars,shadowluc,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/9cvder/cross_post_from_rchoosingbeggars/,"Hi everyone,

As my previous post i do my IT internship at my school. So it started wtih a man with a laptop, his laptop screen was broken so ofcourse we had to fix it. He handed the laptop over and we gave a ''borrow laptop'' they can just borrow them till the laptop is fixed so they can alteast do some work. The next week one of our experts fixed the laptop screen so it was all working fine again. We called the man saying that it was fixed but he said: I dont want that laptop anymore i want a bigger one cause of my big fingers. We explained that a bigger laptop does not mean a bigger keyboard. He still said that he would not pick up his old laptop cause he wanted a bigger one. Another week goes by finally he came to get the laptop but also to talk to our supervisor. He got pretty mad at her saying that his friend got a bigger laptop (because the programms and tasks he needs to do are more suited for a bigger and higher performance type laptop) so i should get one to. After that he left again without his old laptop. We called him again a time later now he came up with a totally different excuse. He claimed that his eye sight was suffering from not having a big enough laptop. The whole IT department was kinda done with him so we sill have his old laptop and now he just has to use a very very old ''borrow laptop'' with windows 7. Is this considered payback or just karma?

ps: sorry for bad grammer
Hope it does fit here like suggested"
9cvixg,10,2018-09-04,Middle child feeling like we are being unfair in considering a car purchase for youngest child,TimeLadyJ,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9cvixg/middle_child_feeling_like_we_are_being_unfair_in/,"We have three children. They have never fought with each other like you expect siblings to do. They don't fight over the front seat, the TV. Nothing. They've always understood that certain things tended to happen in a certain order and they knew that their turn would come.

Example: Laptops. The oldest got hers first because she needed one first. No one complained because they knew they'd get theirs when they needed it. Same with phones. The middle one would not be upset if we help our eldest with a down-payment because she feels confident that she would get that same help when it's her turn.  She isn't upset that we are paying for eldest daughter's wedding because she will get the same when she gets married.

Now, to the problem -

Our two eldest stayed home to get a degree from our local university. One is now in a MBA program and the other is halfway done with a nursing degree. The one in nursing plans to get a masters and a PHD someday. Both will graduate completely debt free and the one in nursing school can expect a debt free masters and PHD program as well. We believe that if we can afford for our children to begin life with no debt, we should. The same will apply to the youngest child, but she will be going off for school so she needs a more reliable car.

We live in a town that has little-to-no public transportation. Cars for our children was a requirement due to different activities they were in. Each of the children got a car at 15 so that they would know how to drive it when they were licensed at 16. They were all basically clunkers that were only planned to get them through hopefully college until they were able to get a better one. We did not purchase new cars for our children. Our eldest purchased a very slightly basically new used car when she got her career job at 23 BUT we did purchase two used cars for her after one was totaled two years in. We also deal with the fact that my husband is likely needing shoulder surgery soon so he will not be able to drive his manual truck for a while. The idea is that he would drive the newer car we purchase for our youngest until he is recovered and then youngest child would get it.

\*side note\* We are at the point with youngest's car that it is more cost effective to get a new one. Repairs are getting more expensive that the car is worth.

She feels that the fact that younger sister now might not have a car payment for possibly 20 years is unfair and something that neither her nor older sibling got.

I wanted to go back at her with the fact that youngest sister didn't need braces but older siblings each had two rounds... and older siblings each plan to get degrees beyond a bachelors and little sibling doesn't... and big siblings each took large trips with me after graduation but little sibling won't get that because she is going off to school...and if middle sibling moves two hours away for a special internship, we would pay expenses until middle sibling gets an official job...

What I've tried to explain was that they are now at the ages where their needs will no longer fall in a nice order where one year one needs something, three years later the next needs the same thing. They are all taking different paths and that will require different kinds of help, or help in ""the wrong order.""

Do I just let her simmer down on her own or try to explain to her again?

**Tl;dr**

**Middle sibling feels like buying a youngest sibling a car is unfair because eldest sibling and middle sibling didn't get the same treatment.**

&amp;#x200B;

edit: it likely wouldn't be a new new car. Probably slightly slightly might as well be new used.

I think I've liked girls since I was about five years old. I know this stuff is supposed to start in puberty, but for some reason, I have memories of wanting to be physically close to girls even when I was in kindergarten. If you had asked me then, I surely would have denied it (as most five year old boys would do), but five years old, that's where this first started.

Even back then, one of my best friends, as a joke, told me to call a 1-900 line and listen to the pre-recorded introduction. It piqued my interest, and I liked it, although I laughed it of at the time.

Later in elementary school, I remember starting to notice women's bodies. One time, we were going through the mail together, when my mother caught me staring at the swimsuit and lingerie section of a catalog. Even at the time, I was ashamed of being caught, even though she didn't shame me for it.

**My first exposure** to pornography happened in fifth grade, I believe. I was working on a report about some air force fighter-bomber that I was excited about, and to this day I don't know how it happened, but I came across the splash page of a porn site. At the time, porn sites were ""decent"" enough to not feature pictures on their splash pages, just the warning ""if you are not 18 or over, please leave now."" I was a pretty well-behaved kid, so I left.

And I wish that was the end of the story.

I don't know how long it was until I returned, whether it was that day when I returned home from school, or whether it was weeks or months later, but I remember wondering, ""What is it that 18-year olds can see that I can't see?""

I won't share any of the details, but when I did go back to it, that was the very first time I was exposed to full-frontal female nudity. The particular image from that day remains seared into my memory, now 21 years later. I remember being scared of it, not totally understanding what to do with it, but knowing that, in some way that I didn't at the time understand, I wanted to do more than just look at it.

Somewhere in middle school, I discovered a Victoria's Secret catalog that had for some reason been mailed to our home, and then in early high school, our house received the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, because I had a Sports Illustrated subscription. I really grieve the hours I spent on those two in particular. Many of those images have still not left my memory.

**Middle school was when I first discovered masturbation.** At first, so innocently, I remember going to bed one night, and accidentally brushing against myself, feeling a feeling I'd never felt before, then realizing that if I continued it felt good. Masturbation and pornography were, at first, completely separate acts. I didn't even know that what I was doing was sexual in nature. Over time, though, it became its own addiction. I realized that, on the days I touched myself, I fell asleep much more easily than the days that I did not. And it became its own form of stress relief. I was routinely doing this 4-5 nights a week, sometimes every day.

Even though I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't want to share it with anyone. I remember showing up to a Bible study at my middle school, where we were beginning to discuss sexual purity and Biblical manhood, and even though I didn't have a name for what I was doing, I remember thinking in my head, ""I wonder if other guys are doing this too, and I wonder if I should say something about it."" But another voice told me to keep my mouth shut. I wish I'd listened to the first.

​Independently, I discovered hardcore pornography some time in high school. I started out by searching for pictures of female celebrities, and then to models in their underwear, and it was just never enough. My only saving grace was that free porn was harder to find (or at least I hadn't found it yet), so I was only able to peruse the splash pages of porn sites (which, by now, had started to feature censored nudity, and sometimes full nudity). Even though our 56K AOL internet had parental controls on it, I was still able to find my way around them, but my supply of pornography was limited. Sometime in high school, I learned that I could increase the high if I masturbated while looking at pornography. And toward the end of high school, we moved from 56K to DSL, making it 100% easier to access pornographic videos, not just photos. My parents never said they had any idea what I was doing. Somewhere around here I realized what I was doing, but had no framework for confessing my sin. I appreciate a lot about my church upbringing and the adults/pastors who invested in us, but brokenness was not something we ever saw.

**EDIT: Three episodes in high school that I’ve never told anyone about, and that I even forget about (or block out): **1. My friend from my youth group was really attractive, but I was just a friend to her. Her family was on vacation for a week and asked me to mow their lawn. One time, while they were gone, I snuck into their home to look at her underwear drawer and sniff her panties. 2. I also did that to another girl who I was good friends with. 3. There was one instance where I was staying at a friends house overnight. His sister was gone at college, and they let me stay in her room. This time , instead of just sniffing them, I actually put them on and masturbated in them. All 3 of these episodes I’ve never told anyone about, have never done again, and am filled with deep shame about. 

**College was a game-changer for the better, and for the worse.** We'll start with the worse. We moved from our DSL connection at home to the high-speed connection at school. All parental controls were off, and aside from my roommate, I had no one to be accountable to. And I had my own computer now. No more sneaking glances at catalogs, or nervously shutting off the desktop monitor when my mom walked into the room. College was a whole new level of freedom, and darkness. I was now masturbating regularly, between five to seven days a week. The kind of pornographic acts I was now looking at were things that, when I was first starting out, scared and confused me. Some days I would masturbate three, maybe even four times. My conscience (and my social awkwardness) kept me from ever acting out with another woman in real life, but somehow I could justify my actions behind a screen. My grades began to drop. In an age where so much education happened through the glow of a laptop screen, it was a struggle for me to spend any amount of time alone with my computer without feeling that old familiar feeling pulling me to my favorite pornographic sites.

Perhaps the worst of it was the summer after my sophomore year of college, summer 2008. I had recently developed a crush on a girl who had been one of my best friends from seventh grade up until that point. But she had begun dating another guy, and I decided not to tell her how I felt. It tore me up inside. I subleased from her and her roommate that summer, living at their apartment by myself (I was basically care taking their apartment for them while they were gone at internships and I was taking summer classes). It was the most lonely, most heartbroken, most depressed I have ever been. My life revolved around two things for about a month: watching the Friends DVD set and pornography. I didn't get pulled out of that despair until about a month later, when their lease ended and I moved to another friend's apartment.

**At the same time, college was a new chapter in my walk with Christ.** I quickly linked up with a campus ministry at my university, and I am so thankful for the men and women that he brought into my life through this ministry. Not just examples of ""good Christians,"" the guys that I was running life alongside were men who shared their brokenness, who opened up about their sin, confessed it to each other, shared their faith with others, studied the Scriptures, dreamed God-sized dreams, who loved the people around them. This context, on IU's campus, was where men first began opening up about their sexual brokenness. Some had been involved in sexual relationships before marriage. Almost all had been enmeshed in some form of the pornography/masturbation cycle. I began to share my own story of how I had sinned against the Lord, and how I wanted different for my life, but felt caught in a snare. We prayed together, we held each other accountable, we installed software, we confessed, we were grieved over our sin. As I got older, I began to lead in this ministry and share my story with others. And even though growth was so slow it often seemed invisible, we trusted that God was working on our hearts and that he would complete a finished work in us, eventually.

**And then I stopped confessing.**

I can't exactly pinpoint when/where, but it happened somewhere close to the end of my senior year. I had decided I wanted to work with this ministry after graduation, and I knew that they took sexual immorality seriously. There wasn't a singular hard and fast rule, but generally speaking, it was fairly well-known among men that they wanted to see a six-month pattern of freedom, especially in male applicants before acceptance would be considered. And that induced a good amount of fear in me. I even stopped sharing my burdens with the man who was mentoring me, because I knew I would put him as a reference on my application, and I wanted our stories to line up. I knew it was wrong, but I lied on my application, and every time I relapsed into pornography, I would resolve never to do it again. But I did. **Again, and again, and again.**

My first two years working for this ministry I continued to relapse, and then repent, and then relapse, and then repent. Every time, I thought, ""I need to tell someone. I need to tell someone."" And then it would get covered up again. And again. And again. I began to tell my story to the students I was working with as someone who used to struggle with pornography, not as someone who currently did.

**Years went by.** I traveled overseas with this ministry, went overseas on mission, met my awesome wife, returned to the States, continued to lead men, and even helped lead a recovery group where men would explore their past cycles of relapse in light of the gospel in hopes of freedom and recovery. And even though I saw marginal ""improvement,"" I continued to struggle, especially more in the area of masturbation. I continue to relapse even into pornography at least once or twice a month for a stretch of a couple days at a time.

The worst part is not only that I am a complete fraud in this, but that I now see how it affects my marriage. As a caution to those of you who are seeking to be married while caught in sin, know that pornography and masturbation DO significantly affect your marriage bed. The more you masturbate, the more you look at pornography, the more you condition your mind and bed to desire those images and those sensations which are NOT realistic to real sex. Especially on weeks when I have masturbated, I have trouble with orgasm when I am with my wife. Many of those images, stories, videos, and sounds from pornography continue to stick with me, even years after I've seen them. Trust me, I wish they were gone.

And here I am, about twenty years after I saw my first pornographic material and twenty-five years after I ever called one of those 1-900 pre-recorded introductions, fully engaged in ministry on campus, but feeling trapped by my sin. I acknowledge its sinfulness, continue to fight it, but feel so, so alone in it, because I'm the only one who knows the full story. If I could have gone back to 2010 to tell that kid, about to apply for the ministry, to choose the harder thing and confess his sin, I would. If I could go back to 1999 and tell that kid to never ever visit that site, I would. And every time I think to myself that I should just say something, just find someone to tell the whole story to, no one feels safe. I feel like I can't tell my teammates on my ministry team. I feel like my job would be in jeopardy. The whole thing is a crock. I feel like I can't tell my wife. I feel like my marriage would be in jeopardy. I feel like I can't tell anyone at church. I just feel so, so trapped. And so, so lonely.

In the midst of it all, I look at Christ and I wonder what he would tell me. And even though I know that he would say, ""Neither do I condemn you. Go now and sin no more."" (John 8:11) or perhaps ""It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick,"" (Mark 2:17), there is part of me that wonders if his grace is going to run out on me. **That, either I will never be free, or, even worse, that I'm not even in Christ at all. I can do such a good job of putting on a brave face to everyone, to my wife, to my friends. But no one knows the whole story. So reddit, now you know the whole story. Please pray for me.**"

9cx0fu,74,2018-09-04,Got an offer!,aivan021,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/9cx0fu/got_an_offer/,"Hey guys, I'm writing this to offset the overall negativity associated with this sub nowadays regarding job search. To paraphrase u/jerryvo, who (indirectly) helped me in many ways, you are what you make yourself. And I believe those words to be true.

To give you an idea, I began searching in June for a full-time, entry-level job upon graduation this Fall semester. My strategy, which I developed from the failures of my job search for a Summer internship, was this: refine my resume and cover letter and optimize the search of jobs through online applications.

Refining my resume was simple: 60% of the resume was focused on content and 40% on design. The content aspect included the following: my work experience, my projects in university, my skills, and finally my education. For work experience and projects, my bullet points read my accomplishments, rather than my tasks, in a way that I would present it to a boss in order to get a promotion. My skills were something I changed to suit for the job I was applying for (keywords mainly) and my education just read my GPA and school.

The design of my resume is clean and specifically made to even out white space. What I find funny is when engineers apply their skills to get homogeneous solutions in order to get uniform reactions, but don't think of applying their skills the same when in designing their resume, because it can applied in the same way. Margins were set up to match spacing between lines and fonts and sizes were heavily abused in order to make it very easy to differentiate sections and find them.

Cover letter was very short, as per u/jerryvo's recommendation (3 sentences), although I also included a table of how my experience fit my skills. Though it doesn't really matter considering I didn't use the cover letter to get the offer (I only used it sparingly).

Apply a lot to increase your chances. I performed some brief calculations and found the probability of getting an interview shot up vastly when spending 5 minutes on setting up a resume and applying to 5 jobs per day in comparison to spending 30 minutes and applying for 2 jobs per day. Only modify your skills section as that the only thing that increases your probabilities by a substantial margin (due to machine filtering).

Online applications are not a black hole. I found both my internship and my full-time job through online applications (using Indeed). And it's not difficult to get a job at all. Sure, my internship helped me, and my GPA is okay though not good (3.60), but the people who failed in this sub make it seem like you need to be as perfect as Jesus in order to get a measly offer for a measly job. In reality, the people who failed most likely failed in some aspect of their search and simply can't recognize, with maybe a few unlucky ones in the mix. Chemical engineering is doing just fine. There's no need to avoid it like the plague, as some people advise. Sure, I have 200+ rejection e-mails sitting in my folder, but guess what? They don't matter. They don't impact my career. The offers I get do.

So to those who are still in university and those thinking of studying chemical engineering, don't be afraid of the job aspects. They're out there. In fact, my offer won't even pop up in the list of chemical engineering jobs (automation controls), but they're highly seeking for chemical engineers in order to have people that understand processes well. And to those that can't find one, sit down and think about your strategy. You're an engineer with design experience. You know how to plan. So make sure you have one. And I'm not rebuking you for struggling. I'm giving you advice so that you may thrive.

Happy job searching!"
9cx7r1,5,2018-09-04,How do I cope with a patient who pisses me off?,ShiningBrighteee,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/9cx7r1/how_do_i_cope_with_a_patient_who_pisses_me_off/,"I'm pretty pissed right now and I have a feeling ill be pissed tomorrow, and the day after. I don't want to go to work pissed and letting it affect me.

Just a little intro, I'm just a nursing student having my internship at the moment. 

As for the context, there were multiple occasions where this particular patient triggered me to the point that now, I can't really stand him because he is so rude and annoying. I would explain all the incidents where I got pissed off at but there are too many, so I'll just share 2.

1) He told me that I'm not suitable to be a nurse because he noticed that I kept doing alcohol hand rub and says that I'm ""too easily scared of being dirty"". Firstly, I was taking vital signs for my cubicle which means I had to touch both the patient and the computer; which also means I have to constantly maintain hygiene to reduce spread of microorganisms. (also, he said those words to me not in a joking manner, but with a serious tone as if the trying to bring me down)

2) He is on Aspen collar care, and the doctor specifically said not to remove it. However, he insisted that he wants to remove it because he wants to wash his body and hair. I insisted that Aspen collar was not to be removed since the doctor had made an order. He tried to negotiate and argue with me, saying that it is okay to remove and that he knows his condition better than I do. I stood my ground (I know I did the right thing. His life is more important than a freaking hair wash) and refused to let him remove the collar. He then made remarks (can't remember specifically) but it indirectly meant that I didn't know my stuff and basically, I'm incompetent.

How do I calm myself down and not be so triggered? I'm not a kind of guy who easily gets triggered so I don't know why I'm so pissed right now and I also don't know how to deal with this anger. What kind of thoughts should I be having? Should I be meditating? Praying? I wrote it on my daily journal but it only helped a little T.T"

    ""Suspects Cerberus and Onibi were thought to--""

    ""--the prison break th--""

    ""--Mahoro--""

*There's a loud crash followed by the sound of scattering parts as Inari chucks her radio against the wall of her dorm room, features knitted into an almost animalistic snarl. The girl's entire body is trembling out of pure, uncharacteristic rage--no one around to witness her wrath nor calm it.*

*Every week has been nothing but the same news, different victims every time. The bodies just keep wracking up on the counter without discrimination. Women. Children. Men. The elderly. Every day a new crime. Bank robbed. Person mugged. Building set on fire. She can do absolutely nothing in the face of not only big time villains... but her own parents.*

*Inari chokes back a sob as her body begins to relax its enraged tension, arms dropping to her sides but fists curled so tight that her clawed nails begin to draw blood from her palms. What can she do that the Pros have not been able to? Who the hell is she? Mahoro? That name makes her stomach twist, especially now.*

*It takes the girl some time to gather and compose herself after the brief mental break down, her usually unwavering spirit cracking in the face of her parents' heavy sins and the burden she must bare as their child. Eventually, however, she is able to get herself dressed for her internship: Hero Costume adorned and black fox kabuki mask set firmly in place, hiding her heart as much as it hides her face. Much as it pains her in these times, she is a Mahoro... and she will make that name radiate 'hero' through the bloodied stain her parents made of it.*


---

""Search up ahead, I'll take down this way,"" *Inari gestures down one of the alleyways in the city before waving her mentor off. They'd been in hot pursuit of a purse snatcher but lost the suspect at an intersection. It makes more sense to split up from here, especially for some small time crook.*

*After receiving a nod of approval from her mentor, what with the UA student having possession of her provisional license, Inari parts with him to take her search down the dark alley--the streetlights not able to illuminate her path. With the passive abilities of her quirk, however, the fox girl is able to press on unhindered, vision keen in the dark.*

*The girl pauses now and again, sniffing at the air and listening to her surroundings as she follows a faint trail. She winds this way and turns that, sending herself deeper and deeper into the twisted underbelly of the city's night life and further away from both her mentor and familiar territory.*

*'Such a small kit has wandered her way from her den,' a delicate, wispy voice pricks Inari's ears and causes her attention to wane away from the trail she's picked up. Even with her enhanced vision in the dark and superior hearing, she is unable to pinpoint where, exactly, the tone drifts from. She does not immediately recognize the voice but something about it prickles the hair at the pack of her neck.*

*A rougher, deeper, and very much masculine voice all but growls from the shadows, 'Wolf in sheep's clothing and doesn't even know her potential. Disgusting.'*

*'She was taken from us too soon, my love,' the more feminine voice soothes the other, 'she will come around.'*

*A paralyzing fear, at this point, grasps at Inari, preventing her from doing much more than breathe. The way they're talking about her...*

*From the shadows, an older, dark haired woman pads her way towards the girl, smile gentle but silvered gaze chilling as it keeps it's focus on Inari. After her is a giant of a man, eyes like ember focused on her and features twisted into a disapproving scowl at Inari's Hero Costume.*

*Cerberus.*

*Onibi*

*Inari can feel her heart slamming against her chest, her mind screaming at her to do something. Run away. Call for help. Something. Anything. And yet... all she is able to do is tense up when Onibi rests a hand on her shoulder. It's too late. Game over.*

*'Mommy isn't very happy with you right now, sweetie,' Onibi chimes, digging her nails into her daughter's shoulder while her smile turns almost cruel.*

*'Hiding that beautiful face Mommy worked nine months on behind a hideous mask. Enrolling in a disgusting, filthy school full of nothing but vermin. Pretending to be some sort of self-righteous hero, running around in a ridiculous costume,' Onibi lists a few of the transgressions, Inari beginning to feel a little light headed as her birth mother slowly siphons some of her energy away.*

*Inari drops to her knees, legs giving out from under her the more her energy is taken from her body,* ""P-Please,"" *she begs, only to be silenced with a strike to her face, mask clattering to the ground and skittering away.*

*'A Mahoro never grovels,' comes the angered growl of Inari's birth father, 'Have some self respect, you little bitch. If there's any left after your fanciful prance into heroism!*

*Cerberus reaches for his daughter, grabbing her by one of her bunned twin tails in order to yank her up to her feet. The girl is only just able to keep herself standing, legs trembling beneath her both out of her fright and in fighting the lack of strength to them. With a 'tch' of disappointment, Cerberus sends Inari flying off to the side with a knee to the gut--the girl striking the ground and rolling like a rag doll. At some point in there, there's the the distinct, sickening crack of a rib or two.*

*Despite her previous soothing of her husband, Onibi appears only to be grinning wickedly at the treatment of their daughter now. This is her punishment. She needs to be taught a lesson, broken down bit by bit until they are able to bring her to the appropriate side of the justice line and they can be a family again like old times.*

*'Get up,' Cerberus barks at the girl huddled in fetal position, his heavy footfalls thumping and sinking into the ground as he stalks towards her.*

*Uttering a soft whimper in pain, Inari shifts herself slowly in attempt to get herself up as commanded, rolling over to her knees with an arm hugging about herself. She just gets herself stable in that position when there's a sharp pain in her side--her birth father's foot making contact with her and sending her rolling again. This time, she slams into a wall with another disgusting crack as the back of her skull hits the hard surface. She feels dizzy... and sick. Is this really happening?*

*'Get up,' her father all but roars this time, crossing over to her before she's able to pick herself up this time and forcing her to stand by her hair again. This goes on for some time, her father berating her for her choice in life to become a hero and punishing her brutally for it. She gets thrown and struck and beaten down time and again, the villain not even deeming her worthy enough for his violent quirk. Her bones, brittle under his sheer strength, creak and break and the pain, god, the pain... she can't even bring herself to scream.* 

*'Calm yourself, my love,' Onibi finally pipes up in that wispy voice, appearing at her husband's side and resting a soothing hand upon his back once he's plucked the bloodied, broken body of their daughter from the ground again.*

*'We cannot break and mold someone who is dead,' she purrs, wrapping her arms about the bulky man. With a grunt, he drops the unconscious Inari, allowing Onibi to crouch near the girl afterwards. The woman, psychotic, leans to press a kiss to the girl's forehead before fitting that hated mask over her bruised face, whispering in a giggle, 'Mommy and Daddy love you very much~. We're just a little disappointed in our baby is all. You think about this and just remember, dear. We can take you out of this world far quicker than you were ever brought into it.'*

*Leaving their daughter lingering on the verge of death, Cerberus and Onibi disappear off into the night.* 

*The cold begins to set itself into Inari's bones as she lays crumpled and barely breathing, the silence that hangs in the night around her only broken by the ring of her cellphone. One missed call. Two. Three.*

*A rousing Inari, at least an hour after her parents left her, is just able to make out footfalls pounding against the cement, in a run. She can even make out the muffled shout of 'Inari!' from her mentor followed by an 'oh my god' before she's drifting back under. She's so cold. Everything's so numb now. Is she just in that much pain?*

*The next time she's coming back around, her blurry vision is able to make out the flash of red and blue lights in the darkness. She's being moved, gingerly, to a stretcher to be put in the back of an ambulance, her mentor hovering over her protectively. She feels sick now. She wants to throw up but there's nothing in her stomach and she isn't able to move. She just doesn't have the strength... and she drift out of consciousness again.*

*The final time Inari rouses, she's in a dimly lit hospital room hooked up to IV drips, oxygen, and all sorts of wires and machines. It's overwhelming. Terrifying. She isn't alone, though. She can just make out the hunched over form of her adoptive father in one of the visitor chairs and her mentor is off in another, snoring. Papa... She tries to shift herself, wanting so badly to hug the man and be held by him but she's unable to manage it, the drugs in her system too set in to allow her the freedom. All the poor girl is able to do in that moment is let tears well up and overflow until the darkness takes her consciousness again and she's out.*

*Come the morning, Inari's classmates will have been informed of the girl's incident and encouraged that, when the hospital allows it, visits be made. Rumor may very well reach beyond her class with the story, as to be expected, covered by the news.*

I did this because both public transport and biking are just about a small hour, so I would just rather ride my bike. And I've found that this was a perfect distance for me.

But now I'm going on an internship which is around 1 and a ¼ hour, and I've started to notice that this is just a bit to much for me. I'm guessing this is partially because the new route is way more rural so there are less stops at stoplights etc.

So now I'm wondering what I can do to make my commute more pleasant? One of the main discomforts is from my rear from sitting on my saddle.  
I'm thinking about just having a 5min break halfway on my commute but if somebody got any other tips I'm open to suggestions."

I’ve never had any sort of career type job. But now I am a divorced, a single mom full time to both of my kids and one of them has special needs. He takes up a lot of time and energy and has kept me from really being able to peruse much outside of the house because I can’t afford specialized (or really any) babysitters and he rarely can stay in school all day consistently. However, he’s a little older now and recently he started a special school that is better equipped to handle his brand of needs. (I haven’t had to go in and get him for any reason since he started!)


On top of all that, I now have a boyfriend who is a real partner in life things. He helps out with childcare when he can, he splits household chores, and we split some bills. I’ve never had this kind of support before and it feels amazing, if not a little strange since it’s a new experience for me. My marriage was certainly not a partnership like this. 


Here is my issue: Since my alimony is ending soon and I actually have somewhat of a support system now I’d like to go to community college and get a certificate so I can get a job and start a career. The anxiety of not having my own income is really hurting me! 



But the idea of going back to college is also really terrifying. There are so many reasons why it’s hard but the biggest one is that I don’t know how to pay for it. I started to fill out the FAFSA and I applied for the program already. If I can get my shit together I could potentially start this semester still. But the fear of failure and the anxiety of not knowing how to pay for the classes is stopping me from even trying. Why?? Not trying would also be failing. 


I don’t qualify for instate tuition because I haven’t lived in Colorado for 1 year yet. I don’t know that I’ll really qualify for enough aid through the FAFSA either. What’s stopping me from finishing the FAFSA is that they need my taxes information and I have to contact the IRS for that information. I fear that my child support and alimony will put me *just* over the limit for aid like it does in other areas, like food stamps for example. (I mean by literally only a few dollars in a lot of cases.) So financially we eat and pay bills but only barely and that’s about all we do currently. I can’t afford *any* extras whatsoever and my biggest fear is that once my alimony ends I will not be able to pay bills and we will end up homeless. That seems like an entirely plausible scenario. 


The reason I don’t have a job now is because I can’t afford childcare for the younger one unless I get a very well paying job and my partner goes to school full time so he can’t help during the days, only nights. But because of my older child’s special needs I can’t leave him alone with my partner too much because my partner doesn’t know how to care for him and it creates problems for my son who will then have more problems the next day (he’s autistic) and does not handle change or transition well. My partner is doing his best to learn and navigate but my son can have dangerous meltdowns so we are taking it slow for safety reasons. 


The good thing about the program I want to attend is that some of it can be done online and then when I finish all the classes, which should take 2 semesters, they place me in an internship. The job would definitely be a day job and there is definite potential for a progressive career path with a decent salary. Plus, after completing the certificate I can continue on for an associates with all the classes I would have already taken contributing to the degree. And there is a university here that will accept that degree to get a bachelors in the same field. 


All of that is fantastic so why am I so afraid?? I need this! I *need* a job and I *need* an income and just for my own sanity, I *need* a win. A real one. I feel like I’m failing right now and I don’t know how I would survive homelessness with my kids. I’m feeling so lost and as if I’m failing everybody right now.

9cydcf,8,2018-09-04,My Parents are Toxic,Warriorette12,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/9cydcf/my_parents_are_toxic/,"  

Certain things in my life have happened over the past few months that have made me completely evaluate my relationship with my family. Sorry, this is going to be a little long, but I need to get this all out.

I’ve been miserable at home. For years. I suffer from major depression, anxiety, and I have Asperger’s Syndrome. Most of my childhood was miserable due to bullying at school, but a large part was also due to my interactions with my parents.

My father is the type of man who believes his word should be law (likely due to the very patriarchal society that he grew up in, as he’s Nigerian) and that he is never wrong. He never talks to me, except to ask how my grades are and how I’m doing in school. He has never apologized for anything, whether it has been over a small dispute that could be easily checked, to making accusations that can be easily refuted. If I try to correct him, he just calls me a liar and that he knows me (better than I know myself?). He has attacked me twice in my life, that I can remember. The first time, I was 14 and we were arguing at the table during lunch with my mom and two brothers and he began to laugh at me for starting to cry, calling them ‘crocodile tears’. I angrily corrected him saying, “these are tears of FRUSTRATION.” He immediately jumped up and tried to grab me. I dodged and ran from the table, and he chased, punching me in the back or arm whenever he got close enough. I ran up to my room and locked the door. Later, my mom came up to my room and, when I felt brave enough to let her in, she said that all I can do was take responsibility for my own actions (which I’ve always taken to mean that I deserved what I got because I provoked my dad). The second time, I was 15 and he randomly accused me of not washing my face before coming to the kitchen for breakfast. I told him that I had. He grabbed my arm and pulled me into the bathroom, turning on the sink taps and forcing my head under the water for a minute. I remember vividly thinking that now I knew he was strong enough to drown me if he wanted to.

He has never apologized for either of those events, or anything similar.

My mother is more supportive, but she’s very unpredictable. One minute, she’s quietly listening to me vent about how depressed I am and how terrible life is for me at school, the next, she’s pretending such a conversation never happened. One minute, she’s listening to my pleas to take me to a therapist and, the next, she’s saying that I only want a therapist so someone can listen to my sob stories. One day, she saw that I had written some bleak song lyrics on the whiteboard in my room and I came home to find she had re-written them so they were more positive. I cried in her arms and thanked her. A few days later, I feel brave enough to tell her I’ve been feeling suicidal, and she rolls her eyes and tells me to stop being so dramatic. And on and on, all through my teens. Eventually, I stopped telling her things, but then if I told someone else and she got wind of it, she’d make me feel guilty for not trusting her. She has a habit of, every once in a while, saying “you know I love you, right?” and for years, I have not been able to answer yes so I usually shrug or make a noncommittal noise.

Whenever I tried to be honest and tell my parents that I felt they didn’t care about me, they would always say that they DO take care of me by sending me to top schools, letting me go to therapy, letting me have opportunities to do things that I want within reason, and then I just felt guilty for speaking up and made me feel like I was just being a spoiled brat for being upset. In fact, when I told my mom, she got angry and said ""You don't know what abuse is! You think I don't care about you? How about I show you what not caring about you looks like?"" I once snuck out of the house and ran away from home, only returning after an hour when I realized I wouldn’t be able to live or eat or get to school without help (I was 13 with no allowance), and my mom completely denies it ever happened.

I’m in university in the UK now, partially because I wanted to study somewhere as far away from my parents as possible. I mainly have to deal with my parents calling and asking how my classes are going and, around exam time, accusing me of never getting work done and procrastinating too much and that I’m going to fail if I keep things up. Each year so far, I have proven them wrong and gotten mostly top grades in all my classes and then they ignore it all, not even acknowledging that I did well or congratulating me or anything. 

But I have to come home for the holidays because I miss my younger brothers and my only friend from high school, and the nightmare starts all over again.

This summer, my dad has gotten on my case about eating and says that I’m ‘emaciated’ and ‘skeletal’ (I came home weighing 100lbs when my usual weight is 115lbs), neither of which are true because I’ve always been very skinny and, while my weight has changed, there has been very little physical change to show. When my grandma came to visit (his mom), he humiliated me in front of her, saying that I’ve been acting like a stubborn baby who never wants to eat, and even encouraged my aunt (his sister) to get on my case too during the time she visited for a few days, to the point where I ate all my meal in front of her, and she still told him that I didn’t eat, so as not to suggest he was wrong about me.

My mom has also been getting back on my case. She used to scold me when I did something wrong, as parents do, but now it’s like the longer away from home, the more fuel she gets for her fire when I return. We used to have shouting matches when I was younger, where she’d later insist that she’s not abusive because she’s never specifically cursed at me or used words like “worthless” or “stupid” or anything that is blatantly abusive vocabulary. But the insinuation is always there in the words she DOES use. I only got diagnosed with Asperger’s last year, at my therapist’s insistence on my being tested, but my parents like to laugh at finally understanding my little quirks, before accusing me of being purposefully malicious and using my Asperger’s as a crutch when I can’t get something across right, which has only hurt me in arguments we’ve had since.

Last week, my mom cornered me in the hall one morning and shouted at me for an hour, simply because I didn’t come to the kitchen for breakfast within ten minutes of her waking me up. I know I took half an hour to get out of bed because my room was colder than I was expecting and I told her I have to do some things at my own pace, which made her blow up and call me passive aggressive and that I WANT to get up late just to make things difficult for everyone. That I’m self-centered. 

I had an internship for a few months where I was late getting in on a few days, and fell ill during one week and she hasn’t let it go since. She said that I was unreliable and that I have no shame, even though I tried to say that I tried to make up for my lateness by doing more work and staying overtime on those days. She says that my internship proves I won’t be able to hold down a job in the future because I’m so unreliable. She said that she’s heard all about how I’m not eating from my dad and that she won’t support me if I get any weight related illnesses because it will be all my fault. If I tried to explain something or defend myself, she’d snap and call me a liar. 

I’ve also been working on my dissertation’s literature review, which is due on the 24th of September and I’m half finished. But that’s not good enough for my mom, who likes to think of herself as a workaholic. She says she’s disappointed that I don’t have a better work ethic and I could have been done from the beginning of the summer. She kept saying that I no sense of responsibility and that I haven’t improved as a person since I entered uni in my first year, bringing up my internship lateness again.

Even though I told her that I’d be finished long before the due date, based on the pace I set myself, she latched onto the fact that I’d said ‘I’m working at my own pace’ and said that people in the real world don’t work at ‘their pace’ and the only kind of people that work at ‘their pace’ are like Trump, who don’t care about others. The more she talked, the more she started shouting and I was getting tired so I asked her if she had any suggestions on how I could work on my character, hoping it would calm her down and keep the argument brief, and told her that she was just repeating herself a lot without actually offering any solutions. She first refused to answer, then accused me of trying to trap her in mind games and that she wouldn’t answer because that would be giving in. She said that I can’t keep saying I’m an adult and I can do whatever I want (I have literally NEVER said that before. I’m 20 and I don’t believe that. My English boyfriend visited me at home for a week and said he thinks its sad how they treat me even though I’m an adult and I told him that I may be an adult but I’m still their daughter so its okay). She then went back to accusing me of never being reliable and added that she may try and convince my dad to pull me out of university for this coming year so I can stay home and get a job in order to build character.

She wouldn’t stop until my dad came to the kitchen to say he and my brothers were being kept awake by our shouting and she kept trying to talk to me so he had to try and pull her out of the kitchen. Her last words to me were that I should know she had come to me in peace and that I had provoked her (insinuating that its my fault that she started shouting at me and it would have remained a normal conversation if it wasn’t for me). 

I have never felt like a part of my family. I have not known for years if my parents genuinely love me, or just like when I do things they can brag about to their friends. I’m beginning to doubt my memories of all the worst things they’ve said or done to me because they deny them now and say I’ve twisted things in order to play a victim card. My mom says I try to make everyone else miserable when I don’t get my way but, when I try to create distance like staying behind for the annual family roadtrip, she calls me ‘ungrateful’ and that I have ‘some nerve’. She has said that, at least, she understands that we have different definitions of ‘family’ but I don’t know how she’s taken that to mean. I’ve told my therapist everything throughout the 5 years I’ve been with her and given her permission to talk to my parents if she wants, but my parents recently revealed that they’ve started ignoring her calls and emails because they think I’ve been feeding her a sob story and telling lies and they don’t want to get a lecture from her.

My boyfriend says that I should wait things out and, once I’ve graduated, I should do all I can to go non-contact with my parents.

All I feel is that I’m going crazy. This IS abuse right, I’m not just being a spoiled kid who cries when I don’t get my way or when nobody listens to me? My parents have called me a liar so many times and said I should be ashamed of myself for ‘twisting things’ that I don’t know which of my memories are right or wrong anymore. What should I do? Are my parents right for the things they lecture me on and I have no idea how the world works?

We have had some good times, I will say, but the bad ones have just beaten me down so much and I feel so hopeless right now."

About to finish my Master's in Computer Science in the UK and I'm really hoping to find some remote work to do. I'm not sure if I should get a few years of experience in industry first where I can learn from more senior colleagues and get some experience and if so, how long would you recommend? I already have a little bit of experience - 15 month software development internship with Java, MongoDB and Debian. Because of this, I've been getting quite a few calls from recruiters and I'm starting to wonder if I should ask them to find me something with remote working but I am not sure if it's the right move when I don't have much experience yet.

I'm also not sure how to get into remote working in the first place, especially the kind where I won't have to commute to an office once a week. I can't imagine the recruiters will be of much help, to be honest. I want this so that I'll be able to live in an entirely different country than the one where I'm working. Ideally, I'd prefer to be employed and not freelancing, at least in the beginning.

In case any of you care, my motivation for this is that I haven't found a country where I'd like to settle in yet, since the countries I like (including my home country) have terrible work environments. But unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the culture and living environment of the countries with a good working environment and salaries, so I'm in a bit of a pickle. My best option is being employed, freelancing or doing some other remote work myself in one country and living in another.

Any advice where and how to begin?

Thanks."

He recently broke up with me and i feel destroyed. We both go to school and we are both in the period of our internship. We both live in the same country. My internship is in my home country. He decided to go to Japan and do the internship outside the country. 

To get some facts straight: he is my second bf and i am his first gf which i am really glad. We had a lot of discussions throughout our relationship. My parents dont accept him without meeting him. We just started dating and i already decided to stop our relationship. After thinking a lot i asked to start the relationship again. Why stop just because my parents dont approve of him? I come from a chinese family btw and he is not chinese. Until this day i still regret breaking up with him. 

So, we had a lot of discussions in our relationship. I am always really insecure and i have trust issues. This really damaged our relationship. He also has a lot of personal issues. 

After he broke up with me through voice text, i called him immediately. I was omw to my internship and he had the day off. I couldn't talk him out of it and i am really sad this happened. I feel like we needed a good talk face to face. 

I have decided to call a psychologist and make an appointment, because i really need to fix my mental issues and depression.

I wanna start fresh with him, but do not know if this is a good plan?"
9d05zw,0,2018-09-04,In serious debt for a long time and need some advice paying it off,Finance_Probz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9d05zw/in_serious_debt_for_a_long_time_and_need_some/,"Hi Everyone, first post here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26years old and have been very bad with money for as long as I can remember, never saved a dime and would always spend whatever I had from a very young age. I would really find ways to spend money if I had excess, buying things I didn't need. Well it all was fine, until I got myself a $30,000 credit line and a $5,000 credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I needed around 5,000$ 3 years ago to pay for my school fees as I could not get any OSAP (student load) and went to the bank. I had a good paid internship at that time and the bank offered me a credit line for 30k and also asked to take a 5k credit card. Being stupid as I was, I happily accepted it thinking I would have things in control. The paid internship was of no use, like I said, I had a problem of spending money on whatever shit I could get my hands on. Be it some fancy technology, or clothes or eating out everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, both my credit line and card have maxed out. My pending student loan is $6,000. 

So my debt right now is a total of 30+5+6 = $41,000.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been the case since the last year, and I'm still going pay cheque to pay cheque and just don't know how to pay it off. I'm ready to do all it takes to be debt free as soon as possible so I can start finally for the first time in my life start saving money.

&amp;#x200B;

# Income

I'm making 65,000k a year, in Canada, and so my bi-weekly paycheque is **$1,850** (net pay after deducting taxes and everything).

&amp;#x200B;

# Expenses

\-&gt; Rent = $650 (living with my parents right now but need to contribute towards rent and grocery as they've retired)

\-&gt;Car lease + insurance (320+250) = $570

\-&gt;GYM + Phone = $100

\-&gt; Misc = $200 (just putting number here for the coffee or weekend dinner or something. It usually was over 600-700$, never tracked it)

\-&gt; Payment towards student loan = $200

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing is that I am paying from my checking account over **$350** every month for the interest associated with the credit line! It hurts me really that I have been paying that over 1.5-2 years now. I think the interest rate started at 7% and is now at 11%.

&amp;#x200B;

So expenses = $1,720 plus the credit line interest is $2100. I know misc charges $200 is very very less and usually it is more so lets round it up to **$2,500 per month**.

&amp;#x200B;

So really $**3,600** (monthly net income) - $**2,500** (total monthly expense), I can save a **thousand** dollars a month. By that math, if I am super consistent with everything, don't take any vacations and stuff,  it will take me 41 months to pay all this off? I'd probably be 30 then, and then I would start saving money for marriage and other things? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know where to begin from. Feeling like shit. Can anyone advice on how to go about tackling this, and how to be debt free in the fastest way possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have never tracked my expenses or cash flow before, don't know where to even begin from. At times I don't even open my bank account for weeks dreading to see the numbers. I really wanted to have 30-40k in savings when I hit 30 and here I'm going through the opposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

9d0iz8,2,2018-09-04,Never get up to your ex,Shweebflab,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9d0iz8/never_get_up_to_your_ex/,"I'll try to make it short.

We first broke up because she said that she couldn't develop feelings for me that are strong enough to maintain a relationship.

3 months after the breakup, I've already started dating again and I felt that I genuinely moved on. Mid-terms period comes (College), me and my friends form a studying group and she's in it (she told me she was so desperate and that she was going to mess her tests up so I invite her in for old times sake.)

Given that I'm her closest friend in the group, we study together by ourselves in my room. The first days were just studying, then the next days we talk about our former relationship and how it went wrong and hiw each of us fucked up, for the both of us to learn from our mistakes. It was all good, but being locked up in a room with such an attractive lady, I started to feel a bit of lust, what I didn't know is that she did too, one day, she surprises me with: ""Kiss me."", I say:""What is this supposed to mean."", she says:""Nothing, just kiss me."", I proceed to kiss her. That day she stayed for the night, and we made out. The next day as I'm walking her to her house, early in the morning, she tells me that we're friends with benefits. We make out every day for the next few days.

After the mid-terms and a two weeks holiday, she starts calling me to her house and we start hanging out together, I didn't stop having casual dates though, and one day she tells me:"" You have to stop seeing other girls."", when I ask why she says:""Well, if you didn't notice it, we're back together."", My old feelings for her got instantly revived and I couldn't do anything but to accept the deal, we were back together.

For the next 8 months, we have an ideal relationship, better than the last one we've had, lots of memories and memorable moments, we went places together, she gets to knowy family and I get to know hers, at that point she became a constant in my life and I couldn't believe how we went from the way we were before to this, the girl that couldn't cope a feel was so deep in love with me that it was scary, and she always mentioned how she never thought she could ever fall in love but here she is, falling deep in it. I was always on alert because of what happened the last time, but when it got to a certain depth I was like:""We're treating each other as if we were married for years, we reached a lot of couple milestones that people take years to reach, we're a dynamic duo, a perfect match, it has to be different this time.""

This summer, she went on a two months internship abroad with AIESEC, when she came back, we had an argument about how she didn't notice her phone ringing (that was in her handbag the whole time) while I was calling, and how that messed up our first meeting after two months because when she picked it up it was too late for me to go to her hometown. (She was staying there for the rest of the holidays). 

Two days later, not talking to each other, she sends me this message:""Morning , i have been trying to make things work between us for so long but i couldnt . This relationship came to an end for me , it's not because of what happened lately ,no . I never had feelings neither for you nor for anyone else, as i told you before i liked your mind and your way of thinking , everything about you  . I thought i was developing feelings for you but with distance i realised that it's not true , i was just used to you and to your presence in my life . X, you're awesome , i wish i loved you. You don't deserve this and you  don't deserve someone who does not share the same feelings with you .""

So the conclusion of this is:""NEVER get back to your ex, even if my case is a bit special, the rule still stands, it didn't work the first time for a reason. The exceptions are very rare, and I will never take such a bet again."" 

Also, it does get better with the days, stay strong, It's been two weeks for me and I did not drop my usual strong daily routine for a day, and for that reason, I was able to tell you my entire story today with no sadness and no regret. 

I hope you enjoyed the story time. :)"
9d0wfe,14,2018-09-04,"I think I have OCPD, but I have never seen a mental health professional. I know I can't diagnose myself, but I would really appreciate some support before I seek professional help. Sorry for the long post. Just needed to get some things off my chest.",extroverted_inrovert,OCPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPD/comments/9d0wfe/i_think_i_have_ocpd_but_i_have_never_seen_a/,"When I was younger, I thought I might have OCD, due to childhood rituals I felt the need to perform and to my hoarding tendencies, but roughly three years ago, I came to the conclusion that I fit the criteria for OCPD more closely than those for OCD. I had never heard of OCPD until I conducted a more in-depth online search at that time.

My whole life has been characterized by extreme perfectionism. I always had my own idea of what it meant to be perfect and how to achieve the level of perfection I desired. It was never about looks, but more about knowledge and general ability. I wanted to know everything and be good at everything, as if to prove that I could be perfect to those around me, even if I didn't believe it myself. This meant I had to have the best grades, while also being perceived as athletic. I needed to be musical and artistic and basically contribute to society in every way I could think of.

I exhibited hoarding behaviors from a young age. The earliest instance I can remember is kindergarten, when my parents wouldn't let me have a certain toy or my playmates had toys I wanted but knew my parents would never get me. Instead of letting those feelings go, I would draw my own versions of the toys and keep them in my room. As I got older, I began to hoard information - I kept every single school assignment, pamphlet, book or informational object, so I could be like a walking encyclopedia. It wasn't just enough to have learned what I had; I needed physical evidence and the possibility of getting rid of that evidence was unthinkable.

I also began to express my insecurities in an unhealthy way. Whenever someone mentioned something or I thought of something that I wasn't naturally good at, I would write down the opposite of the thought on a piece of paper. For example, if I was playing wiffle ball with the neighborhood kids and I didn't do a great job of throwing the ball, I would write ""I am the best at throwing in the world"". It wasn't that I actually believed I was the best, but writing down the opposite of any slight on my desire to achieve my ideal level of perfection was the only way I could let go of my shortcomings. It was almost like if I had it in writing, I could will myself to believe it was true and move on. I knew my behavior wasn't ""normal"", so I hid all evidence of my thought process, essentially hoarding these bits of paper as well. The older I got, the more my hoarding spiraled out of control and extended to basically any item I got my hands on. Not only did I want to know everything and be good at everything, I wanted to have everything. Those were my three main criteria for achieving perfection.

I began to set arbitrary deadlines for myself, telling myself, ""by this day, you have to be perfect"". Of course, I could never meet those deadlines, so I constantly pushed them back, which only made me feel worse, like I was failing at my sole mission in life. On top of that, I had certain rituals I had to perform daily. For example, I couldn't leave for school until my room looked a certain way or useless tasks had been completed (like watering the house plants, which my mom already took care of).

I realized three years ago that the behaviors I exhibited above throughout early childhood and adolescence weren't coming from a need to temporarily rid myself of anxiety or fear as they do with OCD, but that I used them more as a means to an end to achieve my desired level of perfection. In other words, I viewed them as necessary, not as unwanted, which I know is one of the main distinctions between OCD and OCPD. In any case, I realized that a lot of what I was doing was making it hard for me to function toward the end of high school. It especially strained my relationship with my parents, who noticed some of my behaviors, particularly the hoarding, and didn't understand why I acted the way I did. They would frequently get upset with me, which caused a lot of tension in our household.

I eventually hit a breaking point and wrote my parents a letter detailing most of the struggles I had kept hidden from them my whole life (I was too scared to talk to them in person). Their response was incredibly disappointing. Instead of getting help, I was told I couldn't diagnose myself and that was that. By the time I was set to leave for college, I had realized that if I wanted to feel any relief from my crushing expectations, I would need to take matters into my own hands. Therefore, when I got to college, I made a conscious effort to put an end to my hoarding and ritualistic behaviors, even though it pained me greatly to do so. I feel I was only able to do this because I was starting a new chapter in my life and I knew my childhood bedroom with all my belongings still existed at my parents' house as a sort of home base.

Focusing on my new chapter helped me to heal. As I've gotten older, however, I feel my underlying issues have manifested in different ways. It was this transformation that ultimately led me to believe I have OCPD. I was still an extreme overachiever in college. I was obsessed with obtaining a near perfect GPA, joining as many extracurricular clubs as possible and taking on the highest possible leadership positions in those clubs. I completed six internships in total throughout undergrad and also held various part-time jobs to earn spending money. If there was a research conference or writing competition of some kind, I had to take part. I was also in the honors program. Basically, I began to apply my extremely high standards in newer, more tangible ways. I constantly kept busy, writing and re-writing to-do lists down to the minute. I freaked out at friends when they showed up late or canceled or changed plans at the last minute because it meant adjusting my carefully planned out schedule. I always had to be in control when it came to any kind of project and I found it extremely difficult to relinquish that control by delegating or trusting other people's judgment. I still do to this day.

I immediately accepted a job offer when I graduated and tended toward extreme workaholism, sometimes pulling all-nighters at the office, frequently staying later than the CEO of my company. About a year and a half in, I was already extremely burned out. I became chronically anxious to the point where I had chest pains. Then, I started to feel really hopeless and often had to will myself to get out of bed in the morning. It got to a point where I would cry on the way to work almost every day, often standing on the train platform and thinking that it would all be so much easier if I just didn't exist. I began to have intrusive thoughts where I pictured myself jumping in front of the train. These always terrified me because I didn't want to go through with them, but I became so scared that I would lose control of the situation and impulsively jump, even though I was afraid to die or hurt myself. Somehow, I made it through that time. I moved locations and positions within my company a few months ago and so far, the workload is much better. I no longer have intrusive thoughts and I'm generally less stressed out.

My main issue now is that I have an extremely hard time finding the motivation to do anything. I have all these things I need and want to do, both at work and in my personal life, but I can't stop procrastinating. I constantly make to-do lists but never actually accomplish anything on them, or if I do, it's only because I have a pressing deadline and I finish at the last minute. I am also applying to grad school but I can't stop fretting about which programs are right for me. I am so obsessed with making the right decision that I end up not making any decision at all. I'm just extremely overwhelmed and don't even know where to begin. Somehow, I've managed to keep up a productive facade at work these last few months, but I'm not sure how much longer this can last.

My personal relationships have also experienced more turbulence lately. I have come to find that I have extremely high expectations and moral standards. I used to internalize these mostly, but now I find myself projecting them onto others, especially those I care most about. I spend a lot of time doing research on various political and ethical stances and once I reach a decision regarding what my stance on a particular issue is, I have a hard time accepting opposing viewpoints in my friends and family members because I think I am right. I feel justified in believing I am right because I have evidence on my side due to my extensive research and spend more time than I'd like to admit attempting to use that information to change the stances of those around me. I am highly critical to the point where I often push too far, causing conflicts in my personal relationships. I know what I am doing and that it generally causes more harm than good, but I can't seem to stop myself. I try to bite my tongue, but often, my feelings end up coming out anyway.

Basically, I'm a mess. Everyone thinks I have my life so together because I've achieved a lot in my 25 years of life so far, partly due to who I am as a person, but they don't know what's really going on inside. I truly am my own worst enemy. I have never been able to genuinely relax or live in the present. I know I need to make a change. I want to talk to someone, but finding the right therapist is just one item on a never-ending to-do list. I've told bits and pieces of my struggles to the people in my life, but never the whole story. Even this isn't the whole story, but it's more than I've ever told anyone. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest more than anything. I think I know what I need to do next: find a therapist, if I can just focus long enough to make it happen.

I'm not looking for a particular response to this post or for anyone to agree with my suspicion that I have OCPD, I've just never felt like I had a non-judgmental forum where I could talk about my struggles. Any support as I navigate this next chapter of my life would be greatly appreciated.

I'm going to exchange for the next semester in the UK, and I will go back for an internship, so I'm currently finding a small monitor that I can travel with. 

The closest I can find are the portable monitors from Asus, but they don't have HDMI so that's a problem. The portable monitors from GeChic are not my favorite since it's a Chinese brand and I can't tell if it can offer a decent image quality for its hefty price or not. And there is the Sharp LL-201A which goes for more than $600. Other than that, whenever I search on Google for ""lightweight monitor"", it returned me with full of newegg and amazon link to some monitor that I found is big and not thin at all. 

If you guys have some experience on this, please send me any recommendation! I have been searching for 3 days without a proper answer. I have also filled in the form that is required by the sub. Thank you so much and enjoy your evening!

But somewhat more positive

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looks like I won't have to start saving like crazy to buy a new car for the time being as my old one is actually still drivable. My NDad had called for our auto insurance to send a truck to pick it up from the body shop and he test drived it to verify if it really was *""supposedly damaged""* and nothing happened. In a way I feel cheated that this happened and that I had to cough up a decent amount of my savings just because of my actions. I could blame it on not taking my medication that day, or for panicking and allowing myself to be intimidated, but that's not responsible at all.

My car is safely home now but the driver who dropped it off didn't bother to ring the doorbell to give me back my car key or the receipt, a *huge* oversight on his part for not completing his job, so now I need to go pick it up later this week.

I admit to feeling rather guilty and I've learned my lesson in that once my internship starts next week, I won't be driving downtown myself anymore and will have to go through the dreaded park-and-ride. But this sucks as another thing my NDad will hold against me until possibly his dying breath. Just when I take a step forward in being independent, I'm dragged 10 steps back."
9d1j89,6,2018-09-04,To my dearest stem cell...,for_homme,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/9d1j89/to_my_dearest_stem_cell/,"  

To my dearest stem cell,

How are you? Are you OK? I can tell you’re upset and tired. Can you hang in there?

It’s been one week since we had that uncomfortable discussion about your work hour, and how I was disappointed about your work ethic. You said that there are many things going on in your life that make it difficult to focus on work.  You told me to “move on” when I tried to dive deeper by asking if everything is OK.  

Over the past 3 years as we’ve gotten to know each other, I have had the privilege to witness how much you have grown as a person, as a scientist, and as a budding physician. You once told me that you think of me as your dad.  I took it to mean that you look up to me as I’m sure I’m not old (enough) to be your dad.  Instead, I told you that I think of you as a pluripotent stem cell – someone with so much potential to do so many wonderful things in life. If you are a stem cell, then I’m your niche cell. The job of a niche cell is to protect its stem cell and guide it towards their proper differentiation. You have no idea how proud I am to be a part of your differentiation process - a journey to find that world which belongs to you. Whether you become a kick-ass surgeon, a primary care doctor, or a scientific researcher, I can already tell that you will be amazing.  I will always remember that February day when you told me you chose to pursue your dream of becoming a doctor rather than settling down with your significant other. You probably don’t know this, but that’s the day I made it my goal to do everything I can to help you reach your dream. I promised that I will help you thrive in this cut-throat academic environment. I promised that even though you are only a research assistant, I will treat you like my med/grad student – letting you develop scientific ideas, see patients with me, and take credit for everything you’ve done in front of other faculties. 

I noticed when you started to show up late to work.  I thought it was temporary, but when this trend continued, I had no choice but to give you feedback last week. You didn’t take it well, and neither did I. Maybe I could’ve picked a better time. Maybe I could’ve been more understanding of other things that are going on. But you see, my dearest stem cell, this career you are about to embark on, will ALWAYS be this hard. There will always be reasons why you couldn’t show up on time. But that’s the thing: you have to find a way to always show up despite everything going on in your life.  When you become a med student, an intern, an attending on service, you always have to show up. There will be days that you feel the weight of the world bearing down on you, that you wish you can sleep in just a little more, take the day off, or just cry on someone’s shoulder. But you still have to show up. 

As your mentor and your niche cell, it would’ve been so much easier for me to cut you some slack and reassign your tasks to someone else. You have no idea how much it hurts me to see you upset because of this, or how I wished I can just do the work for you. But you see, my dearest stem cell, I made a promise. I made a promise that I will do whatever it takes to make sure you become who you want to be,  even if it means that you hate me for pushing you.  

The last couple weeks have been very hard for me as well. Recent, there are many things-personal and professional-that make me question who I am and what my priorities are. I won’t tell you this because it is my own problem to solve. However, among the few things I promised myself, is that I will never fail you. I hope you have the courage to keep going despite the tough times. I sincerely hope that you remain strong as you walk that path towards your final differentiated state. I know you will leave this niche soon,  but you will always be my stem cell, and I your niche cell. 

Love,

Your niche cell. "

9d28ag,1,2018-09-04,I hate my first real job and I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal.,glitchgirlll,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9d28ag/i_hate_my_first_real_job_and_i_dont_know_if_what/,"I just need to type my thoughts and I don't know where else to post it. 

I am 21 and recently graduated with a business bachelors degree, &amp; started my first (real adult) job a month ago.

Previously to this job I had a business internship that I enjoyed the work in as an assistant, but in honesty that job was easygoing with it being 60% work &amp; 40% me reddit browsing, along with it only being 10 hours a week (while taking senior classes) 

I started a new job working at a big national company who deals with many major clients, with my job being taking client requests and scheduling dozens of online orders &amp; tasks needed a day. (Trying not to get too specific in my job)

This job requires tons &amp; tons of multitasking multiple tasks &amp; conversations with major clients and requires me to be insanely detail oriented while remembering all of the client's specific needs. I also have to work very fast paced and meet deadlines, &amp; I also have to keep track of these deadlines myself, without much help. If I mess up any tiny details in my job, I can lose the client money. I have already done this on this past Sunday &amp; the client is very mad and I feel absolutely awful. (It's not tons &amp; tons of money but it's still a pretty bad situation) I have also been making other smaller mistakes at my job that are way less severe but still make the client unhappy, &amp; I am trying my best to not make mistakes but with fast deadlines &amp; lots of details I feel like I am drowning. 

Also the job is 8:30-5:00 but there's already been multiple evenings where I had to work at home all the way until 6:00-7:00 which has been giving me more stress because I feel like I can never escape. I also work on a team, so if I am slow or make any mistake then it causes everyone else to have to do things like work after hours. I have talked to my boss today about how she can make my job less stressful, but I honestly don't think it's possible.

More than anything, I want to quit. I have had normal-to-moderate amounts of anxiety before in the past but nothing like this before. I have been having panic/anxiety attacks daily, I've been crying easily which I've done a few times before work because I didn't want to go (I have never done this before), I've had a lower appetite &amp; also have been throwing up during my panic attacks (directly job related). Just soo soo much pressure and stress.

All of my friends/family said they would support me if I quit, but I'm scared. My coworkers are very nice &amp; have been trying to help me the best they can. I just don't think I am qualified for this position though, it's so stressful and my mental health has never been so bad. I don't want to disappoint my boss too, she is very nice &amp; I don't want to make her work life harder, especially since I've made many mistakes at work lately thats been causing everyone stress.

I'm also mad at myself for giving up so easily. It's only been 1 month and I'd feel bad for bailing. I don't like to consider myself someone who bails at the first sign of trouble, but I just know I can't last much longer here, my gut has been telling me since day 1 that this job is going to stress me out

My biggest fear though: what if every job is like this??? I have an interview lined up for an office assistant job on thursday and an auto dealership, but what if I get that job and nothing changes? What if I just hate working 9-5? I hate not having free time, I hate giving 8 hours to something I don't enjoy, I just don't know if the problem is the job or if the problem is me.

I do think I need to get help for anxiety in general, I am talking to my parents about therapy &amp; maybe medication.

I just don't know what to do. I am just adjusting so poorly to life after college &amp; I want it to all stop. Part of me wants to quit my job this Friday, but I hate quitting without something lined up. I'm not in desperate need for money though, I have a saving account that can last me a couple months along with supportive parents (I don't want to rely on them though unless I have to). I do think I could find a job kind of fast, but only if I'm willing to accept jobs that aren't entirely in my field. The only sad thing about leaving this job is that they specialize the EXACT field I want to go in to, but my job itself isn't doing tasks related to that job. Also the pay is great here &amp; I doubt I can find something as good with my limited job experience, but like I said I'm not desperate for money.

I am sorry this is so ramble-ly &amp; is full of first world problems. I just really neede to get my thoughts out of my head &amp; maybe hear what others who actually have job experience may have to say. Should I stick it out? Is what I'm feeling normal for a first job? I'm just so so lost."

After spending the past few years doing various internships within the music industry, I finally came to the conclusion that I want to work and dedicate my career to Royalties, Copyrights, and Licensing. After being an artist manager for a while, I really learned to value those who work in this field, as much of the revenue the artists I work with get is from their streaming royalties. I don't yet have a bachelors degree. I am currently a student majoring in Music Industry, and have a few years left for my studies.

But I was wondering if there are any people here who work as royalty analysts, or in mechanical licensing either at record labels or in rights managment firms. What is it like for you currently, what was your route to getting the job, are there many barriers of entries for people who want to work in that field? What were your choice of majors in college? I wanna know all of the perspectives. 

Thank-you &lt;3 :)"

How to maintain it?

My dailies:

Everyday:

Go to internship 9AM til 2PM

Read for 25min (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, can't make it consistent)

Sleep before 12 AM (I rarely get to do it because I waste too much time in the PC)


 &amp;nbsp;

Mon/Wed/Fri:

Arrive at college before class begin (6:30PM til 9:20PM, most of the time I arrive 15min later, why? stayed in the PC for too long)

Go to the gym (~3PM til 4PM, this is the only consistent habit I have)

 &amp;nbsp;

Tue/Thu:

Review last class (never get to do this)

Do mini courses online (never get to do this)

Meditate for 10 min (never get to do this, yes, 10 MINUTES, is unbelievable)

Stretch (never get to do this)

 &amp;nbsp;

Free time/things I want to do:

Listen to podcast (I do this in the bus)

Play games (sometimes in the weekends but can't find time most of the times)

Watch series (can't find time)

Listen to albums (can't find time)

 &amp;nbsp;

Not counting basic things like shower/brush teeth/eat meals, yes, those things takes time, especially the meals as I want to gain muscle mass, I try to eat 4~5 meals.

As you realized, my biggest problem is wasting too much time in front of the PC (Youtube, Reddit etc), tuesdays and thursdays I have free time from 2PM but even so, I can't accomplish anything in the day, I don't know how to explain how this happens, I really am very undisciplined.

Last August, things were different. I was starting my second year in college after working both a fun job and rewarding internship all summer long, and I even declared my major! Everything felt like it was falling into place, and this gave me so much confidence that I truly didn’t know what to do with it. The only thing missing, i thought, was someone special to share this new “Me” with.

{In the parentheses below = probably too much detail oops}

(((Then this happens--straight out of a cheesy rom com or some shit--I’m walking to my last class of the day, and outside is this gorgeous girl just waiting to be let into the room. We make brief eye contact, but then the door opens. I make my way in and notice that, for some reason, everyone is sitting on the left side of the room, so I naturally popped a squat down on the right side of the room (because even a confident me needed a little personal space). She comes in a moment later and sits right next to me. 

It’s like we had our own little island.

Despite me being at best a 6.5/10 and her a 9 or 10/10, I managed to play it pretty cool, and she actually initiated a conversation first. 

After about a month of flirting and not paying any attention at all in that class, I learned that she had the wits to go with the looks, and I was certain that she was”the one”. Fuck. Then she asked ME if I wanted to hang out later that same night, and I was fucking thrilled. So, we met up somewhere on campus at 10pm and just talked. We also randomly walked around for 3 or 4 miles, and I was super nervous the whole time, but I never really felt uncomfortable with her. Then bam, it was 2 in the morning and we both realized we should probably sleep at least a little before all our classes the next day...

I walked her to her dorm, and when we got to the door, we locked eyes and she smiled as she said softly, “goodnight”. That was my cue. I leaned in and we had the best first kiss I’ve ever had, maybe ever will. It just felt so natural, and I was genuinely on cloud nine afterwards.

Then, long story short, I fucked it up after a few dates, and she wanted to just be friends for the time-being. I told her I was fine with that, and I thought I really was...

I spent two months with her as a friend, as her best friend. We were almost inseparable, and i felt like we were very connected emotionally.

There were still some mixed signals from her as to what we could be, however, and that made my mind wander sometimes. Eventually, I decided to go for it and tell her I still thought we could be more than friends. She played it cool in the moment,  but kind of left me hanging. As soon as she left, she dropped all communication with me and the devastation quickly set in. I tried everything I could to get her to talk to me, but nothing would work. She instantly went from wanting to be around me 24/7 to not even wanting to acknowledge that I exist.

The next few months were brutal. Winter was just starting, my other close friends were going out without me, and my grades weren’t where I wanted them to be. I was a shadow of the person I was at the start of the school year. 

To top things off, I lived in an off-campus apartment, and I just felt really lonely. I spent most of my nights eating a full oven pizza by myself whilst sitting in front of the tv, mindlessly watching nba games. I wanted to use some of my free time wisely and study properly, but I felt almost constantly numb, and if I sat down and opened a textbook, I could never read more than a page or two. 

In April, i was walking on campus and I saw her for the first time in about 6 months. I felt like I’d seen a ghost. I briefly stopped and talked to her after she waved at me. She greeted me and told me some joke about it being Friday the 13th. I laughed, and walked to my class. I didn’t know how to feel after that...)))


Fast forward to the present (9 months since we stopped talking), and I have to say I obviously still haven’t gotten over her. I’ve tried counseling, talking with friends and family, dating, and just trying to “get over it”. 

Nothing seems to help this numbness.

I’m still in school because I really want this degree, but I can’t focus...I just...can’t. My conscience reminds me of her almost every day, and I get into a vicious loop of thoughts that derail my whole day.

I somehow have a new girlfriend now (and I’m ashamed to say this), but I don’t think I’ve ever had any real feelings for her. She’s so nice to me, and she genuinely likes me for who I am and all that, but I’m really starting to think I may be too emotionally traumatized to reciprocate for her. It’s a chore to even text her back...

Again, depression and anxiety have seemingly taken control of my life! The biggest concern for me  (and this is new) is that I started having both panic attacks and episodes of really bad dissociation about 8 months ago that only seem like they’re worsening as time goes on. 

I guess I’m just reaching out on here to see if anyone has a similar story or some advice to share, because I think I’m getting close to the end of the road here.

TL;DR: Lost my best friend when I told her I had feelings for her 9 months ago. Since then, i’ve had my first panic attacks and episodes of dissociation ever, and I feel like I’m losing control of my mind!"

## Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi, my name is Theo Lee and I’m the co-founder and CEO of [**KPOP Foods**](https://www.kpopfoods.com/).

Today, the brand and story behind a company is critical for success and sustainability as consumers are driven towards companies and products making an impact.

KPOP Foods is a Korean food company inviting people to discover and enjoy Korean flavors through its food products. Our approach is to become the Red Bull of Korean food by bringing together mainstream culture, art, music, and food.

My co-founder, Mike Kim, and I are both Korean Americans and launched KPOP Foods because we wanted to build a Korean food brand that people could resonate with and embrace.

Our mission was and continues to be about bringing people together and uplifting spirits through Korean food and flavors. When we looked at the Korean food companies in the market, we couldn’t find one that represented this spirit, so we decided to do it ourselves.

Our first product is KPOP Sauce, a Korean chili sauce based on my grandma’s 70-year old recipe using Korean chili paste (aka gochujang). We debuted KPOP Sauce through a successful [**Kickstarter campaign**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/603961883/k-pop-sauce-the-ultimate-korean-chili-sauce) last year in April that funded within the first eight hours of our campaign.

We received Kickstarter’s stamp of approval as ""A Project we Love"" and were featured as “A Project of the Day” and ended the Kickstarter campaign with nearly $40,000 from over 1,200 backers.

In April of this year, we launched our second product, KPOP Sea Snacks, a premium roasted and all-natural seaweed snack made here in the US.

While still fairly new, KPOP Sea Snacks is already an Amazon’s Choice product and was featured in FabFitFun (a women’s quarterly subscription box) and Pinterest’s limited-edition, specially co-branded box called the [**P100**](http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/pinterest-fabfitfun-box/313927/).

Most recently, we announced our new Head of Product and Product Development, celebrity chef, [**Chris Oh**](http://www.chefchrisoh.com/).

Chris is developing several new sauces that we intend to launch in November and is also opening his network for opportunities in marketing, content, and partnerships. We’re really excited to have Chris onboard and to be working with him!

Since September of last year, we’ve generated nearly $100,000 in revenue, primarily all online through our website and Amazon. Our products have earned the coveted Amazon’s Choice badge because they are unique and well -reviewed.

We’ve entered over 90 specialty stores throughout the west coast and are currently raising an investment round to expand our distribution into major retailers.

# What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Growing up in Korean American families, we were fortunate to be surrounded by Korean food all the time. However, along with the food, an important principle that was instilled in us was the connection between Korean food and family, friends, and fun.

Mike and I met at business school at UCLA Anderson where we would take large groups of friends to Koreatown in Los Angeles to enjoy Korean food. Along with enjoying the food, our friends embraced the Korean culture and the energetic atmosphere.

This is what sparked the idea for KPOP Foods. We wanted to replicate the sensory and social experience our friends had at Korean BBQ and share it with the world!

I think a really important concept, especially for when just starting out, is being comfortable with launching things quickly.

The UCLA Anderson community played, and continues to play, a major role in KPOP Foods. We took the concept and business plan for KPOP Foods through UCLA Anderson’s entrepreneurial classes and startup program called Business Creation Option, a field study option required for graduation.

Prior to business school, Mike served in the U.S. Army and I came from a finance and banking background so neither of us had any real experience in food nor marketing.

Our classmates, professors, and other members of faculty were instrumental in advising and helping us during our Kickstarter campaign, which launched during our final quarter at business school, and connecting us to potential investors, advisors, and food industry professionals.

If you’d like to learn more, I’ve actually written a LinkedIn post about [**UCLA Anderson’s role in KPOP Foods**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/community-kickstarter-built-kpop-foods-theo-lee/).

The Kickstarter campaign was key in validating our idea and giving us the confidence to pursue KPOP Foods full-time.

But even before Kickstarter, we did hours of research, talking to CEOs and founders of other successful Kickstarter campaigns, running focus groups to test our brand story and variations of KPOP Sauce, and picking people’s brains on ideas for our Kickstarter video.

We also found a way to create samples by buying little bento box soy sauce containers shaped like pigs and filling them up with KPOP Sauce to send to our friends and people interested across the nation.

The samples were great as we were able to send them in the mail, keeping costs low as we paid for everything ourselves with our savings and credit cards. This was also helpful in getting the awareness of our Kickstarter campaign out to people.

As MBA students, we had significant student loans and were presented with opportunities to work at great companies, but thanks to our Kickstarter campaign, we were able to raise an initial investment round, allowing us to pay ourselves a minimum salary to cover rent, loan payments, and basic living expenses.

This was our chance to build something on our own and work for something that we truly loved so we dove right in.

# Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

**Getting the ingredients right**

The reason we started with KPOP Sauce was because one of the key ingredients, gochujang (Korean chili paste), is a staple ingredient in Korean cuisine.

Additionally, my grandma used to send me bottles of her gochujang sauce and my friends absolutely loved it, putting it on their eggs, grilled chicken, burgers, hot dogs, noodles, rice, and more.

Given the versatility, we thought it was the right product to start with – a flavorful sauce that people could incorporate onto foods they already eat. Along with that, gochujang can be difficult to use given its thicker texture (think peanut butter), so the sauce made it much easier to use or cook with.

We used my grandma’s recipe as a base and began tweaking things based on feedback. The most controversial ingredient turned out to be sesame oil – some people really liked it, others didn’t. When we removed the sesame oil, people still liked the sauce, so we took it out.

**Packaging &amp; Design**

We also had to figure out the packaging, namely the bottle, cap, and label. Based on research and our focus groups, we wanted to be in a plastic bottle, so we went online and looked for as many different bottles as possible and asked people for their thoughts.

We also used these bottles during the focus groups to test usability and to see which one people naturally gravitated towards.

For label design, we found a designer, who I previously worked with at a previous startup, to help mock up some label designs. We gave him our story, ideas, and mock images to use as a style reference.

We eventually narrowed the label designs down to two options and received feedback from friends and people. We also posted the designs to social media and received a ton of engagement and comments through that as well.

Next, we had to find a manufacturer, or co-packer, to make our sauce at scale. I remember calling 15 to 20 different manufacturers and not getting anywhere, especially since we didn’t know how much we wanted to produce (time is literally money for manufacturers and since we hadn’t started our Kickstarter campaign, we didn’t know how much we needed to make in our first run).

Finally, a co-packer we ended up working with, was nice enough to explain the process and offered to help.

We learned that the first step was to find a food scientist to scale our recipe as things can quickly change when going from making small batches to hundreds of gallons.

The food scientist would also help us with testing for shelf stability, analyzing the sauce for nutritional information, and submitting our application for the license to manufacture in California, otherwise known as a S-Letter.

The person who explained the process to us sent over a list of potential food scientists - we were fortunate to find a food scientist through a friend of my uncle’s.

I had several calls with the food scientist and met with him to make sure it was a good fit and he turned out to be great, explaining to us certain issues and basic concepts.

**Finding suppliers**

While the food scientist focused on the product, we shifted our focus towards finding suppliers, namely for packaging (bottles and caps) and key ingredients. We were fortunate to find a packaging supplier that was also able to assist with warehousing as the minimum order quantities for the bottles and caps were well above our first production run.

Furthermore, we were able to negotiate a structure such that we only paid for the bottles and caps delivered to our manufacturer. This saved us a ton of money as the minimum order quantities for our caps was 25,000, yet we only needed 6,000 for our first run.

Alongside packaging, we also sourced a quality ingredient supplier that turned out to be in the same area as our manufacturer, keeping the transportation costs low.

After several months, we received our S-Letter and were ready to do our first production run for approximately 6,000 bottles. We’ve since completed 4 more production runs for KPOP Sauce, each time making small tweaks to the recipe as we’re always looking to improve.

Chris is now working on developing several new sauces and we’ve already begun the development process and excited to launch the new products later this year.

## Describe the process of launching the business.

Before launching our Kickstarter campaign, we made sure to have our website and social media accounts up and running.

We bought the domain for kpopfoods.com through **godaddy.com** for less than $20 a year and used **Shopify** to build our website.

In the beginning, we focused on building our social media accounts, mainly Instagram and Facebook. We used our website for credibility and a way to share our story while offering samples to promote our Kickstarter campaign.

After fulfilling all of our Kickstarter orders on-time in August, we were ready to begin selling nationally through our website in September. We picked up a number of re-orders from our Kickstarter campaign in the first couple of weeks and also began testing Facebook and Google ads.

In the beginning, we struggled to get conversions, leading to a higher customer acquisition cost than initially expected, however we learned a lot about our user flow and funnel. We’ve gone through countless iterations of our website to improve the UI/UX.

In October, we entered Amazon through ""Fulfillment By Amazon"" (FBA) and this was when things really began to take off.

We were fortunate to pick up a number of five-star reviews immediately from customers and Kickstarter backers, allowing us to become an “Amazon’s Choice” product within the first week. We soon became the #1 new selling chili sauce on Amazon for the next three consecutive months.

## Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

As we started to see high levels of conversions on Amazon, sometimes as high as 30%, we began changing our digital marketing strategy.

**Retargeting**

We were able to get clicks to our website at a very low cost per click, and thanks to some PR initiatives, SEO optimization, and content development (both video and blog articles), we were able to increase sessions to our website to 150 to 200 a day.

We would then retarget our website visitors with Facebook ads, driving them to Amazon and continued to see high conversions. As we began talking to other CEOs and CMOs of food startups selling online, they mentioned that they were using the same strategy.

The one downside to this strategy is that you can’t collect customers’ email addresses through Amazon - inhibiting your ability to retarget.

**Instagram**

While we’ve grown our Instagram account to over 10,000 followers, we’ve been using Instagram as a tool to partner with Korean restaurants and reach out to influencers we’d like to work with.

We haven’t seen a significant amount of conversions from campaigns with Instagram influencers, however these partnerships have been successful in growing our following, driving traffic to our website, and providing creative assets for our e-mails, website, and ads.

**YouTube**

We’ve had success partnering with YouTube influencers, but it’s taken a lot of time, effort, and luck. When we first started cold e-mailing influencers, we didn’t get many responses.

If you’ve ever had experience selling anything, you know it’s a numbers game and that was true here, but we really lucked out when Greg Mrvich, of [**Ballistic BBQ**](https://www.youtube.com/user/sd4547) (230K+ subscibers), got back to us.

He also resided in Southern California and was empathetic to our struggles as a newly minted startup. It also helped that Greg was a huge fan of Korean food. We sent him some samples of our sauce and the rest is history.

He creates these amazing, mouth-watering videos featuring culinary BBQ masterpieces and we can’t thank him enough for his help!

**Partnerships**

Along with YouTube influencers, we’ve been able to partner with other companies, such as subscription boxes leveraging our success on Kickstarter, online sales, earned media, and prior relationships.

We use past partnerships as credibility to fuel the next one giving other parties multiple reasons to collaborate with us. We are honest in our communications, prompt in our responses, and detailed in our work. We use every success as a stepping stone to reach up and find better opportunities.

We’ve partnered with subscription boxes such as **Bespoke Post** and **BBQ Box**, and each partnership has led to increased website traffic and new customers.

Our latest partnership for KPOP Sea Snacks was with women’s quarterly subscription box, **FabFitFun**, and Pinterest in their limited-edition, specially co-branded box called the **P100, a box reflecting Pinterest’s top trends for 2018**.

Partnerships like these can help in multiple ways from generating direct sales, increasing brand exposure, to acquiring a new group of potential customers. We see large influxes of website visitors at the onset of announcements and steady traffic for the duration of a partnership.

We are generally able to cater to these new audience by creating unique landing pages or offering special discounts only offered to them.

So how did we source these kickass deals? Apart from what I mentioned above about using accomplishments to get one deal, and then using that deal to source another, it comes down to goodwill and building relationships. Here’s an example:

Our Kickstarter success can be attributed to what we learned by reaching out to the founders of other successful campaigns. We paid that collaborative, sharing mentality forward by talking to anyone that reached out to us for Kickstarter advice or business advice in general.

Months after helping one such person, that individual connected us to one of her friends, working at an amazing brand that just so happened to be looking for amazing Korean-inspired products. And voila! Relationships matter and have led to some of our biggest achievements.

No matter how busy we are, I think we can all agree that we can spare 20 minutes out of a day to talk to someone or help someone out. Help other people out without expect anything in return

**Email**

Lastly, a new initiative that we’ve been focused on is email marketing. Through a platform called **Dojo Mojo**, we’ve been able to partner with companies to run giveaway campaigns and through just three campaigns, we’ve been able to grow our e-mail list by over 500%.

While email marketing has always been great way to keep in touch with our initial customer groups to drive repeat purchases, gathering new emails is essential to widening our top sales funnel and increasing revenues.

There are so many different objectives a company can hit with e-mail marketing (e.g., web traffic, referrals, conversions, education, etc.). The greatest part of e-mail marketing is that it is extremely cost efficient and targeted – we don’t spend on advertising and we get prime placement in the mailbox of our would-be and existing customers.

**Specialty Retail Stores**

A specialty sauce distributor reached out to us after the completion of our Kickstarter campaign and we’ve been working with them to get our products into their network of specialty stores nationwide.

These stores we’re placed in are generally independent grocers (think mom-and-pop shops), but our experience has taught us much about selling in retail as we look towards expanding distribution. It’s one thing to get into a retailer and another to ensure your products are selling in that retailer.

Sell-thru in a store can depend on, but are not limited to the following: customer demographics, store location, product price points, promotions/discounts, and sampling. Our success in these stores have served as validation that we must expand our distribution in order to scale and take our company to the next level.

## How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

Since September of last year, we’ve generated nearly $100,000 in revenue, primarily all online through our website and Amazon (about a 50/50 split in revenue by channel).

We are currently in the middle of fundraising to expand our distribution outlets, develop new products, and hire new talent. Since February of this year, we’ve entered over 90 specialty stores throughout the nation and are now receiving interest from distributors and larger retail chains.

We’re also partnering with restaurants and coffee shops, such as Everytable and The Hive in Los Angeles.

As mentioned previously, e-mail marketing has been showing promising signs. That’s the name of the game for startups. It’s a bunch of testing and finding out what’s working and what’s not.

We now have a list of over 10,000 subscribers. We’re constantly A/B testing variables such as day, time, content, subject line, and so on to improve our open and click rates.

In product development, Chris is focused on launching 3-4 new variations of KPOP Sauce in the 4th quarter of this year. We’re also looking into developing 2-3 new flavors of KPOP Sea Snacks to launch at the beginning of 2019. It’s been exciting getting sneak peaks at the recipes in development and we can’t wait to share them with everyone!

For e-commerce, we target a gross margin north of 33% - the higher the better. This is absolutely necessary if we plan on expanding distribution to physical stores. Online, we don’t get as many sales as we would if we were in multiple grocery stores, so an extra $0.75 per order, goes a long way.

Secondly, our margins include shipping expenses that we incur as we provide free shipping for all our products (shipping is quite costly especially if you have heavy or bulky product!). Our online price for our products minus shipping expenses will generally set the suggested retail price (SRP) for our physical retailers.

Traditionally, one could follow the 1/3 rule to expand distribution into physical retail stores. That is, 33% margin for you (the manufacturer), your distributor, and the end retailer.

Today’s retail landscape is rapidly changing, and many distributors and retailers are requiring higher margins as they’re facing competition at an unprecedented level.

While it’d be great to be able to do direct deals with retailers, until we have a suite of products or our own distribution network (hopefully one day), we must partner with distributors to scale.

With the increase in distribution and launch of new products, our revenues are projected to grow quickly in the coming months and we’re working on ensuring that we’re operationally prepared.

We also have a lot of plans for upcoming partnerships, content, and experiential marketing events. We’re not just talk. We’re out to prove we’re not your average food brand. We’re going to revolutionize the way people view and taste food in the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) space.

Our vision is to be the premier Korean food company for America – that KPOP products be in every pantry across the nation. To get there, KPOP Foods will need to be the Red Bull of Korean food by bringing together mainstream culture, art, music, and food.

## Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

**Cultivate a great team**

It’s tough to go about it alone. Find a partner and build a team. I think one thing that truly helps is finding a great co-founder to work with.

I’m incredibly lucky to have Mike as my co-founder and there is absolutely no way in possible I could imagine KPOP Foods being where it is today without him. While we are both very different in so many ways, the one thing that we share is a strong work ethic.

We push each other to continuing fighting and overcoming setbacks and obstacles and having someone there with you is a huge relief. There have been so many times where I was tied up and had to leave things off with Mike and knowing that he’ll take care of everything is paramount.

**Launch quickly**

Secondly, I think a really important concept, especially for when just starting out, is being comfortable with launching things quickly. Early on, it’s hard to get everything perfect and you have to become comfortable with things being launching that may not be 100% perfect or may not be what you had initially envisioned.

If you’re constantly waiting for your product or service to be perfect, odds are by the time you’re completely satisfied with it, you’ve exhausted your resources and missed out on the timing of your opportunity. Fail quick, learn quick.

**Reflect**

Lastly, I realize that at the early stages of building a company, this is very hard to do, but you should always try to find time to reflect on things to think of how you can improve or do something better.

It’s very hard to find time to do this, but I think it’s very important for a number of reasons – you may realize that worrying about something wasn’t worth your time at all or didn’t have an impact on the business or you may find that if you had something slightly differently, there could have been a lot of new added value.

This is also something good to do with your team as they’re also likely in the middle of many different things and receiving their feedback and points of view may help you down the road as well.

## What platform/tools do you use for your business?

After researching the various platforms businesses use for e-commerce, we found that Shopify was the best choice due to its convenience in website design, product setup/integration, and fulfillment.

We utilize the native shipping tools on Shopify that include discounted shipping labels. As a CPG company that deals with a lot of inventory, Shopify’s backend could adequately support. We’ve had no issues thus far.

Within Shopify, we use the app, **Shogun**, for frontend design. For example, we can use it to change the layout of our landing pages or products pages, and even affect how our pages look on mobile vs. desktop.

It took some time to master, but it’s pretty user-friendly and is much more affordable than hiring full-time web developers. I like their snippet function that allows us to save formatted designs that we can easily access and use at another time.

We use **Sumo**, another Shopify app, to generate our pop-ups for e-mail lead capture. I like the app because it’s intuitive to use and easily allows us to run A/B tests to see what kind of offers, content, or copy language performs the best.

We can run different pop-ups on specific pages, control when a visitor sees these forms, and what happens when a visitor submits his or her e-mail.

**Google Analytics** (GA) is a must for e-commerce store owners. It’s free to use and comprehensively tracks nearly everything we need to know about our website visitors and the actions they take on site. These visitors are all potential customers. By identifying and optimizing their pathways, we can increase sales and conversions.

For example, if our homepage has the highest bounce rate (percentage of visits in which a visitor leaves our website without browsing any other page) we know we can examine the source of the traffic or our homepage design/messaging to affect the bounce rate.

Lowering the bounce rate means that visitors are spending more time on our website, which increases the likelihood of conversion. This is just one example of the myriad of uses of GA. If you’re interested in learning more, Google provides a lot of free online classes on GA. It is truly a powerful tool worth investing in.

## What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

One book that I really enjoyed was **""Power to People**: The Inside Story of AES and the Globalization of Electricity"". This book focused on several topics, but the founders’ focus on culture and empowering employees to make decisions is something I hope to drive forward at KPOP Foods.

I want to say that most of you reading this right now have already read **""How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People""** by Dale Carnegie. But in the off chance, you haven’t, you should. It applies to every aspect of life, not just business.

I’m amazed at how, even 80+ years since it was first written, the principles still apply. If a person would try to adhere to any of the principles mentioned in this book, it would positively impact his or her relationships with friends, colleagues, and significant others.

Finally, we’d be remiss if we didn’t thank UCLA Anderson and the UCLA Anderson Venture Accelerator for all the support they’ve given us these past 18 months.

They provided us a beautiful, collaborative working space to build our company, access to industry professionals and investors, and a chance to work alongside some amazing companies like Alcatera, Habit Nest, and Textpert just to name a few. These relationships have been invaluable and have helped us move rapidly while avoiding costly mistakes.

## Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Entrepreneurship is not for the faint hearted. You’ll need grit and passion – and a whole lot of it. Creating a successful business requires massive amounts of action, perseverance, and conviction.

It’s not something you can build in one, two, or even three years. It’s a long-term battle filled with many sacrifices and tribulations.

Pursuing the path of entrepreneurship will most likely be the most difficult thing you’ve ever done in your life.

This isn’t to dissuade any of you. Because while starting your own business may be the most difficult feat you’ve ever attempted, stay true to your course, your dream, and it’ll also be your most rewarding accomplishment.

## Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

Yes, we’re looking for a VP of Marketing or Marketing Associate to join our team full-time. The person would oversee paid marketing (Facebook, Amazon, and Google Ads), email marketing, social media, brand partnerships, website, and public relations.

Additionally, this person would also have an opportunity to get involved in product design and content development

We are also always looking for interns interested in finance, accounting, data analytics, and marketing. If you’re interested in working in a startup or becoming an entrepreneur, it’s a great opportunity to get experience.

It’s a fast-paced and challenging environment where you’ll learn tremendously and see the results of your actions on a daily basis.

&gt;According to D23, in 1973, shortly before the Hoop Dee Doo was created, the Star Spangled Washboard Band, a New York-based group of country-western musicians, began performing at Pioneer Hall.  During the time the Hoop Dee Doo Musical Revue was being planned, written, and readied for Pioneer Hall.
Walt Disney World started auditioning college students from the summer intern program - the Disney/CalArts Work Experience.  The Disney/CalArts Work Experinece was an 11-week work experience program in entertainment that involved both Disneyland and Walt Disney World. 
During this time auditions were for the three female and three male character performers. Those roles were: Six Bits Slocum and Dolly Drew (comic relief), Jim Handy and Flora Long (the singers), and Johnny Ringo and Claire de Lune (the dancers).
According to Ron, the script for the Hoop Dee Doo was a collaborative effort. The writers, as with many Disney shows and productions, tried to incorporate something that was a nod to the Disney legacy. In the Hoop Dee Doo Musical Revue it was Davy Crockett. Davy was woven  with bear puns and jokes.

9d72r5,1,2018-09-05,(PotDA 3) Social Security Disability/SSI,Bootskon,PotDA,https://www.reddit.com/r/PotDA/comments/9d72r5/potda_3_social_security_disabilityssi/,"     Now let’s get to the crack team of people working on our disability cases. Least in the California/Nevada side. So before my first denial, my case was apparently tossed back and forth between an office in my current home state of Nevada, and my birth state of California. This made it difficult to contact them. In fact, even when they kept sending me letters to contact them, they never answered the phone nor returned my calls when I left a message with my claims handler. I kind of wish I was back in that lovely back and forth. At least I wouldn’t be concerned they are gaslighting me.      Now let’s get to the crack team of people working on our disability cases. Least in the California/Nevada side. So before my first denial, my case was apparently tossed back and forth between an office in my current home state of Nevada, and my birth state of California. This made it difficult to contact them. In fact, even when they kept sending me letters to contact them, they never answered the phone nor returned my calls when I left a message with my claims handler. I kind of wish I was back in that lovely back and forth. At least I wouldn’t be concerned they are gas-lighting me.

[A picture of my right hand swollen, with lined paper in an attempt to prove I did not use Photoshop, as well to help give a visual reference compared to my non-swollen hand.](https://i.redd.it/34xvtx8fkfk11.jpg)

   Throughout this process I am trying to send them blood tests (as this is a blood disease technically, so the proof is in jittery intern needle pricks), pictures showing my swollen hand held up next to my non swollen hand, document after document that they sent me constantly badgering me for my day to day activities of not stressing out about my day to day activities (which eventually lead to a chart explaining my disorder as they clearly were not getting how being allergic to stress is at all an issue in the job market, and how going to college to get a degree for a less stressful job is shockingly counter-intuitive), and some other important medical documents. That was a year ago. I found out a couple months ago they never got those documents. Remember that, as this part of the story happened a year or more ago.

&amp;#x200B;

     Eventually, I get notice I need to go to a doctor and a shrink for my physical and medical evaluation. The ones they picked out and asked me to go to, mind you. This is also something you should remember.

&amp;#x200B;

     As I still couldn’t get a hold of my claims handler at this time and being naive and innocent to the idea they may be actively fucking with me, I brought every bit of proof I wanted them to have and ask them to send it to them. As I imagined the doctors would have a quick, foolproof method of getting in contact with Social security and giving them all these papers. They do this all the time after all.

&amp;#x200B;

     Now that you are back from the surgical procedures your insurance won’t cover from busting your gut laughing at the poor sweet innocence in that thought, I am sure you will be not at all surprised that, a year later, I found out they never got those files. Remember how I told you to remember those previous bits? Well, sadly we ain’ done with this chapter of the future explanations of why I have an aneurysm, so continue remembering and lump this lunacy in with it. The doctor didn’t even make note of me giving them those files. Not surprising. She did nothing to help her figure out my disability and instead had me do stretches meant for a back problem and limb issues. I wasn’t swelling at that time. I had pictures showing me swollen, showed them to the doc myself. NO mention in the notes though. How strange.

&amp;#x200B;

     So, after what felt like an eternity I got my first denial letter. Back in October 2016. I almost felt like framing the damned thing, as strangely enough spite seems to be the main thing that keeps me functioning these days. The reason in this denial letter is 1) they didn’t see me having it for longer than a year. As I have had it for 27 years and had it plaguing my life for 11, I think I ruined my eyesight in one eye a little from the frequency it twitched. PRactically heard the click of an ancient movie camera. The second reason was 2) because they didn’t see it affecting my ability to work. Which after a long line of being fired, fucked with, or ignored about my disorder until forced to quit due to pain and danger to my health… As I was still working with the assumption they had the papers I had all but sent a herd of owls to get to them. I might even be subjected to finding stamps (Of the licking and mailing variety)! Surely the email had sent it to them, but shockingly no.

&amp;#x200B;

     So I get a lawyer. Correction, I try to. After countless calls that end in a ‘we’re booked up’, ‘we can’t take your case’, and one getting me to stop going to community college (graphic design at the time. I was swollen almost 24/7.. Better than culinary, computer science, and engineering before that! But nah. Clearly fine to work) because “no lawyer would take you as it is considered work’. No one fires me from school. Any job I could actually get? Not as lenient I am afraid. Not to the guy in his twenties who smokes pot, is hyperactive, and has this weird allergy to stress. I am sure EVERYONE fucking believes me when I say that. Can you sense the sarcasm? CAN YOU READ THE AGITATION AND PAST EXPERIENCES IN THE SUBTEXT? Well, now you do whether you wanted to or not. Quite stressful really.

&amp;#x200B;

[My right hand after the swelling had gone down. Lined paper to prove it is unedited and to help with the comparison. Nail polish so I feel pretty.](https://i.redd.it/dvkvf9hnkfk11.jpg)

     Finally, someone agrees to help me, even files the appeal for me same day I meet them. You think this is where the triumphant trumpets would play. Nah. Turns out after seeming like he would be helpful, getting me to have my doctors and such fill out paperwork, get more blood tests to prove I STILL have the damned thing, blah blah, all of which were sent to him. (-sigh- Remember that) to send to the main office. Suddenly, I get a call from my claims handler! Losing the bet with myself that it was a cardboard cut out in an office chair with a voice recorder taped behind it, I got a physical being for once.

&amp;#x200B;

     Turns out they had been trying to contact my ‘lawyer’ for the past few days and they weren’t answering. I tried to call them, still not answering. Weeks go by and we still can’t get ahold of him nor can I get a hold of the tiki god that has apparently cursed my bloodline for dishonoring their totem. Claims handler, in an eye-twitchingly HILARIOUS turn of events, is actually answering my calls now. Sadly, my lawyer still isn’t. Minus answering my voicemail complaining about all this with an ‘I’ll get right on it’ voice mail.

&amp;#x200B;

     Also, this is when I learned they don’t have any of my blood tests, files, or pictures. The ones I have been sending them, been giving to lawyers and doctors they sent me too, is not in their files at all.

&amp;#x200B;

     As well, in order to fire my lawyer in the case of being unable to get them to pick up your calls, you apparently need to write a handwritten, signed note. Then mail it to them. Which I did, folded over the countless things they should have had ages ago.

&amp;#x200B;

     Week later? They have those files, nothing about that handwritten note that was literally folded around these things. Whatever, clearly, they just haven’t processed it. I never found out what happened to this magic letter and then I am left to wait after I ask if there is anything they need, and I go on the hunt for a new lawyer. Turns out, since the previous one didn’t send me a withdrawal letter, lawyers won’t help me! Cause that one might still get my money. Seems like quite the legal issue! If only there were a professional whose career it was to help people when a crooked fucker preys on the disability cases. I’ll tell you when I figure out what the name of that profession is, but to finish up this lawyer tidbit, with a bunch of letters out I still haven’t gotten a response back. I have gotten too mentally exhausted to explain this over and over.

&amp;#x200B;

     They got a shorter, cliff-notes rant. This one is more cathartic than anything. As well, in the very least if I die from my throat swelling up, brain swelling up, dehydration from gastrointestinal tract swelling up, or something to that effect then the likely cause is at least known to any willing to read me complain.

&amp;#x200B;

     We are getting to the end, as only a couple more hiccups have caused me headaches. That come to memory. I call my claims handler see where my case is at. While my Dad is trying to help me (which Social Security even asked me why my Dad just can’t support me for the rest of my life. Casual and flat tone too. Pricks.) with my medical costs, giving me a place to live, ect, I don’t like burdening him. I have seen plenty of posts bout a similar plight, so I am sure you can gather.

&amp;#x200B;

     So I pestered them. My claims handler said my claim had progressed, but she didn’t know to what point and I needed to call the main social security office in my city for more information… So I really don’t know what that person’s job description is, but she ain’ handling my case well as she implies. SO, I do just that. After waiting 45 minutes for what has my vote as the most obnoxiously repetitive hold system I have ever been put through, I get told that it is in the ‘identification phase’, that they are having trouble verifying something, and that I am not allowed to know what that thing is. I never found out, but they repeated this when i tried to ask more questions, and as I got annoyed that I was apparently not allowed to know about my own claim, I was abruptly hung up on.

&amp;#x200B;

     The week later, I get my denial letter. Claiming that while my disorder does hinder me, I can and I quote from the letter, “We have determined that you can adjust to other work”. Eventually, I am able to get a new lawyer, who I have had for a few months. After being told that it was never in their policy to have a handwritten note sent. (Well fuck, who was phone then?!) and that they had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned being in the ‘identification phase’ I was able to convince them to help me. They even managed, after much struggle, to get my old lawyer dropped! Sad thing is they haven’t sped matter up. Even after more photos and proof and blood tests. Even as my stomach acid rots my teeth to the point I can hardly eat anything harder than bread or a baked potato without having to fight through pain. Doesn’t stop me, because I am forced to deal with pain so I might as well agonize my way through something delicious.

&amp;#x200B;

    I am on year three. I am still waiting. I still get little if any word from SSI or my lawyers without pestering them, and even then it is a stretch. Months tick by, and I am forced to find out that the fairy tale about the government that cares, the sect of it that is made just to help those unable to make it is nothing more than a fantasy. Next to Santa and the Easter Bunny lies Uncle Sam."

I am a junior in the Business IT major. So far my experience at Tech has been great and the transition hasn't been too bad at all! There's only one thing I'm really worried about and that's finding an internship this year. I did not think I would have a problem getting an internship through Virginia Tech and their internship resources are amazing, but it seems like many of the job applications on Handshake require either a certain Virginia Tech GPA (it's my first semester so I technically have no VT GPA yet and I'm sure I cant put the community college one down even though it was really high) or they require transcripts which I also dont really have for Tech except I guess this one semesters class schedule with no grades. I feel like I can't even complete some of these applications fully and have no real Tech experience to highlight on- only community college experience right now, which I dont feel like companies are going to care about. What do you think are my chances in terms of internships? I'm really concerned getting one this fall will be tough since i'm just starting at Tech and dont have any experience at the school yet or classes finished here."

In the beginning of October, 2017, I personally had enough with how I had been treated. Specifically when it came to my disorder. So, as such, I sent a message to just about everyone I could think of. My local newspapers, senators, governors, mayors, the white house… Even marijuana magazines thanks to how it helped. Below is said message.

A senator’s representative responded. So I went about doing whatever I could type to keep me in their memory. To be honestly, I kinda blacked out in a fit of stress filled rage. I forget most of what I wrote. I began randomly ranting about bullshit I read on the news, just to see how the responses would turn out.

Mr. Meierer -

I was able to clarify the recent letter you received from the ODAR office, the congressional liaison stated:

The case was recently worked up in preparation for the hearing. When this is done a letter is sent out with a list of exhibits of medical information we have on the case and has the language in there which states we will review the case. If there is medical evidence that will result in a Fully Favorable decision we can pull the case and make that decision. If not, the case will be scheduled for a hearing.

I hope this provides an understanding of the status of your case.

Howdy Katie.

ITS ME AGAIN! I AM sure ya didn’t miss this long ass rants about the horrors hidden in our society, but here we are.

Update on my initial problem: NO UPDATES! NOt a word from my lawyer nor claims handler. You know, it makes it really easy to make someone like me think i have just been left in the hole to rot. Since that is how it has been the past DECADE! The only reason I am not dead right now is that I am stubborn and all this pain and madness has my sights set on one goal. I want this shit fixed. Not MY shit fixed (though part of the goal). This shit is broken and utter lunacy. This system is a horribly constructed knot that, instead of being fixed, mearly had more brick and mortar shoved at it. The knot is covered up, but is anything really fixed?

I don’t want the disabled and broken having to lie on the streets crying out for medicine because this damned country has made EVERYTHING a commodity. I am not someone’s statistic. I am not the prescription company’s customer nor am I someone who is gonna be cool with being shoved handfuls of pills that paid off the doctor. I want to not be the universe’s medical punching bag.

So the reason I am messaging you. GIVen that suddenly Medicaid changed my dental insurance to something that actually shows me dentists (still in a god awful design since it seems no one in this government every took a database design class. Poor website and database design are acceptable for a store or something. Not something supposedly as professional as medical insurance. I’ve seen better-designed angelfire and geocities website.) It is clearly not made with a patient in mind. So after figuring out the 4 or 5 buildings made to look like a more substantial list by the oh so amazing tactic of listing every damn staff member in the place individually instead of the dental offices, I have found every single one of them has an abysmal rating. Like, only ONE was over 2 stars. With a blood disease that has plenty of instances of dental work leading to throat swelling fatalities, I am a bit… Concernedly picky about who is going to be shoving sharp tools into my mouth. as careful as i can be given the lovely tapestry of madness I have described in the past emails.

Surprise, surprise. Just like every time a lil shred of hope shines towards my mouth, it turns out they aren’t accepting patients. Apparently, this city has some HORRIFIC teeth. What good is insurance when no one will see you? It’d be really nice to eat rusty bread again. How I miss cooking for myself without having a chance of needing to toss it because it is too difficult and can shatter my fragile teeth. NOt burnt to a rock, just not tender enough for this 80 year old mouth in a 27 year old jaw. If no one is taking patients, guess I am destined to have my teeth rot out if the infections don’t hit my brain first. So far we’ve been quite lucky, hoping for another decade of that not happening.

I rant and rave, again, because I am disappointed. The government that presides over us should be what we aspire to be, should be run like a proper machine. Not like this country isn’t filled with unemployed database and website designers, for one small point, that could use jobs! government buildings shouldn’t be considered the height of inefficiency. What message does that send to ANYONE? DOes anyone go into a government run building these days, not counting the ones near the higher up’s eyes, and actually go ‘BOY! This is just beautiful. I am seeing the apex of the modern day right here. Smiles because people WANT to smile, machines updated to fit with the current decade, all that.

But, apparently, thinking that the people at the top of the ladder keeping the entire country running being at all efficient or logical is a naive thought. That last bit wasn’t me either. That is the general attitude one has when I rant about stuff like this. That people actually caring or helping this community is childish. Personally? That rings in my ears like the abused loner in the corner of the playground. Bitter and hateful, unable to see beyond the darkness.

It is horribly depressing, isn’t it? Fact our news feeds now read like a dark satire mixed with pitches for action horrors probably isn’t helping.

Maddeningly,

Dear Daniel:

I’m very sorry you haven’t been able to find a dentist that is accepting Medicaid patients or one with a favorable rating. I hate to say this, but if you need further assistance in finding one you will want to reach out to Medicaid. You probably have a number on your insurance card to call that might have a list that is more updated than their website.

Howdy.

Typing these out have proven a hint cathartic to me. i doubt they make much headway, but in this world, this really is the only thing that feels like it is working. Since any forms I have filled out or complaints were put through yet another broken machine. all the while being told this is reality. this is life.

Sure, it is that way now, I will not, however, accept that the horrible systems of humanity that humans (which no matter how marvelous they seem have their flaws) created. When flaws are pointed out, we (or at least I) am treated like the same child who was pissed at being locked in a school with people who seem to think to shove your head in a trashcan is a sign of friendship and love. It has lead to the belief that everyone that runs us are a bunch of hypocritical lunatics. ESpecially given that this country was born from immigrants and outcasts. People fleeing tyranny, hoping for another start. ONly, these days, most of us want to take the path of our forefathers. As all the land has been bought up and is now being used to milk every god damned penny from our veins, we do not have that option anymore.

We live in a new world yet every news station and politicians likes to argue like it is still the 80s. This country has failed to the points Nazis are everywhere and politicians start pointing fingers outside the borders. I have been beaten and battered, abused and misused, and cast aside. however, it wasn’t foreigners that did any of this. Act like the world at large is full of rapists and terrorists even though we are no better. We find ways to murder, we find ways to make the innocent suffer. we havee created a world where everyone believes that money can save you from even the worst offense. corporations will snag people outside the borders due to it being cheaper. THis makes sense, but it makes the whole ‘people outside our borders are BAD’ vibe everyone is trying to give even more obviously a biogotted crock. Companies can cause deaths from poor regulation or safety. Can get people harmed from how they push us. MAke us have health issues from pointless stress or something as little as respecting us so little we must ask to use the bathroom. You know. Like children in a classroom! Up until college of course, when you can use the bathroom as nature demands it. I am not gonna risk potential issues down the line due to me having to hold a natural function of my body because packages need to go out faster. Basically, got a bunch of lunatics acting as the lifeblood of this economy, no one takes responsibility, and the people are harmed by it while the rich continue keeping a bulk of the economy in their accounts. Banks may be able to use it, but still that money continues to be locked in the same little areas so they can go act like they are better than everyone else while others get debt paked onto them because they are simply trying not to feel eternal agony likee their medicinal condition demands. Yet, the whole time, my generation gets blamed for all of this.

Which is almost hilarious given that my generation isn’t the first scapegoat. Like pledges in a frat, however, instead of fixing the problems that wronged them, they take that paddle and get consumed. They want others to suffer like they did. Yet, this seems to be the common fair. People will be given things to shut them up and placate them while the problem shows no signs of being fixed.

Then, the people who act better than the rest pull a shutdown. So, since this is becoming more annoyingly frequent, I would like to tell you how this looked from younger eyes, to near 30 year old eyes. It looks, and I know I have used this term a lot, childish. It is literally a group of grown-fucking-adults who once more can’t get anything done so, as a group, they needed a TIME OUT! Oh, I feel HORRIFICALLY safe now. Feel completely taken care of by a country that can’t work out their own budget. Probably due to the budget of anything being poorly regulated to the point side street gangs look like they have a better hierarchy.

I know this is apparently hard for the government as a whole to consider, given history, but really it would be good to at least consider the kind of reputation we are putting out. LIsten when others aren’t talking directly to your face. Problem with a mask of authority made purely from power is that it has this horrible tendency to make people afraid to speak up. For fear they will be called a ‘Whistleblower’. Afraid they’ll be shoved into prison for eternity, like so many innocents, and have their life stripped from them by being shoved under the rug with all the other dangers (Exagerated or not) we just sweep under there. making them angrier. making them more damaged. making them more dangerous or, more likely, ACTUALLY dangerous from spite and conversing with actual dangers.

I write this message as a warning. Do not consider this a threat because i have no intents on doing any more than i currently do (read: complain and whine). I warn due to the fact that it is out of luck and fear that this hole y’all have dug isn’t so deep that you are being buried by the sheer amount of people (your own country’s fucking people. THe ones you should be more concerned about) when they have finally had enough and have finallt lost the lie that has been carefully built to make people like me believe yall actually know what you are doing.

This shut down is just another nail in the coffin. Another event that proves otherwise. Y’all are a bunch of humans like the rest of us. It is about time all of you started acting like it.

PS: Given how the two-party system has made it so you can’t both about one party without acting like you are just white knighting the other side. Both sides are about as impressive at teamwork as kindergarten classes. nothing but two rams slamming their heads together, utterly ignoring the world around them as it all fucking crumbles. From the beginning it has been spoken against. It creates teams. It makes people fight for their side for fear they’ll look bad. Well, let me assure you you both are pretty far down. (One lower than the other, but once we reach the negatives it really is just symantics arguing which is more damaging.) UNITED we are supposed to fucking stand, yet we have been in a god damn cold war between each other for ages. Just because people aren’t actively sending troops or shooting people does not mean a war hasn’t been fought these past few decades. Political parties should not be a reason alone for people to fighht, to hate each other. Politics should NOT be banned from polite conversation due to the hatred and venom behind it.

Yet. Here we are. Here we have been. Coast to Coast, sea to sea. We are a fucking disappointment and have been as far as my collective memory of history has shown me. We are not a democracy. We are a dictatorship run by a large group of people. Surprising no one, given i am surely not the first person to complain like this and, as things are going, will not bre the last. We are an Oligarchy. Be it the senate, congress, the corporations whispering to them and feeding them bills… We are not run by the people, and not even my experience in writing fictional world could allow me to spin this story any other way without either a Macguffin or a complete change in the writing staff.

But in lighter news, calling liberty dental helped me in finding a dentist. Hopefully, like the last couple times I tried this, I don’t have the foolish hope of being able to smile without hearing glass breaking taken from me. Fingers crossed. as i am typing it, please imagine that said with a tone full of sarcasm and countless experiences (not just dental) that prove otherwise.

I was happy and far less annoying at one point. I’d someday like to take the leap to stop being that one day. Like disability, fixed teeth, a shrink that is there to help instead of just wait for me to talk out the hour, and proper health. Guess that is just going to have to wait.

I am the only one who seems to consider those important these days, after all. It is either you can work yourself to the grave for someone else’s dream or you are drug through the dirt. In my own experience, at least. Especially given i have not met a single person who doesn’t hold their job with contempt. Like it is a death sentence. Sure, we do have it better than other countries. Punch to the face is also better than a knife to the brain. Doesn’t mean we should line up outside a booth to get punched repeatedly. Though with the cynical view i now have of society thanks to… Society (namely the ones that claim themselves to be leaders) likely seemed to think otherwise.

I have dealt with far enough jackasses, stress, and chaos for one lifetime. Ranting is one of the things I can consistently do. This says nothing for my skillset, which thanks to having a lot of time on my hands, it a proper jack’s toolbox. Not much a master, but I can do plenty. I just feel that people get what they give. So far? The world at large are a bunch of self absorbed assholes who will belittle you, calling us selfish lazy millennials, telling us we can’t even take a day off work to see important milestones in our family’s lives since flipping burgers/filing forms that robots could fill out with proper database management, and other things they act like the world is ending if you don’t show up. when your own world is ending? FUCK OFF! You have to work. nose bleeding? WORK or you are fired. Sick enough you could get the entire restaurant sick? FUCK OFF! WOrk or you are fired! If you get everyone sick and us in trouble with the health inspector… Ain’ our fault you were literally forced to come here! Your fault for being human! How DARE you not be immortal, how DARE you not be a perfect little fucking robot who could work until their fucking gears rust off. Know friend who don’t even get breaks. THey are managers too!

But asking for breaks, or respect, or enough money to work 40 or more hours and actually be able to afford rent for a shitty apartment in the middle of murderbend. Apparently, that is far too much to ask. Apparently the idea that, if EVERY SINGLE OTHER THING is going up in price, MAYBE the means for us affording those things should also go up. Yet that is not apparently how this economy works. People like to claim that like it is set in stone, but like i ranted before, what people who arte now dead decided has little to do with us in the now. Especially since they didn’t have the amount of knowledge we as a species have now. AT OUR FINGERTIPS EVEN!

SHOCKINGLY, we aren’t taking this bullshit. Enough people are, but when people try to figure out other markets… Nah, now us Millenials are KILLING some industry. I have never had more anxiety from the fact we are SOMEHOW the most lazy creatures in existence yet also somehow determined enough to kill anything. It is almost like we are trying to fix something! Yet when everyone acts like we are children, like we are entitled, and worse yet THEY ACTUALLY DO THE SHIT THAT DEFINED THOSE WORDS! Too lazy to do safety checks causing deaths or entire fucking gulfs to turn black.

And who pays the price? The people trying to survive at the bottom. The ones told at practical gunpoint to do their jobs or go back to starving while they go through the horrible experience of a fuck ton of companies wanting the perfect worker, but no one wanting to train those workers. Not even schools. Want to know how many teachers (COLLEGE LEVEL ONES) told me that all the actual work-related shit will be taught on the job? ALMOST FUCKING ALL OF THEM! You’d think if I have to pay more than a damn car to get a career, and NO careers want to spend the time training people, THAT COLLEGES WOULD TRAIN PEOPLE! Instead of being taught outdated history from the point of view of the entitled winners, maybe some actual quality control would be nice. The job expects yu to be fresh off the line, ready to go.. Yet the schools don’t even care enough to teach us how to use cash registers or, in networking classes, actually SHOW US THE MATERIALS AND TOOLS WE’D WORK WITH! Instead, more history. I understand the need for theory, I also understand that teaching freshmen entry-level skills might just let them get a job that allows them to go further in their career while paying for the classes they are going in. we are told college is to prove we can commit to something. NO. NO IT IS FUCKING NOT! IT is for us to learn. if people don’t want to learn, their fault. However, if the school is turning into a minefield of shitty teachers and the ones that truly LOVE what they teach, and instead turn it into a nightmare. I love to learn, I LOVE science especially history and science. Yet put me in front of (most) teachers and they will bore me out of the class. mostly since they are bored. If they can’t be invested how the hell am I?

INSTEAD, we are shunted off to ‘internships’ and ‘externships’. Thinly, and I meanly THINLY, veiled means of getting free labor. Just pump in interns left and right, don’t pay them, and you get work done! HOW FUCKING AMAZING! NO ONE GETS HURT IN THIS SET UP AT ALL!

Regardless of if they are a student or not, if you do the job you should get paid. SOmething I have ranted before on different subjects.

So. You have a job but you might not even be paid. Even if you do, you might not even get paid the hours you worked and they will make it seem impossible to get the money you are earned. Even then, you don’t even get paid for the amount you make since most of that will be taken by taxes and other bullshit anyway. EVEN THEN if you so much as step wrong you can get fired for some vague reason, and can’t even file for wrongful termination since you get stuck in a year or two of waiting and paperwork and nothing gets done. Even before getting the job you need to jump through more hoops than a dog trying to get adopted. I’ve mentioned the subway that required two years experience to make a sandwich, yes? That is just my more glaring example. You can’t work ‘entry’ level jobs without years of experience.

How this country has balanced so smoothly on nothing more than a bunch of meditation stacks that people are hoping stay together. Hope really is an amazing thing, ain’t it?

AS usual, the rage, cursing, and the rest are directed not specifically at you, Katie, and I appreciate you actually answering me here and there and showing that someone actually cares about other’s concerns. If the cathartic ranting didn’t help, showing someone has read this helps. Lets me spark the pipe dream that, maybe, the adult-sized children playing in the Senate playground might finally take a look at how they are painting themselves. Not even John Oliver’s dog congress is a proper satire. People actually want to see that.

PS: DId you know the tune for many of our patriotic songs take their melody and tune from other countries? Star Spangled Banner used a British Tune. THis land is our land apparently was Irish or Scottish. Hard to tell what is true, but given the current political climate, I felt that little nugget of knowledge is something the government should remember. It isn’t like we fucking rose out of the see like a mythological race of beings. Though with how us Americans like to talk about themselves, you’d think we all thought we were some mystical high elves looking down on the lesser evolved populous. It is a fucking embarrassment to everyone."

I’ve been really struggling to get back into normalcy, before the psychotic episode and hospitalisation. My life seemed somewhat normal I was working an internship that seemed promising and a casual job in a retail outlet. Life seemed to be going good and then I hit rock bottom. 

Since I’ve started my bipolar medication Lithium I’ve since gained weight, have rashes all over my body which my psychiatrist is convinced isn’t related to my medication, I am thirsty with dry mouth, I’m constantly tired, I am always hungry hence making me gain more weight, however my mood is more stable, so it’s working. 

I’ve been suffering flashbacks of my psychotic episode, I’m not sure if anyone else has this. I have lost both my job and my internship. I’ve been really depressed. So I’ve been talking to a psychologist about how depressed I am and been trying different techniques on working through it but I still have no motivation to do anything. Everyone in my life thinks I’m doing okay but I’m not. I have managed to convince my family, friends and boyfriend that I’m doing okay by throwing myself into therapy and endless support groups. But really I just spend most my days looking at depressive memes and my only solace is the endless amount of Netflix series to watch (I’m happy to take recommendations). 

There’s really only been my life before diagnosis and after diagnosis. I have support, people who love me, medical professionals to help me. Why can’t I pull it together right now? Will my life always be this messy? I’m afraid of ending up in psychosis again I lost a lot of my memories after having my psychotic episode and I really don’t want it to happen again. I’m really afraid of letting down the people I love and I feel like I already have this year, just by things out of my control. "

6 years ago I started the Women in STEM Mentorship Program (WISMP), which aims to support this transition from school to industry by matching technical women in industry with women studying STEM fields in university.  Throughout the school year, these volunteer mentors meet with the students once every 4-6 weeks via video conference or in person to build a relationship, provide coaching, and help to broaden a student's horizons for what's possible in their field.

Since its founding, we've helped hundreds of students get their first internships, their first jobs, and start to build networks that will keep on giving.  The program gives an opportunity for women early in their careers to get leadership and coaching experience, and most mentors find it incredibly rewarding.

This program cannot be successful without great women who volunteer to mentor.  As we enter this school year, our rosters are smaller than usual, and we're actively seeking to attract more mentors.  Please consider joining us this year and forward to your friends and networks -- this is a good cause!  (Our in-person program is based in the SF Bay Area, but we are also piloting a remote program this year!)

I wasn’t planning on upgrading my bike any time soon, since I’m college and am on a tight budget. However, a deal came up and I need help making this decision. 

I have a 2017 Trek 1.2 that I bought in January for $850. It has Shimano Sora components and is aluminum, but with proper cleaning and maintenance it has served me well over the 5,000 miles I’ve ridden this year. There is a guy selling a 2017, still in the box Colnago C-RS, with a 105 groupset for $1200. This is a carbon frame bike, and the components would definitely be a huge upgrade. 

Should I go for it? I’d sell my current bike, hopefully getting no less than $400 for it, potentially more. I really love Colnago’s, and between the beautiful red color and the money I saved up from working an internship over the summer, it’s hard for me to say no. "
9d8kta,1,2018-09-05,"It's been a few weeks, but I [23 M] am still sad about breaking up with my toxic ex [23 F], while she moved on immediately.",Zarotu,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9d8kta/its_been_a_few_weeks_but_i_23_m_am_still_sad/," My last post was incredibly long, so I'll try to make a summary here. My ex has made me feel used and was very unappreciative throughout the relationship. She made me feel guilty when I did not do things for her, and I did a lot for her. I took care of her, spent all my free time with her, and made her the center of my world. I helped her get a job, get into pharmacy school, and get an internship. Her future was set. I did everything I could to make her happy. I am in medical school, so the amount of stress I have been, am, and will go through is immense. The stress of being with someone who doesn't have any hobby besides clubbing is pretty rough. I do my best to remain open, never once stopping her from going out because I didn't want to be ""controlling.""

But, 6 months go, our relationship went downhill when she started lying to me about what she was doing at night, about a guy she met at the club, and more. It wasn't until my birthday did I find out that this guy at the club was more than ""a friend from school."" Her excuse was that I didn't ""seem to care"" that she was in Japan, while I was busy with exams. What made it worse was that she started messaging this guy right after our fight with regards to her getting completely drunk and coming home late and I had to stay awake until 6 or 7 a.m. in the morning taking care of her. I also find out that she has been calling this guy many times throughout the night. This was weeks before her trip to Japan. She continues to message this guy despite promising me that she wouldn't.

My decision to break up with her came when I found out that her school was supposedly a ""party school."" I did not do my research, everything was heard by word of mouth from a friend. I broke up with her without even checking to see if the school was a ""party school,"" which I doubt because it's UW Seattle. But, I knew that if I was with her, she would not be able to make friends, just like how I spent all my time with her during the first year of medical school. I am completely alone right now and I have only myself to blame. I couldn't bare the thought of getting hurt again or dealing with a girl who I didn't trust, thousands of miles away, going to places. I regretted the decision at first, but seeing her move on immediately and going to places like those just made me think I made the right decision, even though I never wanted to break up.

I know that I am the one who broke up with her, but I am still sad. She moved on within hours and had possibly slept with a guy within a week of our break up, which was probably why I am sad. The thought of her with someone else, even though I shouldn't care, bothers me. Every day I think about her. I miss her a lot, but I know I deserve someone who treats me better, and she deserve someone who has the time and money to take care of her, while giving her the freedom to do whatever she wants. I couldn't provide the time and money anymore. Despite my better judgement, I tried talking to her. But, she is ignoring me because I really ""hurt"" her. I found it amusing since she is having the time of her life, but I guess she is happier without me.

I am trying to focus on school, but it is difficult. I hung out with a couple of friends, talked to all the females friends I had about the situation. They support me and I felt better during those times. However, when I'm alone, I still think about my ex. Despite writing down a 6-page essay about the shit she put me through, about the shit she treats her parents, etc. I still miss her. What's wrong with me? She was a girl I liked for 6 years before dating and, so far, my first. My parents despise her and knew from the very start that she was using me. How do I move on?

**TL;DR: I broke up with my ex due to trust issues. She moved on immediately, but I still miss her.**"

But recently blizzard unlocked my old account from back in Mist of panderia expansion ( It was locked since then and i was finally able to have them unlock it. Rather than asking someone to pay for the expansion upgrade seems more sensible to ask for gametime. With gametime i can level all of my old characters to 110 &amp; wait until im back in a better financially situation to buy BFA myself. 

Why i need gametime? I haven't gotten to play this account since mop it was my very first account i made when i was 13.

What is WoW? World of Warcraft is biggest MMORPG ever! based on the warcraft 1,2,3 lore.  You can do massive raids or PVP vs other players for fun or raiting. WoW arenas are even a esport with the last major getting 70k views !

Why i cant afford it? No sob story i just had some car trouble which costed a fair amount of money which intern put me behind on rent and a few other bills, so for the next two  checks i have to catch up my bills (basically paying them twice) so i wont be behind again.

Should I stay with him?,FabulousSugar,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9d9nuf/me_22f_and_my_boyfriend_23m_i_have_found_things/,"So at one point last summer I was at a college out of state for a summer program and had been hooking up with a few guys. So now about a year later I started grad school a couple months ago at the same college as my internship. One of the guys I had hooked up with asked if I wanted to hang out when I got in town and I said yes. We ended up hanging out a couple times and then he invited me to go to the beach with him a couple hours away for a weekend and I went; there he asked me if I wanted to actually start dating and not just hooking up and I said yes because he's nice and I thought I really liked him at the time. So we've been dating a few months now and we do fun stuff together like the aquarium, the zoo and the movies but he always wants to have sex like right when we go back to my apartment and then again after we eat dinner and again in the morning; to me it kinda feels like he still is just in it for the sex so I talked to him about it and of course he said that's not the case but I still kinda feel that way. One time we were cuddling and kissing and he started to try to take off my clothes and I stopped him and said I did not want to have sex; so then he continued to dry hump me to try and get himself off, stopped for about 10 minutes and asked then if I wanted to have sex (which I said no since I still did not want to). Also when we have sex he closes his eyes and doesn't really participate or say anything at all. He is pretty immature still and it bothers me with some of the things he says that are just completely ridiculous. In addition to these things that bother me I have found myself thinking about other guys in sexual/romantic ways. I don't know if I should break up with him or just try to voice the things that are bothersome to me again."

She does a lot of yoga, fitness classes and jogging, which means she's quite fit and flexible. She has a high-powered, professional career and you're the intern working for her.

She's away on a business trip and tonight has been drinking with colleagues. At the end, it's just her and the intern heading for the elevator. He gets brave and places a curious hand on [*that ass*](http://businessloanpicks.com/396/6fed010a47d3d815539f27a62a19317b.jpg) the moment the doors close behind them. Had she been stone cold sober, it might have been the worst decision of his very short career, but tonight, it was a *good call*.

She bites her lip, smiles and reaches over to place her hand on his crotch. As she squeezes gently, she's surprised to discover his fully erect girth, thicker than she'd imagined, tucked down one side of his slacks. She slides it down, slower, her mouth opening wider, the longer it takes to eventually get to the tip.

""Oh my..."", she whispers, staring across at him with an impressed blush on her cheeks.

When the doors ping open, she takes his hand and leads him to her door.

""I'm gonna make a deal with you. I won't tell anyone what you did to me behind this door tonight if you don't tell anyone how much I liked it...""

I earn about $35k/annually and have a .5% share of the company. I don't have any other benefits besides that.

I graduated about a year ago, with a degree that I could easily be making around $60k - $70k somewhere else with benefits like health insurance, 401k, and other perks. I took my current job because I realized that a share of a company, even a small one, could become more profitable for me than an higher salary.

I haven't asked for a raise yet because I know that the company was going through their investment faster than intended, but now they have started becoming profitable and are beginning to do a big hiring push.

I have been told numerous times that I have made myself indispensable to the company and that if I was to leave that they would be in a lot of trouble because no one else knows how to do my job and the data I manage is vital to the company's success. 

Is it acceptable to ask for a raise? And how much would be an appropriate amount to ask for? What would be the best way to approach it?

Also, I should be receiving a small bonus for completing a project by the end of this month, probably around $1,000 - $2,0000.

9d9x2a,164,2018-09-05,"Sure, I'll Close the Door on You",ppgrox,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/9d9x2a/sure_ill_close_the_door_on_you/,"TL;DR: Senior staff in the lab tells me to keep a door closed at all times when I had left it open so she could save a little bit of her time. I close the door that she needs to exit through.

Edit: The people saying that you shouldn't leave the door open are right. I didn't leave the door open to ruin other people's work, but so that she could get in without using the air shower. I'm aware that you should close the door if nobody is going to be using it immediately afterwards.

Edit 2: The protocol, which so many have pointed out nicely I should follow (and I did), was to use the air shower once moving from the 10K area to the 100 area. This happened after we had already both gone through the air shower, so were free to move between the clean areas as we pleased (according to the protocol).

Edit 3: I feel like I should also say that beyond this, I didn't have a negative interaction with this person, and, while I'm not familiar with her work, I've been told that she is actually extremely good at her job. She can just be pretty mean and rub people (i.e. me) the wrong way, thus this post.

I hope this belongs here! So this summer I had an internship doing some wafer fabrication. Basically, you take a metal plate and make some really tiny devices on it. One of the hard parts is that because the device is so small (features on the order of a millionth of a meter) you have to be REAAAALLY careful with how clean the environment is, as a particle could just ruin your device that you spent months working on. To help with this problem, all the processes are run inside a clean room, with an air shower and gowns and filters and everything to minimize the particles in the air. There's the 10K area which is big, and clean, and the 100 area inside it (like a big rectangle, and then a small rectangle inside the big rectangle) which is REALLLLLY clean. To go from the 10K area to the 100 area for the first time, you needed to go through an air shower which took around 1 minute, and it's pretty annoying since it's kind of useless and takes time. After you had done it once, you didn't need to do the air shower again, though.

Anyway, most everyone that works there is super helpful and nice, and more than happy to help out li'l ole me who was just some random intern that didn't know every single protocol of the clean room, which not many people followed to the letter anyway. There was *one* woman, let's call her Alice, who was notorious for being the lab police, and being really mean about it. There's even a story I heard about someone losing their job after doing a process Alice recommended because it didn't work (and the person who lost their job even told her it wouldn't), and Alice is married to the department head. That sort of person.

The lockers are located in the 10K area, and I needed to grab some stuff for something I was going to do, and so I left through the main exit next to the air shower, being careful not to close it as I didn't want to have to go through the air shower again and the exit locks. I see Alice in the 10K area grabbing some of her locker stuff too and as I reenter the 100 area through the exit, I leave the door a little ajar for her to get back in. As I walk back in the lab she follows me in and yells across the lab for me, in front of a fair number of people (the lab is pretty small).

I walk back to her, as I didn't hear her the first few times she called for my attention and so was pretty far away and ask her what's wrong. She gets up in my face and says ""Don't you dare leave that door open. It has to stay closed."" I was an intern and she was senior staff, so I wasn't about to argue. I just shrugged, apologized, and reached over to the door and yanked it closed so it locked, and then looked her in the eye. She glared at me for an extra second, then opened and left through the exact same door I had just closed. From then on, I always made sure to shut that door if she was in the 10K area, so she had to waste that extra minute in the air shower."

You guys may remember me as the DIL whose MIL came after DH at our job and had to be escorted out. In my last post, I said that we were tentatively resuming contact with MIL, because DH missed his niece and nephew. 

Well, as he and I thought, that went down the drain quickly. Soon after we resumed contact, DH got a text from his older sister that said, and I quote, “Only because it’s the right thing to do, I thought you should know I’m pregnant again.” He didn’t respond. 

We went to MIL’s house once, which, in and of itself wasn’t a bad visit. No boundaries crossed. It’s the aftermath that has just absolutely crushed my DH. 

His mother has taken to pretending he doesn’t exist. Almost as though she only has two kids. She will not text him, she will not acknowledge him in any way. If she bumps into him in public, she will smile and speak, and promise to make plans, but that never happens of course. 

But obviously, this is happening because of me. DH and I bumped into his younger sister at a public event, and she handed us a Tupperware of “slime” to store in our car for her. (Made with glue, laundry detergent, glitter and food coloring.) Well, that slime leaked into my car, onto my $40 employee shirt for an internship I have. The next morning, younger sister texted me, and told me (not asked) to bring her slime to her house. I told her that we had thrown it away, because it had leaked in my car. She responded “okay, well can you give me the $12 it cost to make that slime? Bc I’m kinda upset.” I responded that we were even on cost, because it ruined my shirt. That wasn’t good enough. 

MIL texted DH going on and on about how I was so rude and mean to younger sister who “is a 15 year old who doesn’t understand and just cares so much.” DH shut her down and told her off all in the same text. Since then, MIL hasn’t bothered to text or anything else. 

To be honest, it’s a blessing. DH is happier without all of his crazy family in our life. This is the last straw for me. DH can resume tentative contact again if he wants, but I will not. I’m over it. 

In 2 years we are moving 6 hours away anyway! 

I’m sorry for the rambling. I just HAD to get all this off my chest! No one understands but you guys! 

Tl:dr; I am the worst thing to ever happen to DH and have torn him from his family. He’s so much happier for it. "

Know what I want to do, but don't know how to get started.",magicking610,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9db9v1/having_trouble_getting_off_the_ground_after/,"I just finished schooling for my BS in Accounting in May, but my university requires a 3 month internship to be able to graduate, and I have been unable to secure one. I am now living at home, and have no idea how to get started. Just to clarify it: I need one semester worth of paid work experience in my field to be allowed to ""graduate"" - I am not able to apply to grad school or receive my degree until this is complete.

I would like to return to my college city (roughly an hour and a half from home) because of the number of opportunities there, and because I would like to continue my education for an MBA once the university will allow me to.

Home town never recovered from the 2008 recession; there are roughly 3-4x more jobs in college city than there are at home, and they all pay close to twice as much even though the cost of living is about the same.

The issues I've run into:

* I have a license, but no vehicle. No one in my family has a vehicle that I can use.
* I live in Central New York, so biking is out of the question 6-7 months of the year.
* Our public transportation is rudimentary at best. It would take approximately an hour and a half to get downtown from where I am by using the bus system.
* At home, most of the available jobs in my field want to pay minimum wage, or require an MBA/CPA.
* I do not know anybody who would be able to co-sign a loan. Additionally, my credit is too low to be able to secure a decent loan if I were to have income. All payments have been 100% on time, and this would change once my credit card is fully paid off.

I know what I want to do, but the issue is being able to make it happen. My student loans total about $64,000 -- 52,000 in Federal loans with mandatory repayment starting in March 2019, and a high-interest private loan of 12,000 with mandatory repayment starting in November. Once repayment starts, the minimum on the Federal loans will be $461 a month, and the private will be $150 a month. I also have a credit card at its $2,000 limit due to textbooks.

As a result, I have no savings and have been relying on family being able to make the minimum card payment while I search for something. I worked on campus for 20 hours a week while I was a student, but book costs (or, more specifically, online access codes) made those jobs more of a necessity instead of being able to contribute to savings.

Ideally, I'd return to my college city. The job offers there would meet the income requirements for the apartments close to the university; the reason I'm looking there is because I know the bus line.

What is the best way to get off the ground? It seems like I'd be okay once I have my own reliable transportation, but that seems to be the hardest thing to nail down."

I’m in a bit of a pickle and I hope I can get some advice. 

I started my resume building by landing a wonderful CI internship with the DoD back in college. I went to a hiring event after I graduated and was offered a position with an agency. A year later after my poly and psych review, I got a letter saying that I wasn’t selected to move any further. I was very disappointed because I was kind of betting on landing this gig and I put all my irons in one fire, ya know. 

 I passed the CI poly and I have an out of scope secret clearance. I don’t know what to do now or how to keep up with my resume. Do I keep applying for direct hires and wait around for another year? How do I continue to build my resume? Do I go into the private sector? If so, how? I’m okay with starting over, I just feel like I’ve lost my way and I don’t know where to look or how to move forward. I’m so passionate about this career path I’ve chosen, but I don’t know how to get there. 

I appreciate you guys taking the time to read this. "
9dbg15,11,2018-09-05,Seeking Arrangements: Rapekink Edition 2,koppyrite,Rapekink,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rapekink/comments/9dbg15/seeking_arrangements_rapekink_edition_2/,"Her name is Liz.

28 years old. Close friends with Kelly, the girl I wrote about in my previous story. They had the same last name, joked that they were distant cousins. I like to think that they were.

German, but born and raised in the USA. Was the perfect complement to Kelly in every way - where Kelly was tall, Liz was short. Where Kelly had ass, Liz had tits. And where Kelly humored my kinks, Liz embraced them. 

Did I mention we would have a three-way?

About a week passed by after my memorable evening with Kelly. On a whim, I decided to text her the day before she was heading back to Germany. Didn’t expect anything from it, just wanted to say goodbye and wish her luck. As it turns out, she was spending her last day in America at the same spa I took her to the previous week, but this time she was with her good friend Liz.

She sends me a pic of the two of them. Holy shit.

I jokingly muse how awesome it would be if we all got together tonight and gave Kelly a proper American send-off. No way that would have worked, right? But Lady Luck must have been horny that evening, because before I know it I’m booking a room at the nearest hotel I can find on short notice and running to the store for wine, condoms, lube, and anything else I could have possibly needed to handle two chicks at the same time.

It’s about 11pm when we finally get together in the hotel room. As I’m already acquainted with Kelly, I play a quick catch-up with Liz. Turns out she works in finance, at a very well-known corporation in the city. One of the first things she tells me is that not a single soul in her office knows about this ‘adventurous’ side to her. Interesting. I’ll keep that in mind.

The white wine continues to flow as smoothly as our conversation does and soon our clothes begin to follow suit. With a triple kiss to kick things off, we head to the showers for a quick rinse and I get to enjoy being the leberkase to the two fine brotscheibe both in front and behind me. Pretty sure none of us came out of that shower clean, though.

And this is where I discover a certain peculiarity with Liz - whereas Kelly had no gag reflex whatsoever, Liz couldn’t go ten seconds without puking on my cock. I actually timed it. And I wasn’t even forcing her head or anything, she fucked her own throat on my dick til puking all on her own. On top of that, she insisted before we started that I give her her first ever throatpie tonight, like how I did with Kelly the previous week. Oh boy.

Quick sidebar - it’s actually kind of difficult to rape two chicks at the same time! Unless they’re both tied up or something? Then it’s like just banging one girl right after the other. What’s the point, right? Well, here’s what I came up with:

My dominant side starts coming out and I take control of the situation, forcing them both down on their knees to suck my cock. Kelly starts off sucking the shaft, while Liz is on ball duty. Is that the optimal combination, though? I have to try it the other way just to be sure. And try again, and again. It’s the best feeling in the world.

They go at it for awhile, but eventually it’s time to fuck. Liz, being the new girl, gets the honor of going first as I grab her by the hair, drag her to the bed and bend her over, face down/ass up as I force my way into her cunt from behind. I tell Kelly to rub her pussy all over this stupid whore’s face as I’m railing Liz like a train. Her moans and screams get muffled into another woman’s flesh as I berate and verbally humiliate her.

Liz’s body starts to betray her as she begins panting like a bitch in heat, her entire body gleaming with sweat as she starts bucking her hips and shaking uncontrollably from her first orgasm of the night. I decide to reward myself with another blowjob, but this time with a little twist. I make Kelly go first, with Liz controlling her head on my cock. I play them off of each other, egging Liz on to really make her get mean and rough with it. She totally delivers, giving me the roughest, toughest blowjob I’ve ever received, all via Kelly’s bottomless cunt throat. 

When they switch places, I egg Kelly on the same way, but she’s an absolute sweetheart and doesn’t go nearly as rough/mean as Liz did, but this time I tell her to berate her friend in German which is not a language I understand but something I thought made it super kinky and hot. I get puked on a bit by Liz so we clean up and switch beds.

It’s Kelly’s turn now. I’m still recovering my stamina from earlier so she rides me cowgirl as Liz starts sucking on my toes, which is not something I’ve done before but holy shit, it feels just like a blowjob but on my feet. And she can go deep on it without puking her guts out so that’s nice. She rides me till that inevitable quivering and shaking rumbles through her loins and she gets exhausted and falls off.

Shockingly, I still haven’t cum yet. As I’m regrouping and planning the next position I want to try Liz tells me to slap her in the face as hard as I can. For real? She nods. I start off with a playful slap. More, she says. I go at it 25%. More. 33%. More. 50%. More. 66%? More. 80%. Finally she starts to really feel it. I’m basically wailing on her face with an open palm at this point, damn near giving her whiplash. The last face slap sends her careening to the bed, face down.

This is the hardest my cock has ever felt in my entire life, to the point where I’m not quite thinking straight. I jump on top of her and mount her from behind as hard as I can force it in, her screams and moans only kind of muffled by the bed and pillows. This is when the role play gears in my head start kicking in, so with each thrust inside her exposed, vulnerable fuckhole I’m telling her something along the lines of:

“You stupid fucking bitch, you thought you could work in this office and not have someone find you on that website? Everyone knows your dirty fucking secret now, that you spread your cunt legs for men who are better than you. Except every man is better than you, you useless baby factory. Your career is over now, whore. The only way you’re getting ahead now is on your back, like a fucking hooker. Hope you like being the office rapetoy, because even the intern is getting a piece of that ass”, etc.

At this point, I pull out and shift upwards to align myself with her asshole. My lovely assistant Kelly applies some pity lube and whispers some concern into Liz’s ear but she’s having none of it. “If he wants to fuck me in the ass he’s going to fuck me in the ass...” I hear her say.  Music to my ears. 

I can feel her rapehole stretch out as I split her cheeks like a fucking log. I can feel her whole body trembling as I begin to slowly assrape her. She’s crying out in both pain and ecstasy as I begin to pick up the pace, all while continuing our role play in her ear. It takes on a whole different level with the painal, and I wrap my hand around the front of her neck to choke her for good measure, too. I’m not sure how many times she came but she was a slobbering mess afterwards so however many orgasms it takes to do that, I guess.

I finally get exhausted and roll off of Liz, but I still haven’t cum yet! I check the time: about 1:15am. I had been going at it for over an hour non-stop, and at this point my mind was willing, but my body was pretty exhausted. Wasn’t going to end the night without a nut though, so this time I pulled in Kelly’s throat with the goal of cumming as hard as possible. With concentrated effort, it didn’t take too long to get close, and when I reached the point of no return I hot-swapped in Liz so I could give her that throatpie I promised her. 

As is my way, when a girl tells me she’s never had a throatpie before I make sure the first time I do it I cum unannounced (it’s like a little initiation to me). I grab onto the back of her head and hold her down for dear life as I cum as hard and as deep as I possibly can.

Big mistake.

As soon as the first shot hits her throat, puke starts spraying out of her like a geyser. I hold on for as long as I can but eventually the sheer force of the explosion sends her reeling and spraying me and the bed with vomit. Not gonna lie, it’s pretty disgusting. But she does her best to clean the tip of my dick with her mouth but I’m so sensitive at this point I can’t even handle it. 

We rush off to the showers a final time to clean off. There are no more clean towels, so we try to dry ourselves off on the clean side of one of the beds. We hang around for a bit dancing together to a little salsa music before we finally call it a night and bounce from the hotel room. 

I felt really bad for housekeeping the following morning."

Just wanted to ask grad students here if they'd be willing to assess my competitiveness as an applicant for PhD programs.

Here's my info:

* 2.5 years of research experience but no publications
* My undergad school is ranked in the 50s
* GPA: 3.96
* Math minor
* Decent GRE scores: (164/162/5) for (V/Q/W)
   * I am retaking the test soon and expect a higher quantitative score
* Minority applicant (Native American specifically)
* No conference presentations
* No internships (just summer research)
* Work experience (2 years of tutoring student athletes and 2 years of working in a hospital)

I think that about sums it up. Unfortunately, I found myself working with a graduate student and PI who weren't very reliable, and that explains my total lack of publications. I was wondering if it would make sense for me to apply to top 20 schools or if I should be aiming lower. I was also wondering about the number of ""safety"" schools I should have on my list. Here is my list so far (I'm planning on trimming it down some):

* NC State
* Michigan
* Illinois
* Carnegie Mellon
* Northwestern
* Ohio State
* Johns Hopkins
* Cornell
* Wisconsin
* Minnesota
* Iowa State
* University of Virginia

Thanks for any and all advice to those of you who have been through this process. I wish I had more to show for my undergraduate experience, but I'm hoping a decent graduate school will give me a chance.

Reasons varied from completing college, working only part-time or on an internship, several moves from varying states, just life in general.

I had recently renewed my lease on my apartment for another year, took a look at my finances and decided I seize the opportunity now to build my first desktop PC.

It was slightly intimidating considering building it myself, so I looked around online to see if there were any tech stores in the area that were geared specifically towards building something yourself.  The closest place is about a half hour away that I could find online, but I'm certain there could be something much closer that I am not aware of.

When I traveled to the store and discussed what I wanted to build, they helped me every step of the way.  I knew a bit of the details from my own research, but definitely needed assistance filling in the gaps.  I had not realized before that there were websites dedicated to helping you pick the components that are compliant with each other, and that was of great assistance.

[I bought all my components](https://i.imgur.com/fGFj1fy.jpg), brought them back to my place and stayed up to around 3 AM to [assemble my desktop](https://i.imgur.com/QhwFVXG.jpg).  It was quite an arduous task, but I managed nonetheless.  I also got fairly nervous at one point since I could not find my thermal paste, but upon further investigation, the heat processor fan already had it pre-applied.

I was nervous on the [first boot of my computer](https://i.imgur.com/WRaagBE.jpg), but it ran perfectly fine on the first attempt; it felt quite like the equivalent to compiling an application and running smoothly on the first attempt, which was awesome.

[Here's what my current setup looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/45nqJfn.jpg)

It was one of the most satisfying things I have accomplished this year, next to adopting two cats.  Although I have no need for a new PC anytime soon, I absolutely would love to build one again in the near future.

Bonus: [aforementioned cats keeping a watchful eye to protect me as I worked on my build](https://i.imgur.com/tZDUCnj.jpg).

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

Σπουδάζω σε Ελληνικό Α.Ε.Ι. και υπάρχει κάτι που περιπλέκει τα πράγματα πιστεύω όσον αφορά την πρακτική (θυμίζω πως στα ΤΕΙ είναι υποχρεοτική). Είμαι freelancer και το αν με καθιστούσε κάτι υποχρεωμένο να περιορίζομε μέσα σε έναν τρίτο χώρο εργασίας καθημερινά θα ήταν τεράστιο μειονέκτημα για την επαγγελματική καριέρα που έχω ήδη. Ένα εξάμηνο απουσίας από τον χώρο μου λόγο πρακτικής μπορεί κάνει χρόνια προόδου να χαραμιστούν...

Πιστεύω δεν έχω κάτι να κερδίσω από την πρακτική γιατί ήδη εργάζομαι στον τομέα μου και με καλές απολαβές κιόλας. Το θέμα μου λοιπόν είναι πως όταν θα έρθει η ώρα της πρακτικής θα πρέπει να λουφάρω μάλλον κάπως... Αλλά κανένας δεν μου έχει δώσει ικανοποιητική απάντηση για το πως θα γινόταν αυτό. Γιατί εν τέλη θέλω και το πτυχίο. 

Ένας καθηγητής-φίλος μου άφησε να εννοηθεί πως κάποιες μικρομεσαίες επιχειρήσεις δεν θα είχαν πρόβλημα (μετά συνεννόησης) να αναφέρουν πως παρίσταμαι στον χώρο τους ενώ στην πραγματικότητα εγώ θα μπορούσα να πηγαίνω όποτε ήθελα. Αλλά δεν ξέρω κατά πόσο εφικτό είναι αυτό. Και απ την άλλη, δεν θα με έκθετε και σε συνέπειες από την σχολή αν μαθευόταν; 

Ήλπιζα να υπήρχε κάποιος νόμιμος τρόπος να απαλλαγείς από την πρακτική... Πιστεύω είναι λογικό αν έχεις κάνει έναρξη σαν ελεύθερος επαγγελματίας στο αντικείμενο των σπουδών σου πως δεν θα έπρεπε να υποχρεούσαι να κάνεις πρακτική γιατί ουσιαστικά πας να προσφέρεις τσάμπα εργασία σε επιχείρηση τρίτου αναγκαζόμενος να αμελήσεις την δικιά σου, ενώ ο σκοπός του να αποκτήσεις εμπειρία έχει καλυφθεί ήδη. Αλλά γενικά όσο προσωπικό σε ΤΕΙ έχω ρωτήσει, αν και το βρίσκουν λογικό αυτό, το μόνο που ξέρουν σίγουρα είναι πως η πρακτική είναι υποχρεωτική για όλους.

______
(Παρένθεση εδώ, γιατί ανοίγω άλλο σχετικό θέμα αλλά το καθένα θέλει απάντηση ξεχωριστά.)


Μήπως στο εξωτερικό με πρακτική Erasmus+ θα ήταν πιο εύκολο να 'λουφάρει' κανείς; Φαντάζομαι (χωρίς να έχω άμεση εμπειρία) πως σε κάποια χώρα που υπάρχει η έννοια του intership θα μπορούσα να βρω εύκολα μια εταιρία όπου θα μπορώ να ""κάθομαι"" χωρίς ιδιαίτερες ευθύνες και με ελευθερία να κάνω τα δικά μου. Γιατί εδώ απ' όσο ξέρω όσους κάνουν πρακτική τους εκμεταλλεύονται. Έχω δει π.χ. φοιτητές σε τράπεζα να κάνουν δρομολόγια για καφέδες, άτομα σε τουριστικά γραφεία να κάνουν υπερορίες και delivery από το ένα υποκατάστημα στο άλλο στην άλλη άκρη της πόλης. 

Ενώ στο εξωτερικό (βάση στερεότυπου μιλάω, αν ξέρετε κάτι άλλο πείτε), τα καθήκοντα είναι βασισμένα σε άτομα με έμμισθη εργασία ή συνεργάτες οπότε οι interns και να ψάχνουν πράγματα να κάνουν δύσκολο να βρουν κάτι. Φαντάζομαι αν βρω κάποιον στο εξωτερικό να του πω την κατάσταση μου θα είναι πιο εφικτό, γιατί οι εδώ επιχειρήσεις μπορεί να έχουν και την ανάγκη να βάλουν τον φοιτητή να τους κάνει δουλειά. "
9decda,2,2018-09-05,How Long Does it Take to Succeed?,FabulousAd5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9decda/how_long_does_it_take_to_succeed/,"Source: Forbes 30 under 30 entrepreneur Chris Kelsey

Since a teenager, one of the biggest things I worried about was how long it’d take to financially succeed. I saw people who had a lot of money online and I always wondered how long it’d take **me** to get there. I originally told myself that I wanted to be a pharmacist because my cousin was earning 100k+/year right out of college. If it wasn’t that, I figured I could be a dentist and make $200k+/yr by my thirties.

In 2014, I talked to my cousin about what it was like to be a pharmacist. He said that it was the same thing everyday and overall he didn’t seem to recommend it. This scared me because my only other “option” was becoming a dentist, or so I thought.

During one of my dentist appointments, I asked my dentist if he could tell me about the business. He told me he went to school for 12 years and showed me some of the equipment they work with. I knew he made pretty good money, but the idea of being in university for 12 years (or 8 if you don’t specialize) was quite scary to me. He also said he worked as an employee for a number of years before he started his own firm. He described how he built up his client base which sounded the same as any normal business. I began asking myself why I would ever go to school for that long when I could start a normal business and make the same amount as him or even more. I also didn’t want to get in debt (which he said took years to pay off).

In my junior year of high school I joined a leadership program. One day they took us to a hospital and we got to learn from the doctors about their careers. One of the workers in residency said she went to Brown University and collected $200,000+ worth of student debt. She was a 28 year old that had pulled up in an old Toyota Corolla. I knew that was not the car I wanted to drive when I was 28 regardless of whether or not I was eventually going to make a supposed “fortune” from this industry. She told us that her only job during this “in the field” residency was doing paperwork for the hospital. It sounded like they looked at her as nothing more than an intern to take advantage of. I felt bad for her as I could tell from the tone of her voice that she wasn’t sure she had made the right choice.

After these events, I decided I wasn’t going to become a dentist, pharmacist, or even go to college. Beyond that, the seed of dropping out of high school was planted in my mind. My dream was to go big, and I wasn’t going to go home.

I did not become as financially successful as I hoped I would within the timeframe I’d expected. Yes, I did become a millionaire at 19 but I was trying to do that by the age of 18. In 2015, Appsitude only had 70k revenue and around 50k profit. At the end of the year I was disappointed in myself for not having made more money (although it didn’t take a lot of work).

I turned this disappointment into motivation to do better in 2016. Thankfully I ended up making 356k in revenue with around 200k in profit by the end of that year. I was happier but still upset that I hadn’t reached my goal.

I’ve found that success will not usually happen within the original timeframe you **hope for**, but it will definitely happen faster than you **think**. In 2017, my life began to change for the better over and over on different days (in the two previous years it did as well, but even more in 2017). All of a sudden I began to **feel** the light at the end of the tunnel.

In the pursuit of success, it’s good to stay motivated and continue pushing, but do not get mad at yourself if you don’t reach a certain point as quickly as you’d hoped for. Don’t compare yourself to me or anyone else because each of us had different circumstances. It doesn’t matter if you came from wealth or not, **true** success is completely independent of that. There are many broke people with a lot of money.

At the end of the day, you must remember that you cannot wait for future possible events to determine your success. You must create your success **today**. Today, my great friend was telling me that he wanted to wait on submitting a press release until he got a certain contract. I told him that he should do it **now** instead of later because the contract isn’t for certain, but that the journalists receiving and posting the press release is a guarantee (yes I know in certain cases you don’t know if the journalists will post your press release, but in this specific case it is certain). I also mentioned that posting the press release will put more pressure on his potential client because the article will make the client realize he may lose his chance to work with my friend due to the soon-to-come influx of other potential customers.

It’s always best to do something now than later. The only thing between us and success is **time**, and the only thing holding us back is our **fear of success**. I had many moments where I waited on posting something online because I knew it’d had massive results and I felt I wouldn’t be ready to handle what came next. The thing is, life always prepares you for the next steps even when it looks like it won’t to either you or those around you. When you have this in mind, you become unstoppable because you will realize that life is always taking you into the right direction.

It took me from December 2014 till May 2017 to become a millionaire. That’s around 2.5 years of working toward my goal. I did do things for money before then so you could say my journey originally began in May 2013, but I didn’t seriously get into business until the end of 2014. Yes, I did lose most of that money from my ex-business partner stealing it, but I didn’t care (besides the friendship lost) because I knew I can, and will earn far more than what I “lost.”

I feel that true success is the ability to realize that you could lose all of your material things today and not blink because you know you can just as easily earn it again. Once you’ve attained this **feeling** (it’s not just a belief), you’ll notice that everything you want to happen begins to happen. With that being said, I believe that I did not truly become successful until my fiance came into my life after the summer of 2017."

I have some experience regarding Aspen Plus and HYSYS since my final project was about simulation regarding ethyl acetate production using reactive distillation.  
I also have a bit experience for being a MATLAB and lab assistant when I'm still in college (I wonder if these things are worth mentioning in the CV or not)
  
What other things that I should learn while finding a job as CE? I already decided on learning AutoCAD first since there's one company which listed AutoCAD as one of the requirement for being a product developer.  
I've tried skimmed through the FAQs and seen programming being mentioned. How does it help in your job?

I'm a fresh graduate (graduated at the start of this year) with little to no idea how to manage money/savings. Apart from pulling 2k out from my paycheck (\~50%) every month into a savings account that's yielding me 2.8% (ING), I feel as if money can be better managed. A little bit about myself first.

I turned 21 about half a year ago and have been working based in Sydney as a data scientist for a Management Consultancy for just over a year (started as an intern last year). I'm on 75k a year including super and boss has told me I'm being promoted at the end of this year. I'm not sure what bonus I'll get.

I still live at home and my monthly expenses are about 1.3k - 2.1k depending on what I need to purchase in that month:

Breakdown are as follows:

\- Food ($400) - this includes going out with girlfriend and colleagues

\- Rent ($400) - Mentioned I still live at home but I don't want to leverage off this especially with a job -- $100 a week goes to groceries and family allowance just so I help out. I work a pretty intense job as well, so not always able to help out with housework.

\- Transport ($180) - This is fixed, $45 a week for the train assuming a 20-21 day work month.

\- Essential variable costs ($300) - This could be anywhere from paying for car insurance/rego or buying fuel.  

\- Gifts/Presents/Splurging on my self ($200) - If I average this out for the whole year, it comes to about $200 a month. This includes buying my girlfriend presents/friend's birthday and spoiling myself from time to time.

\- Holidays ($300) - A full 4 week holiday would cost about $4k including accommodation/food/travel -- I am probably being optimistic here.

&amp;#x200B;

This sums to $1780 a month off a 4k paycheck (after tax). Would like to maintain this lifestyle but I think I might be spending too much here.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at ETFs and other types of funds I can put my money in, but I don't know where to start or how to proceed from there. I have about $25k in savings at the moment. I've looked at buying property, but I think given the inflated housing market in Sydney and the massive financial burden I'll have - I will probably give that one a pause.

If you guys have any advice/recommendations about where to go, it would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers!

&amp;#x200B;

So, first off, what shall we be called? I like Black, Tarso &amp; Heron LLP. Step aside BDO, and say hello to BTH baby!

It's either that or ASS - Associates, Seniors &amp; Supervisors LLP. What about IEO LLP? IndustryExitOpps

It's going to be about $500 for a booth at a decent school. If 6 of us pitch in we can have 1 partner (compensated), 1 hot recruiter, 1 koolaid-drinking recent intern, 1 associate, 2 seniors, and a manager.

For the partner, we need someone a little grizzled looking and can add some credibility. We can offer you $200 for standing with us. The game plan is for two of us at a time to go do actual recruiting, and we'll rotate throughout the evening. You have to promise to come back to our ""company"" booth and serve your time once you've done your own recruiting though.

Please state:

1. Firm Name suggestion or preference
2. What position you are applying for
3. Why you'd be a great fit for the team!
4. And an example of what you'd say to interested students that dare to wait in our line

9dh10l,4,2018-09-06,Am I responsible for this...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9dh10l/am_i_responsible_for_this/,"So I just wanted to write it out in an attempt to see where I went wrong and to maybe get insight from unbiased people. This is a throw away account so here goes;

I am a junior doctor still doing my internship at a public hospital in country where corrupt government, lack of funds result in poor health facilities. We always have shortage of staff so there’s no designation really, doctors do a nurse’s job as well and that’s how we all keep going. 

Anyway this happened when I was on my second last rotation in surgical ward under an extremely pathetic female consultant. She was hated and feared by EVERYONE. If you walked into her office, she’d make sure to strip all the self respect, dignity and self esteem off of you. She would insult your way of standing and talking in front of her. You talk fast, you talk slow she’d straight up jump to insult your mother your father, easily among the worst human beings on earth. I was praying not to get surgical rotation under her supervision but oh well... 


Okay during the last two weeks of my rotation we were deciding who will be working on Christmas Day. And me and this other person were the chosen ones. The other doctor requested that they needed to be at home for family dinner so if it was okay to split the 24 hour shift so they can be at hospital during the day and I’ll be there at night. So I said okay. 

Now I arrive on my exact time since I had to take notes from them. There was me and the trainee, who are senior to us, on call that night. 

There were 3 sick patients and my colleague told me briefly about everything and left. I took initial vitals and checked up on critical ones with that senior of mine. Now there was this old man internally bleeding I guess but with very critical situation. We requested the ICU to provide a bed for him but they couldn’t do anything as the beds were all filled, there was no space. We had no choice than to keep monitoring him every hour and looking out for other patients too. 


His family was extremely non co-operative. The man is on his death bed and they’re just chit chatting away, eating, laughing basically enjoying Christmas at the hospital. At night they left and I monitored the patient till 3am. The Blood pressure monitoring apparatus was faulty so I had to go to another ward to borrow and then return the apparatus everytime. After 3am the Senior was supposed to do that. In the morning when I looked at the charts and only 3 readings were written there. What could I do if he didn’t do his part. I told the senior and left at my time. I got a text after 2-3 hours from the senior saying the old man passed away. 


A week after that, it turns out the family filed a case and it was all under investigation. What??? Those pathetic pigs filed a case when they could see we were only two people to look after 30+ patients and they were told about the refusal from the ICU. The ***** consultant dragged me in as well and tried to put it all on me. I explained and told her what happened but she was taking out minor details out of the patient’s file. I mean she wasn’t there to see what we had to do and we were running around doing everything ourselves and that ***** celebrating Christmas with her family took it all out on me because I was the most junior one in the story. She made me feel I was incompetent and my negligence killed that man. At the end she told me to write an explanation letter and that was it. The case probably ended up nothing or maybe the hospital had to pay that old man’s family I don’t know. 

I left from that shit hole. Completed my internship and I’m doing so much better. But I still sometimes think about it and wonder if I am responsible for his death? I wasn’t held accountable but i just need to know where I stand??

**Trivia/Card Art Corner**

* Ritsuko has gone through three major design changes compared to the other idols’ two. [Her original design has her signature twin braids that curl up.](http://www.project-imas.com/w/images/c/cf/Ritsuko.png) [Her second design one year later straightens these out, and it is the design you see in the anime.](http://www.project-imas.com/w/images/6/6a/Ritsuko_ofa_stage.png) [Her third design debuted in Platinum Stars and showcases a long braid down her left side.](http://www.project-imas.com/w/images/e/e9/Ritsuko_PS.png)

* Ritsuko actually knows a little bit of MMA.

* Ritsuko actually started out at 765Pro as an intern before transitioning into an idol due to the shortage of idols in the agency, then transitioning to the role of a producer like you see now. Being a Producer was always her initial goal.

Today's Million Live representative is Karen Shinomiya! Karen shares a lot of character traits with Yukiho - she is very shy (although lacks the phobia of men and dogs) and became an idol as a way to overcome her reserved nature and gain confidence. Karen looks up to some of the other girls in the Theater that also lack confidence in some areas and draws inspiration and support from them. Karen also enjoys practicing aromatherapy and has suggested scents for other members of the Theater to use for relaxation.

Details, ideas, and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9di7xp/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood morning DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"
9dja3n,208,2018-09-06,Dr. Drama in: Meet the Centaur Associate!,Deprox,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/9dja3n/dr_drama_in_meet_the_centaur_associate/,"I'm a clerk at a civil court in Brazil. My job includes dealing with lawyers and parties who walk up to our counter, as well as dealing with all the stages of a lawsuit. Some months ago, not long after I changed workplaces to my current Court, I got to know one *adorable* lawyer whose nickname around clerks is ""Doctor Drama"". This tale takes place about three months after [You actually expect me to WRITE AND SUBMIT??](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/9cmeit/dr_drama_in_you_actually_expect_me_to_write_and/).

We had three very peaceful months without Dr. Drama showing up. Some of us think he was undergoing unsucessful treatment in a mental ward, but that's not here nor there. During this time, every now and then, a very loud clopping would be heard on the hallway. While a bit odd (maybe someone in leather heels?), I didn't think much about it until I had to deal with the owner of the shoes. 

It's a very busy afternoon. Most clerks and all interns are dealing with someone at the counter, and there's a small line. I realize that a late-twenties good looking man in a very expensive suit, next in line, has been staring at me for about five minutes now. ""Tough luck, bud, I'm happily married"", is what I want to say, but instead, I stare back at him when I'm done with the lawyer I was helping.

We keep staring at each other for about a minute, when I give up and say ""May I help you, sir?"". He huffs, turns his back and, *clop, clop, clop*, goes away, his expensive-looking shoes making the exact noise of a horse's hooves. Okay...? Plenty of crazies 'round here, I don't really mind one more. I go back to my own business and forget about it... Until I hear ""It was him!"" from down the hall, and the oh-so-familiar screech from Doctor Drama.

**""SO YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MISTREATED MY ASSOCIATE???""**

I look around and see he is pointing at me. ""I don't think so, no."", says me in an I'm-too-busy-for-your-bullshit-today tone. *Clop, clop, clop*, the good looking man walks the hall dramatically and points at me. ""This is the one! I asked him many times about our lawsuit and he just wouldn't answer! So terribly rude!"". His voice is unfittingly high-pitched. A few people clear the counter because they're probably afraid to catch whatever crazies they have. Doctor Drama approaches and proceeds to, as per usual, slam the counter.

**""I WAS SURE IT WAS YOU! YOU'RE THE RUDEST CLERK I'VE EVER MET!""**

He rants for a while about public workers, and his associate does the same. Oh God, it's happening. It's stereo craziness, right here in front of me. Suddenly, the associate tugs his sleeve, yells ""LET'S TAKE IT TO THE JUDGE!"", looks dramatically at me and, *clop, clop, clop*, both leave. My supervisor, who was looking at me, tells me to just go back to work, and I'm pretty sure I can see a vein bulging on his forehead. Other lawyers who were there the whole time are also looking at me, confused as hell. They know not how blissful are they, for they never had to deal with Doctor Drama.

Based on the associate's ~~horse~~shoes' noise, I can pretty much pinpoint where they are. *Clop, clop, clop*, down the hall... *Clop, clop, clop*, going up the stairs... *Clop*, asking where is our judge's office... *Clop, clop, clop*, walking the upper floor halls... Until it finally stops, probably in front of the judge's room. Not one minute later, I can hear the stereo screaming from the floor above, and finally, the office's phone rings. It's the judge, and I know it because I can hear my supervisor say ""Your Honor, you've been a judge for 20 years. Does that seem plausible?"" among other things about both lawyers' behaviors. Bear in mind that they kept screaming *while she was on the phone*.

When my supervisor hangs up, things upstairs are silent for a while and then... **CLOPCLOPCLOPCLOPCLOP, THUD, CLOPCLOPCLOPCLOPCLOP, THUD, CLOPCLOpCLopClopclop***clopclopclop.....*, the loud screaming resumes, in mono, and the sound of shoes is amusingly loud until it dies down. Judging by the sound, Dr. Drama resumed screaming at the judge and the associate proceeded to fly down the stairs and leave the premises. The distinctive sound of policemen going up the stairs is also heard a few moments later (""SIR, GET ON THE GROUND! DON--""), and there seems to be a small riot in the upper floor before everything is quiet once again after a loud thud.

The judge shows up with a frown at our office, a very rare occurrence¹, an hour later. Doctor Drama and his associate have been banned from setting foot in our court's building for one year and a grievance has been filed to the Bar Association. She might as well have said she would be sharing her hefty salary with us, based on the joy wave that took our office!  ""So, what happened?"", asks my supervisor, unable to contain a grin. The judge sighs.

Apparently, they vehemently insisted that I assaulted his associate (""tried to punch him in the chest, stomach and face""), which caused her to call our office, but backed down when she stated they would be arrested and face strong charges if their complaint was found not to be true. When the ban was issued on the grounds of disturbing a judge's work to tell lies, Doctor Drama started to rant like a lunatic (""his words weren't making a speck of sense""), screaming and pointing at her, and he was to spend one night in jail for disrespectful behavior towards a public worker. The associate was smarter and just bolted before she could care to jail him too. Someone in the upper floor called the court police as soon as Dr. Drama started to scream for the first time², and he wound up tased because he tried to resist arrest and now, she says with a half-smile, it was up to the police as to how many nights would he spend in jail.

And that's how all courts in the building had a blissful year with no Dr. Drama or his Centaur Associate... Just the third associate, which was the sanest of the three by a hair. I'm pretty sure he once defecated on the public toilet's floor out of spite, but that's a story for another day.

***

¹ An even rarer occurence, however, would be the judge showing up at our office with a smile.  
² Yes, it takes about 3-5 minutes for the police to arrive. Yes, the judge was in danger this whole time. No, it doesn't make any sense not to have police at the judges' floor. People have been telling administration for decades. They don't seem to care, because their room is right next to the police room, in the criminal courts' building."

I was a biology major my first year of college then an accounting major my sophomore year college (my freshman year I did not do well at all for a number of factors), but this summer I recently transferred to a new college and switched my major to supply chain management. I was really indecisive with what exactly I wanted to do, and I have not done any internships with any companies this far in my college career. Right now I am just trying to get into the swing of things as far as it goes with this new major and new school, but seeing as how I'm a Junior I know I do not have much time to figure things out. My biggest fear right now is that I know SCM is a degree where internships are a big thing and can really affect your post-grad jobs. I'm currently trying to get my GPA up still because of the academic blunders I made my first year, my overall is around a 2.9 right now which is pretty bad. 

I'm hoping to get more involved at this school and somehow score an internship, but I just want to run a few scenarios and get your thoughts on it.

If I were to graduate in SCM with a decent GPA but no internships, do you think that would make it difficult for me to find good jobs after graduating?

I just started a QA Engineer internship at a startup, and one of my first tasks is to research Selenium vs VSTS CUIT. 

We run everything thru Azure and VSTS, so management was wondering if we should burrow further in the ecosystem by adopting the integrated test suite in VSTS, Coded UI Test, or to go with the tried and true Selenium option for rigging up the automated UI tests.

I have been looking into the pros and cons of it online, and I just wanted to hear some opinions and perspectives from people who have experience with one or the other, or both.

Thanks!"

I'm a US ~~resident~~ citizen studying overseas looking to apply for the Pharm.D next year. I have one more year before I complete my undergrad degree in pharmacy. I've already studied core pharmacy subjects like pharmacology, pharmaceutics, engineering, therapeutics and more. My research this year is in QA and RA. I've been a delegate and presented winning papers, have been the college representative in state and national level conferences, and Pharma events (overseas). I took the PCAT in july and here are my scores-

Biology- 80 %ile

Chemistry- 93 %ile

Quantitative reasoning- 67 %ile

Critical reading- 97 %ile

Composite- 90 %ile

I got a score of 3 on the essay with the median being 2.78

I have a GPA ranging between 8.2 to 9.3 out of 10. I don't have much internship experience working as a tech, but get this. I've worked in a hospital, accompanying the medical team examining patients at the bedside, medical history, pharmacotherapy, and making adjustments to medication therapy (accompanied and supervised by senior faculty of course) to the drug regimen. I'm doing this for one more year as a part of my course work.

I've also studied Pharmacy practise as a subject for two semesters and am experienced in patient case analysis and  presentations, counselling, and ethics.

I've also taken courses in management, jurisprudence, ethics and chemistry for years. I've got lab experience in the aforementioned courses too.

I'm a little confused on how to go about with starting the whole procedure. As of now, I'm waiting for my WES evaluation and would be taking the TOEFL soon.


My question is, What are my chances? Should I bother applying to a good school? What tier of pharmacy schools should I be aiming for? It's not possible for me to take the PCAT again, and I'm inclined towards pursuing a dual degree PharmD. 

Any tips, suggestions, and advice would be welcome. Thanks.

9dmskt,5,2018-09-06,Soil - Valycia Bound (Tinfoilus mas Grungus),elpadrinonegro,pureasoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/9dmskt/soil_valycia_bound_tinfoilus_mas_grungus/,"Tl;Dr: Aight, what I'm aiming for here is some next level tinfoil, if that sorta thing ain't *your* thing you won't like this one bit, so sorry. If however you think you are into tinfoil... strap in, I *will* test that. 

Oh, and this is the first part of two, I tried to keep it down, but it sorta grew in the telling:)

In my apparently never ending quest to unearth even the derpest darkest and most inaccessible secrets od ASOIAF, to boldly go where no one has ever really bothered to go before, I have come across a most curious tome that I do not quite know what to make of.

The tome is old very old mayhaps as old as the very idea of Westeros itself, and it is written in a strange language to boot. Somewhat reminiscent of *skaldic poetry* but not quite, which makes a complete translation futile, and I will therefore have to present it in bits.

It consists of twelve texts, or *songs* if you will. Some of those texts seems prophetic in nature, some merely descriptive, and some... Well, some seems to be written solely for those already in the know.

But while everything about the tome is smothered in the mist of time, I can't even be sure where it was written or by whom. All signs however points to the place of origin as a city called Sea-Craddle, or mayhaps Sea-Mantle. And this in itself is a bit curious since the writers appear to have been Maesters, or at least an earlier version of Maesters, leading to the shaky conclusion that this Sea-Craddle could even be a precursor to the Citadel itself.

Most of the texts in the small collection are signed by the Maesters Cantarell and Layne, and again a point of curiosity, as this could be read as an indication that Maester Mushroom in naming himself was actually following a now lost tradition, instead of as previously reasoned just named after his hobby.

And this is of course pure speculation, but the prophetic nature of some of the texts lend credence to the thinking that Maester Layne was in fact no other than Lann the Clever himself.

But let's dig in to the texts one by one and see what shakes.

The first of the texts is called **Them Bones** but unfortunately there's not a lot of meat on this one. It appears rather repetitive, a hymn of lamentation, written from the perspective of someone mourning the loss of a loved one to the point where the writer identifies with the dead rather than the living. The title *Them Bones* along with the lines *I lie dead gone under red sky* and *dust rise right on over my time* indicates that this text is indeed about Lady Barbrey and her long lost Lord and not much else. But then the heart of that matter is really encompassed in the title *Them Bones.*

The second text is named **Dam That River** and this one is a bit more tricky because even though there's a lot more text it appears prophetic in nature. As the title is alluding to Euron's coming attack on Oldtown, and therefore not easily deciphered. But I believe that *dam that river* is exactly what the Hightowers are fixing to do to the Honeywine and at least metaphorically they are going to piss on a candle to do it. Here's how [[Spoilers Extended] A Clarke and a Half](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/8udkh8/spoilers_extended_a_clarke_and_a_half/) This is also me arguing why the glass candle test in reality is a test of hubris rather than a test of skills. The line *you piss upon my candle, so proving you're a fake,* is to be taken quite literally I believe.

The third text **Rain When I Die** is a text about Lord Varys. And the text is actually worth a foil of it's own. Not the least because of the curious reference to Quentyn Martell *Oh, when I die,* but for this post *what she slippin' inside, slow castration* and *I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me* strongly indicates that this text is about Lord Varys... and now we know what the weather will be like when Varys dies.

The next text **Down In A Hole** is another text that is definitely worth a close look. The text is about Bran. *I like to fly, but my wings have been so denied* captures Bran in a line, but that's not all. This text also hints at what Jojen is on about with the chained wolf business. *Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place, I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste* and at the same time connects this to Norse mythology with the wolf eating the sun bit. *Oh I want to be inside of you* is of course a rather morbid line about Bran and Hodor's relationship.

*Down In A Hole* is then followed by **Sickman.** The opening lines of this text, *what the hell am I? Thousand eyes, a fly* flags this text as the companion piece to *Down* as this one seems to be all about Lord Brynden. This text however is not easily understood either as it focuses mostly on Lord Brynden's relation with time, or rather Lord Brynden's lack of connection with time.

The text **The Rooster** is about good old Jon Connington, the soldier who despite carrying out orders to the extent his conscious would allow, is still forced into exile *they spit on me in my homeland.* And now lives for one thing only *oh god please won't you help me make it through,* to see Rhaegar's son on the throne before he dies.

And talking about sons of Rhaegar. *The Rooster* is followed by **Junkhead** and this one is a bit heavy in the *Heiti* department. For reference [Words of Death ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/9asgtt/words_of_death/). Not only is good old *Lord Knowsnothing* simply referred to as *Junkhead* but his merry band of rapers, murderers and turncloaks are also being poetically paraphrased as *stoners, junkies and freaks,* even the Night's Watch's oath is in this text written in a funny stunted way *money, status, nothing to me.* Mayhaps, one can only speculate, an older version of the oath than the one we know.

**Dirt** follows, and again we're treated to a rather short and repetitive text with one message only. To illustrate Jaime waking up to the nature of his and Cersei's relationship. *I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me* pretty much says it all. *You have the talent to make me feel like dirt.*

**God Smack** is a text about everyone's favorite little god smacking psychopomp intern Arya and also probably the most esoteric of the dozen. *Don't you know that none are blind* written from the perspective of an Arya who already sees herself as a little slice of death. But at the same time have become a bit confused with the face-changing and warging and whatnot. *for the horse you've grown much fonder than for me, that I don't ponder.*

**Hate To Feel** is a text about Tyrion's continuous tumble down the road of self-loathing. *All the time I swore I'd never be like my old man* spells it out, but it's also a Tyrion who is at an end, who has had enough. *Gotta change, set a date eat my cake lick my plate* and who will return to Westeros to get what he sees as his. *What the hell it's time to face exactly who I am.*

The next to final text is called **Angry Chair** and this text really *do* need a bit more space. So, please forgive me but I'm going to skip this for now and do a Cersei post where I will include the text instead (tomorrow).

The final text is called **Would?** Which in this case is a misspelling of wood and it's about good old Neddy and his feelings of temporal displacement. *Into the flood again same old trip it was back then* and his broken promises, *so I made a big mistake try to see it once my way.* And really the only question the Ned should have been asking himself. *Have I run too far to get home?*

Conclusion: Elleven out of twelve texts from the book of **Soil.** Full text here [Alice In Chains Lyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/a/aliceinchains.html) seems to be about our friends in Westeros. the twelfth is too, but let me back that up first, (Cersei post tomorrow).

So could it be that the Maesters Layne and Cantarell really saw it all so many years ago? Should we forget all them other prophets, the Norse, the Greeks and the Bard and look towards the Emerald City for clarity? Or, mayhaps I should start listening to other bands? What say you?

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

I am currently a freshman at GMU majoring in Information Systems and  plan on transferring to Vtech next fall.  I wanted to some questions?
I personally don't like george mason because it doesn't have a good reputation outside the Washington DC Metro area and it lacks school spirit and vibes are kinda bad,  It feels like high school 2.0.

What GPA is needed to have a solid chance of getting in?

Do high school grades make a huge part of the admissions process?
What other advice can you give to a prospective transfer applicant?
How hard is it to get adjust to Virginia Tech ( Blacksburg vs fairfax/ university setting)?

How hard are the classes for BIT majors  ( are they much more harder than George Mason classes)?

What does the university provide to transfer students to make the transition easier?

How are the job opportunities for BIT majors, more specifically concentrating in DSS?

Is it really worth going from George Mason to Virginia tech? the only advantage I see from George Mason that it is close to dc and that helps with opportunities/ internships.



Your responses are appreciated.

CZ was supposed to do a prison internship as part of her studies, but she has heard that the warden doesn't want her there because her health issues apparently make her too much of a health and safety risk. She says that she hardly disclosed any of her issues to him, and she goes on about how she's been ""discriminated against"" and how she's ""constantly fighting"" against ableism. She is right - disabled people are discriminated against unfairly. But to take the struggle of genuinely sick and disabled people as her own, so she can get the echo chamber of ""you poor thing"", is so horrible. We called on her shouting ""ableist"" if she wasn't allowed to do this internship, and looky here. This CZ is one predictable gal.

EDITED: And surely, if she actually HAD all of these conditions, it would actually be safer for her to NOT to do this thing? Oh dear, maybe she should stop playing sick, it's come to bite her in the bum.

9dor0e,14,2018-09-06,Infopass from hell,throwawayGC9839w0,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/9dor0e/infopass_from_hell/,"Just wanted to share my frustratingly useless experience going for an Infopass appointment today.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** filed I-140 under EB2-NIW at TSC in October/2017; raised SR in May/2018 after case was beyond normal processing time, received a generic reply that my case was in line for review and I should wait 90 days before contacting USCIS again. The 90 days have passed and my case status is still stuck at “case received,” so I decided to try my luck in person with a USCIS agent in hopes of finding a human being with the slightest bit of empathy who’d be willing to dig a little deeper to try and understand what the hell is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

After waiting THREE HOURS (even though I arrived right on time for my appointment), I was called to a window. Here’s how this bizarre encounter went down:

&amp;#x200B;

Agent: How can I help you?

Me: I was hoping to find more information about my case than I’ve been able to online. It’s outside normal processing times. I already filed an SR and it’s now past the 90 days I was told to wai--

A: IT’S 120 DAYS

M: But the notice said 90 days.

A: Where does it say that?

*I slide my SR response letter towards her and she pushes it back* 

A: IT’S 120 DAYS

M: But the person over the phone also told me I had to wait 90 days

A: They don’t know what the hell they’re talking about.

M: Ok…

*She starts looking at her computer and clicking away. She does that for a very long time. I get excited. She may be rude, but it looks like she’s digging deep into things! She’ll be able to tell me something, ANYTHING useful about my case. She looks at my I-140 receipt notice a few times and asks:* 

A: What’s your classification?

*I’m a little confused. It’s written right on my I-140 receipt notice, which she’s still looking at.* 

M: EB2-National Interest Waiver

A: Is that second preference?

*I’m becoming more perplexed.* 

M: Yes, second preference.

*She reads some stuff. Then she prints out the latest visa bulletin and hands it to me.*

A: As you can see, your category is currently retrogressed, therefore…

M: Ma’am, sorry for interrupting, but this doesn’t even apply to me yet. I’m still at the petition stage. I am inquiring about my I-140, not the I-485. Priority dates should not affect I-140 processing.

A: Ok…

*A few more clicks and long stares at her monitor.*

A: I see you changed your address recently. Possibly what happened is that, after you move, you have to wait 90 days for your file to be transferred to the new local office.

*\[I recently moved from an east coast state to another east coast state (both under TSC jurisdiction), but that was after my case was already past the normal processing times and after filing an SR and receiving a response. And yes, I did update my address within 10 days of moving. And none of this should even affect I-140 adjudication, which I then try to explain to her.\]*

M: But ma'am, again, this doesn’t apply to my inquiry. I’m asking about my I-140, which should be in Texas.

A: But you don’t live in Texas!

M: No, I don’t, but the Texas and Nebraska service centers are the ones that process EB2-NIW cases.

*More clicks, long stares, and some typing. She prints out a sheet with a list of “actions”. The very last item on the list is checked, which says they were opening a new SR. She hands it to me and sends me on my way. I left the place dumbfounded. I had just wasted 4 hours out of work to walk out with something I could’ve done myself on the computer. And how can someone like that work at USCIS? She showed little to no understanding of the whole EB green card process. Every answer she gave me was completely scripted and MADE NO SENSE TO MY PARTICULAR INQUIRY.*

&amp;#x200B;

I’m trying to stay hopeful, but dealing with USCIS is one of the most soul-crushing, kafkaesque\* experiences one can have with a governmental agency.

\* I know this adjective gets thrown around a lot these days, but it really does befit USCIS accordingly: ""having a nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality"" (from Merriam-Webster).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Went for infopass appointment after waiting for a year with no news from USCIS about my petition. Waited 3 hours and got an extremely rude agent who seemed more like an intern on her first day. Got nothing useful out of it."

Hello everyone, I’ll be applying in two years and Im looking for weaknesses in my profile so that I can address them before I apply. 

Background

Work Experience: 
Undergrad Internship at top oilfield services company, redesigning a failing product line in a sector the company was trying to grow. 

Year one with current company, I was hired as a quality/data analysis engineer on the sustainment of a famous defense program. Automated my daily activities within six months, given a service recognition award and was given free reign to automate anything else I wanted within my team. 

Year two, moved from the operations side of the company into a more technical role. Lead the design and development of an incredibly complex and difficult area of a larger assembly, interfacing with suppliers, manufacturing, and leadership. Had the opportunity on multiple occasions to propose major design changes and compromises that had far reaching changes to schedule and performance.  Led to my acceptance into the LDP. 

Third year (now), currently working as a stress analyst because the mathematical select of design is the weakspot if most designers. Promoted for my support of multiple projects. 

Currently helping stand up a cross training program for engineers to try their hand at other roles. It helps balance out overwork and underwork, and lets the company reshuffle its talent to achieve greater employee happiness. 

Also helping devise a centralized hub for all technical data in my organization. Currently there are a lot of resources that exist, but there is no way to market there existence so many employees go without. 

Extracurriculars:

Worked as a student ambassador while in university. Essentially an intermediary between students and administration. Voiced students concerns and needs, lobbied on their behalf to gain access to more resources, aided administration in creation and role out of as campaigns to increase enrollment of targeted groups. Started a speaker series where professors shared their experiences and opinions in a candid way. 

Founded a club to help transfer students acclimate to the university, centralizing university resources and information for them, setting up social events to build bonds, etc. 

Outreach events, basically introducing young students from underserved communities to engineering in a fun and engaging way. 
Big Brothers Big Sisters Program - currently a Big for a middle schooler. 

Small business consulting for local businesses. I wanted to see if I would enjoy consulting, so I reached out to a local business that was struggling, but had some great products and has been around for 60 years. Recently took on another client. I provide analysis of the sales and revenue data for both, as well as helping both prepare presentations to help them secure investment to reduce their monthly debt device costs. 

Undergrad school/major: Top 5 Mechanical Engineering program. 

Other education: Currently getting a masters of mechanical engineering. There were some topics I still wanted to learn about and want to be a community college professor when after I retire. 

Race/Nationality: Hispanic/Native American
Sex: 27M (29M when I apply)


Stats:  GRE 165V, 169Q, 4 AWA (730 GMAT conversion)

Undergraduate GPA
3.4 or 3.3 at university
3.7 from Community College 1
3.8 from Community College 2
3.5+ all units combined. 

Goal of MBA:

At the core of who I am, I love learning, I love personal growth, and I love helping others do the same. 

Long term I want to be a business owner and investor (real estate and local businesses). To me, that means having capital and business acumen.  As an engineer, I can certainly acquire both, but at a much slower rate. Additionally, I enjoy quickly moving from project to project and high level learning and strategy, and that doesn’t exist as much in my industry. 

To that end I’d like to use my MBA to get into MBB consulting because I believe that will prepare me best to help businesses grow. 

Questions and concerns:

Not sure whether to include this but neither of my parents graduated high school and both work blue collar jobs. My upbringing had a lot of economic turmoil, with bills being regularly unpaid, creditors calling the house, and helping my dad do construction on the weekends to make ends meet (why I’m interested in real estate).  I’m incredibly hungry when it comes to success, I went to two community colleges at an hour apart at once so I could get the classes I needed when I needed them. 

Things that may count against me, I attended community college, and I’m not sure how that looks on my application. Additionally, I have a c- from a class in my transcripts. Basically there were group labs and both of my teammates dropped so I had to do the work of three people, which I struggled to do in the time limit. 

I have a nine month gap between graduating and my first job, mostly just burnout and enjoying spending time without my dad helping him fix up his house. 

A major question I have is what sorts of positions I should pursue with my next two rotations? Should I seek to acquire business experience, maybe leadership rotations in more operational roles? Is it better to stay in engineering and try to do more tech and innovation roles from that position?

I had it all I had 2 big 4 offers and few offers from firms right behind the big 4. So not going to go into too much detail I transferred to a university after getting my associates a community college. Decided I want to do accounting even though I was pretty unsure of what it entailed. My first semester I did everything I could for recruitment since I just turned 21 and had the future ahead of me. Got involved with BAP did all the on campus events everything was going really well was networking with professionals from the field made a really good image for myself that I got 3 office visits from the big 4. I had a really good GPA 3.8 after my first semester and got offers from 2 of the big 4 (the other one I went to the office visit when I had the flu and drank too much robitussin before so I wasn't ready for it). However during my second semester I started having a lot of problems when it came to money lost 40 pounds from not having a lot of money, working too much to pay for an apartment and other shit, and a bunch of personal stuff going on with relationships.... It doesn't really matter what the problems where, I don't want to get too personal,  I ended up getting a lot of offers for internships and let them all expire and didn't do too well that semester. I thought my GPA dropped below a 3.0 because I ended up not studying for any finals and was unsure of what would happen next in my life. But I let all the intern offers expire and didn't send any emails telling them why ( I KNOW I FUCKED UP). Though during the summer I got everything back on track and checked my GPA and it is at a 3.25 which is better than I thought it would be and am now pissed at myself for not sending emails and don't know what to do. I'm paranoid about going to recruiting events because of the people I will see. I skipped the meet the firms event the other night and should of went and now I don't know. I just don't really know what to do, I'll get my GPA up this semester but I'm a senior now and I feel like I just ruined my career in accounting. What are my options should I just apologize to the firms and explain my situation and hope they feel pity and try to regain my reputation. This is bad and I know I'm just super anxious about how everyone is going to think of me now and am petrified I had the best offers from the best companies that recruit at my college and I f'd it all up and am super depressed and don't really know what to do about it.

TL:DR Do firms still offer kids that let their initial offer expire?"

At work today, I was talking with a group of people about what their plans were at Amazon and most of them never planned on working in a warehouse. One woman had a BA in English, another had a law degree, I have a BA as well (in language and education), while this other guy has a BA in management/business. We all work at basically the lowest tier, and are probably about as qualified as the actual managers who get paid several times more than us, since all you need to get into those positions is a BA. Yet since we got hired on at the lowest level, we have to work up all the way to management which is several levels ahead, OR we quit the company and apply directly as a manager... except oh wait they only take people doing internships for college. So basically we all missed the boat by not getting permanent employment from internships in college. Once you miss that small window, it is incredibly difficult to get back on track to a real career and you have to settle for fast food, Walmart, or warehouse. Some completely forgo white collar and go into trades to fix their mistake. We completely wasted our time and education when we could have been better off just going straight to work. It's maddening.

I misheard and instead of my mom referring to herself as a housewife, she actually said *""sheltered houserat trapped at home.""*

My mom revealed that since she has about 6-7 years left until she can retire, she is hoping that if I can start saving and get a ""halfway"" decent job then the two of us can get our own house. She admitted that she feels like she's reaching her breaking point and can't stand to be around my NDad's controlling behavior, feeling like he's watching her to keep her from doing anything he doesn't like.

Another pattern I've noticed from when I was a child was that if my mom would have a day off from work, my NDad would suddenly decide to take off as well so they would both be home. My mom is now convinced that he would do this on purpose to keep an eye on her, and if she'd leave the house, he'd throw a fit.

She went ahead and attended the wake, and for the majority of today, she and my NDad didn't really talk to each other unless it was necessary. This month will mark 3 years since my sister's passing and I told my mom to go ahead and travel for her birthday so she can take a breather. She doesn't want to leave me alone with him and my brothers but now that I have my car back and my internship starting the following week, I'll be sure to stay out of the house to avoid him as much as I can."
9drmek,1,2018-09-07,Captain Marvel Full Plot Prediction,MoMoXp,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/9drmek/captain_marvel_full_plot_prediction/,"As I did with Avengers: Infinity War, I will be attempting to predict the plot of Captain Marvel. This is very early on and rough as I am only basing this on the synopsis and the new pictures released. So yeah... without further ado here’s my full plot prediction for Captain Marvel. There may be spoilers so be warned.

The film starts out with Carol Danvers as the second-in-command of an elite Kree team called Starforce. She and her team that consists of Mar-Vell (the team leader and Carol’s mentor), Korath, Minn-Erva, and two others go on missions throughout the galaxy to stop crime and threats to the Kree Empire. They wear aqua green uniforms and take orders from Ronan the Accuser as he is the one that established them.

It is explained that Carol used to be a fighter pilot with her best friend Maria Rambeau. One of her commanders was a man named Walter Lawson (Mar-Vell in disguise) and when an explosion happened on an aircraft carrier Mar-Vell’s powers transferred to Carol and she became a human-Kree hybrid. At first she was confused but soon Mar-Vell revealed himself to her and explained what happened. He then takes her with him to the Kree home world. He trains her in the ways of her powers and soon she becomes a master of her ways. She even gets added to Mar-Vell’s Starforce as a second-in-command.

Back in present day Mar-Vell still mentors her and trains her. One day the team gets a call from the Kree Empire that they believe something has infiltrated the Kree. The Starforce arrives and meets with Ronan the Accuser. He explains that there may be a Skrull invasion on the forefront. Suddenly an ambush happens and the Skrulls attack. In the resulting ambush all of Starforce is killed except Carol, Mar-Vell, and Korath. However a Skull sneaks behind Mar-Vell and slits his throat, killing him. Now with only two members left and the Kree at war the Starforce is disbanded. Carol is relieved of duty and Korath joins Ronan as his bodyguard.

Back on Earth an invasion soon begins. The Skrulls arrive to meet their leader Talos who has been disguised as a high ranking member of S.H.I.E.L.D. The Skrulls hide on Earth to prepare for a full scale war on the Kree Empire. There on Earth they hide without being noticed. While Talos is in his human form he mentors a young Nick Fury and his intern Phil Coulson. Nick and Phil have no idea of Talos’ true intentions and who he really is. Later on Earth a Kree spy notices a Skrull and a fight ensues, getting the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. The agency then starts a full investigation on the subject.

The Kree reports back to Ronan and tells him of the Skrull invasion and how they are there for Talos. Ronan then says that he is going to destroy Earth so the Kree there die. However Carol gets word of this and tries to stop Ronan. She says that she can go to Earth and stop the Skrulls. Ronan allows this but says she only has one week before the Kree Empire decimates Earth. So Carol suits up in her aqua green outfit and heads down to Earth in disguise. She decides to get back into the fold and meets up with Maria. The two reconnect but Carol doesn’t reveal her powers. 

One day while investigating Carol comes across some Skrulls. It turns out Nick Fury and Phil Coulson are also investigating the exact same Skrulls so the two meet up with Carol in the ensuing fight. Carol gets her hands on one of the Skrulls but he dies before he can reveal any info. Nick and Phil are fascinated by Carol’s powers but Carol forces them to stay quiet and not tell anyone. She tells them her mission and who she is and the agents understand. The two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents bring Carol back to their base and hire her on as an agent. The three then work together for awhile solving mysteries involving the Skrulls with Carol keeping her powers a secret from the public.

Carol however keeps getting visions of Mar-Vell and how she is something of great importance. After a few days Carol comes to the conclusion that a S.H.I.E.L.D. is Talos so she ends up attacking the wrong person and causing major destruction to the base. She also blows her cover and in the chaos a real Skrull attack happens on S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Skrulls get away. Carol then leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. and goes into hiding knowing that there’s only one day left before Ronan destroys Earth. Back on the Kree homeworld Ronan prepares his ships for a full bombardment of Earth. They then begin to fly towards Earth.

However Carol soon gets one last vision from Mar-Vell revealing that she isn’t just a powerful woman but also the next in line for the mantle of Captain Marvel. He tells Carol it’s not to late to save Earth and stop Talos so Carol gets her new red and blue jumpsuit and adopts the role of Captain Marvel. She meets back up with Nick Fury and she tells him that she knows someone in S.H.I.E.L.D. is Talos and that she needs just one more shot. Nick agrees and takes her back. The two enter the base and try to find out who Talos is. Fury’s mentor agrees to help them. A radar begins to sound and the group finds out that five massive starships have arrived outside the Earth’s atmosphere. This is the Kree Empire. Suddenly it is revealed that Fury’s mentor is Talos and he slashes out Nick’s left eye. A great fight ensues and all of a sudden S.H.I.E.L.D. agents all over the base begin to transform into Skrulls. The whole base turns into chaos until eventually the fight is just between Talos and Carol. Talos is bearing her bad when Carol then gets one last vision from Mar-Vell to be stronger than he was. Carol then musters up all of her strength and kills Talos. The rest of the Skrulls soon follow.

With Talos killed and the Skrulls defeated the Kree leave Earth be and Carol leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. for space. She says goodbye to Nick who now has an eyepatch and has been promoted and also says goodbye to Phil who has been promoted to agent. Carol then tells Nick that if he ever needs her, to send her a message on this device. She hands him a small beacon device for him to carry. After this Carol, now Captain Marvel leaves for Earth and continues to be a protector for all in need across the galaxy.

In an after-credits scene Carol gets a distress signal from Nick Fury in 2018 and prepares to leave for Earth.

So yeah that’s my prediction. It’s very rough and early and will change a lot but this is just what I have now. I think I covered everything mentioned in the synopsis though.

“Set in the 1990s, Captain Marvel follows Carol Danvers, a former U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, as she turns into one of the galaxy's mightiest heroes and joins Starforce, an elite Kree military team, before returning home with new questions about her past and identity when the Earth is caught in the center of an intergalactic conflict between two alien worlds.”

I’m still trying to figure out what happens with Photon and how to make Talos a better villain, but overall I think I got it mostly down. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Let me know what you think.

Also Yon-Rogg could also take the role of Ronan in this film it’s interchangeable. Either way would be fine."
9drqgv,1,2018-09-07,How Do I Allocate My Assets?,FinancialThrowaway95,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9drqgv/how_do_i_allocate_my_assets/,"I am a single 22 year-old college student graduating in ~1 year with a computer engineering degree.

I am expecting a job offer from a prior internship that will be to be ~60-70K pre-tax yearly income in a low cost of living area.  I would say that the likelihood of getting the job are practically guaranteed as they loved the work I had done with them in my prior internships and verbally stated they would want to hire me should I want to pursue a career with them.

I currently have no debt, and I hold ~50K in assets:  ~12K in a Roth IRA (income from two years of past internships), ~14K in a non-tax-advantaged mutual fund (intended for personal retirement savings), and 22K in a high-yield savings account (1.85% APY).

I also own a reliable car as means of transportation, a necessity as the location I will likely be moving to is more rural and does not have public transportation.

I have looked at this sub's investment flowchart, and I have tried to follow it as best I can.  The 22K in savings can act as my emergency fund (roughly 3-4 months of my gross expected income after graduation) as well as to cover whatever costs I have as I settle into the area where this job will be.  I've had put as much of my income into a Roth IRA as I could, since the internships didn't offer any chance at investing in a 401k or other tax-advantaged account, and put a decent amount into a standard internationally diversified mutual fund (60-40 split between US stocks/bonds and foreign stocks/bonds, with a 90-to-10 ratio of stocks to bonds).

I've already made a basic budget to estimate future expenses based on my past expenses.  This was a little hard to do as some of the expenses (namely rent and utilities) are ones I've never had to allocate any money towards before, as I had lived with my family or on-campus prior to this.

However, concerning the future:

* My hopefully soon-to-be-employer offers a 100% match into a 401K up to 4% of my salary that I'm planning on taking full advantage of.
* I'm planning on renting short-term (which is about ~$450-600 per month where I will be moving to, depending on size and location) and looking into home ownership should I decide to stay with the company long-term (more than 1-2 years)
* I'm planning on living as reasonably as possible (staying within/below my means), and I anticipate that I can comfortably save at least 20-25% of my gross income between the Roth IRA, 401K matching, my personal retirement account, and expanding my emergency fund and short-term savings.  This is mostly due to the relatively low cost of living area I'd be moving to in the event that I was hired on full time after graduation.  This should allow me to properly save for future short-term expenses (replacing my car when it becomes cost-inefficient to maintain, putting a down payment on a house, etc.) as well as retirement.

The one thing that is bugging me is how little, relatively speaking, of my current assets I have invested.  I know that everyone says that time in the market is the most influential factor in determining future growth in the stock market, so my gut is telling me that I should divert more of my money that is currently just sitting around in a savings account into a diversified mutual fund.  I currently have no immediate need for the 22K (other than acting as a safety net).

Would it be wise, given my general circumstances, to reduce the size of my emergency fund to invest more heavily in a mutual fund, or am I getting too far ahead of myself?  I recognize the importance of having some money set aside, it just seems like a waste to have so much (~45%) of my current total assets tied to my emergency fund.

In addition, are there any other opportunities or risks/dangers that I haven't yet utilized or considered that could be available to me?  I'm pretty inexperienced with all this, and would love some other pairs of eyes looking at my general plan.


Thank you!"

9drzn5,4,2018-09-07,a frustrating conclusion and an optimistic update,kinkyquark,grad_school,https://www.reddit.com/r/grad_school/comments/9drzn5/a_frustrating_conclusion_and_an_optimistic_update/,"TLDR: I’m free of my toxic PI. I made my mistakes, I waited too long to take-action, and not everything is perfect. But I survived!

So, my last few posts here didn't get a lot of attention but what did pop up was all good advice and helped quite a bit. I'm mostly writing this for myself, but I welcome any advice on what I can do as I go forward. I made my own mistakes and I’m working hard to fix the behaviors that got me here in the first place.

I ended up leaving my lab and I'm officially on a Leave of Absence. The Spring semester got bad enough that I ended up withdrawing from the two undergraduate courses I was taking. It was frustrating because I feel that, if I'd been allowed the time to work on them, I would have passed them comfortably, but I didn't have the time and I had research to do as well as needing to look for other PI's and better support. I did start documenting every single interaction I had with My PI and while things were didn't get better the amount that they could get worse was minimal. He continued to harass me over email and threaten/berate me in private. 

I brought this forth to the dean of the college and the way things went down weren't exactly satisfactory to me, but I can see the line of diplomacy she was walking.

The story has a little bit of overlap, There was a period of three weeks that cemented my decisions. I was speaking to other professor in the ChemE department as well as outside in other departments. I wasn't committed to giving up on the major yet because I was doing passably in the classes.

I was given the directive to train the undergraduate student and do my research and I had a combination of troubleshooting and having hard time getting the students to come in at the times they said they were available. I ran into some very weird troubleshooting issues with some transformations which took up a great deal of my time. I logged everything I did every day in a notebook. I was running on fumes, but I was making some progress.

the last week of this three-week period my PI found me in the lab as he was going home. I was in the biosafety hood and completely alone. He approached me and asked what I was doing, and I explained that I’d finally gotten some troublesome colonies to work. He made throat clearing noises and waited around behind my back while I finished up. He waited until I was out of the hood. (nearly 15 minutes) and stopped me as I was getting a new batch of samples to repeat the process. He told me then that I had clearly not been very productive recently and that my ""normal 10-15% output had gone down to zero."" I asked him if there was anything else and went back to work with the hope that I might go home before 7 tonight. He went away, not thrilled with my response, and the next day during our lab meeting, as I brought up my PowerPoint with pictures of my results, he interrupted me as I started, to ask a question about what I had done (which was part of the presentation.) and as I started speaking on the first slide multiple times to ask questions about whether I had done this or that part. I went to the slides and showed him the date at the top of the slide for each one and tried to start off from there. He then told me that I should have been able to do this in a few days. I explained that I'd run into an issue with colony growth and went back to the slides showing the various troubleshooting things I had done, but he ignored that and said it was unacceptable that it took me so long to do this. 

I kept trying to repeat what I had done, but he interrupted several more times before finally yelling at me and saying that this was only two days’ worth of results and it was unacceptable. he then stared at me waiting for me to respond so I finally said ""okay. do you want to see the rest of this?"" because at this point I haven't really been able to detail any of the troubleshooting or the problems I ran into. He said no, and we put our Master’s students slide in, but the rest of the group was clearly a little put off that he had yelled at me and I hadn’t really presented anything.
I was approached by our new Post-Doc after that with reassurances that he had seen me in the lab and not to take too seriously the PI’s anger. I also noticed a concerted effort in the next few weeks by our Master’s student to credit me for things. Something that I hadn’t really noticed as malevolent before came to my attention. My PI almost always thanked our Master student for any kind of positive action or decision in the lab even when it was on my advice or if I had suggested it in a group meeting. So, having the Master’s student say, “oh that was quark’s idea.” Really seemed to deflate my PI in a weird way. (I hadn’t really confided my issues with the Master’s student at this point because there was some obvious favoritism going on and I didn’t want to risk anything getting back to him. So, it really helped me to hear some verbal support from someone who didn’t really have a stake in the matter or possibly even an idea of  what was happening.)

This meeting really finalized for me that I couldn’t stay at all. Whether or not I had support for the following year I wasn’t going to risk dealing with him anymore.

I went to the Dean again and she asked me why things hadn’t gotten better and why, if I was going to leave now, I had stated that I would stay back in October when I first brought his behavior to their attention. Honestly, at the time, I didn’t have a good answer. I said something about not wanting to jump to conclusions at the time and how I had thought it was a miscommunication problem. Now of course I know the real answer is that I felt like I was at fault. Like I was being too sensitive and that, if I didn’t stick it out I would be a troublemaker and I didn’t want to hurt his career.

We established a time to have the graduate student advocate come in and be a witness to one of our meeting to assess, and of course he was completely normal and reasonable seeming. He didn’t want to give me feedback about the project or answer technical questions at this meeting though and kept pushing for me to meet with him one-on-one the next day. He kept saying we would talk about this detail or he would answer that question tomorrow so finally I spoke up and said, “I’ll be honest, I don’t want to meet with you alone anymore.” That clearly shocked him, and I can see how that statement can be interpreted as worse than it was, but I just didn’t care anymore. He was visibly vacillating between being furious and horrified since I had said that in front of someone who would relay that to the dean. We ended our meeting without much being said, a few specific tasks that I needed to do for the week, and a huge weight off my shoulders.

 He was visibly furious about this but didn't lose his cool in front of the graduate school student advocate or any of the third parties present for the remaining 5 or so weeks. We met once a week with a mediator in attendance and though he awkwardly was forced to interact with me since I had been managing most of the lab inventory and materials ordering he mostly left me alone. He didn’t ask me for updates on my project until the end and I did my job and made it to the next milestone of the project by the end of the semester.

His remarks about my normal output going down to zero was what really convinced me I needed to drop the undergraduate classes. I couldn’t keep up with the furious rate I was working and find funding for the fall. I also realized that I really wasn’t going to get much more help from the Dean and that adding stress to pass classes I didn’t necessarily need for a program I might not be a part of next year wasn’t worth the pain. I still wish I had stayed in one of them, because I believe I could have completed it effectively as I kept attending lectures for both of them but that’s one of those hindsight kinds of things. 

I did use this new time to make some connections in the Biochem department and became convinced I should move back into Biochemistry. The support and immediate kindness I received from the professors I spoke to as well as the intense overlap with other departments made me realize that the ChemE department was a little shut off from the rest of the university. None of the other engineering departments had this lack of overlap with the other sciences.

I also was accepted into a paid Internship for the summer and unfortunately missed the deadlines to get into the Biochem program for this fall. So now, my internship is over and I’m back to square one. I’m moving back to my parents place this weekend and looking for work for the next year at least. I thought I had been accepted for a job but just got an email saying they had decided to eliminate the position and would keep me on file for other opportunities.

I’m still having the odd panic attack here and there so it’s probably best that I’m not going back to school until next year (hopefully) but the internship really helped me in getting some of my confidence in my work back. I’m terrified of being unemployed again and I hate having these gaps in employment. It doesn’t help that my parents aren’t in a great financial spot so, if nothing pops up soon I’m heading to Walmart.

I did hear some updates after I left at the end of the semester. I heard he had been saying some very horrible things about me to a few of the other ChemE professor and may have been doing so all along. That part wasn’t surprising. The more interesting news was that he had gotten into trouble around the end of the semester (around the time he started avoiding me) because several of the undergraduate females in his class had complained that he had been temperamental with them, refused to answer question, and had said some inappropriate things. I don’t know more detail beyond that because I have very few connections left. I do know that he was reprimanded, but it seems that the department took about the same level of action against him for that as they did for my complaints. I can’t say I’m happy to hear that and I don’t think it bodes well for the future well-being of his students.

I also haven’t heard from the other Master’s student who had been considering joining his lab to start her PhD. She had reached out to me mid-semester with the same complaints I had had. He had been harassing her via different phone numbers to get her to commit to his lab while refusing to correspond over email, expected her to meet with him at times she was busy, had asked her very personal questions, refused to show up to meetings on time and then insisted on doing other things before the meeting started, said some very unprofessional things about her life-choices and family planning, and had interrupted her multiple times during two different presentations then refused to hear the rest of them. I hope she ran far far away from him, but I know she was growing desperate for a lab to work in.

In conclusion, things aren’t perfect for me right now, but they’re better than they were. I don’t want to be unemployed again, and I hate having to wait even longer to start graduate school, but I do believe I’m better prepared for it this time and I’m learning more and more to take my own questions more seriously when it comes to whether I’m being overly sensitive.

Anyway, if you took the time to read this thank you. This has been cathartic for me. Right now, I’m free to go anywhere so I’m looking for work across the country. I just want another chance to move forward. If you know of any good job opportunities in protein engineering, feel free to send me a link.

I'm also happy to chat with you about making a scenario that isn't any of these ones or is based off them. I expect this to be long term as well:

1. I've been your boss for many years, maybe you were my intern who we then hired full time, perhaps you're my secretary who has been with me through my rise through the company. Regardless we decide to spend some time together out of work, having never done it before and find that connect on more levels than we expected.
2. This ones a bit odd, but bear with me. It's the near future and the laws regarding crime and punishment have changed. Now a person can take custody of a person who's committed a minor crime. You can be someone familiar to me who chooses to do this (we can discuss specifics) and you choose to use the limiting nature of the custody to exercise control over me and use me as you see fit.
3. We're both at a party hosted by a mutual friend, we have at various points had crushes on each other, tonight the stars seem to have aligned as we've both crashed out of our relationships and are now single at the same time.
4. You're my wealthy (Step) Mother and you've been taking care of me since my father died, I've come back from my first year of college and you've decided that you'd rather I not leave you and take steps to ensure that I stay with you. Even going as far as some extreme measures to ensure that no other woman will want me (We can talk about these)
5. You're my older (step) sister who is much more successful and accomplished than me and we decide to meet for a drink at your place, where you choose to gloat at how much more successful you've been than. Gradually grinding down my self-esteem and respect until you decide to take advantage of it for your own satisfaction.
6. You're my bratty spoiled younger (step) sister and you've found some dirt on me. You decide to use this to blackmail into doing your bidding, this can be sexual or non-sexual so long as it's demeaning to me and at the expense of my social life/reputation.
7. One of us is prisoner/guard (I'm fine playing either), the prisoner uses their charms, at first only to get small benefits, but then eventually wraps the guard around their will using their charisma and ability to seduce people. This could go in lots of directions, including an eventual escape/partners in crime type scenario.
8. You're my best friend, we've always had a latent attraction to each other throughout the time we grew up together. We told each other (almost) everything and feel incredibly close. We begin with you staying over at my house (or me at yours) just hanging out, knowing that our time together is running short as we'll be away for college soon (all characters 18+).
9. You're my former teacher who I've always had a crush on and we've had a chance encounter at a bar on a Friday night and have got to talking, after a few more drinks we've gone back to your place.

We can discuss Kinks/limits on Kik, I'm open to a lot of things and these scenarios are just guidelines, we can adapt/change them and create a scenario that suits both of us. Or you can send your own idea, I'm totally game to try something else provided you come with the idea. Kik is Axannar looking forward to hearing from you."

Much more than Teddy and the Ortho guy. The possibilities for his story is endless. I just really hope *Knock on wood that the writers won't fuck up with his character. I know he's not a series regular but I hope he'll be by the end of the season. So I'm now taking bets on who gets the most accurate guess on what his character is gonna be.

Is he gonna be an Intern? Maybe, maybe not. I hope he'll be the new hotshot attending or even a new resident that will work with Jo.

In a typical Grey's fashion, who’s gonna be his lover? I hope it'll be Koracick, he can also be with Deluca, imagine them in the screen together?

About his specialty. Best guess would be in peds or trauma cause that's the slot that's been recently vacated. Can we have him under Alex? I don't want him under Mer. 😂😂😂

So give me your wildest guess, and let's see if it all comes right. "

But anyways, here it goes. 


Me and this girl, let’s call her Jane, have been really good friends for the better part of three years now. We really hit it off in the beginning when she got into the university as me. 

Fast forward to about April of this year, I realized I was starting to develop feelings for her and it kinda scared me because I don’t want to risk our friendship. This was also around the time of my college finals before I graduated and got accepted for an internship, starting in July, at bank. When finally July came, and I was about to start my internship, we went out for a drink and she mentioned she would like me to take her out to diner somewhere fancy. At the time I didn’t make much of it and told her it would be somewhat hard for me because I have to get up really early in the morning. Fast forward to today, my internship is coming to an end, and for the past week she has been talking again about taking her out for diner in a fancy restaurant. 

My problem is, I don’t have really that much experience when it comes to dating and whatnot, and I’m having trouble deciphering if she is subtly asking for a date or if she just wants a fancy diner on my dime. 

What should I do?"

Unfortunately, he's very shy and awkward, so I don't really know how to ask him out. I've talked to some of the other guys who have worked with him longer and I've learned that he does actually like me and that he's probably never had a girlfriend. He's a really hard worker who's only hobby seems to be work, but I do have other things in common with him. I just feel he would rather work than date. Harder for me still is that I've never had a boyfriend (I'm 21 and a late bloomer obviously), so I wouldn't know how to start this relationship in the slightest. The only ""flirting"" I know how to do is acting dumb and making fun of the person in a nice way (which he seems to respond well to).

I've tried dropping hints about the fact that I'm interested and have given him my number (which he has texted me), but I don't really see anything changing. I've sorta asked him out by asking him to get ice cream with me, but he turned me down. He doesn't like to drink, so I can't really ask him out for drinks. He's older than me, but only by 3 years and he lives a bit far (about an hour and a half) from me.

I just want some advice as to what to do about this as I'm finishing up my internship in about 2 weeks and I want to see if I should do something. I'm going to keep in touch with everyone anyway and will be coming back next year, so it's sort of just a long break of going back to school. So, should I ask out my shy, awkward coworker?"

9dusdn,24,2018-09-07,Agencies capitalizing on recent MSW grads,itszamber,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/9dusdn/agencies_capitalizing_on_recent_msw_grads/,"Good morning and happy Friday all!

I have some questions and am in need of advice with a subject centered around agencies capitalizing on recent MSW grads seeking their first paid master’s level position.

Just as some background, I’ve been working the behavioral health field for seven years now in a variety of settings with various populations This includes children and adolescents at an inpatient psych unit, those hospitalized for eating disorders, in the ER, in level 11/12/13 residential facilities with both children and teens, for the city working with individuals with any type of disabling condition ranging from Pica to paraplegics, autism, addiction and more. Most recently, at internship, I was providing direct practice with individual children and their families, including diagnosing and assessing. Last, but not least, I’ve worked with those experiencing homelessness: group facilitation, case management, assessing and more.

I guess, in short, what I’m trying to say is that I’m no newbie here.

To add, due to the county of behavioral health paying for my last year of grad school, I’m required to work for a year for the county or a county-contracted agency. 

Here’s my dilemma:

My experience with the jobs I’ve come into contact with is that, while they love me as a candidate, many do not fully disclose up front the less desirable duties of the position.

The posted job description seems fine and dandy: Monday through Friday, clinical work, etc.  However, what isn’t disclosed sometimes are real deal-breakers for me (not to sound picky but I know my limits —and I don’t have a ton of limits). 

This results in a waste of both their and my time since it isn’t disclosed until either the end of the interview, when everything else has gone well, or more recently until I’m one month into my position.

This is jarring to me because I have a time limit to be employed by, or else I have to pay back my county stipend —also needless to say it’s jarring as well because I’m not financially well-off and need to generate an income ASAP. 

I know all about asking questions in interviews; however, these job descriptions don’t sound like there are overnight requirements and I also would think that the agency would be fair enough to disclose during the interview if not on the job posting.

For example, in one interview at the very end they piled on all of the less than desirable details such as supervising interns and working overnight if an overnight staff calls out.

Overnight seems to be a huge detail that many of the jobs try to sneak in last minute. At least with this job I found out during the interview and was able to turn it down.

This is my one HUGE dealbreaker: overnights. I know myself. I’m NOT a night person at all. You wanna call me in at 4 a.m.? SURE! But I have no chance of staying up overnight, I know because I’ve tried before.

Unfortunately the next job didn’t tell me until present day, one month into employment when I thought I could finally have some stability. 

The way it was brought about felt icky to me. They basically squeezed it in the middle of a discussion during our meeting and were so vague that my spidey-senses told me to circle back around and clarify.

I’m passive, and was wanting a way to express how I think this isn’t suitable and did that in the form of circular questioning. I wondered how that would work out if my main job role requires me to assess Monday through Friday during the day time. I’m salaried so I know overtime can be called for; however, I don’t think it’s ethical to have someone work an overnight shift and then bounce back to a day shift the next/same day.

Their response to my questioning was that they’re still figuring that part out, which gave some relief, but it seemed like maybe they were testing the waters to my willingness. Upon inquiring with other employees, they said the sup tried to do the same to them but they refused (they have all been there for a while now). They also told me the sup doesn’t deal with push back well, which only added to my anxiety because I want to have good relationships in my profession.

Much to my (temporary) relief, in the next staff meeting the sup mentioned needing to apply for a grant for overnight staff. 

I thought that was taken care of; however, yesterday she told our intern in front of me that I’m in charge of the overnight shelter. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, I thought maybe I’d be admitting people during the day.... or maybe they meant I’d be working overnight. 

Anyhow, none of how it was gone about felt respectful (by telling someone else in my presence about something I was committed to that I had no clue about). 

I decided to ask if we had time to talk about it more in detail and the sup said not now (it was our end of day meeting, and they previously mentioned scheduling some one-one-one time for me that same day).

Ever since I’ve had A LOT of anxiety, I slept bad last night and dreamed about it too. 

What is your advice? Something about this feels bad to me, and I’m trying not to shame myself into feeling ungrateful/picky about my job. 

How can I speak up for myself without ruining our relationship?

Is this occurrence common?  "

I didn't have any experience with Power Bi or BI itself, only with Postgres.

My work includes creating queries looking at a postgres database and create charts and dashboards with BI. I have a supervisor but he is really absent, and I'm the only intern in the company BI area.

I'm having a really hard time trying to create the queries, finding the correct columns in the database and translating all that to Power BI. Sometimes I think I have the perfect query but when I send it to PowerBI it looks like I don't have one columns in there or something. It is becoming frustrating.

I don't want to lose this internship because of my supervisor, and I know I can complain about him to his superiors but this will end up just making them fire me instead I guess. So I want to learn by my own. Do you guys have any tips? ANYTHING will already be helpful.

I posted a similar question yesterday but it didn't really capture the issue I was trying to get a response to, and it wouldn't let me change the headline so:

**My OPT is up in January, H1B applications don't get send in April, so I am missing the cap gap and am out of status and could not work (for a company I have an interview with next week) from January to October, making the whole scenario even worse, besides only being able to work for them four months because there is no option for them to sponsor me or realistically have me. Is that correct?**

I am not sure when to mention this, as I don't want to mention my visa troubles too early, but also don't want to waste their time/burn bridges if I don't tell them until they make me an offer?

I am super passionate about this company and job and would love nothing more than getting the chance to work for them. I am willing to do an internship if that is more realistic for the remaining time frame if there really are no options, but I don't want to bring this up too quickly in case they do consider me for a full time role.

Help!

Ps: I am from Germany and the company is a small start-up.

Thanks so  much.

However, the rules say that you can’t work on anything thats NOT your major and you have 3 months to find a job. Am by my second one. Finding a job here is so FUCKING HARD when a bunch of regulations are imposed on you. I can’t work under the table because I may violate my visa if I do that. I need money but nothing is working for me to get a job. I have changed my resume countless times and nothing happens. My last resort is references and some of them are helping me get there.

Am so tired of doing nothing in my house other than applying to jobs, cooking, smoking weed and exercising in a gym that does not let me in anymore because am an alumni (can’t use it anymore because am don’t go to that school anymore). They only allow me to stop these days (if i reach 3 months of unemployment i have to leave the country) by volunteering or working unpaid internships if I dont get a job. I can’t do that, i don’t eat on goodwill. I am also 22 years old, im not asking my parents for money.

It is so frustrating this fucking permit and not getting a job. The worst thing is that I am trying my best. We drop a shit ton of money in this country and after that they drop these laws on us as if we just got out of jail lol"

9dx2yd,161,2018-09-07,Russian Consulate Kevin,Phtpnk,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/9dx2yd/russian_consulate_kevin/,"Apologies for such a long story, but it's worth it. There is a small TL;DR at the bottom.

To clarify, my best friend is majoring in diplomacy. Since she is part Russian (but her citizenship is in a country I won't name, for privacy reasons). She had an internship in our country's Russian consulate and finished it recently, but had a displeasure working with a real jackass of a Kevin, which, for humor purposes, will call Kevinov.

To jump right at his realms of stupidity. His first major mistake was with a PowerPoint presentation. He had all the papers, all the guidelines, he literally just had to transfer all the contents of the papers he was given in PowerPoint form. I mean, simple, right? A basic office grunt could do it. But, then again, he is Kevinov for a reason.

First thing, he skimmed and neglected to write 50% of the contents. The slides were mismatched, looked sluggish, and he was waaaaay out of his timeframe to do it (and they were lenient on him, considering that it would take maybe 30 minutes, because they literally arranged all slide contents, the number of slides, EVERYTHING for him). When questioned, Kevinov, in his Kevinovous glory, simply said: ""Wasn't me"".

He also frequently has gotten lost in the building, and couldn't even deliver simple forms to other offices without having to call for help, and it would take a while to retrieve him and whatever files he was carrying. He would also frequently play games during his shift, and when asked what he was doing, he'd simply reply that he's working. Kevinov would also try to act all business-like and busy by just roaming the building aimlessly with a coffee cup in his hand. When, at one point, he once approached my friend, who was carrying a memo, Kevinov immediately said: ""Oh, I've read that memo, boss sent me a copy yesterday"". Except, the memo contained sensitive data, and it was prohibited from being copied, and my friend held the only copy of the memo, for which Kevinov also lacked the security clearance to examine. Important thing to note here, my friend was also his boss; he held the lowest rank in the building, akin to a pencil sharpener guy.

However, let us leave these small Kevinish occurences and move on to The Incident, the one that got him fired and gave my friend nightmares akin to Battle of Stalingrad.

**THE INCIDENT** : There was an upcoming large conference between several European countries, including Russia. My friend, along with several other interns, had duties which included this conference. They had to create a *huuuuge* memo for the event, totalling 400 pages, which included scripts for major ambassadors, seating plans, you name it. It was a shitshow, with paperwork bureaucracy rivaling the movie *Brazil.*

Anyways, my friend was in her office, and her boss called, asking her to send the full memo to his office, so he could sign the memo and have its contents delivered to the ambassadors. She was too busy to send it upstairs, so she had to send someone else. Since all interns were busy, she had no choice but to send Kevinov. Even though his stupidity preceded him, the boss was sure not even he could screw this up. However, this wouldn't be The Incident without Kevinov's glorious fail, right?

The boss had to check up on others, so he went away. Kevinov *literally* only had to enter the bosses office, and drop the memo on his desk.

Two hours later, the boss calls my friend and asks where the papers are. Puzzled, my friend went to Kevinov, and it went like this:

Friend: Kevinov, where are the papers?

Kevinov: I put them on a shelf.

Friend: Which shelf?

Kevinov: The red shelf, of course!

My friend, in a fraction of a millisecond, descended into a level of fury rivaling Kratos' when he ascended the Olympus to slaughter the Gods, while the other interns who overheard the conversation, all simultaneously made a split-second ""deer on headlights"" look and SPRINTED into the bosses office at speeds which would make the Lockheed SR-71 look like an old grandma with a cane.

You see, due to security reasons, the memo couldn't be duplicated nor saved on any digital storage. And the red shelf? It was for all documents that were due to be *sent into the shredder*.

Despite my friend and the other interns practically rushing into Warp 10 to the office, the entire memo was already shredded, save for maybe a few pages. It was a 400-page memo. The conference was tomorrow. She and all the interns had to assemble the memo back, with hairpins, in the most tedious, nerve-wracking puzzle game that ever existed. They even had to stay overnight in the consulate (they had clearance to be present in the building during off-hours), to assemble the fucking memo.

Next day, when the boss summoned Kevinov into his office about the shredded papers, Kevinov simply said: ""I don't know how it got up here."" Unfortunately for poor old Kevinov, the security camera clearly showed Kevinov placing the memo on the shelf. The boss, a Russian, 6""5', bearded, bald golem of a man, wasn't happy. (To preface, Kevinov was a blonde, skinny, lanky 5""8'). 

Kevinov was fired ""the Russian way."" The Russian way includes creating a seismic earthquake with a fury that made everyone in the building lose several shades of pigments and instantly fill their pants with whatever content they ingested that day. The golem was overheard by the entire bullding, including quite a few people on the outside. Apparently, the golem's distinctive description of Kevinov included having ""never imagining of meeting such a catastrophically idiotic person in his entire life"" and that ""even the fucking chirping birds on a fucking tree are aware that his ass is fired"". 

Apparently, Kevinov exited the office, whiter than Russian tundra, quietly chipping how ""his parents will kill him"". My friend didn't give an accurate description of the boss' rage look, but he looked angry enough to be radiating enough to turn the building into a New Chernobyl.

**TL;DR: How to potentially sabotage an international conference within mere seconds, also known as The Second Coming of Stalin.**"

It was a hot summer Wednesday in the busy city of New York. The sun was beating down and it was lunch time. A corner store diner was working hard. This diner was known for it’s great American style menu. Cash Only dining these days usually doesn’t survive, but they were thriving. On this day though, the kitchen was hard at work. The owner was a 5’10 Italian man named Gio. Gio yelled out, “Carol! Get the backup stock for that camera crew, that fatty is cleaning us out!” Carol barked back, “How can one man eat so much?” The waitress, Sienna, walked over to the table. “Do you need anything else?” The customer responded with a full mouth, hard to understand “This isn’t shredded lettuce.” The waitress looked at the disgusting thing of a human wearing a New York Rangers jersey, “We don’t carry shredded lettuce.” The thing, known by his internet persona ‘Glenny Balls’ yelled back “Two point Three balls.” A piece of burger flew out of his mouth and hit Sienna in the face. She stayed professional and walked back to the kitchen, where she gagged while wiping the burger off her face. When Glenny Balls got up to leave, paid and tipped well, he walked out of the door. He was insanely moist and his sweat left a puddle on the ground. The camera crew was make shift today. When Mr. Balls was ready to go, the only one who knew how to work a camera was Caleb. 

Caleb was making fun of Glenny the whole way back to the office. The wet trail her was leaving looked like that of a snail’s trail. When they got to the office, Caleb hit the button for the floor below the content floor. It was empty and all the interns had left. Caleb used his strength to push Glenny onto a table. Glenny leaned up to kiss Caleb. Caleb turned away “No bro, don’t kiss me. That’s gay.” Glenny nodded and the his chins shook like a bowl of Jell-O. Caleb took his shirt off than helped Glenny get his off since Glenny couldn’t put his arms higher than the crown of his head. Glenny was drenched in sweat and Caleb couldn’t help but put his hands all over Glenny’s stomach. Caleb proceeded to take his pants off. His Raging boner could be seen trying to break through his MeUndies men’s boxer briefs(Promo code: Take). Glenny was so excited that he started to breathe heavy enough that it could be heard by anybody if they opened up the door to the elevator. Caleb was obsessed with Glenny’s body. He managed to waste 20 minutes rubbing every inch of Glenny’s sweaty stomach. He finally pulled Glenny’s shorts down. Glenny neglected to wear underwear that day. His penis was nowhere to be found either. It was hidden somewhere in Glenny’s FUPA. Caleb liked that “I’m not gay bro, this is perfect. Now put two of your rolls together.” Glenny was confused by what he meant. “Like this?” 

Caleb looked at him, dumbfounded, “Oh my fucking shit, all you’re doing is grabbing both of your titties you fat bitch.” Glenny chuckled, and the body shake from his laugh looked like he was driving over rumble strips on a highway in a golf cart. Caleb then grabbed two rolls of Glenny’s and pushed them together. He then took his boner out and thrusted it into the rolls of Glenny Balls. “Your sweat is good lubricant, Glenny” Glenny didn’t hear it. He was too busy trying to reach his FUPA. He couldn’t reach it. Caleb suddenly stopped. He bent down and grabbed a can out of his Pocket. “What is that?” Glenny asked. Caleb Responded “I got some burger grease for you!” Caleb poured burger grease from the diner all over Glenny’s stomach and on his chest. Some even splashed on his chin. Glenny got excited. 

For a second, you could even see the tip of his penis through his FUPA. But soon the blood rushed back to trying support his heart and his prematurely dying body that he created from an early case of diabetes.  The Burger grease made the room smell like burger. Added to the smell of fat people, the room officially stunk. Caleb kept pounding away at Glenny’s stomach crease. Caleb felt himself coming to completion. He told Glenny to suck it. Glenny was hesitant. He looked at Caleb, “Isn’t that gay though” Caleb responded “No Glenny, it’s a bro job. Plus, we’ll pretend like it’s Saturday and Saturdays are for the boys.” Glenny started sucking away at Caleb’s dick. Calebs yelped in excitement “That’s right Glenny, Two point zero balls for you, you magically mouthed behemoth.” Glenny chuckled again. His whole body moved. Caleb was upset by this. “Yo Glenny, quit fucking moving I got to finish.” Caleb grabbed a bag from the back pocket of his jeans and let Glenny continue to finish him off. Glenny did his work with his mouth and then laid there on the table looking like Jabba the hut. He had his mouth open ready to catch Caleb’s load. Caleb jerked it and as he about to cum, he threw a bunch of shredded lettuce from the bag in his jeans in Glenny’s face. There was no evidence of semen anymore, just a pile of shredded lettuce all over Glenny’s face. Glenny smiled and thanked Caleb. “I’m just happy you have the shredded lettuce.”"

My anger and jealously practically rolling off my body. I want to be her. I want to be the one on your arm. The one who gets to be openly affectionate. 

I finish off my glass of champagne and sit it down dramatically on the table. I’ve lost count on how many glasses that makes now but I’m definitely a little drunk. I let out a slight huff and I look up to see you give me a *cut it out* look. 

It all stared several years ago when I started out as an intern for your company and worked my way up. Now I’m the VP of Marketing and I’ve single handedly double your profits over the last two years. Helping you rebuild your company. Being the person that was able to put your vision to work. 

Naturally, we’ve spent a lot of time together. Our chemistry undeniable. Like magnets until we finally gave in 4 months ago. Since then we’ve spent a lot of late nights in the office with me bent over your desk, blowing you in the parking garage, and sneaking to my apartment for long lunches. We can’t get enough of one another and I want you so badly right now. 

Tonight is huge for the company. A big investor dinner for our clients. Your wife had insisted on coming and you only told me right before. I’m pissed but I still only want you. Our time together is rushed and secret but our chemistry is real. I think tonight I’m finally realizing that I want more than sex. 

I huff again and get up from the table. I’m being unprofessional and I know it. I practically stomp over to the bar and get a refill. "
9dyd0i,12,2018-09-07,"Lady's and Gents, I present to you: My ideal Five Night's at Treasure Island (to end all treasure islands) (Part 1)",Springtrapattacks,fivenightsatfreddys,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/9dyd0i/ladys_and_gents_i_present_to_you_my_ideal_five/,"**The Following statement is based on the Creepypasta Trilogy, as well as the majority of the Story presented in the following (ABD, Room Zero, A Few Suggestions, Corruptus)**: 











[The Corruptus theory essentially boils down to this: If enough people as a collective believe in an idea or concept, it will become real, defying space and time in their conception. 










A horrifying example being the incidents that caused Mowgli's Palace to shut down. Multiple mascot costumes began to become “alive” as apart of an anomaly caused by the global amount of young children believing that Mickey and his other characters were real when seeing mascot suits. This unfortunately caused the death of multiple employee’s wearing the costumes, as the suit’s “flesh” began forming and assimilated their bodies. Due to the presence of human corpses being inside the suits and the corruption of though caused by negative feelings associated with the characters, many of them turn out distorted, failed, or inverted. 







Another example being more indirect was the conception of fears and urban legends. Myths about silhouette’s of Gas-Mask wearing people (Gascots) began circulating around the theme parks and attractions. So much so that it created hallucinogenic entities or “Thought-forms” out of reality, as being around them invokes fear and hysteria caused by the onset of the urban legends. Other fears that triggered an anomaly was the creation of an Aggressive Avian Species formed from the fear of dangerous wildlife roaming the parks, or Friendly John, a clear humanoid figure flowing with bacteria, created from the suspicion of a microorganism infestation.  Some anomalies aren’t linked to a concept or idea, but simply create ripples in reality, time, and space. These include misplaced objects or characters, technological disturbances, or area’s that can either cause lethal fatalities if not stable, to rooms that can teleport objects or people from existence and sometimes never bring them back. 





It is still unknown, despite all the research, why the anomaly exists so prominently in Disney Related Parks or Attractions and not anything else related to popular media. Many people involved in the secrecy of The Corruptus incidents believe Walt Disney may have had a hand in the arrival of these Anomalies in his idea’s to create a “Golden Calf” of sorts. A character for people to worship and idolize. Weather the effects were intended or how they even happened is still a mystery. 












-----------------------------------------------------------------------------











#**(Story/Gameplay)**: 










The game is divided into two main segments: Nights and Explorations. Nights are established taking place within current time, with the protagonist being Jake, the SSA(Supernatural Studies Association)'s newest intern. Explorations are playable video recordings filmed weeks prior from the POV of Greg and Lisa, the SSA's main members. The SSA had caught wind of the Author that wrote his findings on Disney and decided to investigate the numerous parks that where mentioned.









Night 1 begins with only Inverted (Photo Negative) Mickey and Oswald. Both of them, along with all the Disney characters, resemble *actual mascot suits* that are relatively accurate to the designs seen in Disney Parks around the year 1999. 





Greg and Lisa sent to set up camera's to film potential spooky ghosts and paranormal stuff. Unfortunately, the water has become too shallow to leave the shore, so help is on the way! Cons are is that you have 7 days before they can get here. Oh well, better hope you don't waste all those rations. 





Who knows? You might even *find what you've came here for.* 










*Cameras -*





Used to monitor the suits as they move from room to room, until eventually reaching the office. 






In order to get them out of the office, use the [SPACE] button to shut off a camera, which will attract them with noise. There are also options to utilize the building's main wiring system which can turn on things like plumbing, lights, and TV screens. These noises aren't nearly as loud, but can be useful. 






It takes around 30 seconds for the cam to turn back on. The more cameras that are turned off the longer time it takes for them to re-activate. 






There are 10 Cameras in total (Staff Area, Meat Freezer, Character Prep 1, Storage Room, Bathroom, The Lounge, Broadcasting Room, The Roof, Character Prep 2) 








*Hiding -*






Serves as an alternative way of defending yourself against the suits. You crouch bineth the desk until the threat leaves the office.
Hiding under the desk may not always work, for your survival is based on RNG. There is a 50/50 chance the suit will find you and result in a game over. 







*Power -*









 
If enough cameras are disabled to the point where you cannot track the suits movement, shutting off the power is a last resort when it comes to surviving. 









The office will go completely dark, as all the camera’s will turn back on. The suits cannot be seen when entering the office. 













The power will eventually turn back on after 2 Minutes (1 and a half gameplay hours), although you can restart it manually, but it takes a few moments to work. 












You’ll need a different strategy when the office is dark. Luckily you have a flashlight to search the office for any figures at the doors. It only works somewhat well. 






Alternate versions of the suits called “Shades” will appear in the screen. They do not affect you and only exist to create atmosphere. 










-----------------------------------------------------------------------------














The 1st Exploration Tape takes place during Lisa and Greg's investigation at Treasure Island. The gameplay is point-and-click much like Sister Location, as you've got multiple objects to collect for evidence like trinkets and such. Every ""tape"" has a threat to avoid. That threat being An Aggressive Avian. A large nameless bird that is indeed a living breathing creature that resembles an overly exaggerated child's version of a ""big scary jungle bird"". Take the right steps and walk the right path and get out of there. 






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------









Night 2 is roughly the same. Only PNM and Oswald are more aggressive, while Disembodied Donald is now a problem. 






A fun fact to note: Inverted Mickey, Donald, and The Face are the only suits to contain corpses. The rest are empty, and are only given life by Collective Corrupted Thoughts. The rest? Well, you, Jake, a member of a paranormal team looking to defile Disney? You had grim expectations from the start. 





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------










The 2nd Tape Recording films a location closest to Mogwii's Palace (the abandoned resort full of living suits). Deep under the park are Concrete Tunnels used by staff to get from one place to another across such a vast wonderland. They also happen to connect to an attraction known as The Pirate Caverns. 







Greg and Lisa manage to capture footage of two entities: A Faceless Figure (Undying) and a Distorted Mickey Suit (The Face). The objective is to find a key located in a treasure chest, use it to open a safe, then collect the Classified Documents and leave. Undying will take your keys. The Face delivers a much worse punishment. Death.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------











Night 3 adds a few more threats into the fray. These additions being The Face, Acephalous (headless) Goofy, and Suicide Mouse (in name only). Suicide Mouse has been retconed into fitting more with the overall theme of the story. Instead, he is an audio/visual projection from the Mickey Mouse VHS tapes being displayed in the Broadcasting room. He doesn't kill you, but his screams can attract someone that's close by. 










-----------------------------------------------------------------------------










The 3rd Tape Recording is relatively easy. It's mostly just collecting more info around the What-if Labs, a section of Epcot that was victim to multiple fatalities when ""Dream Finders School of Drama"" students where sucked into the projector screen and impaled by pins and wires. The only threat is the room itself. Don't look at the mirrors.

9dyr2o,796,2018-09-07,Refuse to pay me and lie to me? I'm taking you down with me.,JParks777,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/9dyr2o/refuse_to_pay_me_and_lie_to_me_im_taking_you_down/,"This all started when a roommate told me that they had a high school acquaintance that was looking for workers, shortly after my last job ended in the middle of summer. 

The job was in the automotive industry, at a used car dealership, repairing wrecked cars.   I was hired shortly after an interview.   I was then given a 1099 (legally very different from a w4.  It means that I was titled as a ""contractor"" not an employee)   Seemed like honest work, and I was glad to do it.    Upon being hired I was told as much work as I could handle, and that I could make between 800-1200/week (it was a piece-work job at 400/car).     That's pretty good for a young guy, especially one trying to get a mechanical engineering degree.   I knew I would expect less when I returned to school in the fall, but I still felt I could do 400/week while in school.   

Things started out alright.  I got ""trained"" for a day. (I helped people for free, didn't learn much except the company process.)     I was getting a few lightly wrecked cars to work on.    The company was just switching to this business model, so things were a bit choppy, but I figured it'd all get straightened out.  

Things seemed a bit off here and there, but nothing alarming.  At least not for a while.   They were small things, like a lack of focus on quality, cheap+thin paint, that sort of thing.     I was given a couple of my own cars and then an unfinished project of a former employee.

I tore apart cars and parts were ordered for me (as was the plan at the time).   Then waited on parts.   Parts then came and I replaced them with the tools available to me.      This process continued for a while.  It was lumpy and surely flawed, but not broken.     

After a short time of that process, they got a vehicle from auction that would normally be considered totalled (self insured companies can do this without affecting the title status), repaired it, and the sold it.     This put the figurative scent of blood in the water.   The profit was so good, that they changed their whole business model to suit.   This of course, was worse on my peers and I.  Instead of smaller things like bumpers and fenders, we had much more work to do.   They had to bring in frame specialists and heavy equipment for the heavily damaged vehicles.      Now the process included gaining a parts list (without access to actual lists of available parts, and often were not fufilled properly), then waiting for the specialists to straighten out the frame as well as possible, then do our work.      Somewhere along here, cars stopped becoming available to work on.   For a time, out of the 45+hrs I was there, I spent 70%+ of my time waiting for others.      

Then things started getting even worse.  I was expected to drive unsafe, damaged vehicles from the auction to the shop.   The I heard about an SUV, that literally had 40% of the body steel (and a whole corner of suspension) replaced, that was sold.   The customers were told that ""it was being painted because the previous owners backed into a mailbox"".   It was there, being repaired, since before I had started (more than a month earlier). 

On a Friday, I was shortly let go.  The reason given was my upcoming school schedule.  I was gone twice a week, T and Th.    I had two cars that I had prepared a week previous and was waiting on others so that I could finish.    I asked what I would be paid for them, and was told I'd get paid 1/2 for each car.    I begrudgingly accepted.   I was told to return on Monday to pick up my check.       I attempted to do so, but my manager was not there.   I talked to the receptionist/PR lady, who directed me to the GM of the store.    The GM then basically told me to go F myself.  Because ""I was contracted per car and had not finished those cars.""        Obviously at this point, I was becoming more than irritated.   I called my manager multiple times.  No answer so I left a voicemail threatening a legal suit.

No answer, or reply for a long time.   I asked my father in law (who happens to be a lawyer) to help me press charges.   He directs me to the government agency that oversees this thing.       I then do all of my legal research, find out that I am right, and I was employed in an illegal manner (which my job description almost exactly mirrored the textbook example of an employee, not to be contracted).   I petitioned this court with this information, asking for the full two car's payment.   They gave both parties 60 days to settle it and even offered to mediate.   They chose not to.     The info I gathered was forwarded to the company, who rebutted with the ""cars weren't finished"" line.    I then received an opportunity to clarify.  I added information as needed, being more focused on my situation and less on general law.    Then I waited..... And waited... And waited... And waited some more.    Finally I received a letter informing me that I had won the full $800, and that they had 24/hrs to send a check, or face a $100/day fine on top, paid to me.   

When the check showed up I cashed it immediately.   After I had cash in hand, I left a review not too different from this post for their business.     Late that night I get a call from an unknown number.  I had been applying to internships, so I answered it.   It was HR lady.  She asked if I had time to talk, and I replied that I did not.   She continued to talk anyway.   She tried being nice and asking if I would take the review down (it was pretty scathing, and I'm a trusted reviewer).  I said that I would not because I felt it was right.   Then she tried to butter me up, saying that I had received my check in a timely manner, and how that was so nice of her (I would have preferred to have it later and with more money, but it was still civil-ish at at this point, so I didn't want to take it that far).  I remained adamant.  She then started to get mad at me, as if that would do anything.  Finally in desperation she asked me again, saying how her job could be on the line.   I told her no, and that I didn't care about that after the way I was treated.   Beep, call over.       The next day, I got repeated calls from.my old manager.  No voicemail or texts, so I didn't care.

One night my wife was talking about something that reminded me of it, and I decided to check the review to see if anybody replied.   Nobody replied, but it did say ""permanently closed"".  I was so happy, and my wife was very happy for me as well.   We had suffered significantly financially (had to move) and emotionally because of them.   It was good to see some justice.    Later when I drove by on my way to do something, I got the satisfaction and closure of seeing the empty building with no name on it.      Finally, relief and joy. :)     








                TLDR:      Company screwed me, I got my money, they went out of business."
9dyvec,27,2018-09-07,General and Computer Science Guide,LightEncryption,WWU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWU/comments/9dyvec/general_and_computer_science_guide/,"Firstly, I am super jealous of all of you who are going to WWU. As a graduate, there are things about WWU I would like to mention in general for incoming students and prospective CS students. I know a lot of you guys here are wanting to get a CS bachelors, so I can provide some details at the bottom and to decrease the amount of Computer Science related post (see CS Majors/Pre-Majors section).

# For Everyone:

1. Always do your homework and stay on top of classwork! A good rule of thumb is to do at least 1 to 1 ratio of what time is needed to spend outside of the classroom. For example, if you have 5 hours of a specific class a week, you should allocate at \*\*LEAST\*\* 5 hours outside of the class. I have seen way too many people drop out of college because they didn’t keep up with their work.
2. Go get help when you need it. There are plenty of resources on campus and the ones I found beneficial for my classes were the math tutoring center and going to professor’s office hours.
3. Enjoy college! Go outside your comfort zone and talk to people.
4. Super Duper Teriyaki (A MUST try) – Famous for their Chicken Katsu. Note if you get the Chicken Breast Katsu you can use your debit card without a fee as it will be a little over $10. These deep-fried Katsu comes with a peanut like sauce that covers all the chicken and is fucking delicious.

# General WWU Things

***· Living Situation*** ***–*** Good rule for housing is to look at the reviews. There are a lot of companies that will take your security deposit and not fix the problem. Most places rent are from $400-$800 a month including utilities. There is a Facebook page for Bellingham housing that could be a useful tool if you want to find a place.

***· Advertisement –*** WWU sends letters and emails to you because of company sponsorship. These include letters to join a national frat/sorority or the notorious painting company. These are generally scams to get your money and I know several people who tried the painting company and lost a lot because it requires a lot of time and commitment.

***· Budget*** ***–*** I have seen some people in the dorms use their loans to buy new 1080TI graphics card for their gaming rigs and things like that. You are going to have to pay the loan money back. If I were you go to community college to get all the general electives out of the way before going to a university as it is much cheaper if you are paying out of pocket.

***· Culture –*** WWU is very liberal and being on the conservative side can be irritating at times. Most people who are conservative keep their ideas to themselves and at times express their opinions with friends. Always respect someone’s view. Protest that happen in the last two years that I remembered was when Trump was elected and the Florida shooting.

***· People -*** The police here are almost the same as UW meaning that they seem to have a lot of shit on their hands and can be vary on different encounters. Bellingham has a big homeless population however they don’t really bother you if you don’t bother them. Tinder and Bumble are most popular in this town if you want a relationship or something in that nature.

# CS Majors/Pre-Majors:

Note: I am doing some copy pasting from my other comments inside the subreddit.

***Attitude:*** Have a positive humble attitude and be friendly/helpful to others. This is important as when I was sitting inside entry level classes, there are many people who think highly of themselves and that they have been coding x amount of years. This not only makes you look bad, it also discourages other students to pursue what they want to learn. If you are stuck on a problem, ask for help but \*\*DON’T COPY\*\*. The Computer Science department at WWU takes plagiarism very seriously. 1/3 of a CS class failed because of plagiarism. When explaining your thinking to others, try to explain your steps onto reaching the solution without showing the technical details.

&amp;#x200B;

***Overview:*** To get into the major you need to have a GPA above 2.7 however as of last year, the department takes the highest GPA’s. It is crucial you do well in the pre-requisite classes and I have seen multiple people retake classes because of their grades. I have friends who are now working at the Big 4 who attended UW CSE at the same time I have attended WWU CSCI program. The programs are similar. At WWU you do CSCI 241, 247, 301 before getting into the major. At UW Seattle, you do those classes after you get into the major. So, chances are if you transfer here, you will most likely have to take those classes. The department as of this year I believe takes the highest GPA's into the department in those three classes mentioned above and the quality of the program is great however I don't think it compares to UW Seattle. One thing I notice compared to UW Seattle is that they get more big-name employers such as Microsoft and Google who attend their job fairs (some of my friends dropped out UW CSE to take the job). Depending on how much you apply you can get an internship in Bellingham however the cost of living here is lower. As a grad myself I have several offers from small companies however many others in my class got jobs at Microsoft, Google, Expedia, Facebook etc... It doesn't matter much where you get your degree it just matters if you can apply yourself out in the real world. When attending here, Amazon did come up one day to do interviews for an internship so be on the lookout for that.

&amp;#x200B;

***Pre-Requisite Classes (241,247,301):*** It is important to know that the department has been prioritizing Freshman and Sophomores for these classes and that there is a bottleneck into getting signed up for these classes. These classes are a step up compared to the introductory classes (141 and 145) so you will need to allocate much more of your time. These classes are probably the most important and beneficial for you to get a job in the real word as it deals with data structures which is tested at every software interview. A good rule of thumb is not to take all 3 together. Either do (241, 301) or (247, 301) if you want to accelerate your learning.

# Symbols:($ = Importance for real world application, ! = Difficult class, &amp; = Time consuming)

* ***$!&amp; (CSCI 241) –*** Data structures is very important to getting a job. This class is done in Java and can be very time consuming if you haven’t had experienced with structures past arrays. You will be learning hash tables, trees, link list, and graphs.
* ***$!&amp; (CSCI 247) –*** Done mostly in C. This class is more of the low level of computer science. You will be doing bit manipulation and using GDB is dissemble code. For many, this may be the toughest class they take in the 3 because there is a lot of material to know.
* ***$ (CSCI 301) –*** More of the logic base class and continues with 305 and 405 inside the major. When taking this class, it was done with (racket/scheme) however I hear that it may have changed.

**Acceptance into the Major:** A good rule of thumb is to ask Mary Hall when acceptance is being sent out and your chances of getting in. You will be receiving an email of acceptance to your .edu email a couple of weeks before the quarter starts. In my case I applied during at the end of Spring quarter and got accepted in mid-July.

**Classes in the Major:**

* ***$ (CSCI 305) -*** Algorithm: Expanding your knowledge of algorithms and run times. You will do a lot of pseudocode in this class.
* ***$&amp; (CSCI 330) SQL -*** Learn how to develop mySQL queries and handle massive amounts of data. This class is typically done with Java and a mySQL database. 
* ***$&amp; (CSCI 345) Object Oriented Design -*** Used everywhere and has many things you need to know on interviews. The department likes to switch the game you are building every so often and when I took this class we had to implement Deadwood in Java. There is a lot of time designing the game however it is pretty easy.
* ***$!&amp; (CSCI 347) Computer Systems II -*** This class use to be Unix I believe and was split between this and Operating System. Memory Management and uses C. Is considered one of the hardest classes in the major.
* ***$!&amp; (CSCI 367) Networks -*** How communication between application works and the 7 layers. Depending on the teacher this class can be done in C or Python. This is also a contender of being one of the hardest classes.
* ***$!&amp; (CSCI 405 ) Algorithms II -*** Looking at more complex algorithms and learning about NP problems. Lots of pseudocode and time thinking about algorithms.
* ***$!&amp; (CSCI 447 ) Operating Systems -*** Expansion of Computer Systems II.
* ***$ (CSCI 491, 492, 493) Senior Project -*** Make sure to plan yourself out a year ahead of time to do these classes. You get to choose your project and present in 492 and 493. You will pick up useful information in these courses that are relevant to the real world.
* ***$ (CSCI 491) Capstone Review -*** Review of all the core classes you took to prep you for the national test. See MFE below.

**MFE(Major Field Exam):** In order to get your CS degree you need to take a MFE(Major Field Exam), it’s a national standardized test everyone doing computer science has to take. A lot of the problems on the MFE relate to those 3 prerequisite classes. At WWU we learn a variety of languages which can be difficult however it translates into the students being more adaptive in the real world.

**Electives To Take:** Some good elective classes to take are Web Scripting and Android development as they are used a lot in the industry. The MVC architecture is very useful in the industry. Other ones that I find that is very popular are machine learning and AI classes. The Big 4 are hiring AI engineers like crazy and the base pay for an AI intern at Microsoft is around $35/hour.

**M/CS Classes:** M/CS classes usually have a big work load as they give you an opportunity to get math and CS credits at the same time. A lot of them are more math based compared to programming. If you are planning to get the Math minor, these classes are a good choice however a lot of employers don’t really care if you have a math minor.

**Science Series:** The easiest science series is the GEOL. Many people in the department choose GEO if they want easy grade boost or PHYS if they want something related to the major. I have also seen friend do the CHEM/BIO series however I can’t say much about them besides being a little difficult.

**Clubs:** There are many clubs related to CS people and you don’t have to be in the major to join! An important one I really liked but barely had time to go to was Whiteboard Coding Club. When I left, the club was hosted by a friend that is a master student and is a great way to practice interview type questions.

**Important things:**

* When signing up for a class your grade and overall learning experience is based on the teacher that is teaching that class. A good way to determine if the teacher is good is by asking others and using ratemyprofessor.
* Sign up for internships early and get experience if you want to be placed into a large cooperate company after graduation. Base pay for interns is around $14-$22/hour in Bellingham. Go to the job fairs and look around for potential employers.
* Job posting are posted on CF 4th Floor and is a great place to look for jobs.

Graduating this December, my original plan was wanting to do OT but I’m doing my internship in cardiac rehab and really starting to like it. 

I’m really considering working in cardiac rehab after graduation while I take the GRE and do more observations for OT, but I’m worried I’m not qualified enough to apply for an ex phys job...I don’t remember much from my undergrad (I hear the ex physiologists that I work with talk about different arrhythmia types and I vaguely remember what some are) and am worried I won’t get hired because of that. 

Any tips?

I will be graduating from IT engineer school next September. To do so, I have to find a 6 months internship, that I would like to do in Estonia (I already lived there).

I am looking for a very specific position (Product Owner), basically to do some Agile project management. Most of the job offers I find are mid-senior, and internships offers seem to be so rare. I have applied to a lot of job offers in Tallinn, got rejected (probably because they were not looking for an undergraduated). In my country, my previous internships and my academic skills allow me to get such position ""easily"". I suppose that I am not applying the right way or to the right places.

Any advice about who to contact / where to seek in order to get such an internship? Thanks!"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I posted this in r/Arizona, but I also wanted to hear from those more local to Tucson as well. I just recently started my college internship in a rural farming community (Avra Valley, in/near Marana, AZ).

I'm fascinated with everything I'm learning, coming from a populated city.

I've found myself wondering what citizens of rural areas wish outsiders knew about the areas, customs, culture, etc.

So, for those of you living in rural areas,

1. Why do you live where you do? 

2. What do you wish outsiders knew about your town or area?

3. Would you be willing to describe the values and the culture of the area you are in? 

Thanks so much in advance!

&gt; ""Comrade President, Comrade President! Wake up! Wake Up! We have a situation!""

President Trong jolts herself awake reaching for her pistol on the side table.

&gt; ""You won't take me tonight!!""

President Trong attempts to grab the pistol which is quickly snatched from her grasp.

&gt; ""Calm down, Comrade President, its me, the Directorate General. We have a situation.""

The President rubs her eyes while she turns on the light, pushing several newspapers onto the floor in the process. She then sits up in her bed.

&gt; ""What time is it? Is this really necessary?""

She grumbles some questions as she prepares to get out of bed. Slidding into some pink fuzzy slippers and pulling on a women's black suit coat with the party pin on it, the Directorate General looks at the President.

&gt; ""Comrade President... I think you are going to need more than some slippers and an over coat, don't you think?""

The Directorate General covers her mouth in embarrassment, as she looks down and then back up. President Trong looks down at herself, and back up at the Directorate General.

&gt; ""Oh, well, yes, just brief me while I get dressed.""

President Trong begins to move over to the curtain to change as the Directorate General begins to brief her.

&gt; ""Well, Comrade President, the Statistics Administration found an error.... On the Móng Cái Smart City project...""

The Directorate General tries to hint at something.

&gt; ""Well, come on! Spit it out! What kind of error?""

The Directorate General pulls out a small notecard and begins to read some summarized facts.

&gt; ""Apparently some of the ministers from the Central Committee have been siphoning funds through fake purchases for approximately four months. The invoices read that Obayashi Vietnam has purchased over $23 Mn in ""drill bits"" from shadow companies run by these ministers....""

President Trong, now emerging from changing her clothes, walks back over to the Directorate General.

&gt; ""Well... in that case... I trust that the People's Police can take care of it. There was no need to wake me for it.""

President Trong throws an irritated glance to the Directorate General, while brushing her hair.

&gt; ""We don't exactly have them captured yet... I'll brief you more on the way over.""

The two move towards the exit, then the Directorate General opens the door for the President.


**December 16th, 2033 3:25 AM Operations Room, Presidential Palace**

&gt; "".... the entrances will be here and here, and the 3 ministers are sleeping in here. This should just be a quick grab, with minimal resistance.""

President Trong and the Directorate General interrupt the Police Chief of the Móng Cái SAR during his briefing with the door closing behind them. The room stands and salutes President Trong.

&gt; ""Glory to President Trong! Glory to the People's Republic of Vietnam!""

President Trong drops herself into the office chair at the end of the table, as she yawns, half-heartedly raising her fist.

&gt; ""Glory to me... Alright, Comrade can we make the operation quick? I'd like to go back to sleep.""

The rooms sets themselves at ease while they all sit back down. The Police Chief remains standing.

&gt; ""....Yes Comrade President. There should be no issues with the operation. All we need is your word of approval to start.""

President Trong looks to the cabinet members on her left and her military advisers on her right, all of them looking at her.

&gt; ""Alright, let's do it. Bring them in.""

Yawning once again she waves her hand in approval. The Police Chief presses the Enter key on the keyboard and one of the lights on the screen turns green and several officer body-cams come to life. The frame depicts several People's Police Tactical Operators preparing to breach into the building at several entrances.


**December 16th, 2033 3:32 AM Móng Cái Residential Construction Office Lodgings of Obayashi Vietnam**

&gt; ""And three-two-one...Hit it!""

One of the officers in [all-black body armor](https://i.imgur.com/ROJf2fe.jpg) pulls the cord, blowing the door wide open as six men run in with their tactical flashlights on, and firearms raised.

&gt; ""Living room...clear! Hallway...clear! Contact... door front!""

A confused and dazed man holding his hand to cover his eyes from the light mutters in confusion. Upon realizing what is happening, he raises his hands above his head and walks slowly towards the police. One of the officers grabs the dazed man by his pajama shirt collar and another officer begins assisting by patting him down, while a third officer cuffs him, and then takes him outside once he is cleared. Several officers move towards the door down the hallway, as gunshots ring-out through the door.

&gt; ""Whoa! Second contact, hallway door! Comrade, come up with your hands out! You are under arrest for corruption and embezzling state funds!""

The command from the officer is responded to by a few more gunshots. One of the officers sighs, as he switches off his tactical light and flips his thermal sight up on his LR18, seeing small occasional peaks of white, from behind the bottom left corner of the doorway. Aiming near the floorboards, he pulls the trigger, sending six rounds down range. A cry is heard from down the hallway before he sees the white figure fall to the floor, exposed by the doorway, grabbing his legs. Several other officers identify him and begin rushing down the hallway towards him to detain him. They begin dragging him back down the hall towards the entrance.

&gt; ""Once contact detained upstairs!""

The other squad begins moving down the stairwell with one of the ministers detained and walks towards the door with him. The minister from down the hall, was being dragged by two officers out the door.

&gt; ""Alright, let's pass the sacks out and start taking any evidence, financial statements, money, computers, disk drives, all of it. These will all undergo an extensive review. Remember, bag it and then log it in the journal. Let's get this going, wheels moving out in twenty! Everything down to the last cent will get logged, don't get any funny ideas!""

One of the officers returns back into the building with large black bags, as the squads begin to take apart the residential rooms, looking for the financial documents and evidence of fraudulent activity. 

**TL,DR;**

The Fraud Examiners at the Statistics Administration noticed an error in invoices at Obayashi Vietnam construction company working on the Móng Cái Smart City project, paying an awfully large price on drill bits for no increase in raw materials account. Some ministers from the Central Committee were attempting to siphon funds for personal use through shadow companies maintained by a handful of loyal interns, who were discovered to all have the same address, thus raising suspicions. The ministers were arrested for their involvement and execution of the criminal activities.

9e2ejg,5,2018-09-08,No Easy Decision..,musictakeheraway,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/9e2ejg/no_easy_decision/,"I found out I was pregnant on Sunday, a few days after my 29th birthday. I had been broken up with the male who fathered the child for almost two weeks. We had a fairly toxic relationship and I feel he is manipulative, controlling, emotionally abusive, and a pathological liar. I had been planning to break up with him for quite some time (months actually) before I finally did. 

The sex that likely led to the conception of the blastocyst inside my uterus right now was fairly low-risk for pregnancy. It lasted only a couple minutes and he never ejaculated. I am unable to use most forms of birth control due to breast cancer running rampant on both sides. I struggle with MDD, GAD, and possible Bipolar 2, and most low/no estrogen birth control methods I have tried have had horrible side effects for me, and I’m pretty much out of options (aside from condoms, of course). 

The last time I saw him before we broke up is the most likely date of conception. We had been talking a little, but i wasn’t planning on seeing him ever again and was pretty apathetic about him/the entire situation. 

I called him on Sunday after taking my first at-home pregnancy test, and his immediate reaction was to tell me it isn’t his, as he has not seen me in 17-18 days. He had ALWAYS accused me of cheating (I never did, but of course he did..) and when I didn’t talk to him for nearly a week after breaking up with him the night of the terrible sex where no one had an orgasm, and he sent me several crazy text messages about me being “on dicks,” etc. etc. 

Sunday night, I took two more tests and all were positive. He continued to deny paternity, accuse me of cheating, told me it was a mistake and I needed to “kill it,” etc. I initially scheduled my appointment at Planned Parenthood for early next week. 

The next day, he explained he would not be helping me pay for the abortion, so I had to reschedule my appointment for the day I get paid and deal with being pregnant an additional week and a half. I explained how much I need his support, both financially and emotionally, and he was extremely insensitive and dismissive. I called one of my best friends and she agreed to accompany me to my appointment, help me when I need to fill my prescriptions after the appointment, and stay with me at home when I take the misoprostol, be there to check on me and smoke with me, etc. (We are both mental health counselors and have both been through medical abortions and I am very grateful to have her in my life!)

I called my ex and said I wanted to discuss everything with him in person. Historically, he treats me different via phone (text messaging, Snapchat, phone calls, voicemails) vs. in person. He is typically very mean and abrasive over the phone when we fight, but usually caves and is unable to stay mad and continue arguments when he sees me in person. He told me to meet him at a park/beach in the suburbs, which is fairly close to where he resides. Unfortunately, he had a bunch of friends there and was on his way to drop a Seattle-based friend off at the airport. I rode with him and his friends in the truck and they asked how long we had been dating, referred to me as his girlfriend, etc. I also drank half a beer in his friends and roommates’ presence, as I plan on getting an abortion soon.

After his friends and roommates left, we went to get pizza and talked in his room for a bit as well. He asked me if i was really pregnant, if it was really his, etc. It is really his- I have not had sex with anyone else in a year and a half. As I stated previously, I never cheated on him. He pretty much instantly believed me, but we still discussed abortion and that was still our (my) plan. 

The next day, I find out he told his boss I’m pregnant and they had a discussion about consistent jobs/money (he works in construction and his boss is a contractor). I also found out he told his roommate (one we were with the day prior) of the pregnancy as well. 

Last night, he takes me out for Mexican before work (I work overnights) and calculates how much he believes he will be making monthly. As I’m sure many people know, construction is not the most reliable and secure job field. He often goes weeks without working if the contractor doesn’t have a job and he often goes weeks without receiving compensation for his work, as homeowners don’t always pay on time.

At the Mexican restaurant, he is essentially acting like we can do this and should and today he’s behaving as if we are back together. My initial reasoning for even including him in this pregnancy was to get half the money to pay for the abortion.

He is absolutely ridiculous and immature. He will not make anywhere near what he claimed he could make, it will never be consistent, and his truck belongs to his boss. He often fights with his boss and threatens to quit frequently. I am a mental health counselor and make very little money at the moment, about 35k per year with no overtime. There is no way I am able to afford a baby on my own, and there is no way I would receive child support, as he works a job where he gets paid in cash under the table. He has even recently suggesting me quitting my job to “stay home with the baby” (hello, where would we get insurance?). Additionally, I am preparing for my clinical counselor exam for my next licensure in November and plan to get a higher-paying job after I obtain clinical licensure. 

On top of the myriad of red flags from my ex, he has a son who he does not have custody of and does not see (this ties into his criminal record- he has 1-2 felonies on his record and has served time in both jail and prison). 

I have had a medical abortion previously. I was 24 and in graduate school. It was not possible for me to finish grad school if I had the baby due to my unpaid internship. That boyfriend was also an immature jerk, and was later physically abusive. He paid for half the abortion and drove me home and stayed with me in my apartment and made sure I had food, my meds, and was safe and comfortable. I have zero regrets about the abortion when I was 24 and am fully confident I made the right decision. I am extremely grateful that I live somewhere where I have extremely easy access (I live in the third largest US city) to safe, affordable, and legal abortion. I have always been very open about my abortion experience and feel absolutely no shame, guilt, or grief.

I feel slightly differently about this abortion. Now that my ex wants the baby, I don’t know what to do. I am still planning on going to my appointment next Friday and accepting the support from my good friend. I will have to pay for this on my own, and it will cost about half my paycheck. I was honestly kind of just humoring my ex the days I saw him this week, as I wanted half of the money and potentially for him to be there with me and help me after I take the misoprostol. He has suggested making an appointment at planned parenthood “just in case,” but overall seems to want to keep the baby and raise it together, even though it is essentially logistically and financially impossible. 

I also feel differently this time around because I’m 29 and wonder how I would feel if I never got the chance to have a baby (when I am financially secure, have my clinical therapist license, and a healthy relationship and stable partner). Furthermore, having a second unplanned pregnancy and second abortion does bring up some uncomfortable emotions and thoughts. The decision to have an abortion is almost never an easy one, but I never imagined being in this situation again. I also never imagined feeling any differently than I felt about my first abortion, but I fear that if I am completely honest with myself, I do feel differently. 

This is cathartic and I sincerely appreciate if you take time to read it. I guess I am just looking for advice and support at this time. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about medical abortions, Planned Parenthood, or anything else I have mentioned as well. Thank you! 😊

I’m actually not hungover. But yeah y’all probably know that I was out partying by now. I TOLD my nmom I was going out last night. I told her I would be out late. I even told her my friend said I could crash on her couch. BUT MY NMOM DOES NOT LET ME CRASH AT PEOPLES’ HOUSES. 

Why, you ask? She *says* she doesn’t want me taking favors from people. In reality, she thinks people will undress me and take pictures to post on the internet. I let my nmom know I was attending a party. I let her know it would go on late. I TOLD HER I HAD A FRIEND WHO SAID I COULD CRASH AT HERS. But nooooo, she goes and says I can’t. OKAY FINE, I DO THE RESPONSIBLE THING AND UBER. 

I got home at 2AM-ish? I don’t even remember letting myself in. I just remember pregaming a ton. As I said before, YOU LATINXS GO HARD (I’m Indian). I was made to chug even after vomiting. I don’t remember if I vomited after that. Anyway, I was well cared for. We are all adults, all over 21. 

So yeah nmom just came into my room and snapped at me for getting home at 1:45. I TOLD YOU I WOULD LEAVE AROUND MIDNIGHT HOLY SHIT. And you’re the one who wouldn’t fucking let me crash on a friends couch. She then proceeds to attack my GPA (her go to move), and tell me I’m basically being treated as a disabled individual. 

I mean, sure. Fuck me if the occasional party is bad behavior. I don’t do this shit every weekend. I, a 24 year old, met up with my friend who invited me to a party. We pregamed before hitting up the bars and I got shitfaced. But I neeeeed to have a foundation in life with a good job. Alright cool. Never mind the fact that I made lunch, cleaned the house, and paid my bills before going out.

I have a fucking job with pharma. And I’m going to apply for an internship that fucking interests me soon. I may not be making bank, but I make enough to support my social life. Nmom then proceeds to play the “You should be grateful that you’re not in a white family who would kick you out at 18” card. I mean, raise your hand if you’re a white adult and live at home.

But nah, I’m a bad person for drinking and partying instead of volunteering at animal shelters for fun. Don’t get me wrong, I love the animals. Maybe volunteering at animal shelters would be beneficial for certain internships that want experience working with animals. 

Bottom line: I shouldn’t be shamed for doing what most 24 year olds do. I didn’t drink and drive. I had a responsible plan of action. I HAD A FRIEND OFFERING HER COUCH. But NOPE. I didn’t get to fucking attend slumber parties as a kid either. 

Apparently my room reeks of alcohol too. WHO THE FUCK CARES, MOM. I AM 24. There was no underage drinking. And once again: I DID NOT DRINK AND DRIVE. Okay fine, it’s a risk getting in an Uber blackout drunk, but I DID NOT TAKE THE WHEEL. "
9e3o77,5,2018-09-08,Why do I feel so much anxiety over online arguments AND comments?,LMitsuki,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9e3o77/why_do_i_feel_so_much_anxiety_over_online/,"Hi, there! I've been looking for a similar question but I didn't find one, so I decided to create this post. Sorry, it's long as I explain my feelings as well.

I've always had this bad anxiety whenever I argued online - and I argued quite a lot in my teens days. I didn't know this could be called «anxiety», so I thought I was weird and wondered why the other party never felt so bothered by it... Sometimes they were bad arguments, sure, but other times we were only strongly sharing different opinions yet I think I would take everything very personally. When we got into arguments I was always so upset that everytime I replied - edited, deleted, reposted my reply - I couldn't do anything more : loud heart thumps, not sleeping, not focusing in anything else but rereading it over and over.... At times I even felt I wanted to delete my topic just in order to put an end to this, but it wouldn't happen much as I was somehow confident whenever I replied.

When I grew up and also realized what «anxiety» was, things actually got better. It was nice to share my POVs with others and I also learnt how to be selective over the things I reply in order not to be upset later one. (But somehow years passed and the self-esteem and confidence over my inteligence I had back then got pretty weak as well.)

The thing is, nowadays it's worse (since around March-April). I'm anxious over pretty much everything, even if there is no argument. And this was so sudden, I can't find a trigger that would explain why I am feeling this way.

Like, I have an account on Quora. Everytime I receive a comment there I just delete my phone notification without reading because I'm fearful. Sometimes I get brave, go to the app and search for that old comment notification but I don't reply most of the times, unless it's a good one (and if it's worth replying). Same with messages and stuff. I have no idea about what the message is about, but I'm already like this. I even disabled the possibility of commenting on my topics. And, it's not that I write stupid or dumb stuff, I actually became a top writer there with good upvotes and everything... but nowadays I can't even go in there unless it's for reading other posts. I can't even write anything as I feel unconfident, I guess?!

Or, when people comment on a comment I made about a series I'm watching... It's okay, it's just that we have different POVs, it's not an argument, but why do I feel so down and anxious over it? They were not rude - just straightfoward -, so why? I do like to share different views with other people (I do it with some online friends by chatting with them, and it's nice even if we don't agree with each other because I know it's everything fine and all...), but I get anxious if the comment doesn't have a certain «nice vibe», you know? Like, using nice emoticons (not the ironic or passive agressive ones) or saying stuff like ""I understand your POV, but..."". So, sometimes I kinda try to make a nice vibe on my replies after, to see if the conversation gets better (if it does, my fear gets lighter). Sometimes it's even hard to reload the page to see if there is a new notif. (when I replied someone's comment). It's like I wanted to be in good terms with everyone when we're sharing views (not when it comes to mean users or  when we're talking about arguments).

\[And, I've registered in an online dating app. I thought I was cool with chatting online but when it comes to boys it's a little harder than I thought. My convo is not bad but whenever I close the app and start doing other stuff I feel I don't want to open it again, I feel somehow anxious (the app somehow doesn't notify me when someone replied back but I do receive emails about messages sometimes, and I feel the same). The only guy I talk to, we started as penpals (sending emails to each other) and nowadays we chat freely on facebook.. but maybe it's different because he's from Brasil so I feel we don't live close by? And since we talked so much I feel I wouldn't be like this even if somehow he moved to Portugal and we got to meet. (Yeah, you can imagine my dating life lol)\]

The online app topic aside, this actually started in March/April when I went through a very stressful period (I was studying for my law bar exam, which would decide a lot of my future and also my past - to see if my almost 2 years of internship, and the money put into it, were worthy or not). Besides that, I was also somehow depressed because of family things (parents' preferences over their children and stuff with some machism included) which would make me cry rivers everytime I thought/spoke about that (still does). I even went to the therapist who immediately asked me what was wrong with me and told me she could notice how terribly sad I was and how my self-esteem was so low. (Later on I gave up as I didn't feel it was helping me and I'm searching for a new one who knows more about mental health).

After months of constant anxiety, in August I found out I passed my exam, and I'm now a lawyer. I was so happy that I thought this was finally over and that I had gotten all of my confidence back, but this fear still remains!! I'm now finding a lot of things about myself and learning how to love myself - I even realized I was someone lucky overall when it comes to things happening to me, which was nice -, but this thing doesn't go away, I actually feel it's pushing me back.

It's making me go insane. And I'm sure I will be like this even if/when I receive any notification of your answers!

Can someone relate or am I just weird?"

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9e5iux,6,2018-09-08,How to set boundaries with coworkers,Imjustshyisall,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/9e5iux/how_to_set_boundaries_with_coworkers/,"I’m a 26-year-old woman who’s been in social work for about three years now. Specifically, foster care and adoption. I used to be in the RTC setting, which I loved, but my position required me to  live on-site 93 hours a week so there was definitely an expiration date there. 

Four months ago, I switched two a new agency where I now work with parents and kiddos in care who are really struggling with behavioral issues. I’m more of a “behavior specialist” than a case manager. It’s an okay job. Not the worst I’ve ever had, but the hours are super flexible which is why I’d like to make it work so that I can  continue to work while getting my masters (at least until internships require more of my time). 

The problem is - my boss. As a person, I like her. As a supervisor, she’s very unorganized, scattered, and has very poor work/personal life boundaries. She often asks questions I’ve already answered, uses me as her first line of defense when she doesn’t know the answer (rather than figuring it out), calls me in the evenings/on weekends/when I’m on PTO, and hasn’t listened to any of my “I have my own job to do, I can’t help you with everything” cues. She’ll often talk to me about things she’s already told me about, and take an hour to say something she could have said in 20 minutes. Or she’ll leave me those really vague “call me when you get a chance” voicemails where my anxiety brain immediately says “EHMAHGERD WHAT HORRIBLE THING IS HAPPENING”. 

Example - this week I took two days of PTO because my sister and her boyfriend (who I haven’t seen in three years) are in town. My sister and I got massages and as we were leaving the studio, I realized I had a missed call from her. Instant stress trigger. She left a rambling voicemail asking me to call her back because she needed help with something. So I called her. Turns out she hasn’t kept any record of any training I have taken since I started working at that agency, and needed me to forward her the dates, times, and titles of each training ASAP so she could tell our regional director. This is the first I’ve heard of this being something she had to do. Seriously - type my name and “training” into the search on your email. That will answer your question. 

I know I sounded a little miffed when I told her I couldn’t do that right now - and that I was on vacation. She said that “I just don’t want us to get in trouble”. “Us”, making it my problem too. She sounded really stressed and I immediately felt terrible, so I said I would get her what I could. She said that she’d call me at 9 AM the next morning (a SATURDAY) to get the details. She then asked me where the papers for a training she was doing on Saturday are. In the files. Marked *training’s name*. On my desk. Like they always have been. 

She did call me this morning but I was sleeping. I still haven’t responded yet but I’m pretty peeved that this keeps happening. I haven’t always had the best work/life boundaries and I don’t want to experience burnout because I love this field. 

I feel bad telling her “don’t call me on my days off/when I’m not working”, even though if a client came to me with this problem that’s exactly what I would tell them. I’m overwhelmed by the amount of extra work she gives me, and I’m frustrated when she asks me why I haven’t done something yet (because you made me audit all of our clients’ files with you last week, that’s why). I’ve tried giving her my schedule ahead of time, clearly communicating when I’m working and when I’m not. I’ve emphasized my own deadlines but she doesn’t seem to remember them. I’ve set out of office replies on work emails, but she has my cell phone number. 

I don’t want to be flakey and look for a new job. With clients, I’m really good with boundaries but with other people in my life I struggle. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? How did you go about changing it? Or improving it? Did you eventually look for a new job? 

Thanks y’all! "
9e5vy7,4982,2018-09-08,"Bungie, please consider toning down the infusion requirements. I think as it currently stands it’s a bit much.",Opticflare64,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e5vy7/bungie_please_consider_toning_down_the_infusion/,"I understand that going into Year 2, a lot of players wanted a sense of the grind back in Destiny. But I think as it currently stands the infusion cost calls for a bit of a tweak. 

The cost alone seems very steep. In order to infuse something I have to spend a decent chunk of glimmer, legendary shards, planet materials *and* masterwork cores. I think this is very discouraging because I’ve managed to acquire some really nice randomly rolled weapons and armor so far in my early leveling journey. For instance, I found a really nice rolled nameless midnight that I enjoy using, but because the infusion costs are so exorbitant now I find myself questioning if it’s worth it to infuse a weapon I enjoy using so much in my leveling journey to 600 light because I’ll literally go broke just infusing it from upgrades. 

Which will intern cause me to have to go out to the planet’s specific materials it wants and grind a bunch of chests, mats, PE, and bounties. I think at this point it just gets redundant. I think the fact that Bungie does want us to visit all planets occasionally is good, but I don’t think it should be on a daily basis to where we have to grind for mats everyday. 

As it currently stands, the materials for infusion are almost steeper then D1’s upgrade progression system it used to have on armor and weapons, and the worst part of all is I haven’t even addressed the masterwork cores yet, which is the most obscene part. 

Masterwork cores should exclusively be used for ... masterworks. I mean, they’re called masterwork cores for a reason aren’t they? I haven’t even infused that many things and I’m already finding myself scraping on cores. As it currently stands, I’m level 512, I can only imagine the cost requirements for just being able to use the weapons you want just to level to 600. 

So in theory, I now need to basically bank all my acquired weapons I’ve found with good rolls and save them until it’s “worth” infusing then, so instead of using my nicely rolled nameless midnight, I now have to use the 515 sidearm drop with grave robber and full auto system, because infusing that thing into a weapon I actually want to use, is going to cost me an arm and a leg along the way. 

I really think this needs to be looked into. A lot of us Guardians have specific play styles, certain weapons we enjoy using who define us as players, and I feel like Bungie is basically putting a premium on us in order to use the load outs we really want to use while leveling up. "

I understand getting an internship and doing research itself isn't too difficult, but I'm studying a very popular topic (biomedical computing), and there are lots of people who want to work on what I'm wanting to work on. I want the internships and research I do to be related to biomedical computing in some way, not just some random thing that I can throw on my CV just to make it look better/fuller.

I'm hoping to be able to tell how badly I need grades, because if it turns out I need a 4.0 GPA (4.3 at Queen's I guess) I'm probably going to have to study all day everyday.

**TLDR** Wanting to do research and internships in the field I'm actually interested, in as opposed to doing them just to make my CV look better. Wondering how good my GPA needs to be (do I need to have straight A's)?

It was my last day yesterday so everyone stayed after work and had champagne to say goodbye. I know that alcohol can exacerbate my anxiety but I hoped it would be fine and I just wanted one night to feel ""normal"" and enjoy leaving drinks. 

It then just all got a bit too much, there were a lot of people and questions and I had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom but really I knew I was about to have a panic attack. I was hoping I could calm myself down but I went to grab a glass of water but ran into 3 of the girls I work with who saw I was clearly distressed. They were so nice and tried to help me through and I'm so grateful for them. But now today my anxiety is back through the roof but I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that they all saw me like that, and I know I said some things that I wish I hadn't. I know I don't need to go back to work but I really liked it there and I can't stop thinking that they probably don't like me know or regret ever hiring me and won't have me back. 

I can tell that I'm spiralling and that I know I have no evidence that this will have changed there opinions but I feel like I just really need to get it all off my chest and try to move on."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I graduated with the B.S. in ChemE this past Spring from a top-25 state us college. My CGPA is 3.02. Hold the EIT license. Have 29 months of part-time/full-time work experience, which I got during the Undergraduate years. That time frame includes the work as a Product Development Assistant (for a start-up pharmaceutical company), Chemistry Lab Assistant, Process Engineering Intern, and 1 year of working as a Python programmer. I have been applying to all sorts of entry-level positions: ChemE, Lab Tech, Chemist, General Engineer, and Programmer. Surprisingly, I have had more success in Software Engineering. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough skills to pass some of the programming challenges, or the employers just didn't buy the story of a ChemE grad wanting to work in Software. What is even better is that so far I have had absolutely 0 call-backs from Chemical Engineering companies. They just don't care. I include a cover letter to every application, and it's clear-cut and dry. It goes over my school name, CGPA, the license, and my work experience. I also mention that I am ready to relocate ANYWHERE, even without being offered a relocation package. I have recently started calling companies to get through the screening system, but there has not been anything solid so far. I have included my resume under this post, so you can take a look if you want. Any advice will be appreciated.

P.S. I know that the posts like this were criticized in the past by the Reddit's Chemical Engineering community, but I regret majoring in Chemical Engineering. Seriously. I have done everything I could to maximize my chances of securing a job post-graduation, but all I got was just a spit in my face. Majoring in ChemE is the biggest mistake of my life.

Some of the scenarios will be more explicitly taboo (not for everyone I know) naturally all characters will be 18+, others will be romance driven. I'm also happy to chat with you about making a scenario that isn't any of these ones or is based off them. I expect this to be long term as well:

1. I've been your boss for many years, maybe you were my intern who we then hired full time, perhaps you're my secretary who has been with me through my rise through the company. Regardless we decide to spend some time together out of work, having never done it before and find that connect on more levels than we expected.
2. We're both at a party hosted by a mutual friend, we have at various points had crushes on each other, tonight the stars seem to have aligned as we've both crashed out of our relationships and are now single at the same time.
3. You're my wealthy (Step) Mother and you've been taking care of me since my father died, I've come back from my first year of college and you've decided that you'd rather I not leave you and take steps to ensure that I stay with you. Even going as far as some extreme measures to ensure that no other woman will want me (We can talk about these)
4. You're my older (step) sister who is much more successful and accomplished than me and we decide to meet for a drink at your place, where you choose to gloat at how much more successful you've been than. Gradually grinding down my self-esteem and respect until you decide to take advantage of it for your own satisfaction.
5. You're my bratty spoiled younger (step) sister and you've found some dirt on me. You decide to use this to blackmail into doing your bidding, this can be sexual or non-sexual so long as it's demeaning to me and at the expense of my social life/reputation.
6. One of us is prisoner/guard (I'm fine playing either), the prisoner uses their charms, at first only to get small benefits, but then eventually wraps the guard around their will using their charisma and ability to seduce people. This could go in lots of directions, including an eventual escape/partners in crime type scenario.
7. You're my best friend, we've always had a latent attraction to each other throughout the time we grew up together. We told each other (almost) everything and feel incredibly close. We begin with you staying over at my house (or me at yours) just hanging out, knowing that our time together is running short as we'll be away for college soon (all characters 18+).
8. You're my former teacher who I've always had a crush on and we've had a chance encounter at a bar on a Friday night and have got to talking, after a few more drinks we've gone back to your place.

We can discuss Kinks/limits on Kik, I'm open to a lot of things and these scenarios are just guidelines, we can adapt/change them and create a scenario that suits both of us. Or you can send your own idea, I'm totally game to try something else provided you come with the idea. Kik is Axannar looking forward to hearing from you."

FedFIRE!

Prepare yourself for one heckuva ramble.

**A little background…**

For those who are interested, I’ve posted two extensive “Ask Me Anythings” 7 and 4 years ago look at the posts I’ve submitted, I’m not active in this username otherwise).  I am an edge-case, in that both my wife and I work as Foreign Service Officers (FSOs), which referred to as being a tandem couple.  As such, we have not spent *all* of our careers overseas.  In the end, I do believe we will come out ahead, as we’ve made the “sacrifice” to work in the DC region when both of us can’t get jobs in the same embassy.  This has basically meant we passed up one 3-year tour (so far) in order to keep us both working at full-salary.  We have friends and colleagues who are also tandem couple who have chosen *not* to do this.  They invariably choose to go to low-cost of living (LCOL) posts, so one salary can take them much further.

**The Perks of Being a ~~Wallflower~~ FSO**

So, FedFIRE?  Well, if you’re a federal employee, there are a couple of ways to retire early, and plenty of routes to financial independence, but I happen to be in the unusual (in a good way) position of being able to retire as early as 50 under the Foreign Service (Dept. of State, if unclear).

This special retirement provision applies to State, federal law enforcement, and I think a few other random federal jobs (maybe nuclear inspectors...I’ve never been able to get a clear answer).  If you have 20+ years of service *and* you’re 50, you can retire with a “pension” of 1.7% times your years of service.  The actual value of your pension is based off the average of your three highest annual salaries.  For each year worked *after* 20 years, you only get an additional 1% (not 1.7%).  You can also draw down your TSP / 401k with *no* penalty.  This is basically known as FERS Special (or Special FERS, if you nasty).

To keep the numbers simple, if someone with an average high-3 salary of $100,000 retired exactly at 50 with exactly 20 years of service, they’d get (1.7 x 20) 34% of $100,000 — $34,000 a year, paid out monthly.  To further clarify, if you worked 21 years, you get 35%, not 35.7%.  The government *does* provide COLA (cost of living adjustments)...most of the time, and there is a formula they use to keep it in line with (but technically less than) inflation.  

Additionally, because you can retire early, you also get supplemental payments to make up for Social Security eligibility until age 62 (this supplement gets diminished / goes away if you earn wages in excess of about $15,000, so careful with that side-hustle, I guess).  The supplement is calculated by taking your years of service divided by 40 times your estimated minimum social security payment.  At 50 years, this would be in the $1000-$1300 range for most people.  So, without saving a dime, the hypothetical $100,000 foreign service officer can pull down $46,000 a year.  To be clear, we are fully eligible for social security from the minimum age onward, so that income would technically increase even if taken immediately at 62.

Now we have the other leg, TSP...the government’s 401k.  Most government agencies match up to 5%, and with 20 years of service, it’s entirely reasonable (at full IRS limits) to put away $400,000, assuming minimal to no growth.  A 4% SWR gives you about $1300 a month, or $15,500 a year.

So, boom, over $61,000 of income a year.

Then there’s healthcare...which you get to keep after retirement, and the government still pays their share.  I considered this to be *the* key element of my retirement, as it diminishes an otherwise significant expense.  Finally, you also can maintain your life / disability insurance at a discount (though most reduce the coverage).

Oh, and by the way, my wife gets the same benefits (humble brag).

So, boom x 2, over $122,000 per year, assuming we both only make $100k as our high-3 salaries (we actually have made more due to occasional warzone compensation and such), and our TSP accounts have been doing much better.  Pretty darned sweet.

**Fallout 3: The Realities of Living in the DC Wasteland**

It is not all wine and roses (well, there *always* wine...and liquor, and beer), but not all roses, at least.

When I started in the federal government, and not as an FSO, my salary was about $28,000...GS-07 in the early 2000s, for those wondering.  I worked my way up in my career and made some not-great financial decisions like taking on too much student debt, and buying a condo/townhome at the absolute height of the market pre-housing crisis — an ARM too.

Additionally, and this pains me to this day...I was advised by my HR in my first government job to cash out my TSP because I was going back to grad school and I only had a couple thousand in the account. Boo!

Even so, my career hasn’t been $100k+ a year since day one, but a steady slog of promotions, cost-of-living adjustments, and time-in-grade increases.  I *haven’t* been able to contribute the IRS max to my TSP for my entire career, though I have taken advantage of max employer matching since entering federal service.

Both my wife and I had student loans, and they are now paid off in our early 40s.

We *still* own our underwater condo/townhome, though we are renting it out.  Within six months of buying the property, we were almost $100k underwater.  This has never recovered, and the neighborhood has gone downhill due to multiple foreclosures and short-sales over the past decade.  We have taken a loss on this property, rent-wise, every time we rented it out while overseas (though only a couple hundred a month, so 90%+ of the mortgage was covered.  This isn’t *so* dire, because while overseas, your housing in the host country is paid for, so it was kind of like maintaining a $200 mortgage for X number of years.  We intend to sell the townhome next summer once our tenants’ lease is up, likely at a break-even point.

From a real estate perspective, this property has kicked our butts, as the ARM was okay for a few years, but now with rising rates, the rental loss is going up every year, especially as HOA fees have risen with no improvement in services.  Contrary to what many claim, it is entirely possible to not “win” in real estate in Northern Virginia (and no, I’m not discounting the reality of the ARM or the housing crisis).  I would not have predicted the neighborhood we were in to turn to low-income in less than five years, but it did.  To be clear, the neighborhood is still perfectly safe, as ethnically diverse as it ever was, but the schools went downhill due to the tax base, and the property values never recovered post-crash.  We have a secondary e-fund set up to cover paying the mortgage for up to a year, in the event it doesn’t sell in the first few months.  By that point, we might consider refinancing (assuming we have enough equity to satisfy investment property re-fi requirements), and renting it out again (though I *really* loathe being a landlord).

Living in the DC region as a whole is expensive and difficult...groceries, commutes, high cost of living for everything else.  This isn’t uncommon for *any* metro area, but it’s a constant reminder of what we’re missing overseas.  We made a decision to move farther out into Loudoun County and bought a second giant house (cliche), but now we have a kid, and we expect to be a multi-generational family, with (hopefully) grandparents moving in very soon.  We want this for the kid, and difference in mortgage between our crappy townhome and the new place is only $900, but a difference of 1200 to 4200 sq ft (I imagine some people choking at this on this sub!).  We also moved strategically within a few miles of the future Ashburn and Dulles metro stations, but for now the commutes are an hour-plus via bus.  That said, our property values have increased by 10%+ over the past year, and the metro won’t even be here for two years or so, so we’re doing waaay better than our last attempt at real estate (and to be honest, if it never went up, I’d still be totally cool with that).

We would like to go overseas at least one more time, though the realities of grandparents in their late 60s / early 70s and a kindergarten-aged child mean we need to be very strategic about that.  We took the kid with us to our last post in Brussels, but they don’t remember any of it, as they were 1.5 to 4.5 during that time frame (the kid spoke French first, but doesn’t remember a word now that we’ve been back for a year).

Regardless, we have planned for the “worst” case (really not *that* bad, just not ideal) of continuing to live and work in the DC-region until retirement eligibility as early as 7 years from now.

**What RE means to ME**

Okay, so here’s some real numbers…

We are 42 and 43.

Kid is 5.

Our expenses are $90k a year.  (Shock!  Horror!)  This includes a rental property (and associated expenses) losing us money *and* childcare (technically *also* losing us money...darned unemployed 5 year old!), which is about 18% of that total.  Both of these expenses will go away before retirement.

Our only liabilities are a $500k mortgage (new house) and the remaining $250k mortgage on old townhome.  That seems like a lot of money, but not really for NoVA.  We got rid of student loans, cars are paid off, and have no credit card debt.

We have about $600k in our TSP.  Assuming literally no growth, just base contributions, we will have $900k by the earlier eligible retirement date.

We have about $100k in stock investments.  We contribute about $10k a year to that, so, again, assuming no growth, about $170k by minimum retirement.  I view this as the kid’s college fund, assuming they want to go to college, or college exists in its current form.

Running out the retirement benefits, our pensions alone will cover 90% of our current expenses.  The social security “supplement” will cover the rest with room to spare.  This ignores drawing down on the TSP funds.

Our annual pre-tax income would be about $140,000.  After taxes (effectively in the high teens, likely), probably about $118,000.  That leaves us with about $2300 of “whatever” money per month.  This is all based on current salary, no expectation of real retirement fund growth, and the assumption of our current expenses of $90k.

**Man Plans and Spouse Laughs**

“You want to retire at *fifty*?  You’re crazy.  The kid will be 13!  What will you do?  We can’t afford that!”

Technically, in the government, there’s no real “FU” money point.  I mean, even if I had a significant windfall (let’s say $1 million, though I have no wealthy relatives), I would not give up my pension or health care.  I *will* work until at least 50...I kind of want to, so I have that going for me.  That said, I’m technically eligible to retire *before* then, I just wouldn’t be able to collect a pension or anything until 50.

I am in the slow and steady process of convincing my wife that the numbers associated with our finances are, you know, *real*.  She handles the budget (daily expenses), but I handle the big picture / retirement.  Other than an actual 4% SWR, my numbers are crazy conservative.  I assume *no* gains in any of our current accounts.  I’m not Warren Buffett (or Jimmy, for that matter), but even if all our money was just in the G Fund under the TSP, we’d be guaranteed bond-level rates of returns.  In reality, the bulk of our money is in the C, S, and I Funds (Large Cap, Small Cap, and International stocks).

My plans include leaving NoVA, possibly to the Carolinas, Georgia, or Florida near (but not on) the beach to a single-level, single-family home.  I’ve been watching a lot of *Island Life* on HGTV, and it is probably detrimental…  ;)

The going rate for these places right now is anywhere from $200-400k, which seems crazy cheap to me coming from DC area (we’d be able to buy in cash if we wanted).  We plan to spend about 90 days (max no-visa required in most countries) a year overseas in short-term rentals, maybe not every year, but close to it in the first decade or so.  We’ve traveled a ton, so our vision is basically enjoying the day-to-day life overseas without having the hassle of real ex-pat issues (having worked American Citizen Services, I have no desire for the type of troubles real ex-pats run into).

**Random Considerations, Questions, and Miscellania**

* If we retire at 50-ish the kid will still be in middle school / high school.  Should we move to warmer climes at that point or stick it out until graduation (could still be retired, just living in crappy NoVA)?

* We don’t *have* to retire at 50, but there is max date in FERS Special.  There is *some* flexibility in the event the market goes kablooey (sorry for using technical terms).

* Retiring *before* the kid is in college means we can’t sneak her in the back door at State (or not as easily).  Passing up a possible “easy” career entry for the kid is significant concern (for me, at least; who knows, the kid may be a libertarian and hate the government / civil society).  First world problems, I guess.

**EDIT EDIT EDIT**  There is no backdoor to be an FSO.  Did not mean to imply it.  There are internal nominations for civil service and internships, though.  **END EDIT**

* People talk about “side-hustles”, but I have no freaking clue if there’s something I want to do.  I can’t really blog about State stuff, which seems to be the default thing, but I really do need to spend some time thinking about *what* real retirement would look like.

**What Motivates You to Be a Lazy Bum?**

Why retire so early, when the life of a diplomat is so totes awesome?  It is and it isn’t.  My wife and I both had an involuntary “come to Jesus” (the hard way) moment during the metro bombing in Brussels.  I had just exited the metro in Arts-Loi  and was entering the US Embassy when the bomb went off.  My wife was exiting at Schumann.  These stops are at either side of the Maelbeek explosion.  If I hadn’t skipped a coffee that morning and my wife hadn't had an appointment at the EU, well…my username is unintentionally ironic.  

The thing is, I’ve been shot at in a warzone, been in a pretty bad car accident, was accidentally driven into a minefield (got out safely, though), all with work, but you don’t expect this stuff in the “easy” posts.  The things that seemed “part of the job” a few years ago don’t necessarily seem worth it these days.  A good friend of mine lost his arm a month ago to infection while serving in Africa.  It was from a scratch, not a severe injury.  Another colleague of mine was stabbed repeatedly in Latin America for trying to escape an extortionate cab driver.  Dead now.  A classmate of mine from my early FSO training was assaulted when she decided to come home early from work and walked in on her house being burglarized.  She was beat up, but otherwise okay.  This isn’t always an easy job, let alone a fun job.  We’ve all served places where our lives are literally on the line...and while I can’t avoid “life”, generally speaking, I do feel safer in the US than in Nicaragua, Russia, or, Nigeria.

Less than a decade...that’s the way I see.  I’m doing my job (and then some), but the light at the end of the tunnel...that’s in sight.

Thanks for reading.  Feel free to ask almost anything.  I’m happy to add more depth to whatever I touched on, though I will be a little coy about exactly where I served in some instances (dates, in particular), as you can very quickly dox me like this.

**tl;dr:** FSO and FSO wife can technically retire at 50."
9e7job,9,2018-09-08,Does anyone else ge attached to some people you don't even know like that?,Foolxumo,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/9e7job/does_anyone_else_ge_attached_to_some_people_you/,"I find this very hard to describe, but I've noticed it's a recurring thing in my life and I don't know what to think of it.

&amp;#x200B;

 Once every while, I meet someone I click with really well. I can sense that this person genuienly likes me as a person, for who I am. Great, be friends with them. Right? But with them it's a little different. See, theese are the people that I feel like really 'see' me, and I don't just feel it, I know it because they compliment me or make remarks about my personality that are spot on. Also there's admiration from my side, a bit more than with a normal friend. BUT somehow it's always with people that are completely different than I am and have different lives so that a friendship wouldn't even be possible. 

You could say this is still all fun and dandy, were it not that I tend to get a little attached even though we're not friends or anything. I get addicted to being around their presence because I get along really well with them, because they understand me, because they like me and vice versa. 

Two examples to illustrate what this vague description of feelings look like in RL:

1. 2 years ago I had this coworker at my internship, she was around 12 years older and I admired her a lot. She was one of the most amazing persons I've ever met. Being around her was always interesting and fun and the thing that made me even more happy was that I knew she liked me too. For someone that amazing to think I'm amazing, it did something. So yeah it ended in that I got attached, resulting in for example getting really disappointed and sad whenever I didn't have the same shift as her. By really disappointed I mean borderline unhealthy
2. Right now I have a coworker (guy, taken btw) who is around the same age as me. Lately (past few months) we've started to talk more at work and it turns out we vibe really well. We have the best banter ever and whenever we work together it results in us both cracking up all the time and literally crying from laughter. We have the same sense of humour and I feel like we could be together all day and just not get bored. Same as the 1st example: I notice that he likes me as a person, I notice he seems to appreaciate the things about me that others find weird or whatever. God it's so hard to explain. I guess you could say I can fully be myself around him and more importantly I LIKE me when I'm with him. But unfortunately, I got a little attached, again. It makes me really sad whenever we don't work together, whenever we're not seated in each others proximity and on the other hand I'm really scared that people will notice  I'm being clingy so I force myself to NOT sit where he sits or not talk to him all the time. I think he's amazing, and again for him to think I'm cool too, it really makes me feel... worthy? I know this sounds like I have self esteems issues (maybe  kind do) and need to be validated by others, and need their attention but I don't think that's fully true because I don't care for the attention from loads of people. It's just when I feel like they get me my whole being just...It just makes me happy. 

Beware that in both cases I'm not in love with this person. I just love being around them, which is no crime I guess, but I don't think it's healthy that my daily happiness depends on them. Mentally I'm in a real bad place, so he (coworker from 2nd example) is literally the light of my week. I want to understand what is happening; is it only because I'm feeling crappy and he cheers me up? Is it the fact that they make me feel seen and appreaciated? Does anyone else have this and how on earth do you stop this? Because I feel so codepentent, weak and stupid.

I've written cover letters before, most of them I've gotten help with from my business school as well. The thing is however, they almost always come out sounding generic. Like what college student isn't going to be decent with computers, or have good work ethic....

That being said, at what point do I stop trying to tie in my ""skills"" to the internship position and instead just talk about something else. I'm getting confused as well too because I just got done talking with a big 4 recruiter and she said that they don't require cover letters and wouldn't read them if you sent them. Likewise, they said they only look at your resume for about 30 seconds and then they've made a decision. So why do these companies want a cover letter then? They are bullshit to write when you're a college student since they sound almost identical to everyone elses."

&gt; i have to think of what to do







&gt; oh









&gt; i know hang on 












-----------------------------------------------------------------------------












Night 4 features three new Corrupti. A Daisy Duck Head (which produces static noise), Pluto (who does nothing but stare at you from a dark corner of the office) and Inverted Minnie (which can appear randomly at different areas of the building). Once again the previous characters have become more difficult. 








-----------------------------------------------------------------------------











The 4th Tape Recording presents a much more dangerous threat while Greg and Lisa wander the River County: Friendly John. It's a completely translucent being that is flowing with glowing bacteria where it's flesh would be. And within the squirming mass of micro-organisms are organs like a brain, eyeballs, teeth, guts, etc. You must avoid any area's flooded with contaminated water, but in the end three escape the fenced-in jungle. 







He got out. 









-----------------------------------------------------------------------------










Sometimes Corrupti are formed out of the indirect thoughts and feelings that the collective human mind can create. Weather it be accumulative anxiety or dead sparks reality can't quite shape. An Unknown White Figure in the shape of a human female is one such entity. It, along with Slester (a fragmented vodoo-doll like object) are mistakes in reality. Hallucinations. White Dwarfs. 







They...don't do anything. 












In Night 5, the suits are even more aggressive then before. 















-----------------------------------------------------------------------------










The 5th Tape Recording brings back old memories. Ever since the Night 1 phone call, Lisa had mentioned the disappearance of Henry, the previous intern that you where hired to take the place of. After the exploration of the previous resorts, the SSA had plans to investigate Mogwii's Palace, the resort your currently trapped in. Henry, the rookie, helped set up the equipment only to mysteriously disappear. 






This recording takes place in current time while you, Jake, are still trapped on the island. The SSA's activity has alerted Disney officials. Much like the Author, they fully intend to ""silence"" the organization. As a result the duo must avoid being spotted by traveling underground through Pirate Caverns once again. 









The undying faceless man. The distorted mickey suit. They are gone. But something has *been* there. Following the two members like a host. Deep in their thoughts. Henry, the once valued employee, leaves behind a headless corpse tucked under a desk. 







But before Lisa and Greg escape, Henry begins walking, overcome by the friendly infestation. 








-----------------------------------------------------------------------------











Night 6 is absolute hell. UWF and Slester have dissipated from your mind. Their existence short, brief, and intangible. Friendly Henry has invaded the building. The only way to ward off against him is to hide under the desk, since noises will not distract him. At this point Shutting off Power is recommended, since you'll be doing lots of disabling. 











-----------------------------------------------------------------------------









The next Tape Recording actually takes place before The Search for Jake. Like most of the others it's weeks prior. Greg and Lisa traverse an abandoned hotel, Disney's Pop Country Resort. An anachronistic being wanders the halls, and is able to go virtually anywhere. Simply known as ""Wandering Entity"". A warped, distorted human shape covered with tacky patterns and lights while adorning a mask similar to a Mickey Suit. He crawls and transports himself through wormholes in walls, and objects within his presence are teleported mere feet from where they are located. 






The mission is actually quite easy, and sets up what happens in the next Night. 












-----------------------------------------------------------------------------









The difficulty of Night 7 is surprisingly toned down. Henry has left the area to stumbled around in the woods. The Suits still roam the halls, but someone new has arrived. A strange figure that Jake personally dubs ""Hourglass"" despite him being under the identity of ""Wandering Entity"" by Disney. He is, indeed, the corrupti seen in the tape, but he does something special.








Now located as an option in the Security Camera menu, is a timer. Hourglass will appear on a random camera at certain times. By focusing the camera on him, you can set a timer that can transport you 30 (real-time) seconds ahead in gameplay. Whatever threat that's in your view will become null as time advances quicker. You can get through the night faster. 








But...whoops. Looks like you slipped up. Because when the clock hits 5:AM, Inverted Mickey kills Jake in a scripted event. 












Greg and Lisa arrived too late. 













-----------------------------------------------------------------------------












The Final Tape is short and sweet. Greg and Lisa find The New Global Neighborhood from Epcot and collect the last Classified Documents. Along the way they encounter some technological disturbances, such as computer audio distortion (a Digital Howl of sorts) and flickering lights (caused by Fiber Optic Worms). 









-----------------------------------------------------------------------------










Night 8 actually features a dual-player mechanic. Jake's body has been stored inside one of the many Mickey costumes within Character Prep 1. He is the only enemy, with his corpse newly decayed inside the suit. Incidentally, like the other Corrupti that came before him, he is hostile. Mick Mick, along with the other Living Suits, begin coming alive. The other suits aren't ""corrupted"" by negative thoughts, but can be a pain. They try acting alive and roam the building getting into equipment, supplies, and technology. This wouldn't be a problem if some of them didn't pose in front of the camera in the dark, making it look like there's other Mick Micks, making you loose track. 







Each hour the POV alternates between Greg and Lisa at opposite outposts at the ends of the map. You must stop Mick Mick from reaching you or from reaching the opposite side, and visa versa. 











But as the time ticks by, Gascots begin appearing. 















Once enough time is bought, the two plan on escaping. However... 












Greg slips up. Mick Mick kills him. Only Lisa is alive and able to leave. 










She makes a dash to the Pirate Caverns to hide from the Disney Agents approaching. Helicopters and men storm the island, wanting to lock her up and make sure none of the confidential information gets out thanks to her being the only living witness. 









Running down a set of concrete stairs, going and going, deeper and deeper, down down to hide...









When, suddenly, she's gone. She never reaches the bottom of the steps. 











She finds herself in











*Room Zero*











Looking up, a Gascot shuts the door. 















Lisa screams. But all she can do is wait to be erased. 












You got: The Good Ending :-)

They thought the idea was a good one shot me over to an intern in Public Relations. The public relations kid thought it was a pretty good idea so he gave me the email address and telephone number to the Director of Scoreboards. Here's the email I sent him. What do you think?

&gt; XXXXXXX -   
&gt;  
&gt;Your contact information was given to me by XXXXXXX, a PR intern after I was directed to him by the FanSquad - I'm here to try to plant a seed.   
&gt;  
&gt;Every week we have ""Get Loud"" or ""DE - FENSE"" that comes across the score boards/jumbo trons; the fans react. Recently, with the inside look from Hard Knocks, we've seen the Browns coaches and players - specifically the defense - ending their meetings with ""HANDS UP!"" \*Pause\* ""BREAK!"" followed by a clap. I'm writing you because I would love to hear this followed by a thunderous clap by thousands of our faithful fans.  
&gt;  
&gt;I understand that you are ""the boss"" when it comes to the scoreboards. Am I in the right place? Is there a possibility that you can make this happen?   
&gt;  
&gt;As a regular at the stadium, I could see this taking off - especially if it's used in the right spots; perhaps, before kickoffs or to start the game/coming out of halftime and I firmly believe that it would become a fan favorite. What are your thoughts?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't know if you have a relationship with our defensive coordinator or if he, or any other Browns employee, has an obligation to you to participate with your programming but having Gregg Williams say ""HANDS UP! ..... BREAK!"" followed by a deafening tone of 60,000 + hands slamming together would be incredible and to think that I had anything to do with it's origination would be an honor.   
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this message finds you well and that you were patient enough to make it through to here. I'm excited and anxious to hear your thoughts.   
&gt;  
&gt;Time is valuable; thank you for providing me an audience!

9e9zxr,16,2018-09-08,Plot ideas for Diamond and Pearl remakes (LONG post),Pun-Intentional,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/9e9zxr/plot_ideas_for_diamond_and_pearl_remakes_long_post/,"Sinnoh's Diamond and Pearl was a great region for the pokemon games. Being the second highest selling pokemon game, having such amazing music that even Sun and Moon still use some of it (hi Cynthia), and being the first Pokemon game that I've ever played are some of the things that stick with me. However, even in my 5 year old mind, there was a big loose end, and that is Cyrus. I didn't get why I never saw him again. Galactic as a team is the worst pokemon villain team there is, without question. Ugly haircuts, stupid plans, and of course, a level 16 Purugly.

Improving the impact of Team Galactic on the game:

For starters, I feel like each commander has a star pokemon that's threatening to players. Purugly with Fake Out, Skuntank with Night Slashes, and Saturn with his Toxicroak's raw attack power make for scary commanders in battle. However, thematically, not so much. I feel like their personalities could be delved into a little deeper. Personally I think of Mars as the stereotypical airhead, who doesn't put much thought into what she does, Jupiter as a bitter person who couldn't find a proper job in the Jubilife City Store (maybe she's Fantina's unintentional sister or something, and got shoved out of Gym Leader by her), and Saturn as that determined intern who'll become a master of all sorts of corporations and be the businessman that Cyrus is only pretending to be, as soon as he learns how to make a proper pot of coffee.

Next, there is Cyrus himself. His character is actually quite well done, and a proper backstory makes it fit together. The problem is that the ending to this story is really really disappointing. An ambiguous ending is not always something bad, but this one was done pretty poorly. ""k imma getchu back later dw about it"" and then he never does. IIRC, villains usually have a proper resolution. One thing I thought of was that Cyrus uses the pokemon you don't get. Most of the story remains the same until Spear Pillar.

\*BIG BLOCK OF TEXT AHEAD\*

First storyline changes: Cyrus doesn't actually give you a Master Ball. Cyrus makes two of them, and keeps them as an emergency plan in case he gets disrupted, to catch Palkia and Dialga. (Basically, in case someone like you decides to interfere with his plans, he can just catch them real quick and run away.) However, after the first battle, as he goes away, you notice he forgets a master ball behind, and that's how you get YOUR master ball.

Cyrus will notice you come and battle you. He'll lose, and attempt to catch both Palkia and Dialga, and fail because he forgot a master ball. Here's where the storyline diverges.

Pearl: Cyrus catches Dialga, and plans on catching Palkia next, but he doesn't know where his other Master Ball is. Furious, he runs away into Giratina's distortion world. You battle Palkia.

Diamond: Cyrus catches Palkia, and plans on catching Dialga next, but he doesn't know where his other Master ball is. Furious, he runs away into Giratina's distortion world. You battle Dialga.

The storylines merge again, and you battle Cyrus, but he has a Dialga on his team now. You battle Giratina. Afterwards, Cyrus swears he'll find his revenge someday, and stays behind in the distortion world. Story progresses as normal, and you finish the game as normal. After putting your pokemon into the Hall of Fame, Cyrus steps in through a portal with Palkia(pearl)/ materializes behind you with Dialga, and says he has everyone in Twinleaf Town kidnapped. Cynthia says for you to go back to Spear Pillar and rescue everyone in the Distortion World, and is about to battle Cyrus, but he has his Palkia/Dialga use Gravity, which he says will affect the whole region, then uses Palkia/Dialga to disappear.

Cynthia asks for you to return to Twinleaf Town to make sure this is true. During this time, Fly will be unusable, and the start of every battle will have the move Gravity permanently in effect. Throughout the whole region, you'll see Grunts taking over the entire region. Grunts are stationed all over at different routes, but more than half of them are stopped by random trainers or Gym Leaders. You'll meet your rival at given points, Cheryl at Eterna City, and the Gym Leaders in their respective cities all fighting Grunts. The Elite Four will be at Sunyshore City, and Cynthia will accompany you.

At Valor Lakefront, Saturn is encountered, and you and Cynthia have a double battle against him and a Grunt. (I'm imagining two seperate pokeball bars for what I'm about to propose.) Grunt's pokemon levels: 50-55. 3 pokemon. Saturn's Pokemon Team: FIVE pokemon: Magmortar Lv 55, Luxray Lv 56, Gallade-Mega Lv 57, Azelf Lv 59, Toxicroak Lv 60. After beating him, Cynthia breaks Azelf's Pokeball, and Azelf returns to what remains of Lake Valor with effort under Palkia's/Dialga's Gravity. Route 213 is blocked, so you have to go through Route 214 into Veilstone City and up to Lake Acuity before Eterna City is accessible by some reason that I don't know yet. He reveals that they want all three Lake Pokemon in order to control the pokemon you possess so Cyrus can have both pokemon again.

You have to fight Jupiter. You have a double battle with Jupiter and a Grunt. Grunt's pokemon levels, 50-55. 3 pokemon. Jupiter's Team: 5 pokemon. Magnezone Lv 56, Gliscor Lv 57, Gardevoir-Mega Lv 59, Uxie Lv 64, Skuntank Lv 65. After defeating her, you can go to Eterna city. Again, Cynthia destroyes Uxie's pokeball, and Uxie returns to Lake Acuity's center with effort.

You have to travel to Verity Lakefront now. Grunts block the way into Route 202. Mars can be seen going to Lake Verity saying she'll blow up Lake Verity, and the player and Cynthia pursue her. There, a double battle will occur with your team and Cynthia's team. Random Grunt with 4 pokemon Lv 60-65. Mars's Team: SIX pokemon. Lv 60 Golbat (Eviolite), Lv 62 Rapidash, Lv 62 Bronzong, Lv 64 Mega Banette, Lv 64 Mesprit, Lv 66 Purugly. After beating her, You can go back into Route 202. Your gender counterpart Lucas/Dawn then shows up. This is when Cynthia will leave you, where she goes to Canalave City to see how Byron is doing. He/she tells you to check Twinleaf Town, because he/she has heard rumors that Cyrus really kidnapped everyone.

If at any point you went through Eterna Forest, you will meet Cheryl, and You, Cynthia, and Cheryl will fight triple battles against any Grunts that appear there.

Major Plot Splits here:

Diamond: You won't be able to enter the Pokemon lab before you enter Twinleaf Town. Once you get there, everyone is gone, and some of the houses are a little smashed up. At this point, your Rival comes and tells you that Sandgem Town is under attack. Once you get there, the Pokemon Lab is completely destroyed, and Prof. Rowan will be in the center of it, saying that the world is doomed. Talking to him again will make him say ""If only I could turn back time"". If you have Dialga in your party, Dialga will bend time backwards to when Cyrus is about to run away after destroying the city. You'll meet Cyrus emerging from a portal thing, and he'll be a little surprised, then he'll monologue. Here, he'll break the Master Ball that holds Palkia, and then use the Red Chain on it. Your Rival will help you in a Double battle against Cyrus alone. Rival's Team: Staraptor Lv 62, Mega Heracross Lv 64, Snorlax Lv 65, Roserade lv 59, Floatzel lv 59, Starter lv 67. Cyrus' Team: Honchkrow Lv 66, Gastrodon Lv 67, Clefable (Unaware) Lv 67, Mega Gyarados Lv 70, Weavile Lv 72, Palkia Lv 70. Palkia gains a ""totem"" effect, which grants it x1.5 to all stats due to it being freed from its pokeball. If Primal Dialga or Primal Palkia are going to be a thing, then the Red Chain causes them to undergo Primal Reversion. Upon defeat, the Red Chain breaks, and Dialga time travels away. Cyrus is defeated, and he breaks down. The Gravity Effect is finally negated, and Cyrus reveals that everyone was held in the old Galactic HQ, and that no one was harmed.

Pearl: You won't be able to enter the Pokemon lab before you enter Twinleaf Town. Once you get there, everyone is gone, and some of the houses are a little smashed up. At this point, your Rival comes and tells you that Sandgem Town is under attack. Once you get there, the Pokemon Lab is completely destroyed, and Prof. Rowan will be in the center of it, saying that the world is doomed. Talking to him again will make him say ""If only I could make Cyrus return and save everyone."" If you have Palkia in your party, Palkia will bend space to force Cyrus and Dialga there. You'll meet Cyrus emerging the future, and he'll be a little surprised, then he'll monologue. Here, he'll break the Master Ball that holds Dialga, and then use the Red Chain on it. Your Rival will help you in a Double battle against Cyrus alone. Rival's Team: Staraptor Lv 62, Mega Heracross Lv 64, Snorlax Lv 65, Roserade lv 59, Floatzel lv 59, Starter lv 67. Cyrus' Team: Honchkrow Lv 66, Gastrodon Lv 67, Clefable (Unaware) Lv 67, Mega Gyarados Lv 70, Weavile Lv 72, Dialga Lv 70. Palkia gains a ""totem"" effect which grants it x1.5 stats due to being freed from its pokeball. If Primal Dialga or Primal Palkia are going to be a thing, then the Red Chain causes them to undergo Primal Reversion. Upon defeat, the Red Chain breaks, and Palkia teleports away. Cyrus is defeated, and he breaks down. The Gravity Effect is finally negated, and Cyrus reveals that everyone was held in the old Galactic HQ, and that no one was harmed.

Ending: Either Cyrus is arrested by an Officer Jenny or something, or some sort of redemption act comes and you act as a therapist to him telling his childhood to you. Honestly, I don't know which would be better. I'm leaning towards redemption.

That was long, right? I basically planned out a pokemon game!

My final idea is for your gender counterpart to pick the last starter, and be battle-able at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

The story assumes you always win. If you don't, against Commanders and Grunts you'll black out like usual. Against Cyrus, Dialga will turn back time to the Sandgem pokemon Center (even if you don't visit it), and Palkia will teleport you to the pokemon Center. I'm imagining the text to be similar to this: ""With the last of their strength, Dialga teleported you back in time to give you another chance./Palkia teleported you away to give you another chance."
9ea72m,1,2018-09-08,[A4A] Literate Fandom Romance Plots,Coffeeandcatsrp,KikRoleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/KikRoleplay/comments/9ea72m/a4a_literate_fandom_romance_plots/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9eazlo,3,2018-09-09,BUYING CLOTHES W NMOM,DaphneNebraska,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9eazlo/buying_clothes_w_nmom/,"So I (23 F) need some new clothes. I dont work yet (I just graduated and Im about to start an internship) So im economically dependent on my parents.
My Narcmum loves to use me in general as a prop for whatever she needs, but sees me as useless and doesnt let me have agency in basic things like choosing my clothes.

I really have my own style, and she has a very different one than mine ( also, she is way older, so ofc I dont wanna use the same clothes as her).

So the thing is that she wants to go buy clothes with me next week, which makes me feel super scared and anxious. She basically decides what to buy, and doesnt give me agency or tries to manipulate me. She has the money, and I guess she thinks that because she is my mother and pays for certain things, she owns me. She badically thinks her preferences are neutral, universal preferences.

It makes me angry, cause I was excited to finally be able to make my own decisions and choose my own things ( I mean, im 23 yo) but in her mind im still a doll for her to use. I cant wait to be economically independant and never see her again.

Any advices? I was thinking that I will just go and buy things while she is working, ""casually"". Or that   if I with her, I will strictly stick to the things I choose and decline all of the things she would like to buy.

This makes me feel enraged, to see how she feels totally entitled and uses me as a doll the whole time. She doesnt aloud me to be me.

Any advices?

Thanks!!!

I wanted to do a celebrity roleplay but have it more kinky 

Character wise I don’t mind playing as Aubrey plaza, Mellissa fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, Emma Watson, Daisy Ridley, Billie Piper, Karen Gillan , Jenna Coleman , Nicola Bryant ,Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez , Ariana Grande, Miles Cyrus, Bella Thorne , Elizabeth Olsen, Britney Spears  and many more if you can think of anyone.

For the plot I don’t mind what we do but if you want to discuss it in message hit me up
Some ideas:
1) a noncon break into my house and see were it goes.
2) a flirty intern has some fun flirting and teasing before the celebrity needs it
3) maybe a celebrity on celebrity action?
4) whatever kinky, weird, sexy stuff you want

My limits are only 2 things and that’s all characters must 18+ and I will be always be sub
Otherwise add whatever kinks you want to

Hope to hear from you

9ebg8o,1,2018-09-09,[M4F] Set of Scenarios or Send Your Own,RPThrowaway85,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9ebg8o/m4f_set_of_scenarios_or_send_your_own/,"Hi there, I'm a 24 M looking for a female to potentially roleplay some of these scenarios with me that will probably have a significant amount of plot involved, but with plenty of room for other things. Some of the scenarios will be more explicitly taboo (not for everyone I know) naturally all characters will be 18+, others will be romance driven. I'm also happy to chat with you about making a scenario that isn't any of these ones or is based off them. I expect this to be long term as well:

1. I've been your boss for many years, maybe you were my intern who we then hired full time, perhaps you're my secretary who has been with me through my rise through the company. Regardless we decide to spend some time together out of work, having never done it before and find that connect on more levels than we expected.
2. We're both at a party hosted by a mutual friend, we have at various points had crushes on each other, tonight the stars seem to have aligned as we've both crashed out of our relationships and are now single at the same time.
3. You're my wealthy (Step) Mother and you've been taking care of me since my father died, I've come back from my first year of college and you've decided that you'd rather I not leave you and take steps to ensure that I stay with you. Even going as far as some extreme measures to ensure that no other woman will want me (We can talk about these)
4. You're my older (step) sister who is much more successful and accomplished than me and we decide to meet for a drink at your place, where you choose to gloat at how much more successful you've been than. Gradually grinding down my self-esteem and respect until you decide to take advantage of it for your own satisfaction.
5. You're my bratty spoiled younger (step) sister and you've found some dirt on me. You decide to use this to blackmail into doing your bidding, this can be sexual or non-sexual so long as it's demeaning to me and at the expense of my social life/reputation.
6. One of us is prisoner/guard (I'm fine playing either), the prisoner uses their charms, at first only to get small benefits, but then eventually wraps the guard around their will using their charisma and ability to seduce people. This could go in lots of directions, including an eventual escape/partners in crime type scenario.
7. You're my best friend, we've always had a latent attraction to each other throughout the time we grew up together. We told each other (almost) everything and feel incredibly close. We begin with you staying over at my house (or me at yours) just hanging out, knowing that our time together is running short as we'll be away for college soon (all characters 18+).
8. You're my former teacher who I've always had a crush on and we've had a chance encounter at a bar on a Friday night and have got to talking, after a few more drinks we've gone back to your place.

We can discuss Kinks/limits on Kik, I'm open to a lot of things and these scenarios are just guidelines, we can adapt/change them and create a scenario that suits both of us. Or you can send your own idea, I'm totally game to try something else provided you come with the idea. Kik is Axannar looking forward to hearing from you."

Like one of them literally said on the first day, ""I'm not here to make friends."" I am not like some super party animal, I just like going to the pub with friends or just hanging out occasionally. 

Most of the non-intern stuff are older than like 26, with the majority being 30+. I'm not sure where I'd meet other like minded 20-21 year olds outside of a university, but as I am not a student at a London university, this seems like it'd be quite unlikely, right?

Has anyone had a similar experience, or did you just suck it up and accept being like 10 years younger than everyone you hang out with. "
9ebkv9,1,2018-09-09,Is it really a toxic relationship?,ba_98,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ebkv9/is_it_really_a_toxic_relationship/,"So around 2 years ago, I met this guy. We were 18, he was great. I fell in love. Okay maybe not in love, but I sure as fuck had a crush on him. But it turns out, he has a girlfriend. Oh well, that’s life huh?

But fueled by our mutual hate for college, we quickly become the best of friends. The crush kinda goes away and so does he — he moved to a different university in a different country. But we still stayed in touch. More than I thought we would. He breaks up with his girlfriend, we’re still good friends and the crush comes back. 

But then, he gets back together with her and I’m confused but happy. I mean hey, its not me, he just never got over her.

Cut to 5 months ago, they break up again, he comes crying to me, he starts hitting on me, I reciprocate.

Think this is complicated? Think again bitches, it gets waay worse. 

We sext. I realise I might be a rebound, I pull away. Then a month later, his girlfriend is in the Netherlands with him — thats where he moved. He finds out that she slept with another guy and loses his mind. Comes crying to me and I’m annoyed now because wtf is going on? Am I just supposed to stick around to fill all the voids?

He stops whining, I start avoiding. He comes back to me, constantly trying to make me talk to him. At this point I start interning, its easy to avoid him altogether because I am working 10 hours and travelling 3 hours a day. Who’s got time for boys huh?

But internships are only short term distractions, they end soon enough. And end it did. He goes to the US for the summer to spend some time with his parents. And we reconnect. We’re sexting all the time now. I ask him if I’m a rebound, he says “No way, Jose. I’ve liked you from the start.”

I buy it. 

He tells me how perfect I am. That’s cute. I don’t buy it, but it’s cute. He stands at the airport and we talk about how great drones are. We talk about drugs and how he would never do them, and I should never do the hard ones because it worries him.

He convinces me that its a great idea to work on projects together, but he never shows. He doesn’t seem to want the money either.

But now, he’s back in Netherlands, and he has no time for me or the work we started together. Idk if I’m being paranoid. But I feel like he’s only ever into me when he’s lonely.

I feel like he cares because he's constantly encouraging me to work better, like even before all this started. And he's always checked up on me when things go crazy at home.

Is this a toxic relationship? 

But then again — Is this even a relationship?"
9ebrv1,9,2018-09-09,What do you do when you suddenly miss someone so badly but you couldn't tell that person?,LeeYunSeong0109,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/9ebrv1/what_do_you_do_when_you_suddenly_miss_someone_so/,"I'm a 26 year old INFP male.. It just happen out of the blue. It was after a show I conducted in a butterfly park just now and I guess I miss her because we shared some special moments together after I conducted the show previously when she was around. I would wait and see if she's around in the office and there's one time she waited for me to finish my show and then we will talk and it was really a great time..

&amp;#x200B;

She was an intern here before and now, she has gone back to her university to continue study after her internship ended. We had an amazing time together and we could talk for ages if time will allow it. And as cliche as it sounds, I fell for her.. because of how she gets me like no one else can.. I went out with her for coffee or dinner a few times and I told her I like her and I didn't really expect a ""yes"" or anything but I just want her to know how I feel towards her. Turns out she doesn't share the same feeling. So, I was okay since we still talk and laugh like usual. But a few days before she return back to her university, things started to change.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a really late night chat this one time (even though we said ""goodnight"" lol). Then she said she will give me a wake-up call the next day to make sure I get up for work. I was over the moon of course. I did received the call the next day but her younger sister saw her calling me to wake me up and she told her that she shouldn't do things like this if she don't like me. She told her younger sister that she was just doing it as a friend ( and which I'm aware of this, inside me) but her sister disagree.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then, I felt that she starts to push me away and try to keep a distance from me. When I'm being myself, I tend to speak in poetry-like and whenever I touched about topic of love, she told me she felt ""heavy"". I guess that means she's uncomfortable. So, I'm sorry for this long post but I feel the need to explain why I couldn't tell her that I miss her.. I'm missing her so badly now but I couldn't tell her because that will make her unhappy ( and I don't want that to happen ) and I don't really have anyone else to tell.. so I figured I'll just vent it out here and see if there's anything that can help me..

&amp;#x200B;

But I think i wasn't really looking for a solution (though I will consider if there is any suggestions). I think I just need an ear or somewhere where I can release all this thoughts and feelings inside me. Thanks for reading

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR : I missed someone badly out of the blue but I couldn't tell her because she feel uncomfortable talking about love with me and she's keeping a distance from me. Nowhere else to vent this out so I wrote it down and posted here see if any of you have the same experience."
9ebst0,4,2018-09-09,What do I do in my free time as a graduate student? Should I join a club?,StreetParking9,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/9ebst0/what_do_i_do_in_my_free_time_as_a_graduate/,"I used to be part of an engineering club when I was in undergrad and I'm pretty sure it helped with getting internships and a full-time job after undergrad. My GPA was also great starting out (but dropped a lot) and I went to a pretty high-ranked engineering school for undergrad.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm in graduate school, do employers (in industry or academia) expect me to be involved in engineering clubs? Or is it okay if I just focus on getting a good GPA, not getting fired from my assistantship, and getting fellowships?

&amp;#x200B;

I really need to get a good grad GPA to make up for my undergrad GPA. I noticed that I used to get a lot of interviews (20-25% call-back rate) when I had a 4.0, 3.8, 3.6 but as my undergrad GPA went down a lot, it became much harder to get interviews (like 5-10% call-back rate), even when I used the school's job portal. I also started not meeting certain employers' GPA cutoffs so I got automatically rejected. When I became unemployed from my last job I only got 1 phone interview out of 30 applications despite having 3 years work experience, degree from an excellent school, extra-curricular involvement and average GPA."
9ec4m3,4,2018-09-09,A critique of RTV - OCS. Looking for a rebuttal to the critique from those in the know.,Xcelseesaw,starcitizen,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/9ec4m3/a_critique_of_rtv_ocs_looking_for_a_rebuttal_to/,"**DISCLAIMER**: I know there is fuck all chance of this happening, but I want to avoid as much frothing abuse from zealots as humanly possible. The below text is going to make you **extremely** angry, but if you can just downvote this post and then my entire post history (naturally) and leave the commenting to people who can actually engage with the subject, you'd have my respect. lol. We'll see how that goes. Onwards!

--------------------------------

Right off the bat - 2015 is when OCS was originally started development. This will be important later.

9:00 - ""we're not reinventing the wheel, we're adapting the wheel to a scale previously unheard of""

So after miss characterizing most multiplayer games as not requiring streaming we hear this gem. But in modern engines, it's pretty much mandatory simply because there is so much detail now that is constantly loaded and unloaded - his statement was true for Goldeneye 64, not so much for the latest FPS. We can argue semantics all day as to what exactly counts as an ""object"" and ""streaming"" so let's address the crux of the matter, characterizing what SC is doing as ""previously unheard of"". I suppose they've never heard of a little game called Elite: Dangerous. Or No Man's Sky. Or the original Elite, even. That's the beauty of streaming systems - something like Skyrim doesn't actually care how big the entire playable area of the game is, because it only cares about the chunks that are currently loaded. It's only relevant in the context of coordinates - if that was properly designed (which we've established is not), then the streaming system simply would not care what the maximal bounds of the total playable game area are, in any way.

10:00 - And they're not even working on it yet? WHAT? And the mention of ""server-side object container streaming"". As discussed, this is stupid: It doesn't make sense in the context of their description because it was all ""we're streaming content FROM our SERVERS to YOUR PC"", which makes sense. Then they just casually drop ""oh ya and we're doing it on the servers too lol"", so where the fuck is that data coming from? Other servers? If so, what's their intra-server architecture look like? Are they just streaming it from disk? Where will the data be processed, is this the magical server meshing that will enable 100k players??

11:00 - We can't make any promises about performance because there's so many variations of CPUs and motherboards

Massive cop out. Technically correct, but imagine how unsure of yourself that you'd have to be to be pre-emptively blaming players' motherboards for performance variations rather than stating ""yeah, performance will be way better, though obviously people on i9s will probably perform better than on i3s"".

11:30 - Currently, everything is loaded into memory from yella to port olisar

We knew this. And it's just as surreal hearing them fully admit it for the first (?) time as it should be. I cannot overstate how backwards this design is. It's been repeated ad nauseum but it encapsulates CIG's design process as a whole: they want to develop a motorcycle, so they start out with a car, then they try hacking apart the frame, engine, and suspension while it's running into something vaguely motorcycle-shaped.

14:00 - Different classes of ship will be streamed in at different distances

Contemplate, for a moment, the enormous level of griefing that this will enable. Just think about it. I'll wait. I'll help: start by imagining the shenanigans made possible by E:D's P2P architecture.

14:30 - Wait, now they ARE working on OCS? Which is it??

16:00 - What are C++ pointers? This is literally basic entry-level C++ programming practices he's describing - when you null an object, all pointers to that object are no longer valid. Obviously, you have to handle that. The fact that they're struggling with this concept is 1) baffling and 2) indicative that they're continuing to bolt one ugly hack job onto another instead of having a coherent, well-designed engine architecture from the beginning.

17:30 - ""going to be a big one for server FPS"" - in the context of marker streaming on player's clients. How on earth would that improve server performance? Unless servers are exclusively bottlenecked by upload bandwidth (which should never, ever happen in the context of a true client/server architecture run on a not-completely-incompetent datacenter). They also contradict this later on.

18:00 - Wait, but they're also undoing all of those performance optimization gains for radar lol

20:00 - Serialized variables are indeed what I had described ages ago. Search the channel for them. I had to implement something similiar a year or so ago, it took me an afternoon. This was not for a tiny project. There is no reason that this should be a multi-year endeavour for them.

21:00 - ""like save games"" 

What?? No, that's not how this works, that's not how any of this works. Are they trying to describe converting to a binary format? If so, that sort-of makes sense, if we disregard the fact that a true save game will require a ton more data about the overall context of objects and state, and can safely disregard a ton of data about the current game session (e.g. it would be super important to sync the current cooldown timer for reloading the player's handgun in a network session, but there is no need to clutter up a save game with weird state data like that - it will just add even more edge cases to test for later).

21:50 - ""converts from the game's format to a normal format"" 

I have no idea what they're talking about unless this is the most painful way ever of describing ""we take objects in memory and convert them to a binary format that's easier to read and write with file I/O"". Boom, I just saved you three of the most painful minutes of my life with this one weird sentence, interviewers hate me.

22:58 - Serialized variables track which have changed and don't need to be re-sent.

DEAR GOD
WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME

This means that currently, every single frame, every single flag and counter and variable and absolutely any field whatsoever having to do with players is sent over the wire. Instead of doing the not-completely-batshit-insane thing and only sending them when they change, like pretty much every other game has done forever.

They're just now fixing this though, woo. I can't wrap my poor little brain around this one.

26:20 - ""When you want to spawn an entity, it happens on the main thread""

Ah yes, multithreading. Search the channel for my meltdown on the last time multithreading entity spawning came up and why it's ridiculous that they're having this discussion in year eight of development.

27:10 - ""bind culling comes in by replicating those server side decisions""... ""and controlling OCS on the player's client"".

This almost makes sense if you forget, for a moment, that the player client does not have access to all of the information that the server does. Or at least, shouldn't in any sane design - otherwise, what's the point of having a server if you have access to all data all the time on every client? Ignoring the security implications for a moment (or not, and recall Star Marine getting hacked to pieces within days of release), this means that naively 'replicating' server decisions is impossible. 

Unless, once again, they're just trying to describe ""the server sends the data the client needs"", but that would just be too pedestrian for the BDSSEWTFBBQ.

28:00 - ""Q: What's the time sink if we have bind culling?"" ""A: We have them working, but now we have to fit them together""

So they're not actually working, gotcha.

All of those things are useless because they are bespoke solutions to problems specific to SC. Unless and until they are functioning in SC, they have zero value and effectively do not exist. ""Fitting them together"" is almost always the biggest challenge in any nontrivial project, because it's very easy to make things work fine and dandy in isolated silos, and significantly less easy to make things work fine and dandy in the lumbering monolith of an existing codebase.

30:00 - 

I lost the plot of what they were talking about, this sounds like a list of dreams because you can't do any of that ingame right now AFAIK?

32:50 - Claim to be using headless clients for stress testing

33:21 - Player limit is 50, good times for the 100k player single shard persistent MMO

35:00 - Everything has to be converted for OCS?

36:00 - Oh, that's because the entirety of their codebase was apparently not designed with multithreading in mind. WELP

38:30 - More dreams about what the gameplay experience will be like, ""amazing!""

40:30 ""OCS is not the answer to everything, it's the foundation"" what

41:40 - ""If you go to Lorville your framerate will still be really low"" okay lol

42:50 - ""Hedge bets"" - OCS won't increase player counts, server load is actually going to be heavier?

43:40 - ""The load on our server side is going to increase pretty dramatically when this comes online""

46:20 - ""Some of us can't even load the maps because the format is too big"" What lol

Okay so zooming back out to look at all of this -

They're 100% turbofucked. They just admitted what we all called to varying degrees (mostly Derek) years ago. They originally designed the game for small session and small maps. Around 2015 they decided ""yeah throw that all out and buckle yourselves in, we're making an MMO now baby"". Except instead of doing the only sane thing and re-architecting everything to support an MMO, they started bolting one shoddy hack on top of another. OCS is a fancy name for map streaming, which ANY open-world game needs. Bind culling is a fancy word for ""only send stuff that clients need"", which every single online internet multiplayer video game has done in some form. And by crobberts' wavy hands, why on earth did anyone architect their game for single-threaded, non-asynchronus content loading and object spawning in this decade? They should never have done that, even for Freelancer 2 or whatever the initial pitch was for, it was bad then, it's terrible now.

And now they've been trying to fix all of these systemic design flaws and antipatterns over the last 3 years as the scope has continued to increase and no apparent progress has been made. Three YEARS, by their own admission, and they are still at what is effectively negative progress for MMO networking, in their MMO.

Also, who were these people they that were being interviewed? Why did they sound like they were struggling with simple concepts (lol @ nullptrs in their content unloading system designed to null out pointers being a surprising thing)? Are there really only like 5 interns trying to write networking code? Because I can't come up with any plausible reason as to why some of the things are taking so long, like serialized variables, which almost anyone, not even a great programmer should have been able to bang out in a week, tops.

And yeah, most programmers are bad at talking to people and being interviewed, but usually the problem is getting them to shut up about inane trivialities that no one else will understand, not having them stumble around from a cheat sheet."

9ecl0x,5,2018-09-09,Need help getting started,t3ax,digital_ocean,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_ocean/comments/9ecl0x/need_help_getting_started/,"Hello folks,

I'm new to digital ocean and got a $50 credit through the GitHub student package. 

I want to create a small Droplet (which I guess is just a VPS?) with Debian and Docker on it.

Some years back (I think around 2004/2005) I had a internship at a local ISP where I used Debian to create a webserver (from install to configuration) and created a small homepage with HTML and CSS. But I can't remember much of it.

I'm by no means a system admin or webdeveloper I got down the design route since then.

What I'm wondering when I create that Debian droplet with Docker (One-click app) is do I have to care about all the security measures you should normaly do on Linux webservers or can I just go ahead and use Docker to install the stuff I 
need and just confirue that?

My goal is to put a simple private homepage on it and to use [Nuage](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage) with it to share pictures with friends and family.

Sorry, I know this is atotally newbie question.

*Weak spots I'm working on: Biceps, Forearms, Legs, Calves, Neck*

Because I had aesthetic goals, my lifts didn’t went through the roof, but in the future I maybe consider running a powerlifting routine.

DL: 198lb (90kg) -&gt; 306lb (140kg)  
Bench: 132lb (60kg) -&gt; 198lb (90kg)  
Squat: 154lb (70kg) -&gt; 220lb (100kg)  
OHP: 88lb (40kg) -&gt; 132lb (60kg)

So after roughly 1,5 years of bodyweight training I decided to go to a gym because of an internship in another city and because I just wanted to get a new experience in terms of fitness and sports generally, so I started with [Metallicadpas PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/):

From the beginning I changed the accessory work sets from 3x to 4x (Surprisingly I could handle the additional volume, so I went with it) and somehow I missed the progression instructions of the compound movements. That’s why I went with double progression (5-5-5-5-8 -&gt; add weight) from the start instead of adding linear weight. (In some way it worked but *I think* adding weight could have been more useful)

What I changed over time (mostly in the last 4 months):

* Additional Biceps Work (Light) on Leg Day (4x18, Hammer and Biceps Curl variations)
* Calves everyday (Seated, Standing, Donkey and try to get 5x20)
* Abs everyday (3x12)
* Changed the rep scheme of my compounds to the T1 rep scheme from nsuns
* Yoga 4x/week
* Neck Raises
* Cardio (1h) on sunday (I could be doing more, I know)
* switching some exercises every 6-8 weeks(f. e. seated cable row to dumbbell row)

**Pull:**

* Added Cable Shrugs (4x16) on DL Day and Heavy Shrugs (3x12) on BB Row Day
* Added Reverse Curls (4x20)

**Push:**

* changed the Front Raises to DB Raises with two hands squeezing the dumbbell (From [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux4fqfmzh4E&amp;t=40s) Athlean X Video)
* added Dips and Bench Press
* Changed BB OHP to DB OHP

**Leg:**

* changed Back Squat on Saturday to Front Squats and kicked the leg press for light front and back squats
* Back Squat (Heavy) and Front Squat (Light) on Wednesday and vice versa on Saturday (Light = 3x12)

***Injuries:***

* *Exertional Headache:* I once turned my neck and forgot to breathe while doing heavy deadlifts and suddenly felt like a hammer hit my head, nearly passing out. Turned out I got exertion headache. Every physical activity gets you headaches, from riding bicycle to running and exercising. Switched my compounds to machine work and used light weights for some weeks and it finally went away.
* *Hip and Knee Pain:* The first months I got a lot of hip and knee pain after doing Deadlifts and Squats. Started doing a lot of stretching and yoga and it went away. Seems like I had tight hip flexors, glutes and harmstrings.
* *Wrist Pain:* I had an accident with my bike and hurt my wrist. Went to the doctor and it was just a light inflammation and he said just rest and to cool. Did my Bench and OHP with machines and used light weight for my accesory work. But it got worse. Maybe exercising, maybe my 700kcal deficit, anyway [this](http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/) article really helped me. It got better after that.Just sayin: This were my experiences, if you got yourself injured go see a doctor.

______________________________________________  
Right now I’m really loving the PPL, just because I love going to the gym almost everyday. But I think about switching to a more powerlifting oriented routine in the future, we’ll see, I keep you updated once a year or so.

9edr2z,1,2018-09-09,My first relationship,anonacc9,u_anonacc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_anonacc9/comments/9edr2z/my_first_relationship/,"Hi whoever's reading this. I'm doing this partly to help myself as a way of writing down my feelings as well as help anyone who may be in a similar situation. This is of course is my perspective on the situation but I like to believe I give quite a good overview.

To start off, I'm currently 20 at university. Before university I had never really got involved with girls and kept to myself most of the time. I always wanted a relationship but was too busy to persue anyone.

I started at university at the age of 18 and instantly clicked with this girl. We had the same hobbies, found the same things funny and she just seemed too good to be true. Let's call this person 'Becca' just for this story. We shared some amazing times over Freshers week and I really fell for her. One evening she told me that she liked me and we started dating in November 2016 when I was 18. 
A few months into the relationship and Becca started to get sick. I lived about 45m away from her so I used to travel all the time when she was feeling sick. This often involved taxis at 3am or during lectures. When she started to feel more sick as the weeks went on I stayed at hers, looking after her. It's important to note at this point she told me she had no friends and was really lonely. She had anxiety and had medication. She told me that she used to have daily panic attacks but with me she never has them. 

I ended up never really seeing or hanging out with my friends in the first year and lost many good friends that I had been mates with for a long time. She really didn't like my friends and whenever I said I was hanging out with them she used to act weird or even annoyed. To be fair my friends were not the nicest to her and from her perspective I understand why she'd dislike them. No one truly understood the situation because we wanted to keep the situation private. I just accepted that this girl needs my help and I will do anything she needs. This made me uneasy about even messaging my friends.

Becca has a phobia of the doctors however I eventually convinced her to go and get checked out. I took her to the doctors and waited for her to finish her appointment. She came out and told me that we needed to go to the hospital to get a tumor looked at in more detail. 
These appointments go on for weeks, I go with her to the appointment and stay by her side. Eventually she goes into surgery to get the tumor removed. We learnt after that it was cancerous at the core and hence she needed no chemo and was fine. After her surgery she needed rest so she rested in bed for a few days before I needed to go home and see my family. This entire process took around 6 months during which we both had to revise for exams and were stressed. I felt so bad for this girl going through all this shit and wanted to be there for her every step of the way.

Me and Becca so far have had no chance to have a normal relationship as you can imagine. We talk about the second year of university and are excited for a new chapter. To be honest our first year was pretty good together, we got on and had a good time despite being in a tiny room for the entire year.

Second year starts, we live together in a house with 2 others. It's absolutely amazing and things are going great. Once morning Becca gets a call that her dad is in the ICU and she needs to go home. I tell her I'm here if she needed anything and she goes on her way. Tragically her dad died later that day and she had to stay at home for a week or so helping and being with her family, during which I would message and talk to her to ensure she didn't feel alone.
She eventually returns to university and I return to university the day after her.
She became depressed and said some unfair things to me but who can blame her, her dad died.

A few months go by and my Grandmother becomes sick. She became hospitalised for a few weeks and then unfortunately died. This was around Christmas 2017.
At this point after these 1.5 years I am getting more and more depressed. Dealing with these things as a teenager who's just left home and in a first relationship is hard. It was never ever a chore for me to help Becca, I like to think I'm an extremely kind person who would help anyone of they needed anything.
I remember she said something while me grandma was sick. I was depressed and staying home while she was out. She asked me why I was being so sad and cold to her. I explained my grandmother was really Ill and might die. She knew my grandma was in hospital and told me to stop exaggerating and she probably won't. I really don't care that she said this. I really don't. It's the issue of double standards. I know, if I ever were to say anything remotely like that she would have destroyed me (who can blame her). To be fair she was very supportive after she died. It's just the double standards that I hate.

Note that we still haven't had a chance to have a normal relationship.
January 2018, we start the new semester with some exams. Becca starts to complain to me that I need to be more 'boyfriendy' and that she doesn't feel like we are a couple. She made some friends and starts to tell them how she feels too. I try to explain to her but she refused to listen.
At this point I was depressed and anxious because she was the only thing I cared about and was truly a part of me. The last thing I wanted was to loose her. 
This started to obviously take a mental toll on me but also a physical one. My psariosis (a skin condition that flares with stress) got so bad my hair started to fall out in the shower. Seeing your hair falling out is not a nice thing, believe me. This also came with a great habbit of pulling out chunks of skin on my head when I'm nervous (this is still here 4 months on so I wear a hat most of the time).
I had my own struggles and I tried to explain this to her.   I began to hear my house mate had been telling her to leave me and that 'she can do better'. I don't believe he quite understood the situation and why our relationship was not the norm. She had also started telling her friends about her feelings (not an issue at all) but they too started to tell her that she was too good for me. We had an incident where another guy asked her out on a coffee date. I told her this made me super uncomfortable. She disagreed and told me I was being controlling and her old self was badass. She said maybe she could be friends with this guy. I was anxious, paranoid and just wanted her at the time so this was horrible for me. She also used to tell me about all these horrible dreams she has about me where I abandon her or do something horrible. Once again, my paranoid brain thinks that ""oh, her subconscious must hate me"". At this point everything she does sends my anxiety through the roof. Everything I said seemed to upset her, she never understood what I was saying and would just get annoyed at me. I remember one evening I was feeling really lonely and she was acting cold towards me. I asked her, ""why are you being cold to me?"". This was just out of desperation at this point. She then went on a rant telling me how exams are stressing her out and how dare I think about myself. 
She told me that I made her want to cut herself and came very close to doing so. I don't know how I'm meant to deal with, or respond to something like that. I always put it down to trauma. Obviously as well as now being super concerned for her wellbeing I'm even more depressed about myself.

For those of you reading who haven't been in a relationship, I hope you can imagine giving to much of yourself to someone is quite a fragile thing. I was still totally in love with her and would do anything to make her happy, whatever that was. I begin to feel super anxious and depressed at this point finding it hard to leave my bed, having panic attacks and really struggling. Becca is a naturally flirtatious person, I never really had a problem with it until my anxiety hit. Every little thing or incident built upon my anxiety, little things people said or did.

At this point we still live together in a house with 2 other friends. We agreed that this wasn't good for the relationship and neither of us particularly enjoyed the situation. We had signed the contract for the 3rd year of university but then we decided this may be a mistake. Both of us wanted to move out. I wanted this relationship to work more than anything and most importantly make her happy since I know what she's been through. She finds a flat, I go with her to look around and then she puts down a deposit. Me and my house mates are then left to fill the free room in the house with a random person. Once again, I didn't care, as long as she was happy.

We both were applying for competitive internships. We are both computer scientists and programmers. She is not a particularly strong programmer. She really found a company she wanted to work for however it required an online timed programming exam.  I took the exam for her and got her into the company she is in today. In my opinion she deserved to be there anyway so this doesn't matter to me. It does however hurt when she turns around to me telling me she 'has a better internship'. I said nothing, once again I just wanted to help the girl get her life back on track. I no longer cared about myself and she now came first. I don't want credit for these things, I don't deserve a medal for doing a good thing, it's just relevant for later on.

One evening we were at braking point. We were at a party and she had her arm round another guy who was clearly making a move. My mates started to point this out  to me. I noticed it too but of course was too scared to say anything to her. I pluck up the courage, so I quickly asked to talk with her. I told her that this guy and the arm were making me uncomfortable. She began to get super defensive telling me 'she can do what she likes' and I have no right to say that. That evening I also had her friends approach me telling me to be a nicer boyfriend and be more romantic which was hard to hear. I wanted to do that more  than anything but it was no longer that simple. I leave the party super upset and just want to be alone. That evening was crazy and just involved a bunch of arguing and talking with my mates. I'll put my hands up and say yes, I was paranoid but I can't blame myself. As she started to recover from the year she seemed to want more independence from me. I leave the party early. She completely blanks me and my house mates tell me I'm insane for being insecure about these things. They don't understand the full situation so I can't blame them but even still, it's something I think I'd be uncomfortable with even without my anxiety. This further adds to my isolation and panics.

Later that night she tells me the only reason she is with me is because I'm a part of 'this chapter in her life' which is horrible to hear considering you want to stay with this person. I want to be loved and not just kept around as a book mark in your 'chapter'.

It's now summer 2018, she decides we need a break. I am absolutely heart broken but I'd do anything to make the relationship work. I still have my anxiety worse than ever and was starting a summer internship at a company for 8 weeks. The prospect of not seeing my other half for 2 months and being on a break destroyed me. My anxiety often got the better of me and I would have panic attacks where I message her beginning for forgiveness. I know this is not the right thing to do but you need to remember this girl was truly a part of me and the only real person I felt I had to talk to. I felt alone and depressed. After every panic I used to apologize to her for the panic messages and left her alone.  Understandably she got annoyed, I travelled up to university just to talk with her and try sort things out and also helped her move all her stuff out the house. We chat and she decides we need to break up however we decide that after the summer we will get back together.
In my eyes every time I open my mouth or panic the deeper I ruin things. I know how I truly feel and I just wished she did too. She perceived my panic as attacks on her which whenever I felt a panic coming on I would message her saying 'sorry I'm about to panic, I'm not having a go at you'. I often didn't even remember things I said to her due to my panics. It's a really horrible feeling not being able to express how you feel.

I understand this would have been scary for her but I felt very alone at this point.
During the breakup I kept panicking and was still dealing with bad bad anxiety. 
She tells me that I wasn't there for her as she needed over the past few years and that I wasn't 'mature' enough. This was deverstating as being a teenager and having obviously never dealt with this is felt I was always there for her and would have done absolutely anything to make her feel happy or safe. Obviously if she feels that way I can't argue but it hurt (lots). For 2/3 months I was tortured by her telling me that she's not sure about the relationship and doesn't know what she wants. I used to tell her that it tortured me to which she told me to stop being selfish.

I eventually get the call that 'im leaving you'. I beg, telling her that I'm depressed over work and beg for her to be there as at least my friend. She says she can't and blocks me on all platforms so I can no longer annoy her.  Before I was blocked I was told multiple times that 'I wasn't there for her over the 2 years in the required way and wasn't mature enough'. To this I told her all my feelings (written in this blog).  I'm proud of what I did for the girl and would be proud to tell anyone what I did. Out of respect for Becca I'm not going to go into the specific things she said, I personally think they are a little disturbing and disgusting things to say to someone who gave their everything and I'm sure it would make her extremely uncomfortable if others knew over the internet. I feel like the things she went through really left a mark on her opinion of me as a person and she started to convince herself that I hated her and I was immature.

After the past year I was actually starting to believe that I was a bad person and just in her way. 

Over the course of our relationship she always told me how much she hates my friend group and the people in it. I always used to defend my friends which seemed to annoy her. After she left me I learn that she is messaging my friends and people she 'hates'. My mates don't know the full story so get pulled in by this thinking she is being friendly. Maybe she is, maybe she isn't, who knows. However this is super uncomfortable for me because I now feel more isolated then ever.

Its tough because I know what was in my heart and she seemed to assume I was attacking her when I just tired to vent my upset. In retrospect I shouldn't have done this but in the mind of an anxious, lonely and depressed person it's not that simple.

I'll be the first to admit that our relationship was not normal and we both deserved peace however I really had a bond with this girl and understood her. I had seen how she used to cut people out her life with absolutely no issue and I was always scared one day it would be my turn. It's hard to explain how I feel, I'm relieved I no longer live to please someone else however after 2 months of being apart I still feel really damaged and my genuine view of women has changed. This has most likely made me paranoid for future relationships. If ever I was upset about something she would get angry at a criticism and shout at me for being so horrible. Again I don't know how to feel about this. She went through extreme trauma which likely left an impact.

I was young, made some mistakes but I know that after being through something like this with someone I sure couldn't just cut them out my life.

The day after our breakup I can't leave my bed and am super depressed obviously. It's 2am and I get a call. It's from a delivery driver wondering where I was. Becca must have not removed my number from our shared delivery app. The delivery driver finds her house and tells me she gave it to a guy and girl. 
Obviously, I am still in love with this girl, despite everything. I ask my mate to get her to call me urgently because I was really panicked and upset and hadn't let go yet. I say:
'I don't care if I'm not with you, just at least have enough respect for me as a human being to tell me if you're seeing someone else'. These are the things that run through an anxious guys head. It may sound crazy. She tells me to go away, it's none of my business and she has completely cut me out her life. She hangs up and that's the end of it. I hear from my friends and know she is out having a good time, going to bars, having a blast while I'm left here alone, depressed and anxious. I later learnt that she told some of my friends that I had 'Verbally assaulted' her which I find deeply disturbing, manipulative and toxic. 

The topic of 'owing' came up. She owes me absolutely nothing. Nothing I ever did was selfish and was always done to help her. I never expected her to pay me back for the things I did, that would be crazy. I'm not too sure what the word for my feeling about this is. I always thought we were a team and I just feel hurt that when I needed help she wasn't there. Towards the end of the relationship I said I was going through a rough patch and thought we were a team. She used to tell me ""not anymore"" which hurt. We were a team when she needed me but no the other way round.
I felt I helped her build this new life after her trauma, helping her through illness, helping her get a job and helping her move to a new flat like she always wanted. Obviously she didn't see it this way.

She always told me she had too much respect for herself to be with me and it finally came true. Before university she would tell me how 'badass' she was and how independence. After all this drama and horrible events she lost that part of her and she blames me.

I recognise every story has 2 sides. To me my actions were black and white. I was there as a teenager by her side through life's biggest obstacles. When I needed help I was left to spiral and feel alone. I'm upset she never waited to get to know me.
I'm not even bitter anymore, I don't care about her. I'm just now a little scared about future relationships.

In a few weeks I need to return to university for my final year. She is on the same course as me. She knows how to hurt me and that really scares me. Do I believe she wants to hurt me? No. Do I believe she will try and avoid hurting me? No. I have to look at her face every day and put on a brave face while she is being all 'friendly' with my mates. People's opinions of me also currently get to me. I'm nervous about her friends thinking that I was just this useless guy that was a dick to her when she needed help. Obviously I shouldn't care but I do.

I can understand how traumatic everything was for her. The fact she mad it through the first 2 years of university are pretty amazing. I can understand these situations having a permanent scar on the relationship and even understand her wanting to end it. However I don't understand the part about cutting me out her life. After 2 years with me I would have hoped she knew what I was like but obviously not. She had told me the death of her dad had changed her and what she wanted out a relationship. I can't blame her at all. I just wanted more respect rather than being tortured with the prospect of her leaving me for months (when you have anxiety that really sucks).

What makes these even harder is I saw genuine things from her that a good person would do. She gave to charity, helped people if they needed anything and for a period was super nice to me etc. I also saw bad things (most likely due to her stress). I'm a naturally forgiving person and am pretty weak when it comes to that so I was torn on my views.
Since we were very similar yet very different people I struggled to understand why I wouldn't get that second chance.
I also understand for her why she'd start to want to leave me. I was depressed and struggled to do anything. There are 100s of guys lined up who aren't depressing and anxious and won't stress her out. I really hoped that she of all people, going through anxiety would understand however obviously not. All I truly needed was her to be there for me and that is it. I didn't want to be made to feel like a chore or annoyance and the one time in my life I really needed help I just felt lonely.
I don't blame the girl for wanting to focus on herself after the 1.5 years of pure pain. It's an extremely difficult situation. I just feel my energy and my positivity were used by her and when I was all out I was left.

I just want to make it absolutely clear I have amazing friends who I know would do anything for me. Most of them haven't seen this side to her so I don't expect them to feel the same way I do. I hate fights, I hate drama. I just want peace. I thought I knew what this girl was like but I was wrong.

This story is paraphrasing 2 dramatic years and of course there are hundreds of incidents which added up and and I bottled inside of me. 

The analogy that comes to mind is a fly in a web. The more the fly panics and moves it just gets more tangled. It's very easy to sit here and say the fly should just stay still as possible but with impending doom it's not that easy.

At the end of the day I just want us to both be happy. I don't care how much I was hurt, I don't believe that fire beats fire.

What do I take away from this relationship? You need to trust your gut and unfortunately you can't trust everyone. Giving yourself to someone can hurt.

What do I want to happen in a perfect world?
I don't really want to see her and watch her blank me. I don't want to see her trying to talk to my friends. This is particularly tricky because who am I to tell my friends who they can't talk to? To me it's the principal that she thinks she can talk straight over me and into the only people I have. Just to be clear she doesn't enjoy the company of my friends, she dislikes them. I want a group of people around me who see what I see and not this perfect facade. 

Once again, I'm not bitter, I don't want to be with this girl. I'm just sore because after being that close with someone for 2 years and going through those things really creates a connection. I feel little justice in the situation, I don't seek revenge, it just hurts. I feel slightly used and very confused. I can't blame her for being this way, the trauma must have been massive but I don't believe this justified the actions. Sure, she can now go out and be a badass women that she always wanted to be but being kind and nice to people is pretty important too.

Like I said, I'm nervous to return. It's all very well saying close your eyes or man up but it's the very principal of her believing she has a power over me and I've seen the levels of manipulation that occur. I want to enjoy my life and get on with things and I really hope she won't try and be a wedge in the door. I've seen the facade she puts on and I know exactly what she will do. I don't want to have to watch her flirt with everyone around me and think she's above everyone. I don't want her girlfriends to all look at me and think 'oh good she left that looser'. Of course, I expect her friends to stick by her side, I just hate the idea of people thinking like that about me.

It's been 2 months now since she left me and hasn't talked to me. I still have these weird nightmare things about her. I read that ""sometimes you miss the memories and not the person"". I feel that's particularly true here. I don't even miss her, I think my subconscious is just nervous to return. People say time heals all. I'm a very forgiving person, I can forgive almost anyone. That's the issue here, I don't really want time to make me forgive her. If I forgive her I'm nervous that I'll want her which I definitely do not. 

I think you can be a 'man' in one of 2 ways, physically or emotionally. I feel putting someone who needs you first is a great thing to do. I don't want people to think I'm crazy or emotionally unstable. I'm very level headed, I don't want her spreading all these rumors around.
I'm scared but I've got some good friends so I'm not alone and I'm sure things will end up fine. I'll probably keep this space updated. My life, although impacted a lot, has gotten way, way better without the stress of her over my head and is actually going awesome, although there have been definite lasting effects. I can hand on heart say that she wouldn't be where she is today without my help. Hopefully when she's older and more mature she'll realise that.

This is an update, a couple of weeks before I go back. I've decided that any friend of mine that talks to her I have no choice but to ignore. The girl left me for dead and hopefully once I explain this they'll understand. I'm also getting angry now. The reason is that she will have something to defend her actions and an argument prepared to make me look like a bad person. She always said I was a good person and boyfriend despite all the things she said to me. My hair is still falling out. It's weird because I feel relieved yet more anxious. It's still very confusing for me. 

Thanks for reading,

9edrzb,1,2018-09-09,My friend who I like so much :(,Diemdo2511,u_Diemdo2511,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Diemdo2511/comments/9edrzb/my_friend_who_i_like_so_much/,"I am not a native speaker of english. So please understand if there is grammatical or typo error and wrong word usage. 

This is kinda a sad story of how I met this friend and how we are doing right now at the moment. I will be posting the first half since its a 2 month length of convo and happenings. And I cant do it in one day since I am busy with school. This is a true to life story and will keep on updating if something happens years after. Expect it to be long and dragging but I hope you read it with full understanding on both sides. 

So I met this guy thru chat. Actually I was the one who chatted him first, since I am lonely and bored. Its summer break here in my country that time and my friends are all away with their vacations and I dont have a lot to do. Sooo yeah. 

Anyways, I met him almost 2 months ago, on July 11 2018 to be exact, during that time my school already started and I was studying for my prelims exam coverage. And suddenly my phone notifies me of a person replying to my chat. So thats where it all started . He asked me where I am from and I said philippines. Before I could ask him where is he from, he replied already so shocked. Its because he also just arrived at the philippines that day. This is what he said 

“Omg”
“I am a korean and I am in Manila right now” 

And I was like wooooaaaah! What a good timing I have. But we’re still not able to meet since his in Manila and Im in Bohol. Its like so close but still so far.

and everything for him is so amazing. Really? Like on the day I chatted him and he was also in my country. So it got interesting and we talked for awhile and I said bye eventually coz like I said I was studying that time. So he said bye too and told me to text him if I am done already. 

So fast forward, Its been ALMOST 2 weeks already since we met and for those past weeks we never stopped talking. Like we talked everyday and we even ran out of topic at times but we still managed to continue with our conversation anyways. By those weeks, it feels like I have known him for a really long time and it feels like we’ve been talking for years now. I have learned a lot about him. 
And now 2 weeks and a few days already, he suddenly disappears what I mean is he suddenly stopped messaging me. The last text he sent me, he told me that his stomach hurts. So me as an over thinker, I just started overthinking right away. I was thinking...

Oh maybe he left me already he got bored with me.?
Maybe he blocked me already thats why he cant see my messages ?
Or maybe he was in the hospital since he said his stomach hurts?
Or maybe he’s away with his father in a vacation place?
And many moreeeee

His absence make me realize what I truly felt for him. Because at the time he was gone, I felt sadness growing in me, I also think I was missing him and was feeling hurt by the fact that he just suddenly disappears without saying a thing. Which means??? 
Yes! I think I liked him already. I have grown attached to him. I know that I am too fast but thats how I was made of. At the same time I was worried coz what if he was really in the hospital?

But anyways I decided to wait for him for a few more days maybe he was just sick or busy and he will just comeback. But thennnn, as I waited longer for him I got all so emotional and I was hurting so much thinking he just left me. You know that feeling you get when someone just broke up with you? That you feel like your world is crumbling down? that was the feeling I was getting that time. 

I even cried. And so, I was so hurt and that I can’t do it anymore. I have finally decided to leave his chatroom. But before I could do it, it feels like something is holding me back. So I decided to do it tomorrow. Instead. I wrote him my last long message saying all of my sadness for the past days and I thanking him also for making me happy even tho its just thru chat. I have been lonely and sad for along time and when he finally comes I am finally happy again. And at the near end of my message, there I confessed to him saying that maybe I was hurting this much its because I like him. So I just prayed to God, “please just give him back to me” or maybe just let him read my message so he will know”. 

And the day comes of my departure from his chatroom. But before i did it I went to his Instagram since he hasn’t unfollowed me yet and I messaged him there once again saying that he should read my message on the other app. So I was just hoping he could read it. And sent it. I decided to wait again for 30 mins, i will just got ready for school for the mean time and Then I will finally do it. But theeennn there he is. He is now back! It feels like my world stops for a moment the time I saw his notifications popping out. I was so happy that I cried. And thanked God He answered my prayers.

He sent me a message saying he was sorry for being away for a few days. He said he was hospitalized. And there, I was right. I think overthinking sometimes is good. Our connection is so strong that he told me when he was in the hospital while he was sleeping he dreamt about me. I asked him “what did I do in your dream?” He told me “You were looking for me TTwhen I was in hospital” and I just got goosebumps coz thats what I’ve been doing for the past few days ‘looking for him’ and waiting for him too. But I kinda get disappointed coz he didnt even mention about my confession. But i just didnt mind it all, all I was thinking that time is he is finally here and what could I ask for more? So we continued with our chat like we used to until its august already and by that time my feelings for him grow deeper. I was itching for him to bring up my confession but he didnt. 

So i decided to bring it up myself one day. So there I bring it up but when I already sent it, I suddenly chickened out and says “goodbye lets talk tom ehehe. But he stopped me and said that he wanna talk to. So there I just continued it and I said uhm “do u remember the message I sent you? The longest one?” He said he remembered. And turn out to be he likes me too!!!! OOHHHH YEAH! i was so happy by that time. But then he didnt wanna be committed like I mean we cant be couples since he said we are far from each other. Instead he proposed that 

“We should stay friends, so We can be together for a long time”

And he further explain, since he is still not that good at english he wrote it in korean.

“나 진짜진짜 너 좋아해 그리고 계속 좋아할거같아 ㅜㅜ. 나도 이런 상황이 너무 속상하고 만약에 우리가 완전히 다큰 어른이였다면 난 분명히 너와 다른나라에서 만나서 지낼 수 있는 방법을 찾아봤을거야. 내 감정도 진짜 많이 복잡해. 나는 우리가 서로를 좋아해주고 아끼는 친구로 남으면 혹시나 나중에 저런 날이 올 수도 있다고 생각해. 그리고 난 너와 연락이 끊기면 진짜 많이 속상할거야. 이게 내가 왜 이렇게 생각하는지에 대한 이유가 되기도 해”

And since I dont understand full korean yet so I decided to translate it. 
“I really like you and I think I will continue to like you. I'm also upset about this situation and if we were all grown up, I'm sure I would have found a way to meet and stay in another country. My feelings are also very complicated. I think if we remain friends who love and care for each other, such a day could come in the future. And I would be really upset if I lost contact with you. And that's why I think this way.”

I know that this not accurate, hmm maybe? Hahahahaha 

But in the end I agreed to stay as friends. But basically we’re not just friends anymore. Its like a new version of friend. Because we are indeed friends but we know our feelings for each other. I dont even know what to call us anymore. Ahahaha like he said we are now “...friends who love and care for each other” so yeah thats it. 

After that convo, our conversation kinda leveled up also. Coz now we are not shy about being sweet to each other. We are now more open. So we keep on chatting everyday. Everyday we got so close, he was even able to say “ㄷ...야, I wish you where here” i was like aweeee. Me too I feel the same. He was saying “I hope I could dream of you tonight so we could meet there. And hug and I wanna fall asleep beside you” He said those things to me which I really like :) which means he was really opening up to me. And those kind of convos continues every other night or when times we feel like we want each others attention. Those times, he was acting cute to me made me fall for him more :) he also said “I really wanna travel the world with you” and I said we will do that and I promised him we will do it. We just have to wait alil since we are both students in our 20’s . I dont even have a job yet or a source of income. 

I really wanna meet him but I cant. I want to meet him when I finally have a cash on my own so i could treat him to places with my own money. I cant leave philippines yet. I have to reach my goals first like to finally become an intern, graduate and finally pass my board exam. If all of those 3 are done I think I can finally meet him but with the help of my fathers money first If i want to meet him fast. My father will reward me of a trip to korea. I have told him about it and he said yes.....

Some background:

• 24 years old white european

• Grown up in a wealthy family with loving parents that have given me everything I can ask for.

• Never one of the cool guys in school, being a small guy with chubby cheeks and no talent for sports, but never got bullied either.

• At some point lost my chubby cheeks, and became really good looking. Not an impressive body or height, but nice looking face. I often get compliments on my good looks.

• After years of not being one of the cool kids, I developed a (maybe too) likable personality. Typical people pleaser, feeling bad when people dislikes me, always working on making a good impression.

• Very social and funny, easy time meeting and getting along with new people, even girls. People generally tend to like me immediately. Always positive.

• Doing well career-wise, landing an extremely sought after well-paid internship, and got into a prestigous master's program. My CV is impressive.

Everything seems to be going perfect in my life - I'm really enjoying it - but I have no clue with the girls at all. I lost my virginity at 16, and had one fwb the following year, but after that I totally lost it. After four years of drought I finally got laid again, and the years after I've had sex about twice a year (one night stands) with 5-7's that have basicly thrown themselves at me. I usually get a lot of initial attention from the girls, but after talking to me for 5 minutes they always loose interest. I even tried to keep in touch with two of the one night stands, but they soon became uninterested. I can also mention that I've never had a girlfriend.

And now, the final thing that made me publish this, was a date I had last week. We had a great time, great conversation the entire time and having loads in common, but a few days after when texting about a second date (we had already agreed on doing it), I recieved the ""I didn't feel the chemistry was right""-message.

So what can I do? I've started to hit the gym and working on my style, but I actually think looks are not the main problem here. I have a strong feeling I'm just not spiking any emotions when talking, boring them out, but have no clue how to deal with this. Please help!"

I was immediately put into leadership and had a lot asked of me after baptism last year, I was being brought up to become an intern and or working for the church in the future but recently when i found this subreddit I feel like my faith is lowering more and more, viewing religion in a more skeptical way (I am skeptical in nature) has helped me see all of hypocrisy and terrible things that have been done and are being done through the church. I love the people I lead and friends within the church but I know that as soon as I ""walk away"" they are gonna keep me at an arms distance (which hurts) but I can't just conform. What got me in to he church was my huge crush for a friend and the high of being in power, and the need of a family, through leadership training though I have learned a lot and i'm not the same insecure kid that I once was (which is what they are looking for). Now i'm thinking on my own and a lot of past history as well as current hypocrisy is pushing me away. I would really appreciate some more resources to help me study in which way I should go as well as maybe some advice on how to leave the church from people that have done so! Thanks!"

Immediately after, despite the economic crisis and the rising unemployment rates, I’ve managed to land a good paying internship in one of the most prestigious law firms in our country.

I had a really nice and serene summer which I used to relax, listen to myself and just make peace with all my shortcomings. It was, without a doubt, the most rewarding and satisfactory period of my life.

Yet, ever since I started working, I’ve been dealing with my old friend anxiety. I feel like I don’t belong there, that I am somehow inferior to all those accomplished people even though we all walk the same path of life and have similar skillsets. I know that I am just an intern and law is something you learn while you practice, but this state of inexperience is taking its toll on me. I can’t stand how slow I am, how prone to error I am or even how clueless I am in the office even though those things are completely normal. 

I fear that I won’t be able to overcome this, that it will affect my overall capacity. Apart from my professional side, I’ve begun to lost myself in my thoughts and fears again. This state of nervousness is really not good for socializing, or “balancing work and social life.”

I don’t know mom, I feel overwhelmed. I am trying to be gay in an intolerant country while always hating myself for being in the closet even though it’s for my best interest; or coming out to my friends and trying to maintain my relationships with them. This requires a lot of energy too.
 
I am also trying to lose my depression weight. In the past year I’ve lost  nearly 30 kg. But now, I have some saggy skin and but more impotantly people started to treat me like I’ve become a completely different person.

Sometimes I just can’t adult. I just can’t juggle all these glass balls and I really don’t want any broken glass on the floor but also I can’t keep spinning them. I guess this Sunday night is one of those days.

Wish you weren’t a narcissistic monster so I could talk to you about these things. 

Remember the night I had a night terror when I was 6? You made hot cocoa and played with my hair until I fell asleep. I think I need you to hold me like that and whisper to me that “everything will be fine” and that I am enough as I am. "

But now I'm having an internship, which means I won't be able to practice before 7/8 PM. When I get home I'm usually not at my best focus, since on my internship I'm pretty much doing code all day.

As technical exercises I have: Scales, Appergios, Hanon. Then I have three pieces. One for technical purposes, usually Scarlatti or Bach. Then I have a piece which I do to practice my musical layering, which now is Debussy. Then usually one 'difficult' piece, like a Sonata.

What is a smart way to create good practice? One time I did try to use alarm clocks, so I could really time my practice and focus on just a few measures."

It all started when I failed a class, I'd grown into quite a sexy young girl without even really knowing it yet. Boys were noticing me and so were my teachers. Approached by one of my teachers, in exchange for letting him fuck me, I would pass. At the time I agreed because I didn't want my dad to know I'd failed... So I just went along with it. That's just what started it, since then I've taken dozens more cocks in all my holes. I don't do it for money, though if they pay I guess that's a bonus, I've just got some sick desire to be dominated and fucked over and over. Treated like a sex object by everyone I encounter...

The thing is, I just wasn't enjoying it as much when they were gentle. When they were kind, and sweet, it was just boring... So I made a rule - I won't say no.

However a guy wants to treat me, no matter how bad, if he wants the roughest, messed up, kinkiest sex ever I will grant him his wish if he'll treat me like the little slut that I am.

That's it, that's all I'm asking, just treat me like a complete slut.

Does the overwhelming urge to run people over and steal money come to mind? I got Grand Theft Auto 5 about a few years ago, but now everything started getting sad. Very recently, my friend had broken my original copy (he’s pretty much dead to me) and now my life is sad. I wanted to buy it again, but I definitely can’t. 

My dad is the only one who has a steady job in the house, as he works as a Special Education teacher. Now, that isn’t the best paying job in the world, but it gets us through. Mainly the money that my parents get (my mom used to work as an EMT, but Multiple Sclerosis took that away, she makes a bit of royalties.)  goes to bills and expenses. 

You might be asking “Why don’t you get a job?” Well, here’s the thing. I go to a college prep charter school, and there are a lot of requirements to graduate. I’m on the clock this year with doing internships, and going to my college classes, while balancing homework and keeping my grades up. My school is wicked strict, and I kinda wish I left when I had the chance. Getting a job and doing all my school work would not be the best decision, especially when I get into college. 

If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading. It means a lot.

For the past three years I was a computer science major struggling to succeed and as of this year I’m in the 4th year of junior college. I finally changed majors to something I enjoy and have a plan for the future that I can see and so far enjoy. After this year, I plan on transferring to a 4-year university to finish my bachelors.

As of now, my goal is to double major in general finance and accounting as I enjoy accounting and the finance background has a steady career path I’m looking forward to. However, I currently work 60 hours a week at two separate jobs. One is full time the other is part time.

When I transfer I know I’ll be required to achieve an internship however I know nothing about internships and I don’t know how I’ll fit that in with at least my full time job in order to survive and pay my bills.

I was wondering what advice you guys could give me as to what I should expect for a junior/senior year courseload and how I should go about internships and what I should look for."

9ei04z,20,2018-09-09,I [23F] am very ambitious and my boyfriend [27M] has no drive for anything. How do I work through this?,Kittsuki,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ei04z/i_23f_am_very_ambitious_and_my_boyfriend_27m_has/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years, although we've known each other for a lot longer than that.

I am currently a law student, I'm close to graduation, and every day for me from waking up until going to sleep is mostly classes, law review responsibilities, and internships. I am very work-oriented and ambitious and I really enjoy planning goals for myself and working hard to achieve them. For me, having something to work towards and having goals to drive my life is very important.

My boyfriend on the other hand has no drive for anything. He's always jumped around between jobs, has two associate's degrees that he said he got ""for fun"" but never planned on using his education to pursue a career, and honestly he's never even thought about his future at all.

I know that he's never going to be as driven and goal-oriented as I am, but sometimes it really irritates me how incredibly passive and without motivation he can be, as if he's completely okay with everything other than his own efforts controlling the direction of his life. If I bring it up and complain to him about it, he gets defensive, and is very stubborn about sticking to his usual ways. What's the best way for me to work through this? Should I just accept that this is the way he is and learn to live with the fact that he has no goals for his own life, or is there some way I can convince him to be motivated about something? If I do have to just accept it, what can I do to help me deal with it since it's something that can cause me a lot of irritation sometimes?

TL;DR: I am a highly ambitious and goal-oriented person and my boyfriend has no drive for anything nor plans for his future, which sometimes causes me a lot of frustration. What can I do to work through this?"
9ei79o,14,2018-09-09,This Goes Out to Hungrybox,BanjoStory,teamliquid,https://www.reddit.com/r/teamliquid/comments/9ei79o/this_goes_out_to_hungrybox/,"So, y'all probably saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/teamliquid/status/1038578980754878469?s=21) from yesterday, wherein HBox gets a booklet filled with fans' stories about how HBox has positively impacted their lives.  I had intended to write something up for this booklet, but well... shit happens and I didn't get around to it in time.  So, here's my story about how HBox and Team Curse/Liquid really helped out, me to some degree, but much more a dear friend of mine.

For the sake of the story, we'll call my friend Nick.  Nick and I have been best friends since high school, over 10 years at this point.  Early on, our friendship was largely defined by competing each other in games. Pokemon was the main one, but Halo was another that we played a lot.

Through Halo, we got introduced to MLG.  At the time Halo 2 was THE game at MLG.  But, Super Smash Bros. Melee was another game present at these events in like 2005/2006.  I didn't play Melee, but I was big into Smash 64, so I took an interest in it anyway.  In particular, I was a big Mew2King fan, because he had a Pokemon name.  Nick was never that into Smash, period.  I was way better than him at it because I grew up playing Smash 64, so there wasn't really much competition to be had, there. I just rekt him.  After Halo 3 came out, our interest in MLG kind of waned. Brawl came out not too long after, so I assumed the Melee died too.

Cut to a couple years later, Nick and I are in college.  We both go to the same school, and the hot new game on the scene is League of Legends.  It's not exactly a game that lends itself to competition among friends, so we play together and end up following the competitive scene as fans.  I like EpiK Gamer, he's more into TSM.  Epik eventually disbands, and my fandom shifts over to who else, but the newly formed Team Curse featuring former Epik players, DontMashMe and Doublelift.  The fandoms kind of solidify once LCS becomes a thing in 2013.

So, with myself established as a dedicated Team Curse fan, I started paying attention to the other esports that they fielded.  Imagine my surprise when in 2014 they picked up Chillindude829 and Hungrybox, two Super Smash Bros. Melee players.  I had up to that point assumed that Melee had died in like 2007.  Of course, I dove into researching these players with gusto, and started looking out for Melee tournaments that were being streamed, with the first major I watched being The Big House 4, where HBox actually didn't do so hot. But, it was a fun watch anyway, so I started watching more Melee.

Meanwhile, college is kind of getting the better of Nick. He's kind of gone off a deep end with his drinking, and he ends up dropping out.  He had always had an issue with drinking. He never knew when to stop, and his personality changed drastically as he drank.  He would go from a genuinely really friendly guy to a raving lunatic who was dangerous to himself and everyone around him.  After he dropped out, he started working overnights at a Target, so we really didn't see each other much, just because scheduling was hard.  We kind of drifted apart.

Cut to, 2016.  I'm working on my Master's Degree, and Nick is back in school finishing his Bachelor's.  I studied abroad for my Master's, so we hadn't seen, or even spoke to each other in about a year.  I got back to the States around Thanksgiving, and that following weekend I get a phone call from Nick.  He tells me that he just got out of the hospital.  He had tried to commit suicide a couple nights prior by jumping off a bridge.  A security guard had apprehended him before he could get all the way over the railing.  He said he didn't remember it, and just kind of ""woke up"" on the bridge with the guard on top of him.  They diagnosed him bipolar, and got him on meds for it.  I was the first person he called when he got out of the hospital... before his parents even.

I lived about four hours away from him at the time, so I couldn't exactly go be there for him right away.  So, I called a few mutual friends in the area and set up a network of people to be checking up on him in the wake of his diagnosis.  Meanwhile, I want to be there for him as much as I can, so I start trying to play games with him again.  We start with League of Legends, but that peters out pretty quick.  Eventually, I ask if he wants to start playing Melee.  I explain to him that there's still an active competitive scene for it, and that I've literally never played it before, so unlike with 64, we'd both be starting from square one. So, we get Netplay hooked up and dive in.  We were using XBox controllers at the start, because neither of us had a Gamecube controller adapter. Funnily enough, we both picked Samus at first.  He, because he loves Metroid games, me because I thought she seemed like a character that required relatively few inputs and would thus be a decent beginner character.  We eventually both shifted off Samus, him to Ganon, me to Sheik.  We started playing on Netplay against each other every night.  Even though it was laggy as fuck, we still were just having a ton of fun experimenting with the game.  A couple months later (January 2017), I landed an internship in the same city he lives in, it's super short notice so I dont have time to find a place of my own, and he's kind enough to let me live with him.  We're literally sleeping in bunk beds at 26 years old.

Of course, we end up playing a ton of Melee in this time, and Nick's getting way into it.  Like, he's falling asleep to playlists of Bizarro Flame sets.  We start having a weekly competition with each other, where we basically do a crew battle where he uses five characters and I use five characters, we start training counterpicks for each other's characters in secret. It's like we're 15 playing Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green again, it's so much goddamn fun.  Obviously, we start watching tournaments together too. I'm a dedicated Liquid and therefore HBox fan, and he's rooting for whomever HBox is playing against, not because he dislikes HBox in particular, but because our relationship has always been defined by competition so he isn't allowed to like the same player I like.  The fact that HBox was #1 in the world by this point made watching tournaments together all the more entertaining, because I got to play the heel by supporting the favorite. 

My internship ran for 6 months, after which I got a job out of town again.  So I moved away, but we kept netplaying with each other for a while.  A couple months after I moved I got a text from him saying that he had gone to his first tournament.  He went 1-2, but had an awesome time.  He got his one win against a Young Link, which he made sure to thank me for, since I played Young Link a lot against him, and he got the chance to play some friendlies with AbsentPage and couldn't believe how good he was.

I don't see Nick very often anymore, but we still are in contact pretty regularly. It seems like he's in a pretty good spot in regards to getting his bipolarism evened out and his life back on track. He's way better than me at Melee now.

So, shoutouts to Hungrybox.  It was through you that I was able to learn about Melee, and it was through Melee that I was able to help out a troubled friend when he needed it most."
9ei7l7,1,2018-09-09,How do I (21M) ask my close friend (21F) on a date in a low stakes way?,MuchoStupid,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ei7l7/how_do_i_21m_ask_my_close_friend_21f_on_a_date_in/,"My friend and I are both college students. We met freshman year in a class, and were casual acquaintances for about a year. Eventually 2nd year we started working an on-campus job together where she was my boss. We became good friends over the year. We had a lot in common, and when we talked we would sometimes stand around for hours and lose track of time together. Around April of that year I asked her out on a date. 

She declined after a few days of thinking about it, because she was about to leave for an internship, and didn't feel it was appropriate as she was my boss at the time. She said she would love to remain friends, and that if I was interested when she returned we could maybe work something out.

We ended up texting pretty much every day since then (over a year) while she way away and she returned in January of this year. We've hung out many times since then, and are very close friends now. We still talk almost every day, which she initiates like 80% of the time, and have a one year long snapchat streak going.

I still am interested in her, and none of the problems she had last time are present. I am on my own internship now in our college town and she is taking classes, so she isn't my boss, and we will both be here for at least 13 more weeks. Should I ask her out again, or was she just being polite in turning me down with the reasons she gave?

I have a hard time gauging her interest as she hasn't dated before, and doesn't really seem to pick up on the hints I'll occasionally try out. I can't tell if she's not interested or just oblivious.

The other question is how/where to ask her out. I'd like it to be somewhere where if she says no and things get awkward we can both just go our separate ways. Normally we hang out at one of our houses or one of us drives the other when we go out places. This makes it hard to leave if things don't go well. I really hope she would say yes, but if she does say no, I don't want it to be hard on either of us, especially her, and I definitely don't want to ruin the friendship if it doesn't work out.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If there are any questions I'll do my best to give additional details.

TL;DR : I want to ask out my close friend without it being too awkward if she says no or possibly killing the friendship. Should I and if so how?"

&amp;#x200B;

19 years old, athlete, musician, go to a top school in the US. I have a good life on the outside.

&amp;#x200B;

Internally, I have often felt lonely, depressed, and meaningless.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had casual flings with girls before, but I never committed to a relationship because I couldn't find a girl that seemed worth the work and investment. Then, at an event at the end of the school year, I met a girl from another top college who was everything that I wanted. She was kind, nurturing, Jewish, a virgin, from a good family, wealthy, caring, thoughtful, chill, people-oriented and smart. She was the first girl I went exclusive with. We had a 4 month summer fling while I worked a finance internship in New York. She made me food, when she stained my sheets, she cleaned them, she flexed her schedule to meet me after work, and was overall a perfect girlfriend. I felt really happy and fulfilled. Like, if the universe had no meaning, that was ok because this girl and I were together.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not someone who gets connected to people easily. Most of the time I am relatively unfeeling when it comes to others. I mostly focus on my own work and goals (sports, lifting, singing, math degree). I want to be close to people, but I find it difficult to find people I can truly care about in a deep way.

&amp;#x200B;

What Happened:

&amp;#x200B;

I went exclusive with this girl over the summer, letting her know it was just a summer fling. We had a wonderful time, seeing each other about twice a week and going to many sites throughout the city. I ate dinner with her parents. I went to the beach with her. With watched movies and the sun set. We taught each other things and discussed books. She spent her second to last day with me in the city the whole day. I really got connected to this girl. I told her things that I had never talked about before. She shared emotions with me too.  when it was time to say goodbye I actually cried. She got sad, but only let out a single tear. She explained that she had mentally prepared herself for this. She held me. We split because I was leaving the city. I had been told long distance relationships don't work and I was too young for that.  We go to colleges two hours away from each other. She was my first exclusive relationship.  We parted ways in early August. She sent me a 50 page memoir she wrote as a token to commemorate our relationship. I read it and we talked about it the next week by phone for half an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the next week hiking the Rockies. I sent her a picture from there and she sent me three back. That was in mid August. She then went to Berlin the next week and sent me nothing. Today I wished her a happy Jewish New Year by text and she wished me the same with a smiley face. Other than that, I haven't contacted her.

&amp;#x200B;

I've meditated nearly every day in the last year. The first week after our relationship, I cried every day thinking about her. Then the second week I was feeling a little better but still sometimes cried during my meditations. The next week I got back to college and started crying during every meditation again thinking about her. It has been 34 days since we went our separate ways.

&amp;#x200B;

People told me that if I met other girls, I would start to feel better. I downloaded tinder and hooked up with two girls from my college. I also went to my first frat party and hooked up with another girl. I didn't feel better. The thing is that it only made me feel more empty. I just miss this girl more. When I am around other girls I can't help but think how much happier I would be with this girl from the summer. It's not even a sexual thing (though the sex was much better because of the connection). It's just that I want to hold this girl again and feel her affection. I don't have that deeper purpose with other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do not know what to do. I know she probably moved on. Maybe she is even happy with a new guy. I hope she's happy. I have good friends at school, but I'm still lonely and missing this girl. How much and in what way should I stay in contact with her? Advice from older redditers is appreciated."

I've meditated nearly every day in the last year. The first week after our relationship, I cried every day thinking about her. Then the second week I was feeling a little better but still sometimes cried during my meditations. The next week I got back to college and started crying during every meditation again thinking about her. It has been 34 days since we went our separate ways.

&amp;#x200B;

People told me that if I met other girls, I would start to feel better. I downloaded tinder and hooked up with two girls from my college. I also went to my first frat party and hooked up with another girl. I didn't feel better. The thing is that it only made me feel more empty. I just miss this girl more. When I am around other girls I can't help but think how much happier I would be with this girl from the summer. It's not even a sexual thing (though the sex was much better because of the connection). It's just that I want to hold this girl again and feel her affection. I don't have that deeper purpose with other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do not know what to do. I know she probably moved on. Maybe she is even happy with a new guy. I hope she's happy. I have good friends at school, but I'm still lonely and missing this girl. How much and in what way should I stay in contact with her? Advice from older redditers is appreciated."
9ejftq,4,2018-09-09,I was told that I’m “abandoning my family”...am I missing something?,Jeru1226,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9ejftq/i_was_told_that_im_abandoning_my_familyam_i/,"To be clear, maybe this is all in my head... but I need to think out loud. I’m graduating from college a little late after transferring from a community college while working. I had an internship lined up for this summer while my partner needed to work on an academic paper (in part, to prove his chops for a job he has desperately wanted for years). We were told we could use the space downstairs for two months while we worked. At the last minute, my sister also moved into a living room space after landing a job—a space that meant no privacy for her and also meant we had to leave the door open so she could use the bathroom at any time. I told my folks that she should take the spare room upstairs because it would be too crowded. My mom complained that would require moving all the documentation for her home business and would only do it if my sister insisted. My sister did not want the room. She was promised the opportunity to renovate the downstairs before she started her job... when my partner and I were promised the space.
Additionally, I knew that my partner and my sister were absolutely going to clash. They both independently told me that they felt “conned into moving in”. After a few miserable weeks of my sister making comments about how he was “bringing in roaches” from leaving sparking water cans out, my partner furious at having to unexpectedly live with a cat he was allergic to, I decided I needed to move out. 
Maybe the way I did it was fucked up. I was too uncomfortable to talk about it for a day or two, causing even more tension and upset. Eventually, I explained that the living situation wasn’t working and that I found another place for the rest of the summer. My mom burst into tears and told me I was making cruel, inflexible proclamations, my dad accused me of “abandoning the family” and my partner of being abusive, and my sister said I was playing martyr and being selfish. They all told me that “science won’t give me a heart”.
My partner has always been there for me. He really has. In the worst parts of my academic career, he’s been supportive and kind; he moved an hour away from school so we could live together for the past two years.  
I kept a straight face, apologized for making the tension worse, didn’t insult anyone, and moved out. My mom came downstairs a few more times to scream in my face. She also threw herself on the floor screaming “don’t yell at me, I’m your mother!” 
I came back twice a week on social visits to make it clear that I wasn’t “abandoning” anyone.  My sister moved into the room and immediately started renovating the downstairs, brought over her boyfriend and his dog. My parents are paying for the renovation.
 I’m graduating at 25 because I went to community college to save money—I was accepted  to the UC’s I applied to and didn’t go. I pushed my sister to go to the university she graduated from and then restructured my parent’s finances so we could both graduate debt free. There was one time, maybe two years ago,  where I and sister dropped my parents off at the airport as they went on a European vacation and she mentioned something about mom paying for car insurances and rents on top of the school supplies. She said “oh, doesn’t she cover yours?”....which no...she didn’t.
I didn’t tell them, but I did tell my partner and his family how I paid for everything. My partner’s family has been really kind and helpful with everything, especially his dad. I was just sick of having my parents panic to me about money. Maybe it’s my fault for not telling them how I was doing things. 
Yesterday, after a few weeks, although we seemed to resolve things, my mom said that she was still angry and thought that I was I was being unfair to everyone and have been picking fights.
 I just wanna scream. All I needed was my own space when the living situation was making me miserable. Am I a shitty person for this?! "

Thanks for taking the time to read this prompt. After thinking this through and rewriting it a couple of times, it seems very 50 Shades, and that's absolutely not the vibe I'm going for, so please don't be put off by that!! 

\*\*The Intern\*\*

You're a senior partner in your company, you've been married for 20 years, you married your highschool sweetheart and you've been growing to resent the frumpy, unfulfilling woman your wife has become. 

You're 40+, how you look is entirely your domain, and age is negotiable.

Now, my name is Tahlia, and I'm 18, fresh out of high school and interning at your company thanks to my Daddy, who works somewhere up in the top 3 stories of the building, with a massive stick up his ass and no real clue as to what people do in the real world.

I have long blond hair, blue eyes and I'm about 5'3, I'm curvaceous, my pencil skirt clings to my plump ass and the buttons on my blouse are straining against my breasts, trying to keep them in. I wear thigh high stockings that I seem to always have trouble with around your office, I bring you in coffee or your printing from the machine and bend down next to you or in front of your desk to fix my stockings or straighten my skirt, occasionally rolling my skirt up just a little bit higher than necessary and adjusting my clips, letting you see just a flash of my milky white thigh, soft as silk and just begging for you to touch it.

This could be my first day, or a few weeks in, you might have to call me in to your office for a review of my work, or maybe for a telling off about my clothing, and things can progress from there. I'm into either non-con or something very rough, I don't want to be asked, I want you to take me. I also want this to be longterm so we can build it up beforehand, lots of teasing, lots of descriptive outfits etc, and then we can move from your office to my home, your home, the options are endless really. 

\*\*The Babysitter\*\*

You're a single dad, (40+) your wife is off in some European country pretending she doesn't have kids and being a slut. You work from home, and your 5 &amp; 7 year olds are not helping you get any work done, so you decide it's time to bite the bullet and hire some help. The idea of some 50 year old nanny shuffling around the house smelling like mothballs doesn't exactly excite you, but you need the help and it's not like you can't afford it.

You're on your 4th interview of the day, it's a nightmare, this grey headed old tart is clearly flirting with you and clearly has no interest in looking after the kids. You make your excuses and apologies, telling her you'll let her know by the end of the week and close the door after her, sighing deeply and rubbing your chin with your hand, your week old stubble needing a bit of attention. You're unaware of a young woman watching you from the foyer, hands folded neatly on her lap, her jeans clinging to her curves, making her look like she was poured into them.

I stand up and clear my throat awkwardly, you start and look at me for a moment, raising one eyebrow inquisitively. 

I hold out my hand to you, ""I'm Tahlia, I'm here about the nannying job""

You stare for a second longer, and take my hand, immediately sending electricity dancing down my fingers and settling nicely in my panties. You usher me through into your study and sit across the large wooden desk from me.

I sit down and hand you my resume, hoping that the fact that I'm barely 18 isn't a hindrance. 

Okay so this one I'm still blonde, petite, curvy, superb tits (obviously) and maybe a bit naive, innocent. I'm not sure how it would play out but I'm excited to hear your ideas :)

I'm a rough non con kinda girl so would love for these to be in that area, but am also open to whatever you'd like. I aim to please. 

I'm willing to work inside your limits and to the very boundary of mine. :)

I am a senior college student who just completed my first summer internship with a healthy sum of money. I am a fairly experienced rider with over a decade on dirt and I've had my license for almost 5 years. I have put quite a few miles on my dad's R1200GS but now I feel it's time to get my own.

I found a craigslist ad for a 2013 F800GS in seemingly great condition with 3000 miles for $8000. The problem is that this is most of my net worth at this point and I'm having trouble stopping myself from pulling the trigger. If I do purchase I will still have more money than I did before the summer began.

I am still working my internship part time so insurance/maintenance shouldn't be a problem monetarily. 

Would this purchase be a mistake? "
9ekxq9,0,2018-09-10,"Me [24 M] with my SO [24 F] 4 years (sorta), not sure if/when I should clarify/disclose an old fact;text",throaway5423,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9ekxq9/me_24_m_with_my_so_24_f_4_years_sorta_not_sure/,"So this is gonna be an incredibly long post. Sorry, and I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. But recently (about a couple weeks ago) I started seeing this girl that I've had an on and off very complicated relationship (never official or whatever until now though) with for the last 4 years. 

It started back in the summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college. I was in a different relationship at the time (very serious, was about a year and a half old), and I went to do an internship in a different state across the country. There were some other fundamental issues in that relationship, and basically me shipping off for 3-4 months led us to ""take a break"" or ""breakup"" (at this juncture I don't remember the specific terminology we used, and I feel like Ross shouting ""WE WERE ON A BREAK"" over and over) for that time. 

I go to this internship and end up starting to sleep with a couple different people. (The morality of this is not what I'm calling into question, I know I was a total idiot for even doing so, but it happened.) I end up meeting and sleeping with this one girl (now SO - we'll call her Regan) and we really, really have a strong connection. Really, honestly haven't felt(feel - I love her very much now) that way ever about another human. It was(is) insane.

She ends up finding out that I was concurrently sleeping with other people, and we get into a whole fight (in which I lie - she caught it right away, I felt terrible about even attempting it...but I was being dumb. No excuses there.) and stop talking for a brief period of time. (This is in fact what I want to get back to, as I the inciting incident was about one person specifically and the fact I had slept with another person may or may not have been brought up, I don't recall. We'll get more into this later.)

We end up talking again after attempting to sort through that stuff and basically decide continue our summer fling (with no real resolution to my actions). Again, I really, really like her. It's a bit overwhelming and also I'm completely disregarding the other messy relationship I was to go back home too. However, Regan lived across the country from where I did so as the summer ended, we came to the realization that we would never see each other again and that was that. 

I go back home, and go back to the previous relationship. We try to make things work but it winds up not (shocker I know). Meanwhile me and Regan talk on and off. Some drunk calls, some casual conversation. At one point we do disclose that we do love each other, but again, the probability of me seeing her ever again are astronomically slim. 

We both were in the same major (hence why we were at the same internship together) but she was a year above me. A couple years go by and in the fall/winter of my junior year of college (her senior year), she informs me that her advisor wanted her to apply to graduate school at my current university. Crazy shit. 

She does, and ends up coming to interview. She figures out she can stay an extra day and does to hangout with me. We do, and it's an awesome time, our chemistry is obviously still there. Regan then decides that she's going to come to graduate school at my university, making her first year in grad school coincide with my senior year there. Again, I had come to grips with the idea I would never see her again, so I'm so excited. 

Then the summer before that academic year comes. And she basically goes AWOL on me. We went from talking on the phone every night to hardly even texting. She had picked up a summer job that wound up being very intense and stressful, couple that with getting ready to move across the country to start graduate school, and I knew she was going through a lot mentally/emotionally. I figured I would give her space, and did so. However, she barely informed me of what her plans were in terms of moving. I had to pry that information out of her and it was clear there was some form of tension. 

She eventually moves, and trying to see/talk to her is tough. When we hangout everything feels fine, but there is still a tension I can't quite describe. I try to talk about it and she won't. Eventually after a month or so of this, she does, and basically admits that she was feeling a pressure and anxiety about being in a relationship with me. She felt like on one hand it made sense because it was crazy that we were close in distance finally, but that she couldn't let go some of my actions from the summer we met. We part ways and I'm a little hurt, wishing we could've talked about it more. 

Two years go by and that takes us to now. We start talking again (I've moved three hours away to start graduate school myself) and things are awesome. I have to go back and visit a couple times (for a friend's wedding, and my band had a show), so we hangout and it's awesome. And recently we decided to start having a real relationship. 

This brings me to where I need advice. We had talked about this stuff a couple times before, and I want to be fully open and honest with her. I betrayed her honesty once already, and that's the source of this anxiety from her. One night during our conversations about this she made mention of ""yeah when you slept with x and whomever else you slept with down there"" (referring to the internship summer). The thing that is bothering me is I don't recall if I've ever directly mentioned who it was/if I did sleep with anyone else. I think I have, but we have had so many conversations about it and she's fixated on person x that I just don't remember. We had a really tough convo today about her feelings and in it I told her I'm trying to be as open and honest. And I am because I adore her so much and I want this...I need this...to work out. 

But I'm not sure if it's worth it to drudge up that memory for the sake of a clarification, especially when we're so fragile at the moment. She seems to know based on vague comments like I mentioned before, but hasn't asked about it specifically, even when I've asked her ""is there anything you want clarification or want to talk about?"" So maybe she doesn't care/doesn't want to know at this juncture. I'm just not sure how to handle it. 

TLDR; Have an old memory my SO seems to remember but she hasn't been specific about it. Not sure if I need to bring it up or if I should wait for her to come to me about it directly if she has questions about it.

9elq0y,1,2018-09-10,[M4F] Set of Scenarios or Send Your Own,RPThrowaway85,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9elq0y/m4f_set_of_scenarios_or_send_your_own/," Hi there, I'm a 24 M looking for a female to potentially roleplay some of these scenarios with me that will probably have a significant amount of plot involved, but with plenty of room for other things. Some of the scenarios will be more explicitly taboo (not for everyone I know) naturally all characters will be 18+, others will be romance driven. I'm also happy to chat with you about making a scenario that isn't any of these ones or is based off them. I expect this to be long term as well:

1. I've been your boss for many years, maybe you were my intern who we then hired full time, perhaps you're my secretary who has been with me through my rise through the company. Regardless we decide to spend some time together out of work, having never done it before and find that connect on more levels than we expected.
2. We're both at a party hosted by a mutual friend, we have at various points had crushes on each other, tonight the stars seem to have aligned as we've both crashed out of our relationships and are now single at the same time.
3. You're my wealthy (Step) Mother and you've been taking care of me since my father died, I've come back from my first year of college and you've decided that you'd rather I not leave you and take steps to ensure that I stay with you. Even going as far as some extreme measures to ensure that no other woman will want me (We can talk about these)
4. You're my older (step) sister who is much more successful and accomplished than me and we decide to meet for a drink at your place, where you choose to gloat at how much more successful you've been than. Gradually grinding down my self-esteem and respect until you decide to take advantage of it for your own satisfaction.
5. You're my bratty spoiled younger (step) sister and you've found some dirt on me. You decide to use this to blackmail into doing your bidding, this can be sexual or non-sexual so long as it's demeaning to me and at the expense of my social life/reputation.
6. One of us is prisoner/guard (I'm fine playing either), the prisoner uses their charms, at first only to get small benefits, but then eventually wraps the guard around their will using their charisma and ability to seduce people. This could go in lots of directions, including an eventual escape/partners in crime type scenario.
7. You're my best friend, we've always had a latent attraction to each other throughout the time we grew up together. We told each other (almost) everything and feel incredibly close. We begin with you staying over at my house (or me at yours) just hanging out, knowing that our time together is running short as we'll be away for college soon (all characters 18+).
8. We're two partners in crime planning the biggest heist of our lives, once we do this job we're set for life. The only thing is after so many years working closely together we may decide not to part ways after this final job and see if the chemistry we had together is something more.
9. Something a bit more fantasy based, we're two adventurers who have been travelling the world together. Other companions have come and gone, but the only constant has been us two, sticking together through thick and thin. We begin at a tavern where we're resting between adventures and I decide to bring you a gift to celebrate and we see how we proceed from there.

We can discuss Kinks/limits on Kik, I'm open to a lot of things and these scenarios are just guidelines, we can adapt/change them and create a scenario that suits both of us. Or you can send your own idea, I'm totally game to try something else provided you come with the idea. Kik is Axannar looking forward to hearing from you."

9empy1,1,2018-09-10,[M4A] The Tyranny of the Hunt,LifeSucksSoDoI,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9empy1/m4a_the_tyranny_of_the_hunt/,"Here’s a fun tip: if you value the sanctity of your asshole, don’t make deals with the Fae. I used to be a normal guy. Yeah, okay, a bit shy, a bit closed-off, maybe a little feminine, but normal. But now?

Now I’m running through a forest in the middle of the night, bare-ass naked, nipple rings bouncing madly on my chest, trying not to overbalance from the weight newly added to my thick, jiggly ass. Behind me, I can hear the baying of the hounds.

I mean, it’s not *all* bad. I remember that as I leap over a tangle of roots, bounce of the trunk of a tree and into a leaping roll, pop up and dive beneath a bush and into yet more forested terrain. I sure couldn’t have done *that* as an unpaid intern for a legal firm. It’s just, well, you usually hope to learn parkour skills from a class, or maybe by becoming an international superspy. Not in a trial-by-fire against a warparty of merciless hunters using you as sport.

Speaking of the hunters, they’re getting closer. The hounds are actually audible by their effect on the terrain behind me, snapping through roots and branches and knocking the occasional tree down. I’ve been caught by them before. Not a good experience. I cast an eye around, looking for a probable path, and alight upon a raised root. If I can just launch off it right…

And then I’m running in the trees.

The dogs fall away beneath me, unable to follow. Perfect. I’m congratulating myself, quite secure in my own genius, when I feel something shift under my feet and the world slips away from under me. I feel the wind leave my lungs, my body bunched up tight, and a swinging motion takes over my senses.

I wait, trapped in a net.

After some time, hoofbeats approach. The baying of the hounds is close after, but controlled, just barely. They’re with their master.

*Fuck.*

The sound of tinkling laughter reaches my ear, mixed with the rough barks and howls from the hounds. A few words pass out of hearing, and then: “Caught so quickly, man-thing!” Unfortunately, I know the voice.

A blade deftly slits the net, as if by magic -- or quite possibly, simply by magic -- and I fall unceremoniously into a circle of light, hounds just beyond the edge of the ring. Before me, far, far above on the back of a horse, a thin face gazes down at me. Lord Alfykaol. Privately, I prefer to call him Alfie, but, well, after he heard me say it the first time… not very loudly. Not very loudly at all.

“A good hunt, Lord,” I say, head bowed demurely. “My compliments to the hounds.” The mutts in question snarl from outside the circle of light, and I raise my voice. “Good job, boys! Led your master right to me, huh?”

“They need little credit,” Alfie sniffs. “You are not a difficult mark to track. I could have followed you myself with both eyes torn from my head and had you just as easily.” Always humble, him.

“All right, all right.” I grumble, head turned away. “So, Lord, what will it be this time? Thrown to the hounds? Passed around by you and your pals? Ooh, perhaps servicing the horses again?”

The lord’s face twists with something I eventually recognize as amusement. “Some… combination therein.” I wonder at his meaning, and then without a touch he urges his steed into the circle and I realize the terrifyingly obvious. He isn’t riding a horse tonight. His bare torso simply merges smoothly into the neck of a white charger, skin turning to hide seamlessly. I wonder briefly and unpleasantly if he grew the legs himself or if some poor horse out there is missing its body, and then those thoughts are cut off by soft hoof-falls behind me.

As I see the massive, swaying shape under the body, my mouth drops open, and I heard Alfie hiss with amusement. “Yes, manling, yes. Just like that…”

And the night is bright, and full of terrors.

A simple concept, but so many possibilities. Your character doesn’t have to be the lord outlined in the prompt, but then it hardly matters: any face the Fae wear is, at best, temporary. It’s up to you what sort of character you want to play, but twisted ones are preferred.

Of course, there’s quite a lot of potential here for a lot of diverse, fucked-up stories. I mean, what do the Fae actually want? To break me? To liberate me? To transform me into something like them? That’s up to us to decide! So are the kinks for this roleplay, which will hopefully be abundant.

This is not an exhaustive list, but: dubcon, beast, huge cocks, tentacles, rough sex, mindbreak, cum inflation, body transformation, body modification, mind alteration, oviposition, male pregnancy, forced orgasm, shapeshifting, sweat, musk, watersports, slavery, freeuse, humiliation, bondage, and the kitchen sink.

My limits for this roleplay are: complete transformation into a woman, scat, sexual gore, diapers, necrophilia, anthro/furry (a fine line, open to discussion), chastity, cock/ball torture, and completely losing it. Because where’s the fun in a broken toy?

Message me with your character’s name and title in the subject of your message and a description of their favored form, if any, and their favored ways to play with a captured plaything in the body of your message.

Happy hunting.

So I'm an intern in a company in Dubai and I've been asked to look into some potential office space for the company to expand into in Kuwait, but I've never been to Kuwait and it's proven extremely hard to find this information online - nothing exists like Dubizzle in Dubai or the like.

If anyone knows of any commercial space in or around Kuwait City or any real estate company that can help me find any such places I would be extremely grateful for your help!

What we're looking for is something around 2000-2500 sqft (~186 - 233sqft) with good amenities (parking etc.) in a good area. 

The people I've called in Kuwait say that serviced office space is too small for my needs and that we should look for open space and arrange furniture ourselves, which we're happy to do.

If you know anything that could be at all useful, like a Tower/location to call or an agency to get in touch with, please do let me know!

Thanks guys! (P.S. much love from /r/dubai)

9enw1f,1,2018-09-10,47[M4F] Daughter’s roommate,ClearlyALoon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9enw1f/47m4f_daughters_roommate/,"I’ve posted this one before and have had fun with it. If you’re not up for long back and forth, but you just want to chat, that works too.

*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa (but you can choose a different name, if you prefer). I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "

9eogyl,52,2018-09-10,Pissed Off After a Weekend with my MIL,luvstovent,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9eogyl/pissed_off_after_a_weekend_with_my_mil/,"I'm new here... have read and tried to familiarize myself with the rules, so I'm hoping to not violate any of them. Basically I've found myself venting a lot about my MIL in the sub I regularly spend time in, so it's time for a different sub!

Context: my DH and I are moving across the country soon to be closer to my family after planning it for 2 years but being too scared to tell my ILs. A lot of the following passive aggression from my MIL is I think related to this move, but that's not an excuse for being shitty, and she exhibited behavior like this before we told them about moving. 

Other context: I originally moved to this god-forsaken state because I was diagnosed with severe bipolar, and I needed a fresh start, so I signed up to do a year-long volunteer assignment. Met my DH, decided to stay temporarily, and have now been here 5 years. Have I mentioned I'm ready to GTFO? I'm so sick of my MIL and her bullshit, but I can never say that to my DH, so here I am.

I just spent a weekend with my ILs. It was the first time we saw them after we bought a house in our new location, so they're pretty angry I think. But they are the silent type. My MIL bottles everything up until she can't anymore and then basically throws tantrums and treats my FIL like shit in front of all of us. So she resorts to passive aggression instead.

I'm in an online graduate program, and my main research interest is healthy food access and public health. I was doing a little research at the breakfast table Saturday morning and happened to make a passing comment about a government program. My MIL was sitting there, and she got this sneering look on her face and started talking about how ""the government shouldn't dictate what people eat."" In her voice I could hear the subtextual critique of Michelle Obama. I'm a Democrat and my ILs are very conservative. I have no problem with this, but they take it personally that I'm not a Republican, so it's turned into a battle of little comments about why my political views are illegitimate, even though I try to avoid politics like the plague. But in this instance, I really didn't think my mention of Healthy People 2020 would contribute to this battle. I mean, Healthy People was a thing when GW was president; I thought it was pretty benign.

Anyway, the conversation quickly turned to my GC SIL, and how it's soooo amazing that she's going to study law (don't get me wrong, I think it's great that she's going back to school in her early 40s). My MIL kept talking about how she's praying for all the doors to open for my SIL. 

But this is the other thing. When I was in my family's home state looking at houses a few weeks ago, I interviewed for and accepted an internship position. It's unpaid, but I really think it will lead to a job, and I'm super excited because I was basically fired for no reason from my volunteer position and haven't done anything work-wise since then. This was another opportunity for my MIL to bring me down. First, she didn't say anything about it at all, even though I'd posted about my excitement in the private family FB group. Then, she said ""so, what is this internship you have? And you're not getting anything for it? To me, that sounds more like volunteer work, like what I've done at the church."" This is of course bullshit because the internship was not easy to come by, and the interview was pretty scary for me. But again, to contrast it with the way she talks about my SIL and how she's ""praying so hard for her"" just sickens me. 

This weekend, she also tried to convince me to take a year off from my graduate program because ""my plate is too full"" (this grad program is what's kept me going over the last year). She also gave me all this shit she didn't want, even though she knows I'm moving and am trying to get rid of stuff. Her excuse was ""you guys are purging, well I'm purging too."" It's impossible to say no when she gives me crap I don't need, and I know it's not because they are gifts... it's because she shops too much and then offloads her shit onto me. 

This shit is torturing me, because I can't talk to my DH about it, but I'm obsessing over it. I stayed up til 4:30am last night obsessing and being angry at my MIL for basically raining on my parade. I cannot wait to finally move and get tf away from her."

Programming sorta comes along with that, I have experience (my mains are Python, C, C++, Racket) in many languages (some projects in Java, C#, and etc) and can adapt quickly to whatever tooling is needed. For example, I had to pick up Apache Pig to manage some data during an internship, or Matlab for my current job.

Work would have to be after core hours 9am-4pm, but I am open to anything outside of that. My two work experiences are Data Science Intern and Research Scientist, so I am used to wearing many hats. Let me know if you think I can help.

I don't know if there even is part-time CS work, and if I'm honest, I am trying to work more now so I can pay of student loans faster, maybe my best bet is to work at a coffee shop."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

D- i also have internship experience for 3 month , with two years of work in my university student council and treasury for IET club.  

questions   
1- what are my chances of landing a job in the automation industry ? provided i got my certificate and trained for 2-3 month on using the programming language with simulation software.  


2- will employers be hesitant to hire me because i only have 18 month visa only ?

We both live in the same state, just opposite corners (290mi/ 467km). It's about a 5 hour drive for me to visit him. 

The last 5 months I have been able to drive over and visit him for a weekend each month, but due to college starting up soon, our work schedules changing a bit, and snow that will be on the mountain pass I drive through things don't look too good for visits. I'm not sure when we will be able to visit each other in the near future. 

We are really lucky to be in the same state/timezone/ within a driving distance with planning. Maybe I'm just getting too overwhelmed by this new change. Not knowing when I will be able to see him next makes my heart hurt more than the normal amount from missing him. 

We're good about texting, calling, Facetiming, watching movies on Netflix together, sending packages but that only helps so much. 

How do you and your SO deal with (hopefully short term) stress and sadness of not being able to be together?  What's the longest you have gone between visits and how did you make that work?

I've spent the past year learning mostly front-end stuff (responsive CSS, React, Redux, etc), but also a little Node/Express, MongoDB, etc. My resources have been Harvard CS50, youtube, Udemy, freeCodeCamp, and a smattering of others.

I've made a portfolio of some projects: http://matthewmasurka.com

...I've already had experienced developers give me feedback on my resume, but I have zero work experience in the field and the extent of my formal education was a Bachelor of Music.

I definitely don't want to move so that limits my options. I live near 'silicon beach', so I think staying here makes sense in the long run. I've applied to about 10 positions so far, but was only moved to the second phase of the application process for one of them (still waiting to hear back). I know that's not many, but I'm honestly not finding many open positions for junior React developers. Most of them list +4 years experience required and/or a CS degree and/or other languages I'm not familiar with yet. A lot of the job postings require React Native experience, so I've been trying to learn that well enough to add to my resume.

I've started mentioning in cover letters that I'd consider an unpaid internship. Does that seem like a good idea, or is it too desperate?  I would definitely prefer a paid job but mainly I just want to get my foot in the door.

Should I try to learn some Wordpress stuff or other CDNs? I'd really prefer to focus on React, but maybe the CDN route is a necessary stepping stone? 

Any advice is much appreciated!"

He's working part-time and school full-time, while I'm working full-time and school part-time. He lives at his parents' home and I live at my parent's home. We both want to move-in together and agreed to in March 2019(6 months), but every time we discussed it he mentioned being worried about being able to afford the cost of living given his part-time work status. I asked him about this and he says that after talking to other classmates and beginning the semester, he doesn't think he'd be able to afford it because of the limited income and full-time studying. He is especially concerned about his practicum semesters, where he would essentially be doing an internship but (potentially/likely) not getting paid and may not be able to work outside the practicum/'internship'. Considering school and his practicum, we wouldn't be moving in together for another 1.5 to 2 years at earliest. I understand his concerns given that a year ago I moved back home so I wouldn't have to take more loans and yet 1.5 to 2 years seems like a long time to have to wait to move-in together. The March timeline was supposed to be so that we wouldn't have to wait 1.5-2 years.

We've discussed finances in living together and I wouldn't mind taking on higher amounts of rent,etc. but my own wage and the high cost of living in the area means I can't afford taking the full cost of us living together. Waiting 1.5 to 2 years seems really long and is a bit difficult for me to swallow and I'm not sure what to do.

Has anybody else experienced something like this? What did you do? Any advice?

9eqf2l,52,2018-09-10,We've got a Mike.,papker,talesofmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesofmike/comments/9eqf2l/weve_got_a_mike/,"I started a new position in administration for a performing arts organization about a year ago. In the past year, our organization replaced the CEO, and literally everyone in my department has only been with the organization for about a year. Everyone, that is except Mike. Mike has been there for 4 years. Mike basically runs our constituent database, I run the fundraising operations. Mike does not report to me (we both report to the VP of our department), but I have discretion and responsibilities, where as Mike does not get to make any organizational decisions. In spite of this, Mike thinks that we are on the same level of an org chart that only exists in Mike's toxic passive aggressive little head. Everyone hates Mike. No one can get along with Mike because Mike has to have every be Mike's way all the time. I'll ask mike to perform a simple job function and i'll end up negotiating for an hour and then still not getting what i asked for because i wasn't asking her the question the right way. For everything. So I started going around her and just doing things for myself so I didn't have to involve her- well now it's a problem because Mike feels like Mike is being marginalized.

We have started to leave Mike out of departmental meetings, because ANY change that anyone wants to make in the way we run operations gets immediately shot down by Mike. It's a bad idea because blah blah blah and the next thing you know you are 10 minutes into some lecture about database protocol. It's insane. 

There is a portion of my job that requires Mike to perform a job function. Mike has set up this imaginary calendar with dates for when I am supposed to have my work completed so that Mike can do her work. The dates are completely arbitrary and I am solely responsible for the completion of the work. In the days and weeks leading up to this arbitrary due date that Mike has unilaterally set in her made up pretend land I get Mike leaning in office doorway asking me for a status update on my project, with the passive aggressive implication that it's ok with her, but it really should have been done by now and the person who had my job before me would have already had it done. That kind of crap. 

She has straight up told me that the way I do my job is incorrect. She has straight up told me that she basically does my job based on the the title description- which is because she has no idea what my job is or how to do it. 

She has taken it upon herself to be the person who orders office supplies so that she can lord her power over anyone wanting a legal pad. I listened to her argue with our CEO who wanted a particular type of pen and she wouldn't order it because they were too expensive and the cheaper ones were just as good. To our CEO. In front of people.

She's the personal who sets unilateral and arbitrary rules about the break room fridge (how long food can be in there, what kind of food). A newer person in our department brought in a large pasta salad to eat for the week and Mike threw it out on Wednesday because 1) Food can't be in the refrigerator for more than two days and 2) it smelled like garlic. (Mike does not like garlic because of fucking course Mike doesn't like garlic). You know what Mike, I don't like the smell of stale menthol cigarettes and dog hair, but no one is throwing you out.

Mike cleaned out the fridge completely on a Friday because it was getting too messy. Threw everything out. BEFORE LUNCH.

Mike is obsessed with my computer. I frequently have a lot of tabs open in Chrome because I use outlook365 and I'm lazy. Mike will see my screen (which does NOT face my office door- she has to try to find an excuse to come most of the way in my office to look). Mike says that I have to close the tabs because all the tabs are slowing down ""the network"" and it makes database work take long. I explained that this was fucking nonsense but Mike can't hear anything other than what Mike wants to hear. I left a file open on my desktop from the shared drive, so Mike wasn't able to open the file. I wasn't into work yet, so Mike just went ahead and went on my computer and closed it. I noticed and asked Mike if she was on my computer and she said that she was and complained that I had too many tabs open again with an air of 'I'm we've already talked about this once."" A couple weeks later she found some excuse to go on my computer before i got into the office and then had our Department VP talk to me about my tab usage because i had too many tabs open again. So then I put a password on my computer and a few weeks later she found that and complained to my boss that I was locking my computer.

She has taken it upon herself to maintain our voicemail system- whatever the hell that means. I hate voicemail, I especially hate our voicemail system, so I listen to all of my voicemail through outlook. So I am generally not deleting voicemail on my phone- which means that the red light is flashing. This drives Mike wild! She went into the system saw I had 20 voicemails which is a problem because it's ""clogging up the system"", apparently. Then she see's my boss as about 30 in his inbox so she went ahead and sent an all staff email about how everyone needed to empty their voicemail inbox because it was clogging up the system. She's unhinged. So I basically decided that I would NEVER, EVER, EVER stop that red light from blinking. That light will blink red until they pull me cold and dead out of this office. She noticed the blinking red light a few weeks ago- weeks removed from the all-staff email and said with absolutely no context, ""You promised me you were going to do something and then you didn't do it.' So i think she's talking about some work thing so I ask what, and she says, ""Well, you voicemail inbox needs to be cleaned out it's clogging up the system.""  


She is obsessed with my comings and goings. My job requires a lot of offsite and late night hours, as does my bosses'- so when i first started he sat me down and explained how he wasn't a clock watcher and he didn't like clock watchers. Basically I try to be in for normal office hours, but if I was working late i might sleep in an hour. I might take off a little early if know I'll be working all weekend. Mike cannot handle this. Mike keeps explaining to me this arcane system for how I am supposed to track my hours and if I leave early on Monday and it's less than 1 hour i have to stay late on Thursday or Friday but it has to be in the same pay period and blah blah blah. It's all completely made up. Most my department was out of the office on a particular Friday so I took a project I was working on to a coffee five minutes away from work- but I didn't tell Mike. So Mike proceeds to call my boss asking questions that make it clear I am not in my office and had not clear things with Mike or my boss. My boss doesn't care. So she creates this scenario where because of my absence she was forced to carry boxes of printer paper up to the third floor (we have an elevator) ALL BY HERSELF and if I would just let her know when I wasn't going to be in the office we could avoid that because she could schedule tasks like that for when I am in the office. Hauling paper isn't my job NOR IS IT MIKE'S JOB!

I mentioned I wanted a dry erase board for my office. This, of course is of interest to Mike as Mike has declared herself the queen of office supplies. She says that they are so expensive and then starts asking me what i want it for. Now bear in mind I can just by this with my company credit card, Mike has no actual authority here, and I wasn't even talking to Mike about it in the first place. Mike spends the next hour trying to find if we already have one. She she's walking office to office asking people for help in locating an old discarded dry erase board that may or may not even exist. So now people are coming to me and giving me tips on where they may have seen an old dry erase board. I don't want an old dry erase board. I just want to buy one, hang it up and use it for my job. So after about an hour she appears in my office doorway with a push pin bulletin board and a handful of thumb tacks. So I tell her again well, for what I want the dry erase board for I need it to actually be a dry erase board rather than something that is roughly the same shape as a dry erase board. Nevertheless, she persisted. She leaves for the day, i'm breathing a sigh of relief as I watch her car pull out of the parking lot and there is a knock on my office door. It's the new intern looking scared and confused holding 2 12/18 in dorm door style dry erase boards. Mike found them on his way out and with I am sure a self-satisfied smile as the intern to deliver them for me. Completely useless for what want a dry erase board for. So now I have a push pin bulletin board and two tiny dry erase boards in the corner on my office and a 3x4' one on the way from Staples.

9equzs,2,2018-09-10,How I Got An Internship At King (Candy Crush),blackmangroup,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/9equzs/how_i_got_an_internship_at_king_candy_crush/,"I want to tell the story of how I got a software engineering internship at King, the company behind the Candy Crush. There was over 120 people applying for my position, so I must have done something right. In this post I want to explain what I did and how you can get a similar job.

[If you want watch a video of this instead you can click here](https://youtu.be/OQbuUCxEeZE).

First, let me tell you about my background. I’m studying management science, not computer science. Basically, I’ve only done one course about programming. So all the computer science I know is from learning by myself. I haven’t even done that much programming by myself, roughly 200 hours. That’s like five weeks of programming full time, not much at all. That means you can get a really high paying job with all perks if you program for five weeks, pretty cool right?

**How did I stand out?**

When it came to the first questions, I researched the company a lot. I looked all over the website and at last I found an interesting frame for my answers. King has explicit culture values, and I thought it would look really good if I focused on them in my answers. Turns out I was right, apparently King grades applicants on how well they match the culture values.

Another thing I did was to make a personal website that stood out. I choose to make a parody of tinder. I show what I mean in the video. That website was quirky and funny, which fits well with the playful culture at King. 

Playing their games and thinking about the product was really helpful for coming up with thoughtful answers in the interviews. I was always trying to relate to their company and understand them fully. My showing that type of dedication, I was able to get hired over more technical applicants.

Hope that made sense!"

So far, I have three interviews from three firms I've applied to. I've also applied to four other firms, but I won't know if I get accept for interviews or not until their application deadline ends. I'm assuming I will probably get interviews for sure with one of those firms. The other three are more questionable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I get a call, and it's from an employer I met at a BAP career fair, but didn't apply to directly. They left me a voice message because I didn't answer my phone (because I get spammed called a billion times a day). They saw my resume and basically said give us a call back and we can set up a time to meet. I should note that I ""bulked up"" my resume quite a bit since last year. The thing is, I actually interviewed with this firm last year (and the same guy who called me) for an internship position I didn't get, so I feel kind of awkward talking to them in the first place. The second thing is the CPA firm is pretty small (like 30 people), and its full of people much older then me. I already had an internship like that, and would honestly prefer to work at a firm where virtually everyone isn't 10 years older then me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, should I give them a call back? Should I be really energetic and hopeful? I feel like doing so would be really misleading. Thanks for any advice you guys can give me!"

Moved to a new city, nothing. Worked at Starbucks until i couldn't take it anymore. Tried working with temp agencies. Had a job that was supposed to start last Wednesday pushed back this week. I called on Friday and left a message to my recruiter to see if there was a new target date. I'd expect anybody who is professional to get back on the next Business day but nope i didn't get  a phonecall, text, or email.

Its my own fault, i'm an idiot for trying to work with them again. I'd already had 3 bad experiences with the same agency and fell for it again, even passed up another job interview for them. A job that i most likely would've had.

So now im back to where i started, no job, no prospective jobs, nothing. I should've just went to the interview...I hope they call me back and give me an actual start date but my hope is slowly fading.

I'm tired of waking up everyday at 10:30 and trying my hardest to stay busy doing something. I'm tired of all these older people giving me career advice, when they're realistically in no better position than me (At least i'm 50 years old, in debt, with no hope of comfortably retiring), I'm tired of doing all these job applications  only to get an email back 2 weeks later saying ""Sorry, we don't you loser!"", I'm tired of trying to make friends in this new city, I end up just going to places and events alone and hope maybe somebody is worth talking, I'm tired of people reminding me that ""I can talk to them"", I don't need to talk, i need a fucking job, I'm tired of having to work at jobs like Home Depot and Starbucks, if i were living alone theres *no* way i'd be able to survive off those jobs.

Its all my fault though, i should've did better in class, got a better internship, took the other job, etc. etc.

How much longer am i supposed to endure? Depending on how confident i am in my own spirituality death might just start sounding better. "

&gt;  
&gt;   If I am wrote this letter to you, it is because I have seen on ^(\[website\]) that you are currently looking for an ^(\[domain\]) engineer. However, it is not exactly for this job that I intend to position my application. If you continue reading, you will understand why my situation forces me to approach your company in this unconventional way. I also hope that you will see through this letter a great opportunity for your company:  
&gt;  
&gt;   Actually, I am a French student looking for a 2 to 3 month immersion in an engineering environment. This internship, which must take place abroad from April 2019, is mainly aimed at improving my level of English, but not only. Because when I will come back to France, a commission will assess the professional skills I have acquired and will judge whether my ability to work abroad is sufficiently visible to validate the obtaining of the engineering diploma I am currently preparing. The latter gives me with solid technical and scientific knowledge and teaches me how to lead and succeed in projects by providing me with a wide range of tools and methods adapted to the industrial field.   
&gt;  
&gt;   For the past 5 years, I have been working in parallel with my studies, which helps me to become operational very quickly. Another of my strong points is my interest in Excel and its VBA programming language. This helps me to create successful application faster and fasters. I am trying to « get to the point » and I know that it is appreciated by my colleagues and current officials.  
&gt;  
&gt;   I think your company is exactly what I need, and I am sure I can be useful to you. If you wish, I would be happy to discuss with someone from the company about one of your needs, a mission idea or other.... I can be reached by email, phone or skype.  
&gt;  
&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.

I quickly fell into the pit of wanting to get into server administration and networking without being able to actually even start. I really have been a longtime lurker but need some advice.

I'm on a very low budget due to bills, college applications, and other expenses. Though, I do have a job and that internship. I want to buy (or build) a server. Whichever is cheaper, but does the job much better than my current AMD A4 desktop substitute. I have considered a rackmount server on eBay for cheap, but due to my living situation that's not an option. So, it's really down to a Tower system. What approach should I take on my goal?



Below is a more descriptive backstory and what I'll be using it for, feel free to skip this if you aren't interested:

It really all started when I created my first Minecraft server in middle school and slowly advanced from there into building a gaming rig, to now wanting to make it more interesting and focus on efficiency and professionalism rather than all playtime.

I currently intern at a local IT firm where I've been given hands on education on what it's like with some of our clients (one of the most common uses being virtualization) and it has grown on me. As we have updated clients hardware I've been able to have some of the useless equipment left behind such as old Core 2 Duo prebuilt desktop PCs and little AMD E3's. I took an AMD A4-3420 prebuilt and set up another minecraft server just for kicks to get back into the swing of things and for nostalgia purposes, a FileZilla FTP server to use with my jail broken iPhone 7 and iPad Pro 10.5 as a nice personal cloud server without extra costs, and opened up Remote Desktop just to use my iPad as more of a laptop than an iPad. This has all been fun and nowhere near ""advanced"", but it's useful. 

However, I want to learn and do more though through Linux and Hyper-V virtualization and a more organized Remote Desktop. With all that I've been doing with this ""server"", it barely can handle anything I throw at it anymore and it's annoying. So, here's the advice part. I'm on a very low budget due to bills, college applications, and other expenses. Though, I do have a job and that internship. I want to buy (or build) a server. Whichever is cheaper, but does the job much better than the A4. I have considered a rackmount server on eBay for cheap, but due to my living situation that's not an option. So, it's really down to a Tower system. What approach should I take on my goal?

Also, if you have any career advice for anyone here in the professional field. Please feel free to leave anything as advice. Thank you!

9etx2y,2,2018-09-10,Environmental policy vs. data analysis--stuck between two roads,searingwaters,environmental_science,https://www.reddit.com/r/environmental_science/comments/9etx2y/environmental_policy_vs_data_analysisstuck/,"Hi all! I recently graduated from a great university, but I can't shake the feeling that if I knew going into college what I know now, that I would've taken a completely different route. I also can't figure out how to find a position that is what I truly want. I know that you won't have the perfect job when you graduate--trust me--but I have trouble pursuing things that I don't take enjoyment in. 

I had a great deal of trouble for the first 2 years in college deciding what I wanted to pursue. Everything I wanted to pursue, I was terrible at. Not the kind of terrible where people tell you ""oh, you'll get the hang out it!"", but the kind of terrible where people say ""no honey, there is something else you MUST be better at"" as they slowly pat you on the back. They were absolutely correct in saying this: it took me 3 tries to finally pass chemistry II--with a 1.7.

I wished that I was better at writing--but I'm not. I don't understand subject:verb agreements and no matter how many edits I do or receive, I can't escape passive voice. It drives me up the walls and even if I notice it, I can spend up to 30 minutes fixing one sentence alone and get so frustrated that I can't even look at the assignment for a few days. It's frustrating because I know I can tell a good story. I just don't know how to do it the ""right"" way. So majoring in communications was off the table.

Anyways, I ended up pursuing a BA in Political Science and a BS in Environmental Science. I fucked my GPA to the top taking those classes that I desperately wanted to be good at until I found these two fields in which I was actually pretty good at. I have an incredible passion for the outdoors, and my affinity for interpersonal skill is really helpful here, as most wildlife biologists have trouble communicating their ideas in ""layman's terms"". Great, GREAT researchers, but not so skilled when it comes to bringing back the research to places where it can be understood--aka the general public and government.

But during my time in college, I spent a lot of time pursuing internships where I performed research and data analyses. Found out it isn't all of math I'm bad at--I was the best student out of 250 in statistics! GAME-CHANGER! I then realized I'm actually really great with data processing using different programs, and thoroughly enjoy it as well. However, this doesn't hit me until \~2 quarters until graduation. I don't have any more time to take any classes that build on this skill, and I've already spent 5 years balancing two jobs, internships, volunteer opportunities, and school. The thought of more classes sickens me to the core, despite my love for learning.

So, here I am. I have two degrees which would essentially pair together well for environmental policy/science communication, although my writing is garbage and I don't know how to fix it because I hate writing when it's not required. I do quite enjoy it when I see a purpose for the piece, though. I also really enjoy data analysis, but I am not skilled in any language, nor have I taken any formal classes on a single program, so that is off the table with jobs as well. If I could start over, I think I would get a single degree in environmental sciences with a minor in quantitative sciences (essentially, statistical biology) and an emphases in some of the data programs I like. But, it's obviously too late now.

I just don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed and like I just messed it all up. I wish I had more guidance before and during college. I'm absolutely terrified about being broke my whole life, as I have barely made it out alive as an independent college student. I have hopes that I will get hired as a research associate for environmental policy, then go on to get an MPA and become a policy analyst, although I can't get the data analyses out of my head. I really enjoyed it, but I couldn't imagine doing it for my whole life. I couldn't imagine doing policy for my whole life either. Is there a position that mixes the two? 

Do any of you resonate with this at all? How did you move forward? 

\*\*TL;DR: How much of an overlap is there in the field between data analyses and policy making for a single position? If there isn't much, how can I decide which path to pursue?\*\*

Thanks!"

I apologize in advance for the long post. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved to South Carolina, This afternoon I was advised to stock up a bit on food and water because of the Hurricane coming our way, so once I left work, I drove to a supermarket near my house to buy some supplies just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was driving, I saw two men on the side of the road with a dog. I was on the phone with my boyfriend at the time and even mentioned to him how cute I thought the dog was, I thought they were taking him for a walk or something.

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour or two later while I was driving back home I saw the same dog lying in the side of the street, bloody and looked dead. I swear I felt my heart break, it was the same beautiful yellow dog that I had seen earlier. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was driving so I wasn't able to get a good look at him, but I had a gut feeling I should turn around to check if he was still alive. Even if he wasn't, I noticed earlier that he had a dog collar and I might as well try to find the owner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt this massive sense of relief when he I saw he was barely breathing, which was quickly replaced by this utter sense of panic. I didn't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The look in his eyes... I could see he was in so much pain, and so incredibly scared.

He was severely hurt. Leg looked broken, Wasn't moving at all. 

He had open wounds and so much blood was surrounding him. To be honest, I was surprised he was still breathing. 

He looked at me and was whining so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was panicking and started to cry, but then I realized that I needed to keep my shit together.  

There was no one else around, and he wasn't going to survive very long, I couldn't wait around for help or keep panicking.

&amp;#x200B;

I carefully put him in my car and covered him up with a spare blanket I kept in my trunk, it was raining and he was extremely cold to the touch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got into the car and took him to the closest animal hospital. 

Honestly, I drove so fast and broke so many traffic rules, that I'm not entirely sure how I didn't get pulled over.

&amp;#x200B;

They took him in and asked if I was going to be responsible for his treatment. 

I hadn't even considered that. I wanted to so bad, But I'm just an intern who can barely afford ramen at the end of the month, In no way could I pay for this dog's treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

They took him in anyways on the good Samaritan law, told me they'd try to scan him for a chip to see if he had an owner. 

If not, they'd be responsible for the dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't shake this feeling that I could have done more, That I wanted to do more. 

Since I was fifteen years old, I've known I wanted to be a veterinarian. 

As the years passed, The feeling of wanting be a veterinarian never went away, But when it came time to enroll in university, I realized I couldn't afford it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents offered to pay for university, on condition that I go to Business school instead.

I accepted, it was my only option at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always hated Business school, and knew I wasn't fulfilling my dream, But today most of all I felt it. 

I felt it like a train hitting me at full speed.  

&amp;#x200B;

I could have been a veterinarian by now, I could have helped that dog more.

How many animals could I have helped by now? How many could I have saved? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I working at a dumb office job to make rich people even richer? 

I couldn't afford to enroll myself in school then and I definitely can't afford it now, But I feel like if I'm throwing away my passion and my talents for something so mundane.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe in a year or two I can find a better office job and save up some money to study what I want to. 

I had forgotten how much I wanted this, and now I have to figure out how to make it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't able to help this dog more, and my heart breaks that he was hurt like that, 

but in a way I'm strangely grateful that I found that wounded dog in that dark rainy street. 

He reignited my passion for veterinary that I had almost forgotten I had. 

&amp;#x200B;

He probably won't live, I'll keep calling the animal hospital for updates. 

I'm hoping and praying they can find an owner and the poor dog will get the treatment he needs to survive, even though I'm not sure if there's even a lot of hope of surviving at this point. 

In either case, I will never be able to forget the dog that made me realize that I need to find a way to follow my passion.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post and any grammar errors, English isn't my first language and I'm still a bit shaken up.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- Found a dog almost dead on the side of the road, trying to save him made me realize I was on the wrong career path. "

**My situation:**

I plan on applying for Centrelink Youth Allowance(?) in the next month. 

I am a 23 year old student who is studying in Melbourne, traveling from QLD each uni year to study. My degree is half finished but I have spent the last 15 months working (internship) in Europe as a fully independent person.

When I first started uni a few years ago I applied for Centrelink but was denied due to my parents income being over the threshold. Yes this was true, but it was a bit hard to accept as their income was only about 8% over the threshold but having four kids (2 uni students at the time) makes it quite hard to pay expenses without Centrelink support.

So now I plan on applying again but this time as a fully independent student. The only problem I see with making this statement is that from Late February to November I am living in Melbourne paying rent either by myself or with a roommate. But during summer break from December to February I am living at home in QLD rent free.

In my circumstances do I even have a chance of getting any support? Even getting $100 fortnight will help me heaps with expenses.

More so from your own experiences, is it best to enquire/apply in person, over the phone etc.? Are their certain methods people use to try and minimise chances of any 'horror stories'?

   
 

All advice is appreciated :)"
9evozb,2,2018-09-11,What job should I choose? (decision needs to be made today),asineedhelpnow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/9evozb/what_job_should_i_choose_decision_needs_to_be/,"Hello everyone!

So I have this dillemma what job to choose between two.

As first some history. This summer I decided tochange my career path and switch to IT. I was considering project management position. Not because I like communication, or taking responsibility for other people or being in the center of the attention. I would say on the contraty, I love calm working conditions, flexible deadlines, communication via messengers and e-mail but not face to face. However I have skills to work asa projectmanager that's why Ithought that this might be a good option. Studying to become a programmer takes too much time and now I can at least enter the industry and gain some basic experience and later I could learn programming and get a calm coding job.

My first experience in project management in IT this summer was a bad one. That was kind of internship in a local company. Because of it I lost my main job, that was calm and quite OK. And that triggered a nervous breakdown. Feeling of responsibility, nesessity to act in considiotns when I do not know what to do, nesessity to draw a UX design (whichis usually not a PM's responsibilities and moreover I have no skills and knowledge in UX). I was completely down and thought that I would go out of my mind. I am still taking anti-depressants and visiting my therapist from time to time.

Later I found new job in a small local company. People here are awessome. The project I work on have very questionable future but the job that I currently do is calm and OK for me. I could say that I love everything here. Although other project managers complain that the company uses too simple approach to project management and you will not gain nesessary skills for the industry. The job is less stressfull but you pay for it with your absent skills of budgeting, deadline management etc. I have not signed any documents becauseit was a trial period and workedwith the company for several days.

But the life likes to bring surprises to us. And so one of the reputable local companies offered me a job of a project manager with higher pay. Initially I have agreed. But the guys where I work now say that they feel comfortable working with me and they believe that I will make the project live and offered me even more money. I know that this new firm uses industry spread approaches to project management and that PM job there is quite a stressful one. But they have good clients, formal, clear procedures, yearl review of the salary, some educational program etc.

So now I feel that my heart chooses the place where I am currently. But my mind chooses the new place because there I might have more perspectives. However there is a risk that I will get another breakdown and the job will be too stressfull for me and that I will quit very soon.

I need to choose today, whether to call the new place and tell them that I changed my mind (my first day there is tomorrow and they have already prepareda working placefor me). Or whether I should risk everything (including my health) and try it. Because if I do not try I might think my whole life what would be.

How would you act in this situation? You are welcome to ask me to clarify anything, but please answer today."

A whole achievement hadn’t it been for the fact that I basicaly inherited the company from my dad. He was already in his seventies so he couldn’t really bring up what it took anymore. Since I was his only child conceived with his latest throphy wife he had no one else to give the company to and that brings me where I am today. 

It’s not that I am not qualified either. I have two degrees, a nose for buisness like my dad and my mothers looks. That combined made for the best products the company has gained in years. The fact that I was easy to look at came in very handy when contracts needed to be signed most of the time those middle aged buisnessmen had more attention for me than what was on the paper they signed and things couldn’t get any better at all.

The world literaly lay at my feet as I looked over the city from the luxury two story penthouse located in the tallest building of the city which happend to be my companies building. My office was basicaly located right under where I lived on the third highest floor. There were no other employees stations there either the whole floor was basicaly occupied by my private Office and the big meeting rooms. I rarely had to travel down further than that. 

Nothing could ruin my life well nothing but the fact that earlier this year an employee had made an accounting error which I wasn’t aware of. It was one including a kind of questionable contractor which in turn would make it look like our company helped in money laundering. Ofcourse that was absurd and noone was aware of it not even me. It was just a small error yet if someone would stumble across it by accident and bring it out blowing up the whole thing that error could cost me jail time and the company.

I am very curious as to what character you would like to play in this but I am only looking for a female or futa character to play with. So sorry guys unless you are willing to play a convincing girl this isn’t for you, oh and if you are a guy who is fine with playing a girl or futa then please don’t tell me okay? Let me live the fantasy.

I myself will be playing the 26 year old Roxy, she is rather small and slender being only 5’2” with a toned trained body. Her butt isn’t all to big but it is Nice and firm. Her stomach is flat and she sports a pair of B cup breasts. Her hair is long and Brown usualy cascading down hair back in a wavy manor. Her skin is quite pale and she has a pair of bright blue eyes and full lips. She likes to keep her look natural using only limited amounts of make-up. For work she always dresses smartly in knee lenght skirts, matching jacket. A blouse underneath, a pair of pantyhose and comfortable heels.

Preferably I am looking for something somewhat longterm. I have a busy life and sometimes it is hard getting back at you but I promise I will try my best to give everyone who writes me a decent response an answer back. 

I have a couple of ideas about who your character could be so if you really don’t have any inspiration please ask. Bare in mind however that she must somehow fit into the company setting so anyone ranging from an 18 year old intern to an employee nearing her pension is allowed. NO people playing an underage character under any circumstance. 

I do have one of these fancy [kinklists](https://i.imgur.com/6Ord6ei.png) but if anything is unclear please just ask 

If you reply to my prompt which I hope you’ll do then please don’t just jump into the play but introduce your character to me. Informing me about what kind of kinks you like would also come in handy and oh if you have questions feel Free to ask. 

Then I gues this is it for this prompt. I am looking forward to some replies. Have a nice day."

&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen van de leden Nijboer en Kuiken &amp;#40;beiden PvdA&amp;#41; aan de ministers van Financiën en van Justitie en Veiligheid over het bericht 'ING treft miljoenenschikking met OM in witwaszaken' &amp;#40;ingezonden 5 september 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht 'ING treft miljoenenschikking met OM in witwaszaken'?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat ING een schikking heeft getroffen van 775 miljoen euro? Hoe is dit bedrag tot stand gekomen? Denkt u dat deze schikking indruk maakt op ING, overwegende dat ING een winst boekt van 4,9 miljard euro over 2017?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
ING Bank N.V. &amp;#40;ING&amp;#41; heeft een door het Openbaar Ministerie &amp;#40;OM&amp;#41; aangeboden transactie van 775.000.000 euro geaccepteerd en betaald. Dit betreft de hoogste schikking die het OM tot nu toe heeft gesloten. Dit bedrag bestaat uit een boete van  665 miljoen euro en 100 miljoen euro aan ontneming van wederrechtelijk verkregen voordeel. Die bedragen zijn als volgt bepaald.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten aanzien van de boete geldt dat de maximale boete 10% van de omzet bedraagt. Dat zou voor ING neerkomen op 1,7 miljard euro. De maximale boetebedragen worden echter ook in de rechtszaal vrijwel nooit opgelegd. Dat zou slechts aan de orde kunnen zijn als sprake was geweest van opzettelijk witwassen en opzettelijk witwassen en bewust en intentioneel faciliteren van criminelen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij de vaststelling van het uiteindelijk bedrag is rekening gehouden met het feit dat ING de gemaakte fouten heeft erkend, heeft meegewerkt aan het onderzoek en inmiddels ook een herstelprogramma in gang gezet heeft. Het OM en DNB geven aan dat er vertrouwen is in het uitgebreide verbeterplan dat bij ING is ingezet.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor wat betreft het te ontnemen wederrechtelijk verkregen voordeel kon niet achterhaald worden hoeveel winst ING behaalde doordat de transacties onvoldoende gemonitord werden en ING de cliënten niet kende. Daarom is gekeken naar bespaarde kosten door niet te investeren in afdelingen, systemen en extra controlepersoneel. Het bedrag dat ING op die manier ten onrechte heeft bespaard, is door het OM bepaald op 100 miljoen euro.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het OM ziet de door ING betaalde boete – bijna de helft van de maximaal op te leggen boete – als een passende afdoening, die pijn doet aan de verdachte en recht doet aan de geschokte rechtsorde.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat ING bijna 100 miljoen euro heeft bespaard door te beknibbelen op personeel dat transacties had moeten controleren? Heeft ING hiermee haar wettelijke taken ernstig veronachtzaamt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Uit het strafrechtelijk onderzoek is naar voren gekomen dat ING jarenlang personele capaciteitsproblemen had bij de voor naleving van de Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme &amp;#40;Wwft&amp;#41; relevante afdelingen, zoals de afdelingen die Customer Due Diligence-onderzoeken uitvoerden en afdelingen waar medewerkers werkten die witwassignalen uit het transactiemonitoringssysteem onderzochten. Er werd te weinig personeel beschikbaar gesteld om werkzaamheden uit te voeren en ook om de problemen die bekend waren geworden binnen de organisatie voortvarend en structureel op te lossen. Ook had het wel beschikbare personeel niet altijd de benodigde kennis en ervaring om de werkzaamheden uit te voeren. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat ING in de periode 2010 tot en met 2016 onvoldoende heeft geïnvesteerd in personele capaciteit en kwaliteit.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Waarom heeft het openbaar ministerie &amp;#40;OM&amp;#41; tot een schikking besloten in plaats van strafrechtelijke vervolging? Betekent dit dat naast de rechtspersoon ING ook alle betrokken medewerkers nu gevrijwaard zijn van strafrechtelijke vervolging?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het OM kan voor de aanvang van de terechtzitting één of meer voorwaarden stellen ter voorkoming van strafvervolging wegens misdrijven waarop gevangenisstraf is gesteld van niet meer dan zes jaar en voor overtredingen &amp;#40;art. 74 Wetboek van Strafrecht&amp;#41;. Met andere woorden, de transactie is een in de wet geregelde mogelijkheid om strafzaken buiten de rechter om af te doen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In dit geval is gezien de hoogte van het transactiebedrag sprake van een hoge transactie. Op een dergelijke transactie is de “Aanwijzing hoge transacties en bijzondere transacties” van toepassing &amp;#40;http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0024648/2008-11-01&amp;#41;. In voornoemde aanwijzing is het uitgangspunt opgenomen: “niet transigeren in dergelijke zaken &amp;#40;maar voorleggen aan de rechter&amp;#41;, tenzij daar een zeer goede reden voor is”.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het strafrechtelijk onderzoek naar ING is naar het oordeel van het OM sprake van goede redenen om te transigeren, nu:  
&amp;nbsp;    
ING de gemaakte fouten publiekelijk erkent en betreurt;  
&amp;nbsp;    
ING heeft meegewerkt aan het strafrechtelijk onderzoek en de kwestie daartoe zelf intern heeft onderzocht en de uitkomsten daarvan bij het OM bekend zijn;  
&amp;nbsp;    
ING het OM actief in de gelegenheid zal blijven stellen om onderzoek te doen naar mogelijke strafbare feiten voortkomend uit tekortkomingen van het Financieel Economische Criminaliteit Customer Due Diligence &amp;#40;FEC CDD&amp;#41;-beleid waarop de transactie betrekking heeft;  
&amp;nbsp;    
ING, onder toezicht van DNB, een nieuw herstelplan heeft ontwikkeld en implementeert. ING heeft gedurende het strafrechtelijk onderzoek aan het OM ook steeds inzicht geboden in de voortgang van dit herstelplan;  
&amp;nbsp;    
ING  met deze transactie verantwoording neemt voor het plegen van strafbare feiten gedurende meerdere jaren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gezien deze redenen is een transactie volgens het OM effectiever dan een rechtsgang. Doorslaggevend daarbij was het feit dat bij een transactie bepaalde zaken kunnen worden afgedwongen die niet bij rechterlijk vonnis kunnen worden opgelegd:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een grootschalig pakket aan compliance-maatregelen die ING moet nemen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Toezicht op de uitvoering van dat compliance-programma door DNB.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij strafrechtelijke vervolging van ING zou een rechter uitsluitend de mogelijkheid hebben om een geldboete op te leggen, maar kunnen deze maatregelen en het toezicht daarop niet worden afgedwongen. Door openbaarmaking van een uitvoerig feitenrelaas en van de transactie-overeenkomst is bovendien getracht de transactie zo transparant mogelijk te maken. Daarnaast is een transactie in dit geval een effectief middel om snel een norm te stellen voor alle partijen die binnen het financiële stelsel opereren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De transactie ziet niet op eventuele strafbare feiten gepleegd door natuurlijke personen. ING kan hier dus ook geen rechten aan ontlenen die natuurlijke personen zouden vrijwaren van enige strafrechtelijke vervolging, zou er voldoende bewijs zijn voor specifieke strafrechtelijk relevante betrokkenheid van individuen. Ondanks forse inspanningen en uitgebreid onderzoek van het OM zijn daar echter geen aanwijzingen voor.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het Openbaar Ministerie heeft uitvoerig onderzoek gedaan naar de mogelijkheid om natuurlijke personen strafrechtelijk verantwoordelijk te kunnen houden. Daartoe hebben bijvoorbeeld vele doorzoekingen bij het kantoor van ING NL plaatsgevonden, zijn individuele e-mailboxen in beslag genomen en onderzocht en zijn de telefoons van meerdere natuurlijke personen, op alle niveaus binnen de bank, afgeluisterd. Desondanks is het OM tot het oordeel gekomen dat de strafbare feiten in strafrechtelijk opzicht niet individueel aan personen toe te rekenen zijn. Voor nadere toelichting wordt verwezen naar het uitgebreide persbericht en het feitenrelaas van het OM.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat witwassen een groot probleem is, dat leidt tot ondermijning van de samenleving en criminele activiteiten faciliteert?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
De strafrechtelijke aanpak van witwassen behoort tot het beleidsterrein van de minister van Justitie en Veiligheid, het bevorderen van de integriteit van het financiële stelsel tot het beleidsterrein van de minister van Financiën. Het versluieren van de criminele herkomst van opbrengsten van misdrijven stelt daders in staat om ongestoord van dit vergaarde vermogen te genieten. Dit heeft een ondermijnend effect op de samenleving. Mede als gevolg van de internationale strijd tegen witwassen is in augustus 2008 de Wwft ingevoerd. Dienstverlenende instellingen hebben een rol om het financiële systeem tegen witwassen en financieren van terrorisme te beschermen en hierdoor de integriteit van het financiële stelsel te waarborgen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u tevens de mening dat banken en andere financiële instellingen een cruciale rol spelen in het voorkomen van witwassen en terrorismefinanciering, aangezien zij inzicht in de geldstromen moeten hebben? Heeft u het gevoel dat banken hun taak op dit punt voldoende serieus nemen?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Banken en financiële instellingen zijn de poortwachters van ons financiële stelsel. Zij vervullen in die functie een belangrijke rol om witwassen en het financieren van terrorisme te voorkomen. Zoals in bijgaande brief aangegeven laat ik mij nog door De Nederlandsche Bank &amp;#40;DNB&amp;#41; informeren over het algehele beeld ten aanzien van de naleving van integriteitsvoorschriften door de sector. Ik zal uw Kamer daarover berichten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe moet de uitspraak worden beoordeeld dat onderhavige vier zaken exemplarisch zijn voor het beeld dat ING de Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme &amp;#40;Wwft&amp;#41; niet voldoende naleefde?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zowel in het persbericht als in het feitenrelaas heeft het OM concrete voorbeelden beschreven waaruit afgeleid kan worden dat ING NL tekortschoot bij de uitvoering van het FEC CCD beleid ter voorkoming van witwassen. De FIOD heeft, zoals door het OM aangegeven in het feitenrelaas, zicht op meerdere soortgelijke signalen afkomstig uit strafrechtelijke onderzoeken of uit de media. Deze signalen zijn niet in detail onderzocht. Wel komt ook uit die signalen een beeld naar voren van een tekortschietend ING waar het gaat om de uitvoering van het FEC CCD beleid. Ook blijkt uit die signalen van  risico’s op witwassen door cliënten van ING NL  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik vind het buitengewoon ernstig als op deze wijze met integriteitswetgeving wordt omgegaan. Deze overtredingen van de Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme zijn tevens strafrechtelijke overtredingen en dat benadrukt de ernst van deze feiten. Banken behoren de poortwachters van ons financiële stelsel te zijn en uit dien hoofde te controleren of hun dienstverlening niet wordt misbruikt voor witwassen of het financieren van terrorisme. Het niet voldoende vervullen van deze functie raakt de integriteit van de financiële markten als geheel en het vertrouwen in de sector.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe lang loopt de discussie over deze schikking al? Hoe is het mogelijk dat de Raad van Commissarissen de beloning van de heer Hamers met een miljoen euro wilde verhogen, terwijl de bank stelselmatig meewerkte aan witwassen? Wat zegt dit over het ethisch besef bij ING?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het onderzoek door de FIOD naar ING startte begin 2016. Na het onderzoek is door het OM beoordeeld welke afdoeningswijze in dit geval het meest passend zou zijn. In het eerste kwartaal van 2018 zijn de besprekingen met ING gestart die uiteindelijke tot de onderhavige transactie hebben geleid  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het systematisch overtreden van belangrijke integriteitsregelgeving betreft strafrechtelijke feiten. Dit is een grens die nooit overschreden mag worden. Het voorstel dat in maart 2018 werd gedaan door de raad van commissarissen van ING om de beloning van de CEO te verhogen was in mijn ogen buitensporig en deed daardoor afbreuk aan het proces van herwinnen van het vertrouwen in de financiële sector. Ook ontbrak maatschappelijk draagvlak voor het voorstel. Het systematisch overtreden van belangrijke integriteitsregelgeving betreft strafrechtelijke feiten. Dit is een grens die nooit overschreden mag worden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat zijn de consequenties voor de individuele overtreders van de wet?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het Openbaar Ministerie heeft uitvoerig onderzoek gedaan naar de mogelijkheid om natuurlijke personen strafrechtelijk verantwoordelijk te kunnen houden. Daartoe hebben bijvoorbeeld vele doorzoekingen bij het kantoor van ING NL plaatsgevonden, zijn individuele e-mailboxen in beslag genomen en onderzocht en zijn de telefoons van meerdere natuurlijke personen, op alle niveaus binnen de bank, afgeluisterd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Volgens het OM komt uit het strafrechtelijk onderzoek naar voren dat een belangrijke oorzaak voor het ontstaan van de tekortkomingen lag in de onvoldoende aandacht die ING gaf aan compliance risk management &amp;#40;business boven compliance&amp;#41;. De verantwoordelijkheid voor naleving van de Wwft was belegd bij drie verschillende onderdelen van de bank. Geen van deze onderdelen overzag het geheel. Het hogere management heeft mede daardoor onvoldoende de ernst van de tekortkomingen en het voortduren ervan onderkend. Het OM rekent de strafbare feiten dan ook toe aan de organisatie als geheel. Velen zijn daarbij verantwoordelijk voor een deel van het verwijtbare gedrag. De strafbare feiten zijn daarmee in strafrechtelijk opzicht niet individueel aan personen toe te rekenen. Ook niet aan de leiding van ING. De Hoge Raad stelt aan het vervolgen van personen voor het leiding geven aan strafbare feiten hoge eisen. Dan moet niet alleen wetenschap worden bewezen, maar ook dat deze personen bewust hebben aangezet tot strafbare feiten of bewust nalatig zijn geweest om strafbare feiten te stoppen. Daarvan is in het onderzoek naar ING niet gebleken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat zijn de consequenties van dit toelaten van criminele activiteiten voor leden van de Raad van Bestuur en de toezichthoudende Commissarissen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan de bank zelf om hier personele consequenties aan te verbinden. In bijgevoegde brief heb ik aangegeven hoe ik hier in sta.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het juist dat de top van ING afziet van een bonus over 2018, maar dat de ontvangen bonussen over de jaren waarin de criminele activiteiten plaatsvonden &amp;#40;2010-2016&amp;#41;, niet terugbetaald worden?    
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Volgens het persbericht van ING van dinsdag 4 september zien de leden van de raad van bestuur af van hun variabele beloning in 2018. Verder geeft ING aan dat gekeken wordt naar andere personele consequenties bij senior managers.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe beoordeelt u de reactie van de top van ING  in vergelijking met het aftreden van de heer Moerland na de Libor-fraude bij Rabobank?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord op vraag 12  
&amp;nbsp;    
De reactie van de heer Moerland bij het bekend worden van de Libor-fraude kan ik mij goed voorstellen. Zoals ik in bijgevoegde brief heb aangegeven heeft de raad van commissarissen van ING inmiddels aangekondigd dat, gegeven de ernst van de feiten, ook op het niveau van de raad van bestuur personele consequenties getrokken worden. Gelet op de aard en omvang van de zaak vind ik deze beslissing van de raad van commissarissen passend.  
&amp;nbsp;

9exdra,1,2018-09-11,[M4A] The Tyranny Of The Hunt,LifeSucksSoDoI,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9exdra/m4a_the_tyranny_of_the_hunt/,"Here’s a fun tip: if you value the sanctity of your asshole, don’t make deals with the Fae. I used to be a normal guy. Yeah, okay, a bit shy, a bit closed-off, maybe a little feminine, but normal. But now?

Now I’m running through a forest in the middle of the night, bare-ass naked, nipple rings bouncing madly on my chest, trying not to overbalance from the weight newly added to my thick, jiggly ass. Behind me, I can hear the baying of the hounds.

I mean, it’s not *all* bad. I remember that as I leap over a tangle of roots, bounce of the trunk of a tree and into a leaping roll, pop up and dive beneath a bush and into yet more forested terrain. I sure couldn’t have done *that* as an unpaid intern for a legal firm. It’s just, well, you usually hope to learn parkour skills from a class, or maybe by becoming an international superspy. Not in a trial-by-fire against a warparty of merciless hunters using you as sport.

Speaking of the hunters, they’re getting closer. The hounds are actually audible by their effect on the terrain behind me, snapping through roots and branches and knocking the occasional tree down. I’ve been caught by them before. Not a good experience. I cast an eye around, looking for a probable path, and alight upon a raised root. If I can just launch off it right…

And then I’m running in the trees.

The dogs fall away beneath me, unable to follow. Perfect. I’m congratulating myself, quite secure in my own genius, when I feel something shift under my feet and the world slips away from under me. I feel the wind leave my lungs, my body bunched up tight, and a swinging motion takes over my senses.

I wait, trapped in a net.

After some time, hoofbeats approach. The baying of the hounds is close after, but controlled, just barely. They’re with their master.

*Fuck.*

The sound of tinkling laughter reaches my ear, mixed with the rough barks and howls from the hounds. A few words pass out of hearing, and then: “Caught so quickly, man-thing!” Unfortunately, I know the voice.

A blade deftly slits the net, as if by magic -- or quite possibly, simply by magic -- and I fall unceremoniously into a circle of light, hounds just beyond the edge of the ring. Before me, far, far above on the back of a horse, a thin face gazes down at me. Lord Alfykaol. Privately, I prefer to call him Alfie, but, well, after he heard me say it the first time… not very loudly. Not very loudly at all.

“A good hunt, Lord,” I say, head bowed demurely. “My compliments to the hounds.” The mutts in question snarl from outside the circle of light, and I raise my voice. “Good job, boys! Led your master right to me, huh?”

“They need little credit,” Alfie sniffs. “You are not a difficult mark to track. I could have followed you myself with both eyes torn from my head and had you just as easily.” Always humble, him.

“All right, all right.” I grumble, head turned away. “So, Lord, what will it be this time? Thrown to the hounds? Passed around by you and your pals? Ooh, perhaps servicing the horses again?”

The lord’s face twists with something I eventually recognize as amusement. “Some… combination therein.” I wonder at his meaning, and then without a touch he urges his steed into the circle and I realize the terrifyingly obvious. He isn’t riding a horse tonight. His bare torso simply merges smoothly into the neck of a white charger, skin turning to hide seamlessly. I wonder briefly and unpleasantly if he grew the legs himself or if some poor horse out there is missing its body, and then those thoughts are cut off by soft hoof-falls behind me.

As I see the massive, swaying shape under the body, my mouth drops open, and I heard Alfie hiss with amusement. “Yes, manling, yes. Just like that…”

And the night is bright, and full of terrors.
*****
A simple concept, but so many possibilities. Your character doesn’t have to be the lord outlined in the prompt, but then it hardly matters: any face the Fae wear is, at best, temporary. It’s up to you what sort of character you want to play, but twisted ones are preferred.

Of course, there’s quite a lot of potential here for a lot of diverse, fucked-up stories. I mean, what do the Fae actually want? To break me? To liberate me? To transform me into something like them? That’s up to us to decide! So are the kinks for this roleplay, which will hopefully be abundant.

This is not an exhaustive list, but: dubcon, beast, huge cocks, tentacles, rough sex, mindbreak, cum inflation, body transformation, body modification, mind alteration, oviposition, male pregnancy, forced orgasm, shapeshifting, sweat, musk, watersports, slavery, freeuse, humiliation, bondage, and the kitchen sink.

My limits for this roleplay are: complete transformation into a woman, scat, sexual gore, diapers, necrophilia, anthro/furry (a fine line, open to discussion), chastity, cock/ball torture, and completely losing it. Because where’s the fun in a broken toy?

Message me with your character’s name and title in the subject of your message and a description of their favored form, if any, and their favored ways to play with a captured plaything in the body of your message.

Happy hunting.

9exfrp,3,2018-09-11,Overwhelmed by offers from SDs,thuggishliving,sugarlifestyleforum,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9exfrp/overwhelmed_by_offers_from_sds/,"Hello, it’s me again. I got some great advice my last post and I was hoping this forum would help me again.

Since I joined SA two days ago, I am inundated with offers. After figuring out how to weed out the likely scams, creeps, and  “salt” SDs I still have dozens and dozens of men who want to meet me, and who seem nice enough that I would not mind going on a M&amp;G with them to figure out compatibility. It would take me more than a month to meet with all of them if I had time everyday to go on a M&amp;G. The reality is I’m a student with an internship and other responsibilities and it is taking a significant toll on me even to just to reply to messages, notwithstanding figuring out dates to meet up with them that work best for all schedules. 

I just feel so overwhelmed in this world, I want to vet each one properly as well but I don’t have the time or the stamina. I am also still a little shy discussing allowances over message, as I rather do it in person, so I can’t even have that as a factor in my decisions. Most of the men are passable in the looks department too

How do you do it SBs? (I am in NYC btw)"
9exp92,1,2018-09-11,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Amhaouch over de veiligheid op rangeerterrein Kijfhoek in Zwijndrecht,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/9exp92/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_amhaouch_over_de/,"^(Geachte voorzitter,  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bijgevoegd stuur ik u de antwoorden op vragen van het lid Amhaouch &amp;#40;CDA&amp;#41; over de veiligheid op rangeerterrein Kijfhoek in Zwijndrecht, ingezonden 13 augustus 2018.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op maandag 3 september 2018 is in de namiddag het heuvelproces &amp;#40;het sorteren en samenstellen van goederentreinen&amp;#41; op Kijfhoek tijdelijk stilgelegd in verband met een incident bij het afremmen van drie goederenwagons. Er hebben zich geen ongelukken voorgedaan. De bedrijfsbrandweer, de ILT en de Omgevingsdienst zijn ter plaatse geweest. Na controle is het heuvelproces weer vrijgegeven. Naar aanleiding van dit incident heb ik ProRail en ILT gevraagd of in het licht van de reeds getroffen maatregelen en lopende onderzoeken, er aanvullend technisch onderzoek noodzakelijk is. De eerste bevindingen van zowel ProRail als ILT bevestigen het beeld dat uit voorzorg een technisch onderzoek wenselijk is. ProRail heeft besloten dit onderzoek uit te voeren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op 6 september 2018 heeft uw vaste Kamercommissie voor Infrastructuur en Waterstaat naar aanleiding van dit incident de vraag gesteld of de door ProRail met de gemeente Zwijndrecht gedeelde informatie ook met de commissieleden kan worden gedeeld. Bijgevoegd treft u bedoelde rapportages met de feiten en omstandigheden die bij een eerste onderzoek van het incident zijn geconstateerd en, indien van toepassing, een overzicht van de maatregelen die direct na het incident zijn getroffen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het doel van deze rapportages is om het verantwoordelijk management zo snel mogelijk te informeren over de tot dan toe bekende feiten en om er intern van te leren, zonder de schuldvraag te beantwoorden. De eerste analyse in een feitenrapport kan wijzigen in een eventueel nader op te stellen onderzoeksrapport, omdat nieuwe inzichten en nieuwe feiten bekend worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In bijgaande beantwoording van de vragen van het lid Amhaouch ga ik verder in op het door de ILT ingestelde verscherpt toezicht, de getroffen veiligheidsmaatregelen, het onafhankelijk onderzoek naar de veiligheidsmaatregelen en -cultuur en de wijze waarop de gemeenten en overheidsinstanties worden geïnformeerd en betrokken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u het bericht gelezen dat de veiligheid in Kijfhoek structureel in gevaar is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u ook geschrokken van de conclusie uit het genoemde bericht dat veiligheidsinstructies bij groot onderhoud niet worden nageleefd en dat treindienstleiders de verantwoordelijken daar niet op aanspreken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
De geconstateerde feiten zijn ernstig. Ik neem deze zaak daarom heel serieus. Mijn ministerie heeft hier afgelopen periode op verschillende niveaus uitvoerig contact over gehad met ProRail, en daarin zijn zorgen geuit. Aan de zijde van ProRail is deze zorg erkend. Voorts staan wij ook in nauw contact met de ILT over hun bevindingen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast heb ik persoonlijk over deze situatie contact gehad met de burgemeesters van Zwijndrecht en Barendrecht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is uw visie op de conclusie van de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport &amp;#40;ILT&amp;#41; dat ProRail bij werkzaamheden voorrang geeft aan het rangeren boven veiligheid?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De ILT stelt in haar brief dat ProRail prioriteit gaf aan het heuvelproces ten   opzichte van het uitvoeren van geplande werkzaamheden Dat kan veroorzaken dat de werkzaamheden onder tijdsdruk moeten worden uitgevoerd en dat kan een onveilige situatie tot gevolg hebben. De ILT heeft dit tijdens haar inspectie op Kijfhoek geconstateerd en in een brief aan de directies van ProRail en de onderhoudsaannemer gemeld. Deze incidenten zijn onder andere het gevolg van menselijke fouten tijdens het uitvoeren van werkzaamheden. Ik onderschrijf de analyse van de ILT en ik deel de opvatting dat dergelijke incidenten voorkomen moeten worden. De directie van ProRail heeft direct na de incidenten zelf maatregelen getroffen en werkt volledig mee aan de maatregelen van de ILT om dit soort incidenten in de toekomst niet meer te kunnen laten plaatsvinden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Was het u bekend dat de veiligheid op Kijfhoek in deze ernstige mate in het geding is? Zo ja, sinds wanneer? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
Het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat wordt bij veiligheidsincidenten altijd door de ILT en ProRail geïnformeerd. Op   
15 juni, 15 juli en 18 juli hebben zich incidenten voorgedaan waarbij is afgeweken van veiligheidsvoorschriften. ProRail heeft de feitenrapporten van deze incidenten met het ministerie gedeeld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De ILT stelt dat deze incidenten het gevolg waren van structurele gebreken in de organisatie van werkzaamheden waardoor menselijke fouten zijn gemaakt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
ProRail heeft direct na deze incidenten zelf beheersmaatregelen ingesteld zoals het aanscherpen van procedures en het aanstellen van een manager die integraal verantwoordelijk is voor de veiligheid. Daarnaast heeft de ILT verscherpt toezicht ingesteld met betrekking tot de onderhoudswerkzaamheden aan de spoorweginfrastructuur in verband met bijvoorbeeld storingsherstel. Dit betekent dat de ILT een 100% controle uitvoert van de uitvoering van de onderhoudswerkzaamheden en nauwgezet de door ProRail aan te brengen structurele verbeteringen beoordeelt. De ILT is tevens nauw betrokken bij de door ProRail uit te voeren risicoanalyse en de afweging om de werkzaamheden  weer op te  starten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de conclusie, dat het onacceptabel is dat de onveiligheid al zeer veel jaren voortduurt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er is geen sprake van een al jaren voortdurende onveiligheid op Kijfhoek. In uw vraag refereert u aan een onderzoek uit 2011 door de toenmalige Inspectie Verkeer en Waterstaat naar informatie-uitwisseling met betrekking tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Een aantal vervoerders is destijds beboet omdat zij onvoldoende duidelijk hadden gemaakt welke lading vervoerd werd. Sindsdien zijn hier gericht maatregelen voor getroffen. Recent heb ik uw Kamer geïnformeerd dat inmiddels circa 92% van de wagons met gevaarlijke stoffen op emplacementen correct is geregistreerd, en heb ik aangegeven welke acties in gang zijn gezet om de registratie volledig te kunnen automatiseren  
&amp;nbsp;    
De incidenten van de afgelopen periode hadden niets te maken met een &amp;#40;onvolledige&amp;#41; registratie van de inhoud van wagons, maar spelen op het gebied van veilig werken. Daarbij hebben zich onder andere situaties voorgedaan waarbij niet aan alle eisen voor veilig werken werd voldaan. In deze situaties is vanwege het veiligheidsbelang en verscherpt toezicht het heuvelproces korte tijd en beheerst stilgelegd tot het moment dat de beheersmaatregelen wel volledig in praktijk konden worden gebracht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de conclusie van de ILT dat, hoewel zij het onderzoek pas in november kan afronden, de eerste uitkomsten zo schrikbarend zijn dat het terecht is dat ze nu al naar buiten worden gebracht? Zo ja, welke acties gaat u daarop nemen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Primair zijn ProRail, de aannemers en vervoerders aan zet om te komen tot een snel herstel en &amp;#40;waar nodig&amp;#41; verbetering van de veiligheidssituatie op Kijfhoek.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De ILT heeft in haar rol van toezichthouder op basis van de incidenten van de afgelopen twee maanden onderzoek ingesteld. Op basis van de eerste bevindingen heeft ILT besloten om vooruitlopend op de afronding van het onderzoek verscherpt toezicht in te stellen op zowel ProRail als de aannemer ten aanzien van de onderhoudswerkzaamheden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het feit dat ProRail haar verantwoordelijkheid heeft genomen en meteen na het eerste incident beheersmaatregelen heeft getroffen, onderstreept ook de noodzaak tot snel ingrijpen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Over de ontstane situatie en de acties heb ik contact gehad met de gemeenten Zwijndrecht en Barendrecht. Ik heb ook afgesproken via bestuurlijk overleg de voortgang van de acties te zullen bewaken. Voorts zal een vertegenwoordiging vanuit het ministerie plaatsnemen in de begeleidingscommissie voor het onafhankelijk en extern uit te voeren onderzoek naar de veiligheidsmaatregelen en -cultuur op Kijfhoek.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u afspraken gemaakt met ProRail en anderen inzake deze problematiek? Zo ja, wilt u die delen met de Kamer en daarbij aangeven volgens welke tijdsplanning gewerkt wordt aan verbeteringen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Door ProRail zijn beheersmaatregelen getroffen en is onder meer een integraal manager als eindverantwoordelijke voor Kijfhoek aangesteld. De ILT heeft naar aanleiding van de incidenten en het stilleggen van het onderhoud voorwaarden gesteld waaronder het werk weer hervat mocht worden. ProRail verleent volledige medewerking aan de invulling van deze voorwaarden. Naast het verscherpt toezicht door de ILT worden door de ILT, ProRail en de aannemer onaangekondigde veiligheidsinspecties uitgevoerd. Voorafgaand aan iedere dienst spreken ProRail en de aannemer de veiligheidsprocedures door. Over tussentijdse &amp;#40;kleine&amp;#41; incidenten worden de direct betrokken overheden door ProRail goed geïnformeerd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naar de oorzaak van de incidenten vindt onderzoek plaats door de ILT. Zij   verwacht dit in de loop van november af te kunnen ronden. Daarnaast is vanwege de opvolging van de incidenten in korte tijd de vraag opgeworpen hoe het is gesteld met de veiligheidscultuur op Kijfhoek. In overleg tussen ProRail en direct betrokken overheden is daarom afgesproken om onafhankelijk en extern onderzoek te laten uitvoeren naar zowel de veiligheidsmaatregelen als de veiligheidscultuur op Kijfhoek. Dit onderzoek wordt momenteel door ProRail in samenspraak met de betrokken partijen voorbereid en moet op korte termijn starten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze zijn en worden gemeentebesturen, veiligheids-regio's en omwonenden geïnformeerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
ProRail en de ILT hebben in de gemeenteraad van Zwijndrecht uitleg gegeven over incidenten op het rangeerterrein en de voortgang van getroffen veiligheidsmaatregelen. Zowel de Omgevingsdienst Zuid Holland-Zuid, de Veiligheidsregio Zuid Holland-Zuid als de gemeente Zwijndrecht worden door ProRail en de ILT zorgvuldig en frequent geïnformeerd en bijgepraat. Voorafgaand aan het instellen van het verscherpte toezicht zijn deze organisaties door de ILT ook op de hoogte gesteld. Daarnaast is er bestuurlijk overleg tussen het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat en de burgemeesters van Zwijndrecht en Barendrecht, en heeft Zwijndrecht de gemeenteraad en buurgemeenten geïnformeerd. Daar waar blijkt dat aanvullende maatregelen noodzakelijk zijn, treedt de ILT op, zoals nu bij Kijfhoek.

9exvep,2,2018-09-11,Ex girlfriend want to start talking to me again a month after dumping me.,Uruz_13,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9exvep/ex_girlfriend_want_to_start_talking_to_me_again_a/,"Dated her for 1 year and 10 months (1 year 2 months long distance). Was my first girlfriend, we saw each other 3 times within a span of 1 year after going long distance.

First year of long distance was easier due to the time zone difference of only 1 hour (2 hours during day light savings, but she started her 1 year internship program 5 months ago in another country and the time zone changed for her to be 8 hours behind mine. 

The first 2 months was difficult since we had to adjust to this change, but gradually she lost interest in me due to the lack of contact. We were too accustomed to the constant phone calls and video calls prior to her internship program.

After 2 months into her internship program, she has established a new social circle, and started going clubbing constantly, partying and drinking. 

I was hit off guard because I did not know she was the kind of girl that did these activities and let my insecurity get a hold on me. Ever since then, she refrained from communicating honestly to me (a gut feeling I felt at that time) and told me “I can’t call you and video call you anymore, physically and mentally”. She told me she could not balance her social life and study (she had to study the country’s language during the first half of her internship program). 

At that time I tried to be considerate and agreed to her. I told her I support her because I felt she was having her own difficulties. After a month passed, I got frustrated because 7 days in a week, she had the time to go clubbing every week and hang out with her friends but she had no time to keep in touch, while I was working 2 jobs and doing my university studies. 

It got to the point where whenever we called, we were annoyed at each other, due to myself wanting more time with her since hearing her voice once a month was too much for me. On the other hand, she thought of me as a nuisance.

After 5 months into her internship program, she decided to dump me. I yearned for the reason why she wanted to dump me but she could not tell me the reason. She said she could not do the distance anymore, then 2 weeks after, she told me another reason was because she started hating me because phone signal was dropping sometimes or the static noise during the call hurt her ears and it frustrated her. To me these were all weak reasons and I could not accept the truth. 

I have always been honest with her from the start of the relationship, hence I also expected the same from her. After a month of getting dumped, she gave me another reason. She said she wanted to explore the dating scene there. She said that she wanted to improve herself and she did not need a boyfriend right now.

2 weeks after, she starts messaging me and asked me “how are you” and we started talking again. I asked her what made her to start talking  again out of her own initiative, and she gave me a confession. “I wanted to talk to you again because I love you”. This were the words she gave me after ignoring me for 2 months and then dumping me. At one point, I told her “was it because you were not getting the attention from others anymore and now you come crawling back to me?” I also said “I would not be surprised if some guy fucked you”.

Turns out that was the case. She wanted to break up because the actual reason was she could no longer suppress her sexual desire and she felt guilty towards me. Another reason was because she could not contact me often, or she believed she could not contact me (she had the time, she just did not want to make time). After her random fling, she thought of me and started missing me so she decided to contact me again. She said she did not want to get back together but she told me if her character improved few months later and after her internship program ended, she wanted to start over again. I then asked her “after you get all the random dicks inside you?” She did not deny and she said I could do the same if I wanted to.

After I found out about the cold hard truth, I snapped and started listing out all the negative points about her and started swearing at her and becoming out of control. The amount of disrespect I felt took a hold of me and I could no longer control my emotions. 

I then realized this was my own fault. I should not have kept in touch with her after she dumped me. I kept believing that she wanted to dump me because she could not handle the distance anymore and she wanted to improve on herself, but turns out she needed dick. Although I appreciated it when she finally told me the truth but it left a bitter aftertaste.

I then told her I did not want to get back together even after her internship program ended. Our original plan was for me to finish my university degree and for her to finish the program, then we would move in together and close the distance.

I did not know how to feel about this. Mixed emotion of anger, disappointment, sadness, disrespect and my mind was clouded.

Timeline:

April 2018 (start her internship program) &gt; June 2018 (she told me she can’t phone anymore) &gt; July (constant fights over the phone) &gt; August 2018 (get dumped at the beginning of August) &gt; September 2018 (she contact me at the beginning of September and finally tells me the true reasons she dumped me)."

6 september 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Herinnert u zich dat u in het dossier van de kinderopvangtoeslag eerst  
ontkend heeft dat een document bestond, het document daarna vertrouwelijk  
ter inzage legde en later nog meer relevante documenten terugvond, nadat  
het dagblad Trouw erover gepubliceerd had?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
Ik herinner mij de gang van zaken zoals ik heb toegelicht in de brief over  
dit onderwerp die ik u heden heb gestuurd.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
Herinnert u zich dat de Kamer nu meerdere keren om de managementinformatie  
gevraagd heeft over de problemen bij de erf-en schenkbelasting, zowel in de  
periode van het najaar van 2017 als in de periode april-juni 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Herinnert u zich dat er in het najaar van 2017 meer dan 400 miljoen euro  
niet binnenkwam? En herinnert u zich dat de inkomsten in de eerste helft  
van 2018 ook honderden miljoenen euro’s lager zijn dan in eerdere jaren,  
zodat het budgettaire belang van deze vragen zeer aanzienlijk is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
Als gevolg van de vertraging in de uitvoering gaan geen belastinginkomsten  
verloren. Het gaat om een inter-temporeel effect.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Herinnert u zich dat u geen feitenrelaas verschaft heeft over die periode,  
hoewel daar wel om gevraagd is in het schriftelijk overleg en u de Kamer  
dus ook niet op een andere wijze op de hoogte gebracht heeft van de bij u  
beschikbare informatie en alle informatie die bij de Belastingdienst  
beschikbaar was?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4  
Ik heb de Kamer voorzien van de informatie waar om gevraagd is. Onder meer:  
    - In de 20e halfjaarsrapportage,[1]  
    - Het AO Belastingdienst van 14 december,  
    - Mijn brief van 31 januari,[2]  
    - Antwoorden op feitelijke vragen over de problemen,[3]  
    - In de 21e halfjaarsrapportage,[4]  
    - Mijn brief van 9 april,[5]  
    - Mijn brief van 19 april,[6]  
    - In het AO Belastingdienst van 13 juni,  
    - In de feitelijke vragen naar aanleiding van de Voorjaarsnota,[7]  
    - Door de minister, in het debat over de Voorjaarsnota,  
    - In mijn brief van 4 juli,[8]  
    - Mijn antwoorden op uw vragen over deze brief,[9] en  
    - In mijn antwoord op uw vragen in het schriftelijk overleg.[10]  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik heb in de brieven van 31 januari en 4 juli de feitelijke toedracht van  
de vertraging uitgebreid beschreven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Herinnert u zich dat u persisteert in het niet verschaffen van welke  
managementrapportage en welke memo dan ook over de erf- en schenkbelasting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 5  
Ik heb de Kamer steeds zo goed mogelijk voorzien van alle relevante  
informatie in geobjectiveerde vorm. Ik weiger geen informatie. Ik heb  
daarbij wel aangegeven dat het staand beleid van het kabinet is  om  
documenten die zijn opgesteld voor intern beraad geen onderwerp te maken  
van het politieke debat. Voor het goed functioneren van het ambtelijke  
apparaat is het noodzakelijk dat het mogelijk is om in vertrouwelijke sfeer  
van gedachten te wisselen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
Herinnert u zich dat de regering aan de Kamer schreef:  “Informatie die op  
basis van de Wob kan worden openbaar gemaakt, kan uiteraard niet worden  
geweigerd als een Kamerlid daarom vraagt”? 1&amp;#41;  
   
Antwoord 6  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Kunt u per ommegaande de volgende stukken, die eerder gevraagd zijn, aan de  
Kamer doen toekomen:  
“alle memo’s over de schenk- en erfbelasting, bekend bij de  
Belastingdienst, zowel rond september t/m november 2017 als rond mei t/m  
juli 2018.  Het gaat hierbij dus om alle memo’s, e-mails en dergelijke van  
binnen de Belastingdienst en een aparte set van alle  informatie die bij de  
staatssecretaris terecht gekomen is”? 2&amp;#41;   
   
Antwoord 7  
Het is staand beleid van het kabinet om documenten die zijn opgesteld voor  
intern beraad geen onderwerp te maken van het politieke debat. Voor het  
goed functioneren van het ambtelijke apparaat is het noodzakelijk dat het  
mogelijk is om in vertrouwelijke sfeer van gedachten te wisselen.  
Vanzelfsprekend geef ik wel graag alle relevante informatie uit de  
gevraagde documenten aan uw Kamer, voor zover dat nog niet is gebeurd in  
een van de in antwoord 4 genoemde stukken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
Herinnert u zich de regering eerder schreef over het informatierecht van de  
Kamer: “De notitie onderscheidt dit soort gevallen van de situatie waarin  
een bewindspersoon in eerste instantie een document niet verstrekt, zonder  
daarbij een uitdrukkelijke weigering uit te spreken, of zich te beroepen op  
het belang van de staat. De Kamer kan in dit niet-verstrekken &amp;#40;eventueel na  
overleg&amp;#41; berusten. Maar als de Kamer volhardt in haar verzoek, zal de  
bewindspersoon het document alsnog moeten verstrekken, of definitief moeten  
weigeren met een beroep op het belang van de staat”? 3&amp;#41;  
   
Antwoord 8  
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
Kunt u deze vraag om informatie expliciet behandelen als een volharding van  
het verzoek  en de gevraagde documenten verstrekken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 9  
Ik ben van oordeel dat ik u voldoende heb geïnformeerd. Ik heb zeer  
uitvoering met uw Kamer gecorrespondeerd en al uw vragen beantwoord.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
Indien u &amp;#40;een deel van de&amp;#41; gevraagde documenten niet wenst te verstrekken,  
wilt u die weigering dan voorleggen aan het kabinet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10  
Ik ben van oordeel dat ik u voldoende heb geïnformeerd. Ik heb zeer  
uitvoering met uw Kamer gecorrespondeerd en al uw vragen beantwoord. Het is

geen onderwerp te maken van het politieke debat.  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
Indien u &amp;#40;een deel van de&amp;#41; gevraagde documenten niet wenst te verstrekken,  
doet u dan een beroep op het belang van de staat? Wilt u dit belang van de  
staat dan nader motiveren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 11  
Ik ben van oordeel dat ik u voldoende heb geïnformeerd. Ik heb zeer  
uitvoering met uw Kamer gecorrespondeerd en al uw vragen beantwoord. Het is  
staand kabinetsbeleid om documenten die zijn opgesteld voor intern beraad  
geen onderwerp te maken van het politieke debat.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
Beseft u dat u elk document dat u weigert en later toch openbaar moet maken  
&amp;#40;bijvoorbeeld onder de Wob&amp;#41; alsnog als een addendum bij deze vragen aan de  
Kamer dient te sturen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 12  
Een bewindspersoon kan de Kamer voldoende informeren zonder de  
onderliggende originele documenten aan de Kamer te zenden. Als er  
vervolgens op grond van de Wob een verzoek wordt gedaan naar de  
onderliggende documenten zelf, kan het zijn dat er &amp;#40;delen van&amp;#41; documenten  
openbaar worden gemaakt. Een goede informatievoorziening staat immers niet  
gelijk aan het toezenden van alle documenten waarover een bewindspersoon  
beschikt. In dit kader meld ik u dat vandaag een besluit is  genomen op een  
Wob-verzoek over de problemen bij de schenk- en erfbelasting. U kunt het  
besluit en de bijbehorende stukken vinden op www.rijksoverheid.nl/wob-  
verzoeken.  
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
Herinnert u zich dat u vergeten bent deze vraag te beantwoorden: “De leden  
van de CDA-fractie constateren dat de Staatssecretaris in zijn brief van  
12 juli 2018 heeft geschreven dat een brede analyse heeft plaatsgevonden  
van de 19 ict-domeinen van de Belastingdienst. Deze leden zouden deze  
analyse graag ontvangen”? 4&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 13  
Ik heb deze vraag beantwoord op pagina 21 van de antwoorden op uw inbreng  
voor het schriftelijk overleg:  
“De leden van de fractie van het CDA vragen of zij de onderliggende  
documenten van de ICT-analyse mogen ontvangen. Ik heb een brede analyse  
laten uitvoeren naar de 19 ICT-domeinen van de Belastingdienst. Uw Kamer  
heeft op 5 juni jl. in een vertrouwelijke briefing een uitgebreide  
toelichting gekregen over deze analyse en de huidige stand van zaken van de  
ICT. Tijdens deze briefing is met voorbeelden aangegeven welke domeinen wel  
en welke domeinen nog niet op orde zijn. Ook is toegelicht dat op dit  
moment wordt gewerkt aan de verschillende domeinarchitecturen, die  
uiteindelijk een goed beeld zullen geven van de huidige en toekomstige  
gewenste situatie, inclusief de beoogde transitie. De kern van de  
informatie uit de vertrouwelijke briefing is na afloop openbaar  
gemaakt.[11] De onderliggende documenten van deze analyse kunnen vanuit het  
oogpunt van veiligheid niet openbaar gemaakt worden.”  
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
Kunt u de brede analyse die heeft plaatsgevonden van de 19 ict-domeinen van  
de Belastingdienst aan de Kamer doen toekomen? &amp;#40;en wel integraal&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 14  
De 19 ict-domeinen zijn doorgelicht om de technische en functionele staat  
in beeld te brengen. Deze analyse bevat vertrouwelijke informatie. U heeft  
in een vertrouwelijke briefing uitgebreide toelichting gekregen over de  
analyse en de stand van zaken van de ICT. De kern van de informatie is na  
afloop openbaar gemaakt.[12] De onderliggende documenten van deze analyse  
kunnen vanuit het oogpunt van veiligheid niet openbaar gemaakt worden.

Was u in control bij de afdeling schenk- en erfbelasting in de periode  
april tot en met juni 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 15  
De managementinformatie was in die periode ontoereikend. Daardoor werd te  
laat duidelijk dat de achterstanden in de aanslagoplegging niet werden  
ingelopen en dat daarbij ook de reguliere maandelijkse stroom aangiften  
niet werd bijgehouden. Er kon niet tijdig worden onderkend wat de gevolgen  
waren van de fout in het nieuwe aanslagopleggingssysteem en hoeveel extra  
capaciteit nodig was voor het opleggen van aanslagen om de achterstand in  
te halen. De achtergrond daarvan is dat de bestuurlijke informatie voor de  
nieuwe systemen nog in ontwikkeling is, omdat prioriteit is gegeven aan het  
in gebruik nemen van het nieuwe systeem boven het volledig afbouwen ervan  
&amp;#40;inclusief bestuurlijke informatievoorziening&amp;#41;.  
Zoals ik in het schriftelijk overleg[13] heb aangegeven, was de  
maandplanning nog niet gebaseerd op een inschatting van de beschikbare  
productiecapaciteit en niet getoetst door de controlafdeling. De vraag of  
de Belastingdienst de achterstand nog in 2018 kon wegwerken werd getoetst  
aan de hand van de jaarplanning. Dit leidde tot de inschatting dat de  
realisatie van de jaarplanning ondanks de ontwikkelingen nog steeds binnen  
bereik lag. Deze inschatting bleek begin juli onjuist.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Door het gebrek aan deze managementinformatie was de afdeling schenk- en  
erfbelasting en daarmee ikzelf niet in staat om adequaat te signaleren en  
waar nodig bij te sturen. Dat blijkt ook uit het feit dat het te laat  
duidelijk was dat de achterstanden in de aanslagoplegging niet werden  
ingelopen en dat daarbij ook de reguliere maandelijkse instroom niet werd  
bijgehouden in het systeem. Door de beheersmaatregelen die ik sindsdien heb  
getroffen, zijn wij beter in control en worden de achterstanden versneld  
ingelopen.

Waar komen de 150 extra medewerkers voor de zomertaskforce vandaan en hoe  
goed waren zij opgeleid?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 16  
Deze medewerkers zijn afkomstig uit andere delen van de directie  
Particulieren. Zij zijn of worden opgeleid voor het toezicht op de IH-  
aangiften en konden door die ervaring met een compacte instructie en uitleg  
van de regelgeving doeltreffend worden ingezet op het toezicht op de  
aangiften erfbelasting.  
&amp;nbsp;    
17  
Hoe goed is de kwaliteit van de aanslagen die in de zomer door de  
zomertaskforce zijn opgelegd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 17  
De kwaliteit van het werk is steekproefsgewijs getoetst. 411 aangiften zijn  
steekproefsgewijs getoetst op zes tot zeven onderdelen. De uitkomst daarvan  
is dat het aantal verwachte bezwaren tussen de 5 en 6% ligt. Dat is onder  
het gebruikelijke niveau van 10% bezwaren. Dat laat onverlet dat in  
individuele gevallen fouten kunnen worden gemaakt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
18  
Kunt u per week in 2018 &amp;#40;tot en met afgelopen week&amp;#41; aangeven hoeveel  
bezwaren zijn ingediend in het domein erf- en schenkbelasting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 18  
Door de beperkte beschikbaarheid van managementinformatie is het aantal  
ingediende bezwaren helaas niet inzichtelijk te maken. Deze informatie is  
alleen op jaarbasis beschikbaar en niet gevalideerd. Een wekelijks  
overzicht van het aantal ingediende kan ik dus helaas niet verstrekken.  
&amp;nbsp;

Hoe hoog zijn de inkomens van de schenk- en erfbelasting per half jaar &amp;#40;in  
cijfers&amp;#41; van 2014 tot en met de eerste helft van 2018?

Antwoord 19

erfbelasting in de gevraagde periode.

Here are some ideas we can go with.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

\- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

9f05qy,0,2018-09-11,Remaking Back to the Future but Marty Goes from 2015 to 1985,funkydrake,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/9f05qy/remaking_back_to_the_future_but_marty_goes_from/,"Zemeckis says they'll never remake BTTF, and I don't think they should, but I often think about how it would work if they did. BTTF is my favorite film and I think it is quite perfect, so we won't be improving on it.  I just found myself thinking about how the story would be different if it had been written in a different time period. Many of the jokes are based on the differences between the 50s and 80s and things that might have been okay in 1985 might not work as well today.  I'd love to hear some thoughts after I give mine.

First things first, how do we set up the relationship between Marty and Doc? In the 80s it might not have seemed weird for a teenager to hang out with a strange 60 year old inventor, but most people would have a hard time with it now. I'd suggest that Doc is now a Elon Musk type, who has blown all his Dot Com money on his invention. Making him a precocious genius would allow him to be in his early 40s so the age difference isn't as stark. Marty would come to work for him as an unpaid intern.  That works. Perhaps Marty would love to go to the lab where he could gain access to a super computer to do some high end gaming instead of just using a huge amplifier.  

One of the harder nuts to crack is the nuclear material.  I think its safe to say that we can't have one of our heroes working with terrorists, even if he is thwarting their efforts. First I was thinking that we could swap out the Libyans with the Russians, but with the current state of affairs, I don't think that works either.  So I think we'd need something like a homegrown militia or some crazy environmentalists who steal some nuclear waste that Doc can refine? The whole Nukes are okay in the future thing might be hard to reconcile, but it is central to the premise, so it must stay in.

Marty might ride a ""hover board"" in 2015 instead of a skate board, but not sure how to translate that into 1985 with Biff chasing him around the town square.

Swap out the Delorean for a Tesla. 

When Marty gets sent back in time in the original, there is a stark contrast between the dirty, rundown present and the spotless 50s.  That would get turned around with the present 2015 being a beautiful Gentrified neighborhood and the 85 world being rundown.

Jokes about Barack Obama being the president don't work quite as well as Ronald Reagan, but who knows. 

I'd love to hear what you guys think.

9f0a6m,2,2018-09-11,Broke up with my gf of nearly 5 years and now I'm regretting everything,justasadbum,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9f0a6m/broke_up_with_my_gf_of_nearly_5_years_and_now_im/,"**TL;DR:** I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. I feel  incredibly awful now and full of regret. We had planned for it to be a  short term thing but I decided to make it permanent. Now wishing I never  did, that I could just figure out how to make it work, and starting to  doubt the advice that I've been given.

&amp;#x200B;

I've perused this subreddit for a bit now, and it seems like you all have much more painful reasons to break up with your SOs. I'm sure mine isn't special or unique, but the pain is eating me inside.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some background, my gf (we'll call her K) and I started dating back in October of 2013 at University. It was the start of my Junior year and her freshman year. Neither of us had ever been in anything long term at that time. My longest relationship was something that lasted 4 months, then a break, and then another month. She had never had a boyfriend. Everything for her before me was short term, and according to her words, terrible. We hooked up after partying for a mutual friend's birthday. She tried to pull my pants off, but she was clearly too drunk, so I stopped her. And she loved the hell out of that afterwards. It really opened up her trust towards me and things pretty quickly rushed us into an exclusive relationship in the beginning of November.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were good for awhile. Really good. I had my own 1 BR apartment and we just spent a bunch of time there together listening to music and having sex. We went out all the time. She made so much time to be with me. I still feel guilt that she may have gotten worse grades and ruined friendships because of the time she spent with me. She will most likely vehemently deny it too. But maybe for good reason. She studied her ass off. And we honestly did have a balanced time together. No one knew us as a couple that was too touchy feel-y or a couple that was never around.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really remember why, but we started to have issues with fighting in March or April of 2014. I dunno, it's been so long I can't really remember. I had an internship that summer and would be flying to California to work for an IB. That summer was hard for the both of us. We hadn't really worked on fixing the fighting and then had that whole summer to sit on it. She would call me often. A lot more than I would have preferred. And it put a lot of strain on the relationship because I was unwilling to walk away from the people I would have been with at the time or I smoked too much weed and was too high to hold a conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

The next couple semesters would be fairly easy with some rough seas in between. She took a lot of time out of her schedule to hang out and sleep at my place those next two semesters. I was living with friends again and would try to spend most of my time there in between studying and concerts etc. This may have caused some fights. I don't really know. That year was a blur for me. But I do know this is when people started to recognize how much we bickered. While still at that apartment, we had pretty much almost broken up. I can't remember what it was about. Probably just too much yelling at each other. I'm sure she was sick of the fighting and that was the reason she was ready to leave it. But... we talked and talked and we made up and tried to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

The next year is when K's distaste for my closest friend (we'll call him Z) really started to come out. She was right that he was short-tempered, rude, and not always there for me. Z and I were living together at the time and she couldn't stand to be around him. We had many fights about this. It drove me nuts that she just couldn't be friends with him. Z is really good at reading people and knew this. He tried to confirm this with me and I didn't give him a straight answer, so he figured it out. K blamed me for him knowing.

&amp;#x200B;

We went to LCD Soundsystem at Red Rocks that summer for 2 nights in a row. Our first night was amazing and perfect in everyway. She introduced me to Molly that night and it was pure magic. The next night, we were meeting at the concert venue. While she was driving, she got a call from her mother that her grandma had just been re-diagnosed with a really bad form of cancer. The whole concert was ruined for the both of us. Selfishly, I was upset at her mom for the timing of the news. K looked so dejected and miserable. She sat there, holding herself while the crowd seemed to dance in slow mo around her. I tried to comfort her. I tried to help her get into the music, lose herself a little, but I failed at it. I made a cardinal sin of trying to help when she just wanted someone to be there for her. We ended up fighting often about how she was handling the news. I tried to keep her distracted and I wouldn't listen to her when she said she didn't want to be out doing stuff. When her grandmother did eventually pass away (mind you the first death of anyone close to her), we again fought about the way she was handling it. I was a terrible fucking listener. I deserve all the vitriol thrown my way for the way *I* handled it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next year, we spent a lot more time at her place. I graduated after one last semester and stayed with my parents for 2 months in their state. Went to Europe and stuff like that. The spoiled kid life. But there's something that happened. On my graduation night, which was amazing, we were hanging out with all my friends and my parents. We all went to the nice lobby of the hotel they were staying at and played some card games. After that, we all parted ways. K and I were walking to her Car. The snow was coming down hard. 5 inches on the ground already. We started getting into some fight, yelling about some sort of nonsense that probably didn't matter. Maybe it was something I said at dinner that embarrassed her, or maybe I tried to use the good dinner as proof that she could be friends with Z. Some guys across the street heard us yelling at each other and shout at us some sort of unclever bullshit and I respond with a ""Fuck off, dude, and mind your own business."" He comes charging across the street with his friends and they proceed to try and beat me. I'm holding my own against him and K is beating the shit out of the what looked like the guy's girlfriend. Some guys down the street see what's going on and jump in to help us. They chased off the people who attacked us and suggested we get out of there. They bounce and all of a sudden it's just us again, snow displaced everywhere. Cold and bruised, we're bawling our eyes out. I shake her off of me and just start walking by myself, telling her to leave me alone. I can't remember if she convinced me to get into the car or not, but we somehow make it back to her place, yell at each other more, I punch a hole in the wall, and she proceeds to break up with me, saying that it was for both of our sakes. I begged her not to leave me. We cry and cry, have break up sex, go to sleep, and in the morning I start to pack up my stuff. I don't remember how, but we talked more and decided to stay together. It was so painful. I was leaving that day too. I met with my parents for lunch and told them what happened. They were shocked. I go home for 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back and got a job at a Construction Firm and another apartment. We were about 45 minutes from each other and I did my best with spending time at her place. She did the same. She went to Tanzania for a month and came back to move in with me. We still would bicker and argue and fight. Most of these arguments would be about me not wanting to do the things she wanted to do, or they would be about me not being supportive enough of her over the drama between her and her friends. I wasn't supportive enough of her and she would lash out in anger at me. I would respond with the same energy. We would fight and fight. She would tell me I scared her when we fought. That I would try to rise above her and make her feel small. For me, she attacked subjects sensitive to me, and she would yell at me until I got to the same level and then act like I was crazy for getting angry. We stayed there through the lease term and found a new place. We had much more room and privacy there. It was a really awesome apartment. The same fights would happen, of course. Ever since she moved into our first apartment, she would say things like, ""If I had the balls, I would break up you."" or ""I wanna break up with you."" My usual response would be, ""Fine, do it. But I'm not gonna be the one to say ok, because that's not my choice."" Or I would call her bluff and say, ""Then get out of here! Leave! I don't want to be with someone who dreads seeing me after work."" Most of the time these wouldn't go anywhere. We would apologize and feel hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

Our sex life wasn't frequent. We could go awhile without needing to have sex. But when we did, even if the sex was bad, it was still great somehow,  because, at the least, it was with each other. I used to be able to last a lot longer in the beginning of our relationship. I started to lose that stamina, and genuinely, I'm not sure why. For awhile, it kinda made sex a hard thing for us. She was not supportive about such a sensitive subject. Like, when I came, she would sigh in disappointment or be like, ""Really??"" Shit stung. It made me want to have less and less sex with her. It was the same thing with gifts I would give her sometimes. Couldn't feign appreciation for what I had given her. Oral sex from her was way less frequent. She ""didn't really enjoy it anymore."" I would still give her oral sex all the time. I really enjoyed it. Even with these disappointments though, we still had our great sessions every now and then. Mind blowing stuff. Feeling really connected to her etc.

&amp;#x200B;

We ended up having a really bad fight. Called her a bunch of names etc and she grabbed a knife in anger. Didn't charge me with it or anything. Just pointed it at me with an angry face. I called her a ""fucking psycho cunt"" for threatening me with a knife. More yelling and shit, she says that she's done with me and wants out of the relationship. Obviously, I know her inside and out and realize it's just a bluff. But I'm sitting there, waiting for an important meeting to start and I just decide, ""Yeah, I'm done too. Fuck this."" I walk outside to the balcony where she's sitting and I tell her, ""I'm moving back to California on August 15th and I'm not coming back."" I noticed she was looking at apartments on her laptop, but it was nothing serious. She didn't look back at me. I close the door. I took a walk around the city. We don't talk that night.

&amp;#x200B;

The next couple days were hard. We cried and talked a lot. I told her all my feelings. She apologized for everything she ever did wrong to me. Things I don't even remember. I tried to do the same. We had sex. Cried more. We tell each other that we'll just make the best of the time we have left before I have to leave. She had previously arranged for a trip to visit family that upcoming weekend, so I got to spend a weekend alone without her. I was miserable. I talked with many friends and family for advice. I came up with an idea. When she came back, I told her maybe we just needed a long break from each other while still remaining exclusive. I would still move away for a couple months and she and I would both take the time to work on ourselves. We would come back and go through couple's therapy. The weekend before we left, we ended up having a huge fight coming down from the mountains. I was furious with her because she was annoying me. It was stupid, but she didn't like that I put a couple of tissues in the foot well of the seat she was sitting in. I couldn't hear that and basically went on a tirade about how it was my car, my rules, don't tell me what to do. Something about it all hit a nerve for me. I was yelling my head off at her. It was horrible. So much for keeping it together until I left.

&amp;#x200B;

We never had goodbye sex or anything. I left two days after our fight excited for my journey. I drove to California and while I was there, I ended up just checking out bumble to see what was out there. I went on a date, but didn't hook up. I told her why. She was ok with that. I thought to myself, ""Hey maybe this is okay. Maybe I can be alone. Maybe I'll be able to move on and find someone again.""

&amp;#x200B;

I met with a therapist. It was our first meeting. He said it sounded like we needed to break up. Gave me a lot of explanation and so I did. I called her, told her I was breaking up with her and that this was goodbye. My therapist had told me to keep the conversation brief. So I did. I kept telling her, ""K, this is goodbye. I need to let you go."" She kept begging me to not go. That she thought we were good and we were working on ourselves. So I hung up on her as she was sobbing.

&amp;#x200B;

I met with that girl again, we made out, and all I could think about was how wrong it all felt. I felt SO fucked up inside. I couldn't believe how I had broken up with her and how much it was eating me inside. I miss her so much. I couldn't believe that I did that to her and then turned around and hooked up with that girl. And how much I just wished it was K, and not this rando I met. And now I just want to take it all back. I just want to reverse everything I did. I just want to hear K's voice again. I want to hug her and tell her how special she is to me.

&amp;#x200B;

See, I know I'm probably the asshole in this story. But I sincerely wish I wasn't. She was such a loyal friend and lover. When I felt this way, it was her that I would turn to for support. If we felt awful about each other, it was her that I could talk with and seek closure with. Now we can't.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted her two weeks after the call, asking how she was, and received no response. Last night, I called her and left a voice message. Just saying that I didn't know why exactly I called, that I felt like an asshole for what I did and for what I was currently doing by calling her, that I hoped she was ok etc. She responded with a text saying ""What's up?"" after I called, so I texted her back basically saying that I'm trying to be mature about everything, but that I couldn't. That I couldn't stop thinking about us since the moment I hung up on her and that I was sorry for not allowing closure for the both of us. That I was gonna be miserable if I couldn't hear her one last time. No response. Honestly, I typed it out and didn't mean to send it, but my finger slipped while I was staring at the text I had written out.

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically where things are now. I feel like I'm being a desperate loser who can't deal with the consequences of his actions, but these are my emotions. I don't know what to do at this point. Should I really be committing to this? Am I throwing away something really good, because I couldn't man up and be more patient and understanding? Is there even a ""going backwards"" option? It's been 3 weeks since the call, and all I feel is immense regret. I can't focus on work, I can't eat, I'm repulsed by the idea of dating. I keep asking myself if there's anything to do or if I'm being a complete cunt for even bothering her in the first place now. I also can't help but to think of her being with someone else and how much that hurts and how I had basically done that to her. This just fucking sucks. And I'm starting to feel as if maybe taking others advice isn't such a great idea because it comes from *my* support group and they hear *my* side of the story, when in reality, maybe I'm the fucking asshole? I don't know. I just feel like I'm drowning."
9f0fox,3,2018-09-11,Mac Miller: A Reflection Essay,bedfordOG,MacMiller,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacMiller/comments/9f0fox/mac_miller_a_reflection_essay/,"I listened to BDE bonus every single morning during my senior year of high school. The first thing I did when I got my license was I drove down the shore to see you during your Blue Slide Park tour in Atlantic City. Your music is the most listened to songs on my itunes, all of which was from high school.  You are my most played artist on Spotify.  Your KIDS and Best Day Ever mixtapes gave me a feeling that you knew where I was at. You were young as well making goofy music about having a good time and getting fucked up. Your music could be a soundtrack for pretty much anything.

I made a music video to one of my favorite songs by you that you hadn’t yet done yourself. Your music was often used in my videos that I made as a high school student. I often wonder if I had been more aware of social media marketing could I have talked to you online or even been a part of your actual shoots. I wonder if you even saw the video.  There was a connection between what you were saying. I used to get high in my car and lose myself to Macadelic. Pink Tape was the soundtrack to 2014 summer and brings back great memories that you’re music is a part of.

I remember vividly every release. The High Life, KIDS and Best Day Ever remind me of a time when I couldn’t even drive a car and I’d be bumping with my high school homies.  Your shit was right there with MOTM1 as my first smoking soundtracks. Blue Slide Park was the first album I really bumped when I got my first car.  Your concert was my only motivation for passing my test because that meant I could go and see you perform. Macadelic made me feel some type of way; falling away into my driver seat after a couple blunts with my subwoofer rumbling 1 Threw 8 and The Question.  Watching Movies was the last week of my senior year and my buddy showed me Someone Like You because I didn’t even know it was released. We were on my friend’s deck smoking joints to celebrate the final exam we just took.  Pink Tape and Faces has some of the greatest and funniest songs you have ever made.  GO:OD AM reminds me of working at my first internship in NYC, walking the busy streets, riding the train tired as fuck, telling me to wake up.  It was my most played album of 2015 and it came out in the fall.  Divine Feminine came out when I was abroad in Barcelona. My roommate there and I became really good friends because of this release.  I listened to it and studied the cover while we were on acid in Parq de Ciutadella.  Swimming had me so excited for another album because summer of 2018 was such a great music period with your project being amongst other releases from Kanye and Cudi, Asap, Pusha T, Death Cab, Alkaline Trio, Tash Sultana, Brasstracks, Gambino, Rebelution, Travis Scott, Post Malone, Meek Mill and Chance the Rapper.

I love how respected you were not only as a white rapper, but as a rapper. Everything you made was fire. Everything was so different based on where you were, there is nothing that stands out as not being good. Nothing bad, always progression and your music evolved with you. I’ll never forget the first time I heard Objects in the Mirror. I was in the front seat of a car with my parents driving through California highways late into the night. High as fuck off an edible, I looked at the rearview mirror and there was the song title. Absolutely the craziest shit. You worked with some of my favorite artists and I love how respected you were to them. You had this ability to speak publicly about your problems and that’s hard for many people to do. I will always commend you for that.  People knew you were struggling, trying to get better, and kept everyone in the loop on where you were at. Of everything that has poured out online, I like to think that I’m in a good space with everyone ONLY saying positive things about this dude: genuine, friendly, nice, hilarious, hard working.  He got into some shit, but was a great guy at the end of the day.

This is such a shock because I read the Vulture article on Thursday and I was optimistic to see you continue towards sobriety.  I watched the interview with Zane Lowe and the way you composed yourself after all the Ariana shit was so mature of you it actually made me open my eyes.  (For anyone shaming her, you’re crazy.) I’ve never had an artist or celebrity I really cared for pass, so this feeling is so strange.  This dude has been through so much shit, crashing his car, his ex getting engaged, addiction, depression, and STILL looking forward to touring your new album and getting after it. That is fucking strong.

We all have demons, and now you can be at your well deserved peace. You’re a legend in many people’s eyes, the music industry, and as an icon in general.  It’s kind of eerie listening to your old tapes and the overall message is similar. I guess when you get to that status you just assume some things are coming, but you always kept going, evolving.  I think the reason I fucked with you so much was the fact that I felt we were growing up together. Your lyrics were TOO relatable in the meaning I gave them.  Although you seemed so much older than I was (I’m 23 now), you were still figuring out the whole music industry lifestyle with the money and fame and everything that goes with it, while I was trying to figure my own self out just coming up as a teenager from a middle class town in NJ. I think I really fucked with you because we were both young white kids who were trying to do things that others told us we couldn’t.  Rest in Fucking Peace, you need it. You will be missed by many.

For those who want to laugh your asses off at the video my friends and I made in high school, here’s the link: r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA1wo8_rn-g. It got a lot of hate in the comments, but our only intention was to make a decent video (we were 17) to a song that we really really liked, didn’t have a video, and have fun with in the process. We filmed it in Sea Isle City while we were staying there to see Mac during his Macadelic Tour in Atlantic City, 2012.

I feel I really needed to write this, to vent about someone who really made a difference to me, as I’m sure he did with others. The only thing that’s been on my mind lately. Thanks y’all for reading, let’s support each other and stay Most Dope fam. RIP"

I turned the volume down on the call and talked to him about it, giving names and calling the customer a “piece of work”.

9f25hw,31,2018-09-11,i almost go stabbed,jinnytinny,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/9f25hw/i_almost_go_stabbed/," Hi guys! I'm fairly new to this subreddit but have been enjoying every second of this thread. Love reading about yalls encounters. currently i'm at work and am bored and cannot be bothered to work. Please excuse any typos that are to come.

So my story starts during the summer of 2017. I was in South Africa for an internship. This opportunity was given to me by my school. There were about 15 of us participating in this program. We all lived together in an apartment and friendships were quickly budding. Typically, on most weekends we would go out to Long Street (where ALLLLL the bars were) and get food and then go out to the bars. This particular night my friend A and I were doing our own thing and were going to meet up with the bigger group for dinner later. Dinner time came around and we went to meet them and by the time we got to the restruant the kitchen was closed so we couldn't order any food. A and I were fairly annoyed with the group because someone could have told us the kitchen was closing and ordered for us. So we were annoyed and decided to leave and told them we would meet them at this bar, Beer House, that we all usually went to. We decide that we're just gonna eat at Beer house since they had really good burgers. We make our way towards Beer house. It is probably a 10 minute walk to get there.

Now its important to note that cape town has a huge homeless population and you should never give these folk money because more often than not they will not use it for good :( we were told that if we wanted to help we should buy them food instead. Even then some people have told us that they have seen people they just gave food to immediately turn back into the store or supers to return the food for money. And crime is no stranger to anyone here. Capetown has one of the highest crime rates in the world. its especially bad for tourists.

Okay- back to the story. So we get stopped by this homeless lady asking us for money. We made the mistake of talking to her for a couple seconds too long. Up ahead of us we see another homeless person but this individual was very young. Maybe about 15 or 16. He noticed that we talked to the other lady and ask for money and we told him that we have none and try to walk past them. He continues to beg telling us that he is so hungry and even just a couple rands (SA money) would suffice. We tell him more sternly that we don't have anything and we see a change in demeanor. we walk ahead of him and we see him crossing the street. We think we lost him and continue to walk towards food UNTIL we see him walking parallel to us on the opposite side of the road. We are at this point pretty sufficiently worried. We just try to ignore him and of course we are walking along a road that has no people walking and is not well lit. He starts running towards us and catches up and he looks like he has something in the front pocket of his hoodie. He looks both A and I in the eyes and says ""give me money. i am a beggar i have nothing to lose. i will stab you"" and flashed his homemade shank. In that moment all i could think was ""wow i could definitely get stabbed right now by that very, very rusty knife and i don't have insurance here and i'm going to get sick. i don't even care if i get stabbed i just hope i don't get sick"". (hahha) And then my flight or fight kicks in and lol i flight and low key leave my friend slightly behind. We both run towards the only open store on the road and the owner of that store had to be one of the most incompetent people i have had the opportunity to interact with..he was absolutely NO HELP. We explain to him what was happening and he just looked at us blankly. The homeless guy followed us to the store and was just standing outside waiting for us to come out. We say at the store for about 15 minutes until he finally leaves. We quickly make our move and run toward long street since there are a bunch of people there. We get to the bar we were trying to get to and call and uber and go back to our apartment. we were very shaken to say the least and just sat in A's room and ordered mcdonalds (yes they deliver mcdonalds in SA!!) and tried to get our shit together.

And that's the story of how i almost got stabbed but could only think of how if i get stabbed i'm gonna get infected."

This is a story of an rare case of beardless neckbeard. Let's call him gangster beard because he always promotes drugs and rap music. 

The characters of this story are: me. I'm a tombboyish girl but you'd not know it if I didn't tell you because I'm as flat as a board. L, my best friend and the milady in question. Sweet girl but a weeb that can't say no. She's total neckbeard bait.   
Then we have gangster beard.   
Imagine 22 years of sweat and grime on a body as pale as chalk with soft fuzzy hair on his face and throat. He hates anything related to vegetables and I think anything green in his close proximity would die anyway. He's always wearing the same baggy pants and a baseball cap that has seen much better days as his fedora substitute. 

We were in 12th grade when gangster beard really started to show his neckbeard-ness. It was spring and we, as in L, me and our classmates, were spending the break outside under the trees to get some shade. The teachers didn't care much about what we did since we are supposed to be mature enough to not kill each other on campus. Anyway, gangster beard came over and I kid you not: he tipped his cap in the typical fedora style. ""Huh. what are you doing?"" came his gurgled purr. 

L replied because she didn't want to offend or disappoint the poor beard. ""Nothing much. Just chilling until PE.""

""Ah. Yes. I won't join today. I'm sick again."" I didn't believe it. The only sickness this guy had was the smell that followed him around like a cloud of doom. I just rolled my eyes and kept to myself but L kept talking. 

""Aww. That's too bad. What's wrong? Do you feel alright?"" 

Gangster beard began to ""smile"" but it looked more like a dried up potato. He clasped his hands together and winked at L in what he thought must be a innocent way. He waddled over and sat down right between us without asking, I had to keep myself from barfing. This was a clear do-not-touch scenario. 

Fortunately for me gangster beard didn't like anything other than ""normal"" girls so when he found out that I have lady parts he was both disgusted and felt encouraged to set me right. I'm frequently mistaken for a boy and I make jokes out of it btw. On this sunny spring day the neckbeard quote of the day was ""You should show how you really look and not hide yourself behind this."" He pointed at my jacket. ""If you had a real man around, you wouldn't have to change your appearance to conform to society. Besides I'm sure a top would look good on you."" Nope. Big nope.

Then he turned around and stared at L. L loves metal, J-rock and whatever else music from hell you can find online, thus she had worn her favorite shoulderless top. L loves make up too but she puts it on for fun only. Gangster beard didn't like that either. Every day you'd hear something like ""you don't need make up to be pretty"" or ""girls without make up are real girls"" Real girls? Really? Sure thing bro. 

He wrapped his arm around her and told her how pretty she looked but that she should eat more meat because she was apparently too thin. Then he proceeded to ask her to come to his place and - I kid you not - cook dinner for the two of them while he played on his PS4. He had tried the same with me a while ago but I skipped last minute. L, however said yes and then she practically begged me to come along too. Whatever. I still owed her a favor so I had to go, no? After school we followed the beard to his home.

Gangster beard dragged us to his little apartment, opened the door and kicked the used and moldy bong under the sofa. Upon entering a stench hit our noses that is comparable to what skunk barf or a rotting whale carcass would smell like. L and I tried to maneuver around the used plates and dirty clothes on the floor as we made our way into the living room. I didn't trust the couch and neither did L so we insisted that we'd stand by the window. Our excuse? We wanted to look down on the street below. 

Gangster beard knew we were both single but he also knew I'm the furthest away from ""milady"" that was possible so he targeted L full power. Court-mode: activated!

""I see you watch anime. The girls there are so hot but I would rather look at real girls."" 

L smiled tightly. 

""You look lovely today. I like your skirt. It suits you."" 

I'm raising an eyebrow.

""Would you like to see what a real man looks like? I had been kickboxing when I was younger. Hehe, I still know some moves too.""

At this moment I could only feel pity for the poor creature. L looked at me and after just one look we agreed to get the heck out of there. Gangster beard was fumbling around with his phone to set the mood with some rap music before he went to dim the lights. At this moment my fight instinct kicked in while L's flight mode turned on. I moved to stand beside L what gangster beard didn't like at all. He stood up to his full height, still smaller than me, and his full weight, more than L and I combined. He. Was. Pissed. 

""Can't you see that L and I are talking to each other?""

""But you invited anon too. Remember?"" L.

""Yes but it is rude to interrupt. I'm sorry milady. Let's continue alone? I bought you this new drama you were talking about. We could watch it together and I could show you how real men snuggle...""

I grabbed L's hand and dragged her out of there. A door was kicked down that day and a neckbeard heart was broken but neither of us cared. We just wanted to get the hell out of that hole. I called my own squad and told the guys what happened, they invited me to the smackdown of the century should gangster beard try anything again. 

The next day he looked like a kicked puppy but thanks to me and my squad he didn't ask milady out again. 

L and I were mistaken for a couple not long after. We played pretend to scare the creeps away. 

Two months later L started to date the cute intern from her town. 

The End. "

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I feel as if this is a blessing in disguise, but I feel a bit ashamed that I should have seen this coming. I was the only IT guy in the company but they hired a new guy and we became close. The company thinks they can replace me with an intern, and double the new guys workload. He fought hard for me but lost. 

I called up 3 old bosses and all of them want to meet me to see if I can come to work for them, and this helps me with my motivation, but I still feel like a failure. My current boss told me I can stay for the month of sept and work part time in October. 

What I find weirdest about this is the timing. It’s really taken a hit to my confidence. 

Like I said before... I feel like this is a blessing in disguise, but at 40 years old being fired for the first time, I feel really lost right now and unsure of how to really bring positive light into it. 

How easy is it to rebound from something like this?"

#SEASON 14

- Like I said before, Moretti's condescension was not at all an effective way to win the ER staff over. By the time I got to the finale I completely forgot about him
- Abby's backslide into alcoholism broke my heart. It makes a little bit of sense tho, how are we going to have a character who's an alcoholic and never *really* see her act out as an alcoholic (Leo McGarry notwithstanding I don't think he backslid on the West Wing and he can do no wrong RIP)
- Neela's dorky underage intern wasn't as charming as they thought that plotline was gonna be
- They never dealt with Morris failing his ER boards again, how important is that for a real-life doctor?
- Moretti's leaving was so rushed, I wish we could've kept him as chief through the finale (although I loved Angela Bassett, not because her character was that amazing but because Angela Bassett)
- Random interim ER Chief Skye was... not good.
- Ayyy shoutout to the Jeanie Boulet cameo, the beginning of characters making last appearances ahead of the end of the show
- I liked hippy chaplain lady as a partner for Tony: in the end they tried to turn Tony and Sam into a second coming of Doug and Carol to lesser effect. Unlike everyone predicted tho, I actually didn't hate Tony. Definitely in my Top 5 of doctors at the end of ER's run.
- Simon initially sucked, and then sucked less, but still sucked. Glad he sought out help for his abuse in the end tho
- Also realizing now Neela really had a romance thing with every other doctor in the hospital. Gallant, Ray, Gates, Dubenko had that crush, and Simon. Why'd they keep pushing that angle?
- Hey look it's Steve Buscemi

#SEASON 15 

- God damnit Steve Buscemi
- On a more serious note WHAT THE FUCK WHY'D Y'ALL KILL GATES?? I knew it was gonna be him and not same following the season 14 cliffhanger because everything in his life was falling into place. About to marry Bettina and become chief? Nah fuck that let's kill him. Doctor Death Count now has Lucy Knight, Rocket Romano, Mark Greene, and Greg Pratt (did I miss anyone?)
- Why the fuck is Abby leaving?? It's the final season just hold on until the end damnit. The mystical wall of name tags was a nice touch/reward to longtime viewers. Were we supposed to know every doctor on the wall? There were some I didn't recognize. Also were Moretti, Chen, Weaver, and Morgernstern on the wall as well?
- Don't care for the new interns. Then again I didn't care for Lucy Knight at first :'( maybe they'd have grown on me if we had more time, but show's literally over
- Heal Thyself was really good, but with how much hype there was surrounding it, I was expecting a full-on reunion. I mentioned this in a separate post, but I initially was confounded by how Mark Greene was appearing in Heal Thyself until I remembered he didn't actually die, they just got Anthony Edwards to return for a guest appearance.
- Sam's extreme anger with Tony after he let the kids go to the party pissed me off, and the things she said to Tony in her anger were inexcusable. She acts as if he was failing in raising Sarah as if her own kid wasn't just as messed up. She pushes people away and her temper was never dealt with in the course of the show. Even in that mock training scene from an episode some seasons back, we see her put her hands on a patient in a hypothetical scenario. Check yourself, Sam.
- Cool to see Morgenstern again, flashbacks initially felt corny
- FUCK YES CARTER IS BACK. Man I missed him.
- oh no his kidneys
- Really appreciated the cameo of Doug and Carol, but I wish it could've been deeper/felt by other characters who knew and remembered them. Sad that they never knew the kidney went to Carter.
- Peter's cameo also warmed my heart, and nice to see him a bit mellowed out with old age.
- I imagine they were trying to make a point with how alone Carter was in the end in the hospital room, but I sure he had friends in connections, just in Darfur and now longer in Chicago.
- Bye Neela, we kind of miss you. Her leaving now just made more room for the finale, and good for Ray to finally get the girl even though she kinda sucks
- Did Morris really propose or was he just saying that I'm serious about this relationship for the future?

#FINALE
- HELL YEAH LET'S HEAR THAT OG THEME SONG AGAIN
- Finale was amazing. Loved all the callbacks to the pilot. 
- Thought it was mildly out of character for Kerry to be kissing everyone on the cheek, but she's shown she can be mellow and loving when not in a position of power. 
- Why did Alexis Biedel suddenly show up in the finale? 
- I'm still in love with Susan Lewis and I'm glad she left her nice but mildy wack husband. Sucks that she's stuck with a kid named Cosmo tho.

Debating personal feelings, current situation, and income.",nailsforbreakfest,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9f5fod/thinking_about_leaving_current_job_for_possible/,"This will be long so please bear with me. 

I am an almost 21 year old college student. Currently enrolled full time in school for education. A year and a half left before graduation, with the last semester student teaching. 

I am currently employed as an assistant manager for a restaurant working 40 hours a week (50 during summer) making $12/hour (overall around $27,000ish a year). Have been there for three and a half year. Technically my first job. 

Last year I got a job offer as a salesperson working in commission with the possibility of making $35,000 a year to $70,000 a year depending on skill, economy, and working hours. I told my company I was thinking about taking it. They asked me what it would take for me to stay, since I do a lot of the work at the store. I told them the amount listed above that I make currently, mainly cause I was training for assistant at the time, then I was a shift leader, and felt bad about possibly leaving, and not as much confidence in myself to be a sales person. So they agree. I turn down the offer. The employee says the offer stands if I change my mind. 

Fast forward a year, and I’m miserable at my job. My boss (same as before) is a dick, the future boss since the current will be moving cross country soon is terrible, the assistant manager-in-training is terrible. Me and another manager training for the position above me (operational manager) are running he store completely it feels like. The district supervisor I know hates me. I can tell from his mannerisms toward me. I no longer love the job like I used to. I would like to build my resume for after college. Overall, I want a better working environment, as well as possibly a bigger yearly income depending on my skill level

In this job, I’m much more confident in my ability than before. I could do well in sales. 

I have a few questions: 
1. Should I take this other job? Take the effort to change jobs in the middle of college, even though I hate everything about it with hopefully a better job?

2. Tell my employer the truth? Reason being the person who offered me the job is a fiancé of a coworker. Before when I was offered the first time, he treated her terribly, and I don’t want that to happen again. Should I lie and say I got some sort of educational internship, or tell the truth and risk her and her fiancé possibly catching hell? 

Thank you very much for any and all advice. "

Dark times are coming, and I don't know what to do to get ready.",MountainMerrow,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9f5op1/i_think_im_about_to_break_up_with_my_girlfriend/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for six month, and she's sacrificed a lot for me. She's been so loving and supportive and generous. In the last four months I've been extremely depressed, and I was hospitalized for the first time because I came close to attempting. But it's gotten to be too much. I realize now that I can't break up with her, because I feel like I owe her too much. After all she's done for me, how could I dump her?

To make matters worse, she's moving into an extremely difficult period of her life. An internship, masters classes, work. She's taking on a lot, and she needs someone to be there for her. Moreover, her clock is ticking (her words, not mine.) She wants to be married and have a family. Although she doesn't want that now, she is turning 31 in a few months and knows that she wants to be definitively heading in that direction. That makes me feel doubly guilty, because I'm not sure taking what she gave and running, I also wasted her time.

I want to be clear that she does not want me to see things that way (regarding the ""my clock is ticking"" statement.) She has been very vocal about not wanting me to be pushed into the life plans she has for herself. She doesn't try to hide her desires, but she also doesn't want to force me to do anything I don't want to do. I don't want to demonize her at all.

So, on Saturday when we have dinner planned for our half-anniversary, I'm going to sit her down and tell her that I feel trapped. That I feel like I'm obligated to stay with her. And the truth is that I'm deeply unhappy. Not just with our relationship, but with my life. I have no interest in my old hobbies. Even eating and sex and sleeping, your basic animal drives, feel like chores. She deserves to know that truth, even if it hurts her. I don't know if it's going to lead to a break up, because I'm not certain that that's what I want. But I know that hiding my anxiety and confusion is wrong, and she deserves better.

After it happens, whatever it is, I'm going to be struggling. I've always felt like I hurt people or use them and just move on. I bottle up my depression until it explodes and someone else has to deal with it, and then I get out. It's ended other relationships before, but none of them were with women so loving and kind and supportive of me. This is going to hurt, and I don't know how I'm going to deal with the aftermath. Not having someone to call at night. Not having a person to hold my hand. Even though my interest in her romantically is fading, she is still my closest confidant. I feel alone and isolated and afraid now. It's going to get worse, and I don't know how to deal with it.

I'm medicated. I've been seeing a therapist for half my life. I know about the basics, like diet, exercise, letting my friends and family know what's going on. But none of that is enough now, and I know that it won't be enough then. I'm worried that I'll hurt myself.

How do I get ready for this? Long term, I want to learn to love my life again. But I don't know for sure that I'll get to find out."

A whole achievement hadn’t it been for the fact that I basicaly inherited the company from my dad. He was already in his seventies so he couldn’t really bring up what it took anymore. Since I was his only child conceived with his latest throphy wife he had no one else to give the company to and that brings me where I am today. 

It’s not that I am not qualified either. I have two degrees, a nose for buisness like my dad and my mothers looks. That combined made for the best products the company has gained in years. The fact that I was easy to look at came in very handy when contracts needed to be signed most of the time those middle aged buisnessmen had more attention for me than what was on the paper they signed and things couldn’t get any better at all.

The world literaly lay at my feet as I looked over the city from the luxury two story penthouse located in the tallest building of the city which happend to be my companies building. My office was basicaly located right under where I lived on the third highest floor. There were no other employees stations there either the whole floor was basicaly occupied by my private Office and the big meeting rooms. I rarely had to travel down further than that. 

Nothing could ruin my life well nothing but the fact that earlier this year an employee had made an accounting error which I wasn’t aware of. It was one including a kind of questionable contractor which in turn would make it look like our company helped in money laundering. Ofcourse that was absurd and noone was aware of it not even me. It was just a small error yet if someone would stumble across it by accident and bring it out blowing up the whole thing that error could cost me jail time and the company.

Hey, my name is Roxy and if it wasn’t clear already I would love to do a non-con roleplay revolving around blackmail. I am very curious as to what character you would like to play in this but I am only looking for a female or futa character to play with. So sorry guys unless you are willing to play a convincing girl this isn’t for you, oh and if you are a guy who is fine with playing a girl or futa then please don’t tell me okay? Let me live the fantasy.

I myself will be playing the 26 year old Roxy, she is rather small and slender being only 5’2” with a toned trained body. Her butt isn’t all to big but it is Nice and firm. Her stomach is flat and she sports a pair of B cup breasts. Her hair is long and Brown usualy cascading down hair back in a wavy manor. Her skin is quite pale and she has a pair of bright blue eyes and full lips. She likes to keep her look natural using only limited amounts of make-up. For work she always dresses smartly in knee lenght skirts, matching jacket. A blouse underneath, a pair of pantyhose and comfortable heels.

Preferably I am looking for something somewhat longterm. I have a busy life and sometimes it is hard getting back at you but I promise I will try my best to give everyone who writes me a decent response an answer back. 

I have a couple of ideas about who your character could be so if you really don’t have any inspiration please ask. Bare in mind however that she must somehow fit into the company setting so anyone ranging from an 18 year old intern to an employee nearing her pension is allowed. NO people playing an underage character under any circumstance. 

I do have one of these fancy [kinklists](https://i.imgur.com/6Ord6ei.png) but if anything is unclear please just ask 

If you reply to my prompt which I hope you’ll do then please don’t just jump into the play but introduce your character to me. Informing me about what kind of kinks you like would also come in handy and oh if you have questions feel Free to ask. 

Then I gues this is it for this prompt. I am looking forward to some replies. Have a nice day."

I'm a college white girl in a relationship with a hot white guy looking for a non-white girl to basically steal my man and dominate me as a worthless piece of fuckmeat together.

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"
9f5sl7,3,2018-09-12,Can I get into another Big 4?,WannabeCPA23,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9f5sl7/can_i_get_into_another_big_4/,"I go to a school that is recruited almost exclusively by Big 4, and smaller firms are only recruiting for cities within the state. After getting three interviews with Big 4 and only making it to second round with one Big 4 last year for a west coast city, I ended up getting an internship offer for their tax group. I had a great experience with the culture, and they kept the hours at the sweet point between not too intense but also get paid great overtime.

I got a full time offer with them, but my significant other has been living in the Midwest for work. Toward the end of my internship, I told people about my aspirations to get a potential offer transferred to Midwest City and everyone said it should be a super simple process and that transfers happen all the time. Fast forward five months and I've been trudging along and have been in contact with the Midwest City recruiter and he has given me some insight into his relatively tight recruitment numbers. He said he may have a position open in a noncore tax group for when I graduate (January '19), but has been hesitant to make even lose guarantees that he would have a position open for Summer '19 that I would also be open to (I totally get it though, he's not trying to shoot himself in the foot).

In theory he should tell me by the end of the week, but I have started to go to firm nights with Big 4 again. After doing pretty poorly with them for internship interviews last spring though, would I still be able to get a job with them in Popular Midwest City trying to get a full time position? I have kept my grades decent and have stayed active on campus, and I also think I got through the worst of my interviewing nerves from last time.

TLDR; Does having shitty prior interviews for internships disqualify me from getting another interview full time with Big 4? Am I screwed and bound to be homeless and live in a box, asking to do people's 1040's for cash?"
9f6kpx,459,2018-09-12,My (M24) girlfriend (F26) transferred me £400 for a flat deposit before leaving me 2 days later,Larvsesh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9f6kpx/my_m24_girlfriend_f26_transferred_me_400_for_a/,"I met her in March 2017 when we were both living in the same town in France. That September we began a relationship just before she left as her internship was over and she returned to her hometown. We managed to maintain a LDR for an entire year, travelling to see each other every month or so, falling more and more in love every time. At the start of August this year she left France to live with me here in the UK, the plan was to stay with my Uncle for a while until we found jobs and our own place.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We find jobs after a week and everything is going great. We love each other, we're having fun. We're doing what we said we were going to do. There were a couple of teething moments of us getting used to living together but nothing too major.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then at the start of September, just after our anniversary we view a flat. It's very nice, in a great location, a little more expensive than we planned but we decide to take it anyway. She sends me her half of the deposit and we contact the landlord to put it down the next day. That night we go out to celebrate our anniversary and we have an amazing time, we get home, have sex, cuddle and watch Netflix.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I receive a message from the landlord informing me that the flat is already taken. I'm devastated, I contact my girlfriend to meet up with her as we've both finished work. She's with colleagues. I ask if I should join them, she says no, she just wants to be with them. No bother. She's very late getting home that night as she misses the last bus and takes a taxi.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later she says that she doesn't think we should live together, that she's having doubts, that she feels trapped and wants to be free in order to save our relationship. This is a massive shock to me as I felt that everything was great, not perfect of course as living together in a spare room with my Uncle after an LDR isn't the ideal situation, but really pretty good.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I dig further, I say well if this is were the relationship is going then why not just break up right now if that's what you want to do. She says she doesn't know and that she needs space. That afternoon I move out to a friend's place to give her this space, she moves in with a colleague a couple of days later. I respect her wishes so we're not really talking right now but I'm still unsure whether it's a break up or just some time apart.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The plot thickens however.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is a colleague at work that she is close with. A man. Another French man. I know that she texts him quite a bit and that they meet up to do wallclimbing, have drinks after work etc. I don't know for sure but I'm almost certain that she moved in with him. She texts me to say that she left my Uncle's place and to wish me goodnight etc. I try to get a bit more information by asking what the situation is, if it's a spare room (doubtful) or a sofa.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't reply. She still hasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally my mind has been running wild because of this. If it's not a sofa nor a spare room then it must be his bed right? Is that even possible? How could someone be so in love with me one day, enough to look for flats and transfer me hundreds of pounds. And then move in with another man the next? It doesn't make any sense to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Reading this back I know that this sounds silly and that I'm probably worrying far too much.But what if I'm right? What do I do? I'm meeting her on Sunday as she has things to collect from my parents house. Should I confront her then? Any advice would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR** LDR girlfriend moved to my country to live with me. Transferred me money for a flat that we didn't get and then left me two days later (possibly for another man)"

He was previously diagnosed with struvite crystals in his urinary tract and was given pain medication, antibiotics and prescription cat food. 

We have moved twice this summer and will be moving again, to a different state in a week. I am currently traveling and my boyfriend (we live together) is with him. Our roommate texted to let me know he is peeing all over the house as well as clawing up the rug and peeing on it as well as their dog bed. It’s getting to the point that they asked us if there was someone else who could watch him until I move. Today he showed some difficulty while trying to pee on the carpet. 

So, I know that’s an emergency, I only just got this text from our roommate so we’ll be dealing with it ASAP. However, this is the 3rd or 4th time I’ve had to take him in for this - the problem is always momentarily resolved but not long term. I just graduated from college and I’m moving for an unpaid internship so I don’t know how I can keep up with the medical bills. I know I shouldn’t have gotten a pet if I couldn’t afford it, but at the time I have a good part time job and i could, i have savings but I’m just very overwhelmed. I’m sure if you’ve dealt with this before you know it’s not just the medical bills but having to replace furniture and other things in the house as well as stain and odor remover, etc. 

He’s an anxious cat, he has anxiety medication for our moves, but he also just tends to be generally mean to people. I know I sound like a terrible person but I’ve genuinely been thinking of giving him up because I’m so overwhelmed and don’t know what to do. 

I’m not sure what my question is but I just need some advice... thanks!

9f75u6,1,2018-09-12,25 M4F Office Sex (10+ ideas within),mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9f75u6/25_m4f_office_sex_10_ideas_within/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

\- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

Meeting him is kinda hard for now. But those 3 things that I have to finish first is near already. i am now near to becoming an intern. I will start this coming November if i finished my internship then I will graduate on May 2019. When I finally graduate I have to take my licensure exam then I can work. I can achieve all of those 3 next year as long I wont fail and got delayed. 

So yeah, we continued our chat and its been almost 2 months still we chat everyday, no absent. But its just short convos everyday, and some are even unfinished conversations. we also have a lil misunderstandings during that time but not major. 

This misunderstanding happens recently on September 2 2018. I noticed that he’s been ignoring me a lot lately since I think he was too comfortable with me already and he was always with his friends. He will chat me and when I replied he will be gone for how many hours and thats the time he will reply back. As someone who was away from him and sincerely like him. I too needed his attention but I just can’t blurt it out from him since he is not officially my boyfriend we are just “friends who likes each other”. So I will just resist myself from telling him what I have been feeling lately. But if i wont tell him, he won’t know and he might really think that Im always cool with it. I know that I am not the only person in his life right now but I need him too. Liking someone who is a country away from you is not easy, there are times that u just really wanna be close to him,hug him, let him feel how much u like him but you just cant coz you’re far from each other. So only thru talking to him is the only way I could confirm that he is real and this guys likes me too. I know this myself that I am clingy. 

So he came home late its 4 am plus out there and 3 am plus here in my country and he said he will be sleeping in his friends house. He said he wanna call but he cant. But that day I was so annoyed coz he’s been doing the text and reply after how many hours thing again. So I was sulking so much that I can’t keep it to myself anymore and made it so obvious to him. And I just told him go to sleep now. Since it was also very late, why don’t we just sleep instead. And then he told me “you dont seem to like to talk to me today, I will sleep now then, bye” and woaaah just like that? He didn’t even bother asking me what wrong? So I replied and told him. “You didn’t even know how I feel about this” so I was near to crying. He replied explaining and said he was aware that he’s been bad to me lately by not replying fast and coming back late. And there I told him about my side and told him too that I feel like I am not important to him anymore that I am not worth his time.... blah2. And then he said sorry like a lot of times, and assured me that I am an important person to him that he values me a lot and he also promises that from now on he will make me feel important. And he also told me that he is also not playing with me=“he is serious” thats how I interpreted it. So we ended up fixing it tho. We said sorry to each other :) and I tell you guys I am liking this guy more and more. You see we were acting like lovers but we are not. I can now finally relate to Soyou x Junggigo song “Some”. Listen to it. 

So after that small argument, he changed. He is now focusing on me when he is not busy. I actually didn’t mean that he should text me all the time. I was just only asking him if he talked to me and I replied he needs to reply too and wont keep me hanging. But if he cant talk to me right now coz he is busy? Its totally fine with me coz I know, I am not his only priority. And me too I have some things to do too. Coz If i have something to do I tell him in advance that I cant talk right now. So yeah he is more active when he talked to me. Replies right away. Even when he is playing his games when his character dies he will text me and told me he died. Telling me all of his frustrations. And I cheered him too! Telling him he can win ahahaha. Its kinda funny tho ahaha. So I told him “go finish your game first you dont have to reply to me since I know your playing” guys I am cool with dudes playing games I dont mind them that’s their happiness and i dont wanna take that away from this guy. 

So I let him be and he cameback at 1:40 am there and 12:40 am here and then he called me we talked a lot of things. We sang to each other, he taught me some korean words, I taught him english, he asked me in korean “도..야~ 지금 뭐해~?” (Do..e~ what are you doing right now?~) in a very loving tone like the one you can see in korean dramas of how the boyfriend talk to his girlfriend thats the tone he is using to me. And I was like dying with overflowing feelings and butterflies in my stomach. I really love listening to his voice when he speaks korean. We also talked about the future like us meeting, finally sleeping together and stuffs like adults would think*disclaimer we dont talk about sex yet or something. We only talked about until sleeping besides each other and cuddling. We dont wanna think about those right now* . That call of us is the longest one duration is 3 hrs plus. And we didn’t turned off our calls we sleep with it on and we can even hear each others breathing while sleeping and somehow we feel like close to each other sleeping and in a same place. Yes, I know its so pitiful to hear. But its the only way we can do for now since we can’t meet yet. 

So after that talk we continued to chat everyday like normal. Says sweet things to each other. And on September 6, 2018, we started our day like we normally do we talked for a while and he will go out with his friends again. Thats his routine and we can only talk straight during night till early in the morning. But that day too, I told him about me watching couples meet each other for the first time like an LDR and I told him that “the longer we talk to each other (and not being able to meet) it makes me sad” i told him that and he was sad too he then told me not to think of it so much. And after that he told me he is going to his parents house since his lil brother want him to help make his PowerPoint presentation. And then he told me something that made me feel nervous and anxious. 

“And Do..e I have to tell you something 
I’m going to tell you it tom before I go to sleep”

Thats the exact words he said to me. I know he is not so good at english so dont mind it.

So after he said that I got curious and worried. Since I told you guys already from the other post that I am an overthinker. Guess what I did?

Ahaha you’re right I started asking him the possible topic he will tell me tomorrow. 

1. “ur going to leave me one day?”
2. “are u going to tell me not to keep my hopes up??”
3. “or is my attitude too bad?”
4. “or am i too annoying?”

We’ll see... hmmmm

He then keep saying things that kinda give me a clue he is going to leave. I will paste his exact words here and tell me what you think: pls i hope you try to understand what he is saying since he is still not good at english so its kinda broken but pls understand:) ok i decided to add my own interpretation of what he is saying.

“Don’t be nervous 😭
I wish just you can think it to cool”

“And I really hope that after when I say, you can talk with me like it’s not big deal, doesn’t care.”
(And I really hope after I tell you about it, you will still talk to me like its nothing and wont care)

“If you’ll treat me like that I said l, I’m going to be okay a little than before I said it” (If you’re going to treat me like that after I said it, It will make me feel a lil better)

“It just makes you sad +one day more”
(He said this, because I asked him can u tell me now? And that what he replied )

“Don’t be seriously I hope. 
And this thing have to come someday surely”
(During this time, I kinda confirmed that he was really leaving me) (he was saying ‘I hope you wont take this seriously, this thing will surely come someday anyway”

“Btw Sorry please stop nervous just think that I’m a not important person for you. So if its any happens, it isn’t a big deal for you 
Don’t make me regret about tell you about it. My favor” (This part I told him my stomachaches because I am nervous) and I replied why are you saying like that? Are u really leaving me? You are an important person to me, why are saying like that? (Sorry, please stop being nervous. Just think of me as someone who is not an important person to you. So that if it happens already, it will be just like nothing for you. Dont make me regret telling you this. This is my favor)

“You’re important for me so much also but Maybe thinking like it. It help you at least a little”
(You’re important to me too, but making you think like Im just nothing will at least help you a little) 

So yeah thats what he told me. I was so nervous and worried already that I kept on thinking about it. We keep on talking to each other like we are happy coz he asked me not to mention it for now since he is going tell me about it tom anyway. So after that We said goodnight to each other. September 7 2018, And I woke up not feeling good all day coz I know when I got home and talk to him he will tell me a very sad news. So he woke up and greet me first saying he’s outside with his friend eating with a smiley face in the end. He was really trying his best not to ruin the mood thats why he kept on sending me messages with a smiley in the end coz he know I will be sad later. So I went to school not in the mood came home at night and finally asked him about it. 

To be continued on the next part..... 3

9f7l0a,0,2018-09-12,25 M4F Office Sex (10+ ideas within),mjd931,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9f7l0a/25_m4f_office_sex_10_ideas_within/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the ideas below we can chat about ages and tings, also I am an adult looking for an adult for some sexy fantasy.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

\- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

9f8oeq,2,2018-09-12,Looking for Independent Loans - Parents will no longer cosign on loans,blktechnerd96,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/9f8oeq/looking_for_independent_loans_parents_will_no/,"Curveball here...and I need some advice. Current situation is that I just finished a mechanical engineering internship, but I am going to be graduating with a Computer Science degree (this is a recent switch; I currently have no help desk skills for a potential job, but I recently discovered that I am pretty good at coding). Also, I'm currently a Junior, 22 y/o, with about a year and half left of school on paper. I have internship-to-hire offers with a few major software corps lined up via networking for the future, so I am actually not too worried about post graduation so much. The issue is that my parents found out I smoked weed and no longer want to follow through on an agreement to cosign on Federal Parent Plus loans for my tuition (made the dumbest decision to buy from a stranger during said internship; smoked for 5 months straight, weed was laced the whole time, went through opioid withdrawal unexpectedly... it was a whole fiasco and I can somewhat respect their decision although what I did was unintentional).

&amp;#x200B;

I receive zero financial aid from my state school and I have 5 younger siblings, one is also in school, so my parents don't help cover tuition expenses out of pocket hence the major loan. I work through school and pay for my housing and everything else, but I don't make enough to cover any tuition costs. I've been denied for private loans with a cosigner previously so I am afraid the I won't find one on my own. Also, to make matters worse I have a 1.98 GPA which doesn't matter in tech so much after I graduate apparently, but scholarships and grants aren't possible, and apparently a lot of loans require a minimum gpa of 2.5 **(IF I AM WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME)**.

&amp;#x200B;

I have around 10k left via FAFSA, 20k has been taken out via unsubsidized loans and 2500 via subsidized. Im expecting the remaining amount for my tuition to be about 30k, so I'm still short 20k. Is there a way to take out that 20k via subsidized loans? Like I said, I have been rejected from private loans in the past even with a cosigner, so I am afraid that I won't be able to take out the remaining amount...any advice?"
9f8t5f,13,2018-09-12,psa: life is busy and i'm changing my posting schedule,naughty_charlotte,naughty_charlotte,https://www.reddit.com/r/naughty_charlotte/comments/9f8t5f/psa_life_is_busy_and_im_changing_my_posting/,"hi lovelies.

it's been a while since i was active and posting three times a week, huh? sadly, life has been rather busy lately, and that won't change. starting october, i'll start an internship, so instead of being a student with lots of freetime, i'll be working fulltime. so i'm guessing my recording opportunities won't exactly get more either.

between that and the fact that my quality expectations for what i put up for you guys has risen dramatically, i'm changing my schedule to posting once a week: fridays, with tuesdays or sundays being an optional second posting day. 

i missed yesterday posting and will go on a trip the rest of the week, so i'm putting out something tonight, but after that i'll start up with said routine/schedule. i know you'll probably react wonderfully like you always do, but i did want to inform you of it &lt;3 

of course i'll still be working my butt off to get you as much great content as i can, though &lt;3 and also working on that ambitious 500-subs project! (and even my cakeday project already &lt;3) so I think you'll find yourself happy about having to wait a little haha.

god i hope i'll finally stop making so many textposts/announcements here haha

love you all "
9f92x0,1,2018-09-12,Increasing suicidal thoughts and borderline catatonia,accualiizdolan,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9f92x0/increasing_suicidal_thoughts_and_borderline/,"Been suffering with depression/mood swings since I was 12 (am 21 now), but I've never sought professional help. Recently, I missed a deadline for one of my modules and I will be required to re-do a whole year of university just for one module, so I will graduate a year late. My suicidal thoughts had already gotten worse before I found out about this (been terrible for about a year now) yet now I find myself in a state of borderline catatonia sometimes. Sometimes I can see the silver linings in this situation such as:  
i) a year isn't that long   
ii) I am extremely involved in extra-curriculars and my CV looks good anyway   
iii) more time for internships   
iv) might be able to travel for a bit which I've always wanted to do   
v) I can sometimes see my potential especially when I am involved in said extra-curriculars.   


However, there are days when my mind eggs myself on to end my life. It does feel like I will kill myself at some point, however I do not know why I haven't actually done it, though I have planned it out a bit. It feels like I have been going back and forth for years, and the last 10 years of my life has been a blur. There really isn't a point in trying to fight it anymore. "
9f9aec,2,2018-09-12,Lengthy monologue about my abysmal love life,dudewithajolly,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/9f9aec/lengthy_monologue_about_my_abysmal_love_life/,"So I've had exactly three girlfriends in my 26 year long life. Out of them the most reason one was apparently the next important thing after hot showers to me, as I almost can't imagine missing hot showers as much as her after one and a half years. She was a weird woman though. She thought of me as responsible to fulfill her needs as a person. If I stepped out of line I was ripping up her trauma because of her childhood with an alcoholic father, you see. I was the thing in her life that messed with her abandonment issues and it was primarily my responsibility to reign in my flaky tendencies. Which flaky tendencies? I liked a day or two a week after a hard day at a school where I didn't feel like I fit in, to just sit at home and stare into a computer screen (I still have this incredible fatigue btw, despite taking vitamins and doing exercise, so if anybody knows what's up, advice would be appreciated). This to her was evidence of my flaky nature and ambivalent mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to be fair I was fighting a stomach-ache from the first we started seeing each other. I suspect it was because either I ""made a serious effort"" or that was going to be all she wrote, according to her. I spent all my weekends with her since she was at boarding school and it  was the only time we could see each other. I went and saw her at that school and worked during the week. I didn't see anybody but her and her family during those three months and every time I saw her I was happy, but when it became Sunday and we separated the stomachache returned and lasted for three days each time. I spent this time in constant doubt about whether the relationship was right for me. But I stuck in there.

&amp;#x200B;

After the three months she moved back home from the boarding school and this is when I broke up with her the first time. I was working at a warehouse at the time and every day I could feel the stomachache getting worse, moving all over my body. While I didn't see her during this it suddenly dawned on me that it was because of her that I was feeling like that. Breaking up with her was the hardest and most painful thing I've ever done in my life (almost). Looking back I realise that it was probably due to commitment phobia. She was moving back and I already felt suffocated. It could only get worse.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later while I had worked full time the entire summer break she contacted me about trying again. I had felt absolutely awful and like crying every day for the entire month. Constantly thinking about whether I had made the right decision. In constant agony.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first saw her again I was happy, but then she mentioned that she had been let down and been ""failed"" so much, she was angry with me and distrustful. That's when the stomachache returned. She wasn't my girlfriend, she was my jailer, and I let her control me. Some panic-attacks followed those couple of days while we spent every waking hour together. To this day I'm sorry what I put her through. She was in love with me and I was essentially playing with her heart without meaning to. I had been for a long time. I still don't quite understand what my problem was, except for that pressure from her and the fact that, when I kissed her I never felt anything, which I used as a litmus test for whether I was in love. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed with her anyways and did things like she wanted. Spent almost every day with her. Asking for ""a day off"" to play computer would make her upset. Looking back I understand how it made her feel. I only made her separation anxiety worse and so I suffered myself for her sake. When she told me she wanted to find an apartment and move in together I didn't feel that scared, or exited, but I did feel worried that I would just never be able to have friendships or any time for myself. But I told her that it wasn't the right time. I was still in school, I couldn't imagine going through the stress of changing everything up. 

She put pressure on me: ""I just don't know how long I should wait"", the subtext there is: ""if I lose patience, I will dump you"". Again, this was her separation anxiety talking. So I did what she wanted and started looking at apartments with her. This is about when my internship started and I started being under extreme stress. We couldn't manage working together in the group I was in, I already suffer from pretty extreme anxiety/shyness that I was trying to manage, while teaching at a school I had never been to before and managing group work with a group that wasn't good together. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was 8 months after we decided to get together again and the break up was horrible. This is mainly the reason I'm sharing it here. Thinking about it hasn't helped, writing about it hasn't helped. It's stuck in my mind as a problem I can't fix. We split up on less that good terms, under stressful conditions. I would have acted differently if I was as smart as I am now and I feel like I deserve a chance to make things better. Yet I also recently discovered that she has found someone else and moved, so I feel like I can't contact her and doing that wouldn't be a favor. She should be doing better now, having moved on so why rip up the past? Also she'll hand my ass to me. I just don't understand. I must have been in love with her, because why else am I here one and a half years later, still thinking about her? It was the most significant thing in my life it feels like, yet it ended in a fizzle, then silence. Everything reminds me of her. I'm going crazy.


TLDR: Still thinking about ex after one and a half years. Mostly musing, but would like advice/feedback/whatever."

9f9u6q,1,2018-09-12,How to see if Credit score is being dinged without hurting credit for looking?,djroombainthehouse,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9f9u6q/how_to_see_if_credit_score_is_being_dinged/,"Long story short, I think my credit score should be better and I think it may be being dinged by Golds Gym.

Since turning 19, I have paid 4 bills monthly on time, without fail (cable/internet, water/electric, gas, and truck payment) for the past 4 years. I have paid my credit card bill every month without fail for the past 5 years. Jan-Aug 2017 I was on an internship and got a discount through the company for Golds Gym. I called/emailed to cancel the gym membership because I was going back to school at the end of my internship. The monthly payment was deducted out of my paycheck each month and did not have a contract. However, last month, I got a call from an unknown number and googled it and it came up as a Golds Gym. I put two and two together (or maybe pulled a Charlie from IASIP with regards to CAROL) and think they could be dinging my credit.

Now, I have read that it can hurt your credit to request a credit report. Is there a way to do that without hurting your credit? Is there another way to see why my credit score isn’t higher?"
9fa9ot,189,2018-09-12,Is the song Rocket Man actually about Josh Allen? A lyrical analysis,FriedChickenIsTrash,buffalobills,https://www.reddit.com/r/buffalobills/comments/9fa9ot/is_the_song_rocket_man_actually_about_josh_allen/,"Now if you've been on this sub lately, you've probably heard about the prowess of Josh Allen's arm and for good reason, because 90 yard bombs down the field don't fucking grow on trees.  Now the Rocket Arm is attached to a man.  A 6 foot 6 230 pound from Wyoming by way of Reedley College.  What does this make him as many of us pointed out?  A Rocket Man.  

And to celebrate his ascension to the starting signal caller I played a highlight video of his I found on YouTube to Elton John's Rocket Man.  I then proceeded to jerk off until my left leg went numb.  But much like a throw shattering the ribcage of our receivers, it hit me.  The song is far far far too lyrically similar to our situation to be a coincidence.  Yes the song came out 24 years before Josh Allen was born but clearly Elton John knew of this kid's potential one day and wrote a song about him.  Seriously check the lyrics 

&gt;She packed my bags last night, pre-flight

Clearly speaks about a woman getting ready to travel.  But this line is actually written from a football's perspective.  Packing the bag clearly means the intern getting the ball bag ready so Allen can get his shoulder exercise in and throw them across state lines 

&gt;Zero hour: 9:00 a.m

We play LA this week who operate on a three hour time difference so our noon is their 9am, basically right in the middle of warm ups where Allen can look across the field and see his opponents.  It's basically like a shark staring at a goldfish. It's called zero hour for the zero in the number 50 which is how many points Allen will put up that day.

&gt;And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then

Clearly insinuating Allen is going to be so elated by his performance it will be like being under the guise of THC.  This THC has a double meaning, it's an acronym for Tom Hates Cheese, as in bleu cheese signifying Tom Brady likes ranch 

&gt;I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife

Miss the Earth so much.  Basically saying Allen is on another planet in terms of skill.  Either that or Earth was doing a checkdown and Mars was open on a fly route.  
&gt;It's lonely out in space

This is what Allen thinks about when he sees all his receivers have separation and his line has a clean pocket.  So much space on the field he almost feels like he's the only one on the field

&gt;On such a timeless flight

Throwing bombs down the field takes time, it's not rocket science.  If you take these last two sentences together it could mean he literally threw the ball into space

[Chorus]

&gt;And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

Clearly speaking about trusting the process here, and the long lasting era of Josh Allen.  

&gt;'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

I mean, fucks sake he says Touchdown, Allen throws touchdowns

&gt;I'm not the man they think I am at home

He's telling everyone Allen is gonna be a fucking God playing on the Road

&gt;Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man

Self explanatory 

&gt;Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone

Self explanatory!  Up here alone meaning he is on a higher pedestal of QB play

&gt;And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

Referencing the Buffalo window for Super Bowl contention 

&gt;'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

2 mentions of Touchdown.  Or about half a quarter for Josh


&gt;I'm not the man they think I am at home

At home he's a very kind lad.  I mean look at him, he looks like his post game celebration is cutting his grandmother's lawn and a warm glass of milk before bed at 8:30.  On the field he'll skullfuck your secondary

&gt;Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man

Obvious meaning 

&gt;Rocket man! 

Straight up just fucking mentions him like when the lady at Starbucks says your coffee is ready.  May as well be yelling Josh Allen with the number 17 tattooed on your forehead like that 69 guy 

[Verse 2]

&gt;Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids

Mars is an acronym for My Abysmal Receiving is Shit.  This receiving core isn't the place to develop a rookie.  

&gt;In fact, it's cold as hell

You ever been to Buffalo in the winter?  Fucking cold.

&gt;And there's no one there to raise them if you did

There's no one to raise your kids in this cold place.  Implying he has kids, and he is their daddy.  Who's daddy is he?  The Patriots daddy

&gt;And all this science I don't understand

Catch = 90 yard bomb multiplied by 2 feet in the endzone, again, not fucking rocket science 

&gt;It's just my job five days a week

Throwing touchdowns can get tiring 7 days a week.  I mean, fuck, even Jesus needed 3 days off but Josh only needs 2

&gt;A rocket man! A rocket man!

Josh Allen!  Josh Allen!

[Outro]

&gt;And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

Says this 9 times in a row, turn a 9 upside down you get a 6.  Slur your speech and six sounds like sit.  And as we all know Tom Brady sits when he pees

And there you have it.  Affirmed proof Elton John wrote a song about Josh Allen 24 years before his birth and the prophecy has been fulfilled.

9fae8y,1,2018-09-12,[QUESTION] Ibanez ARZ200 or Tokai LSF128?,Weonlawea,Guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/9fae8y/question_ibanez_arz200_or_tokai_lsf128/,"Hi, I'm a mediocre guitarrist, been playing for like 7 years since I was like 14 but just recently picked up and starting learning more ""seriously"". I have had the same guitar since I started which is a GIO Ibanez (cant remember the exact model right now). 

The thing is, I am a big boy and make my own money now, and I plan to buy a new guitar. Im between:

This: https://www.guitarcenter.com/Ibanez/ARZ-Series-ARZ200FM-Electric-Guitar.gc 

And this: https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/guitarplanet/item/tokai_ls128f_flame_lp_bs/

Not exactly those but the website where I'm buying them from works like ass so... 

The price for the Ibanez is $406 and, while the Tokai original price is 1,4K its on sale for $700 USD right now.

While of course, its common knowledge to think that the more expensive the guitar the better, I have made some research and it seems that the Tokai's are quite decent, but I'm not sure if its worth the price difference compared to the Ibanez, or if I'm going to be able to notice lol. I still make little money (internship lol) so $700 USD is more than one salary for me compared to the $400 hahah

Anyways, I'm going to the store on friday/saturday to try them out for myself but I wanted to see if anyone here has some personal opinion that can share so I have some background on the guitars.

Many thanks :)"
9fanm0,1,2018-09-12,25 M4F Office Sex (10+ ideas within),mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9fanm0/25_m4f_office_sex_10_ideas_within/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

\- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

\- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

\- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

\- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

\- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

\- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

\- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

\- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

\- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

\- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

9fbg83,9,2018-09-12,Big 4 recruiting - how to get offers? (CPA w/experience but no offers),iRobot_,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9fbg83/big_4_recruiting_how_to_get_offers_cpa/,"So curious if anyone here can provide some feedback as to why I'm having trouble with getting into the Big 4.

* 6-7 years of audit experience at a few different smaller firms
* Passed CPA exam
* Worked on mid-to-large sized clients (over $500M+ revenue)
* Lots of industry specific experience
* Completed engagements from start to finish (planning, testing, preparing reports, etc.)
* Trained staff and interns and have worked directly with Senior Managers and Partners
* Lots of experience with big name accounting software and analytics

The only thing is over the course of my 6-7 years, I've only been with a single firm for just under 2 years. And also I took a year or so off recently to complete the CPA exam once and for all, so there is a bit of a gap (even though I've been active with networking other voluntary/accounting-related leadership roles).

&amp;#x200B;

I hear so much how all these firms are in desperate need for Seniors, but whenever I get a call from recruiters, they try to get me to take an ""Experienced Associate"" role. Even when I agree to apply to those roles, then a day or two later I get a call or email back saying I wasn't selected for the position.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think is the deal? It's just odd considering the experience I have is adequate to fill a Managerial role, but why am I getting filtered out or not getting calls back from Partners to interview for those opportunities?

&amp;#x200B;

I did get an offer from a Top 5 firm for an Experienced Associate role, but I ended up declining that earlier this year while I was still taking the exam. And then another local firm offered me a Staff Accountant role, but I am a CPA and have much more experience than that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Any help appreciated."
9fc06g,2,2018-09-12,"[DISCUSSION] Anyone here have experience at FIT, need some HELP",Testarific1,streetwear,https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/9fc06g/discussion_anyone_here_have_experience_at_fit/,"Going to post this long story, tl;dr at the end.


whats up ill try to keep this short but it might get a bit rambly...


I always got great grades in high school, so I always thought I had to go to college, get a degree, then get a decent paying job and thats it. Thought that I would be looked down on if I didn't. I was never really into fashion until later in high school, but still never imagined doing it as a career. 


I only applied to 2 colleges, didn't get into Columbia, so I left for Stony Brook, majoring in computer science. never coded before that, but I told myself id be getting paid great money and I could work in the city when it was done. Got good grades my 1st 2 semesters (3.7 gpa, A in CSE) However, I'm not really sure I want to be coding for a living, the coding I'm learning is for hardcore software development and thats for sure what I don't want to do. I realized I could die at 25 and not be doing what I loved, whats the point in that. Money only gets you so much, and I'm sure the money could eventually come in fashion if I really stick to it. 


I've recently really got into fashion. Started youtube, coded my own website (this had nothing to do with my major, our CS program is good, but doesn't teach web development so I plan on learning this on the side anyways), and making some clothes of my own. I go to the city all the time, recently for nyfw and I really do think its what I want to do, especially getting right into the city.  


Its not as stable as a computer science degree, but I hate Long Island and don't know if I should just drop Stony Brook and attend FIT or Baruch in the Spring for fashion business, or just fashion. Im confident in whatever I do, but I really need some advice. Fashion is something I can do for hours and I love the design process. my dream goal is to get a little ""clout"" hate that term, and start a creative outlet / brand. 


One problem I think I have is that I compare myself to people doing great things in fashion at a young age, which is why I don't want to be ""wasting"" my time in long island, when I could be in the city networking and making a name for myself. I'm 18 and want to get out there a do some cool stuff, I sometimes think Its longing for success and wanting to be like some famous people, but I genuinely like getting out there and meeting people, collaborating, etc. 


My argument for staying in CS is that I can continue fashion on the side, and having the CS background allows me a different way into the industry. (web development internship at Grailed, etc.), but id probably abandon it as soon as I got a foot in the door and if you aren't constantly learning in CSE , the degree goes to waste. 


I can answer more questions if need but id love some feedback. Asked this in life, but I figured fashion sxn might have some stuff to say about FIT and the industry. 


#tl;dr going to stony brook for computer science, don't know if I should transfer after 1.5 semesters (can finish in 3 more) to FIT / Baruch for Fashion Business Management or stay at Stony, then move to the city. "
9fckul,5,2018-09-12,JustNo from the Vault: Details are important,yellowdragonteacup,JustNoCoworker,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoCoworker/comments/9fckul/justno_from_the_vault_details_are_important/,"My last post about a young female lawyer trying to make a reputation for herself (and succeeding, but not in the way she hoped for) in turn reminded me of another female lawyer that I worked with for a while a few years back.  She would have been in her late twenties or early thirties when she was at the firm, and in the short time she was there (she only lasted a few months) she also made an impression.

This lady took herself deathly seriously. She had no sense of humour about anything, at all. She had gone back to uni and studied law later in life and was tremendously impressed with the fact that she had a law degree, and herself.  She could be quite self-important and she obviously thought she was a great lawyer. I disagreed.  By this time I had worked in several firms of varying size and quality, had dealt with many different lawyers in the process, and I could (and still can) quickly tell the good from the bad and the mediocre, and she was mediocre.

The first day at the firm she presented the practice manager with a ‘list of requirements’ for her office. She bossed around the assistants and would have serious ‘talks’ with us about the way we did things, telling us how she thought we ought to do them (she had no idea). The letters she wrote were hilariously pompous and littered with spelling and grammatical errors.  I would regularly take them in to one of the senior lawyers to be edited and rephrased before they were mailed.

She also wrote a complaint to the practice manager one day about one of the interns, and how this intern’s behaviour ‘resisted correction’, and how on several occasions she had caught this intern doing something she considered they should not have been doing and she had ‘redirected’ her but the intern had ‘refused the redirection’.  The practice manager laughed at it and deleted the email.

This lawyer left our firm after several months for a number of reasons, one of them hilariously being that she felt we didn’t take the law seriously enough. Nobody attempted to persuade her to stay.

Periodically when something brings this lady to mind, I will quickly google her to see what she is up to. It seems a lot of other firms must not be taking the law seriously enough for her either as her LinkedIn page has undergone some revisions every time I look at it, and the present version has some large time gaps.  She has also since then completed not one but two (!!) Masters degrees in different areas of law, and earlier this year opened her own firm. I am not surprised that she would eventually decide to work for herself. Easier to make sure you don’t have to hear things you don’t want to hear that way.

I looked on the firm website and it is a simple, one page website that she has obviously put together herself. The information on it is written in that same deathly earnest but at the same time hilariously pompous style, and it contains a number of spelling errors and numerous instances of the greengrocer’s apostrophe, which is a favourite grammatical error of hers.

(As a sidenote, this puzzles me. How exactly does one get through university, not once, not twice, but three times, without any improvement in their writing skills? Trust me when I say that some university lecturers really mark this kind of thing down hard, I have some first-hand experience with that. If I had handed in something written like her stuff to some of the lecturers I had it would have been extensively red-penned. I wonder if she disregarded the feedback because she felt she knew better?)

The thing is though, for all her obviously extensive efforts, you know what makes her memorable to people? One little detail that undermines it all: her teeth. Let me explain.

This lady is average to look at, average height and weight, long brunette hair. Not ugly but also not particularly eye catching, right up until she opens her mouth and speaks to you. Unfortunately, her teeth are a bright Amal Clooney at the royal wedding kind of yellow.  It is incredibly distracting and once you see them, you can’t look away.  I think that she genuinely didn’t (and doesn’t) understand how off-putting they were.

It was funny sometimes to see clients react. At the first social function we held at that firm after she started, I saw a long term client of the firm and his wife chatting to her with strange expressions on their faces. A little while later the client, a six foot plus teddy bear of a man, sidled over to me and whispered in my ear “What’s with the yellow teeth?!” This was not an isolated incident.

I recall she was directly asked about it one day, and the story is that her mouth is so sensitive that she can’t stand to brush her teeth, it is too painful. Going to the dentist regularly for a scale and clean is more painful. So she deals with it by just not cleaning her teeth, ever.

The practice manager said to me later on that she also has sensitive teeth but she refuses to allow them to become anything like this lady’s are, and it is possible because most dentists have this wonderful thing called anaesthetic that they can give you before they touch your teeth if they suspect that what they are about to do will hurt you.

I have to clarify that it has been several years since I have seen this lawyer in person, but I can still vividly recall her bright yellow teeth. A close look at the several photographs of her available online all show her in very serious-looking poses with her mouth closed, so I suspect nothing has changed.

Some people are weird."

9fdid6,4,2018-09-12,Want to automate new user setup,MagicSarparast,helpdesk,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpdesk/comments/9fdid6/want_to_automate_new_user_setup/,"I'm level 1 help desk at a medium sized firm with relatively 300 users, we are constantly having interns fly in and out. I'm a recent grad and want to prove to my team that I bring ambition to the table and want to increase my little value to my company. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far on average it can take most of a day to setup one user and majority of it is repetitive tasks. Heres the process of setting up a new user.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Copy similar user on AD and begin creating the new user with information provided from the on boarding form. 

2) Create mailbox on exchange

3) Image laptop using PXE Boot with WDS

4) Boring repetisse tasks (Turn off cortana, select key board, change time zone, update each driver manually (the worst), domain join, sign into user account, make a few more mundane changes (you get the idea)

&amp;#x200B;

My boss has given a lot of trust into me and I've brought up that I would like to some how automate some of these tasks. He's given me the green light and told me he will provide me with whatever I need.

I imagine im not the only one to think of this and someone has definitely applied and achieved this goal. Willing to learn and dive into whatever toolset that is required as long as its a step in the right direction.

9fds4c,1,2018-09-12,"He[20s] doesn't want to take our relationship further, I'm [20s] heartbroken, but can't avoid him.",FineAffect,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9fds4c/he20s_doesnt_want_to_take_our_relationship/,"David and I had met in a class we had together last year. He approached me because he recognized me from another class. We instantly became friends and studied together every day in the library. We became friends with other people in our major and started hanging out with everyone outside of school.


In January, David ended his long-term relationship because she had cheated on him for the second time. A month later, he dropped out of the school for the rest of the semester to go back home because of a family emergency. In that same month, I got out of my toxic, borderline abusive, relationship. At his going-away party, I told him I was single. For the rest of the night he was very close and somewhat affectionate (like rubbing my back and sitting right next to me). We went on a “date” the next day. It was a lot of fun, he paid for my dinner, we drank wine and watched scary movies together, then took and Uber to meet up with a friend downtown. We crashed at the friend’s house and made out all night. We hung out again the following day and just chilled while I did my homework for a class. We kissed goodbye and he went back home the following day.


A few weeks later, my friend group and I visited him during spring break and again right after the semester ended. Both times, he was super happy to see me and there were intimate encounters between us. Our friend group teased us about being “love birds” because we were cuddly and acted like a couple. As I was leaving, he kissed me all over my face talked about coming back into town to visit, but that didn’t happen because I spent my summer in an internship a few states away. We talked a few times during the summer but there was not much contact between us.


David moved back into town last week. We’ve been hanging out in our friend group in the library. I went out with him, his sister and a friend on Thursday to celebrate his birthday before he went back home to visit family. We sat next to each other the entire time and he gave me a goodnight kiss on the cheek, something he commonly did as a form of affection during my visits in his hometown, I really like it. Last night he told me he liked he liked me but felt that he led me on to believe that more would happen between us. Since I had gotten out of long-term relationship earlier this year, I knew I needed a break from relationships so that I could focus on school. Despite this, I’m really sad about it. Logically, I know a relationship would get in the way of school, but my heart is broken. I feel stupid for not talking about this before anything happened between us.


Now I don’t know how to act around him. I can’t avoid him because we have the same friend group. Today, I was acting cold towards him because I want to stop liking him. He noticed something was wrong, but I just said that I was frustrated about not being able to figure out the homework, which is true, but obviously not the whole truth. How do I handle being around him all the time while trying to get over him?


TL;DR I got really close (romantically) to a guy in my friend group. Yesterday, he told me he liked me, didn't want to take it further. How I handle my interactions with him now?"

Basically a phone screen first. Has anyone else here been through the intern interview process with Nvidia? What kind of questions should I expect them to ask?

I checked GlassDoor but the information given was about the internship itself, not much about the questions asked during the interview.

I'm beginning to play around with Google and IBM's playground but I don't know how to move on. I'm a freshman in college so no internship or mentorship are willing to take me in. Many people tell me to wait till I'm older and have taking more classes but it's sad to think that I put in all this work and am unable to put it to good use.

9fe97f,0,2018-09-12,Please pray for my physical and mental health (28F here),hannahepadilla,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/9fe97f/please_pray_for_my_physical_and_mental_health_28f/,"I have 3 forms of lupus: SLE, lupus nephritis (which targets the kidney) and lupus cerebritis (which targets the brain). I’ve had on and off seizures since my first mini stroke in 2011, and my health issues (along with my dad’s death in 2013) put me back a few years from graduating in university.  I graduated in 2015. After a few internships and years of job hunting, I got a job last year and am still working there. However, I have been having vertigo, confusion and chills since February. It got so so bad that I ended up having a car accident, seizure in early May and was hospitalized for 11 days. I had (unpaid) medical leave for all of May because i haven’t been working there for a year yet. So when I got back I had to take uber everywhere because I no longer had a car and I wasn’t sure about the status of my license. After a phone hearing with the DMV last month, they reversed my suspension and got my license back and I just got a new car. I praise God because it’s a 2016 Jetta and I found out that my credit score was way better than I expected. Also my health is getting better because I’m taking a form of chemo called Cytoxan for my lupus. Hundreds of family and friends and people I didn’t know prayed for me while I was or unconscious from my seizure.
Ok I’m writing this because I am getting slight lightheadedness and headaches again on some days and I’m so worried that it could happen again even though I just got my license back along with my new car. I thought God would protect me. I know He did when I had the accident (fell off he overpass) and I left uninjured. I’m just so scared.  I just need prayers for Him to protect me, and heal me throughout everything. I was in a state of confusion at the time and I really don’t want it to happen again.

I came to engineering because I like doing hands-on stuff, design, and I'm hoping to wiggle into the pharm industry to help with medical tech. But now I'm unsure and I have a few questions:

1. Internships: Most people apply during their junior year, or senior year and then ""turn it into a full-time job"", so to speak, but I'd like to start early. If I don't meet the requirements but feel like I can still be suited, should I still try? For example, XYZ requires a different engineering major, but I have some soft skills and a solid GPA. And if I don't get in, what are some good next steps?

2. Jobs: The first job is always the most difficult to land, is what I heard, and often it will take 6 months to a year with over 100 apps to land a job. I've accepted that will be the case for many majors, not just chemE. In addition, gotta be willing to move around.
I hear that a large part of chemE is focused on oil/gas, and yet I hear that as you learn more skills and branch out, there's plenty of room for chemE's to apply to pharm, food, clean energy, R&amp;D... so if I'm not interested in the former option, am I still good to go? Specifically, I'm majoring in biochemical engineering (it's kind of categorized as a part of chemE at my school) and planning to specialize in something during master's, which leads me to ask...

3. Master's degree: I'm planning on a master's and would like to know what fellow redditors experiences were like and what opportunities there were to specialize in a more specific topic of interest. And if for whatever reason I have another early-life crisis, can I study a different engineering master's?

I've got a 3.8 GPA overall at the Rutgers honors college, am going to be an active member of Engineers without Borders and perhaps one more extracurricular, am learning Java, Matlab, and later C++, and have done a job as a tech instructor for a summer camp. It's not a lot so far, but hopefully I'm on the right track.

TLDR: Just switched to chemE and worried about future job prospects, as well as applying to internships and what course of action to take for a master's degree. I've got a good GPA, learning some coding languages, branching out in extracurriculars, and have a tech-related part time job before."

Thanks for reading, the post is kinda super long and dense so I put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

First of all, my dad had some childhood friends and we're close to all the families even though we all live in different places. Except for one family. They actually moved to our town about 9 or 10 years ago. There's an older sister and a younger sister and they've basically been family since they've moved here. I'm pretty sure I used to torture them by being annoying, pranking them or some other stupid shit. I guess that I still kinda do but they do it back now. As of right now, I (21M) am pretty sure I'm in love with the little sister (19F) but they're basically my sisters. I was even the ""brother"" at the older sister's wedding a few months ago because the brides brother has some duties to do at an Indian wedding. Then during the summer, the little sister (I'm gonna refer to her as ""T"" for the rest of the story) is home from college for the summer and I went to an internship in Louisiana. I finish my internship early and she's home with nothing to do. 

I come back with like a month left and she's got no friends back home because she didnt love her hs friends so she didnt stay connected and goes to college a few hours away and I just finished my junior year so all my friends are interning at other places and/or are busy so we hang out a lot. We go to the movies a ton because my parents had Moviepasses so we got free movies. She told me she smoked so I would literally want to pick up so I can hang out with her and smoke. I got her to play DnD with some of my family friends and she agreed to play almost instantly but didn't do much during the short session. We went minigolfing with my best friends family, and mine (minus my brother). For my parent's anniversary, I decided to cook dinner for my parents invite all our close family friends over and I knew I couldn't do it alone so called on her and it was just us in the house and we spent the entire evening cooking, listening to music (which we have vastly different tastes btw), watching TV and I thought it was really fun. T doesn't drink often but she was staying at our place while her parents were Chicago, so we got day drunk and just watched TV.  I didn't realize I liked her yet so I was just having fun hanging out. No matter what we did, I was always having a great time. But when I realized that I liked her(it was after I came back to college, I explain later on), I thought back to when she took a nap after we got drunk and I found myself doing stuff I never do, like covering her with a blanket, charging her phone so she'd wake up to full battery, put some water by her for when she wakes up. 

Now, as for how I realized I liked her, it was once I went back to college, I started messaging this girl during the summer because I thought she was cute, and we've gone on dates and I've enjoyed myself. She's cute and nice and she's a good person but that feeling of wanting to do it again was just not there. I'm no where near as excited as I was to hang out with T. At first, I thought to myself, yeah because T is so close to me, that's just normal. I was still texting T while I got to college and I realized that whenever I had the opportunity to I would try to text her. Slowly, it dawned on me that I like her and I told myself ""that's just family love, it's fine"" then it just took me over. I think T is pretty weird and I know for a fact that I'm into weird people. Many of my friends at college are complete odd balls. Even on tinder, if I ever see a weird profile, I swipe right immediately because there's a higher chance for me to connect with them. So it clicked in my head, I think I like T. A lot. 

Just the idea of it was super weird for me and sounded odd and I felt kinda guilty for being the one who had to ruin the friendship I have with T because now it might be difficult to hang out with her if I couldn't push these feelings away. I needed some help, so I called three of my best friends and my older bother (like a few days apart each time) and this is the responses they gave me in order of them calling. (btw they all know her. these are like the kids in the families of the people we invited for my parents anniversary)

Guy 1 - You're joking. Dude, You're crazy. You're just drunk (I was pretty drunk when he called me back but I had been sitting on this for 2 weeks) And that I need to just let my emotions stew and find another girl to date. Until this, I didn't tell him about the other girl I was seeing because it's not that serious and he's like dude just think about it and that was it. I started to worry after this, that maybe I was kinda crazy.

Guy 2 - I'm super close with this guy but he hasn't even kissed a girl yet but I had to ask someone I trusted because I felt guilty for feeling like this and he just said that he doesn't know how to respond and that was a huge thing to spring on someone. 

Guy 3 - This guy was the most helpful. He said that my emotions were valid and told me to talk through them. I noticed even more things like whenever we had parties and she was there, I'd hang out with my friends and all and T would probably just be sitting around the parents and playing with my dog or reading and I'd go up to her a lot and try to rope her into what ever we're doing. Whenever she did join, I'd basically just follow after her and make sure she was doing well in whatever (but not without the occasional taunt because I woudn't be like a brother if I didnt) . We talked about a few more things but I said some of them and it would be overkill at this point. Finally, I stated to feel like my feelings are legit and now I really want to do something about it. 

Side note - (While she was staying over, she told me that when she turns 21, she'll probably just marry whoever her parents pick out for her [arranged marriages are not that uncommon] because she's not a US citizen and she'll just live her life, hope the dude is gay so she can do whatever she wants. At the time we laughed about it, but now that I realized these feelings, I want to act on them or I'll die inside thinking she's with someone who can't appreciate her for who she is)

My Brother - Now when I told my brother, he started telling me about all the biggest problems we could face. Which is the reason I needed advice, but I'll list them out for you. Now here are the biggest problems with this. Our parents are basically family, T's parents come over literally all the time, our parents trust each other with super sensitive information. If we ever have something we need at home and we're not there, we message T's parents and they go into our house and get it for us. So if I ask her out, it has to be for the long run or it'll be so awkward. But I genuinely think of her as one of my best friends now because when I need, I can always rely on her and I don't want to ask her out and ruin this friendship if she just sees me as a brother or a friend. But I countered with the fact, what if she could fall in love with me but has brushed that aside by considering me like a brother. (I genuinely think that we are like April Ludgate and Andy Dwyer from Parks and Rec and that if she considered it, it would work out). My brother also said that I can't just spring this onto her, which I understand, and that I need to get her to realize herself. He told me that I need to woo her. Do things that make her think wow, he's a great guy or he's so fun but I don't know what to do - my brother suggested inviting her to my college and partying but she's not a party kinda person. Lastly, he told me that there's a small chance of our parents being against it, which I had not considered before because literally all the parents in our family friends group love me, but that I should be prepared for that but I feel like that chance in minimal and even if it does happen, I'm all in. 

So basically, I want to do three things. I want to (1) woo her so that she realizes I'm a potential candidate, (2) figure out if she thinks that it would work out, and (3) ask her out, but I am 100% sure that I am not going to do step 3 until after her sisters marriage ceremony in India which is in like 4 months. 

TL;DR - My dad's childhoods friends family has a daughter (19F) and she's been like family and I know I'm (21M) in love with her but she's already super close to me in a different way and I don't want to ruin that. I need to her to realize and consider that I'm a possible option and then I need to ask her out. But how?

Edits - just added a few words here and there, and fixed some grammatical errors."

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while, and it's been of tremendous help to me reading the discussions about the world you all share. The wiki is bookmarked, and I have a checklist pieced together from the enormous amount of advice I've run into on this sub (and other sources from books and the web).

That said, I can't help but feel incredibly anxious. Over the spring and summer, I failed to secure an internship which matched my studies/passion (not specifically technical writing). I'm reaching out to those who are within technical writing (or similar) field to help guide me as I move toward graduation.

Below I've organized my qualifications, experience, and goals. If anyone can comment on anything whatsoever, or even give general advice, I would be incredibly grateful.

***
**Location**

Chicago, IL


**University Experience**


Major: English (Professional Writing Concentration)

Minor: Computer Science

3.6 Overall GPA

**Internship/Work Experience**

Grant &amp; Development Writer at a non-profit

Worked in a law office dealing with subpeona documents

Worked as a tour guide  (this helped me develop speaking skills)

**Noteworthy Skills**

*Programming Experience*

1 course with HTML, 3 courses with C &amp; C++, Unix experience (hobby and sysadmin course)

*Other Computer/Technical Experience*

Microsoft Excel, Word, and Powerpoint (GSuite versions as well), Adobe Photoshop (hobby photographer), Illustrator, and DreamWeaver

**Passion**

I enjoy technology and love explaining it. I know technical writing is not a job all about writing, but the precision involved with thoughtful communication fascinates me. Whenever I'm reading, watching, or listening something I can't help but fixate on the way the content is presented to me. After taking a technical writing course, I found that I felt satisfied making documentation and reports.

**Goals**

My first goal is to strengthen my portfolio. So far I have some sample guides to existing programs, and a hardware reference guide (a very simple one of a raspberry pi). I aim to create documentation for linux programs in the upcoming months. 

My LinkedIn is also weak, and I want to feel confident about my online presence and resume come winter. 

I also want to develop more software skills (MS Visio, Confluence, and Madcap Flare).

STC is also very useful, and I aim to take advantage of my membership.

If you've read my attempt at organizing my anxiety, thank you. Again, thank you to the many posters that keep this subreddit filled with content for prospectives like myself. There are many purple links I constantly return to.

I'm actually going to start today with the Senate.
 
Here we have 4 seats up for grabs. This prediction I am not so sure about, but the intern pushing all the buttons is sure that this is correct, so here we go.
 
1.       Labour
 
2.       Showstealer
 
 
3.       UDP
 
4.       Liberal
 
I don’t know how reliable it is, but it is what it is.
 
Now, onto the House of Representitives. We're going to go seat by seat, and there are plenty of shocks to be had so this will be exciting.
 
First up, Sydney - Sydney has BloodyChrome from the UDP, BHjr from the Greens, and the independent Showstealer. Unfortunately for Showstealer, many of his voters are a part of the UDP so I feel he won't get the support he would hope for. I see this being a UDP victory.
 
Up next, Whitlam - Whitlam looks to be the major battle ground of the Nation. Its Labour leader Youmaton vs CA leader tbyrn21. I think it is going to be a massive fight and I think whoever loses will have a hard time recovering in the future. Still, I'm here to make a call. Its going to be tight, but I think tbyrn21 has enough there to get over the line, Which will really hurt labour. It was hard to predict, but I have to make 1 bold call.
 
Seat 3, Lyne - This one has Winston_Wilheminus from the Conservatives, unorthodoxambassador from the CA, and ChairmanMeeseeks from Labour. This has got Labour victory written all over it.
 
Greenway - This is our first traditional Labour vs Liberal fight of the election. Good news for Ash here, I see him easily disposing of zhukov here, but, spoiler warning for later, its the only seat I see the Libs taking.
 
Bradfield - Hoogstra for Labour. Thats it. Moving on.
 
Lingiari - This has adamtad from the UDP, and AnswerMeNow from the Greens. This one will be close. I won't definitively call this, but I think the UDP have a bigger shot here. But, its close.
 
Denison - Here we see imnofox from Labour take on Dyljam of the UDP. The computer says UDP
 
Canberra - The nation’s capital will see Stalinomics from the CA take on Wasow200 from Labour. Labour simply don't have enough to take the seat which parliament sits in.
 
Kingston - Here we see AussieConservative from the Conservatives, lieselta from Labour and DirtySaiyan from the UDP. There are too many unknowns here to make a proper call. Labour maybe?
 
Pearce - Reagan0 from Conservatives, Perakai from Reason, bsharri from Labour. I think bsharri will have to wait another term for his dream of returning to parliament, Perakai should easily win here.
 
Melbourne - KingEthan from Reason, JellyCow99 from Labour. A relative newcomer in JellyCow should get schooled on the art of picking seats which you have a chance of winning when Ethan wipes the floor with them on Saturday
 
Chisholm - Nothedarkweb from Reason takes on Drunk_King_Robert from Labour. This is a throw your cards in the air and see where they land kind of situation. Mine said Reason, so thats our 'call'.
 
Gorton - Another Lib/Lab fight here, with Supernatural01 and WillShakespeare99 the combatants. Labour will be pleased to have WillShakespeare in parliament this term.
 
Batman - notkhrushevsghost from Reason will take on phyllicanderer from the Greens in the battle of the hardest names to pronounce, and nkg should win this one.
 
Brisbane - Another Labour vs Liberal fight sees former justice Dicky_knee take on pm_me_sprinkles. sprinkles and Labour seems to be ahead here, but its another maybe maybe not scenario.
 
Wright - This seat sees the CA represented by sillicon_based_life, taking on Labour's favourite Bin Cat lurker. Labour win.
 
Fairfax - This seat sees stranger195 from Reason, n4ziporridge from the Libs, and lilacalic from Labour. The final seat should go to Reason
 
So if we look at my certain calls, we get a parliament looking a lot like this
 
Labour 4, Reason 4, CA 2, UDP 2, Liberals 1, Uncertain 5
 
As you can see, there is a distinct lack of the Liberals, but theres also Uncertain seats which you lot don't want. If you force me to call every seat, parliament looks like this
 
Labour 7, Reason 4, UDP 3, CA 2, Liberals 1
 
So Labour will gain one seat, but fall short of the majority. Labour will have a big bloc, but no leader to lead them, whilst the Centre and the Right is a bit of a shambles. For reference, all my calls sortof exclude the sim voters, and assume 100% turnout, which we all know won't occur.
 
Thank you all for tuning into our prediction special, the prediction most accurate* in the nation

9fg7zp,15,2018-09-13,How much am I worth to my firm? Help wanted,hammyish,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/9fg7zp/how_much_am_i_worth_to_my_firm_help_wanted/,"Hi All,

I did an 8 week Summer Internship at a telecommunications firm in the City. I was hired as a business analyst but my role was basically coding throughout the internship. This was basically me having a brief and then running my own autonomous project. The work was mainly around SQL and BI tools but I surpassed expectations throughout my time there, the main input I made was reducing their reporting process time from 1-2 days down to a matter of 15 minutes. I was paid a low intern rate of £15k pa for this work.

I am now back at university doing a masters but I have received an offer to do some work for the firm on a consultancy basis 3-4 times a month, which would be good to keep gaining experience and some money.

They are yet to offer me a day rate but they have asked how much I am expecting, obviously, I don't want to miss-price myself. I clearly don't want a day-rate based off my old salary as I thought it was very low considering how much work I did. A colleague at the firm said accept no less than £300pd and my stepfather who does contract work in the City said that this is a good starting figure.

Any of you lot do day-rate work think this is a good ball-park figure? Cheers!"
9fgcrr,729,2018-09-13,"I've got friends, buddy...",Qiewy,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/9fgcrr/ive_got_friends_buddy/,"So been a moderate lurker on this sub, primarily for feel-good vibes but I read this story that resonated with an experience of mine, thus my hearty contribution. (Names have been changed and this is a looooong one, but really worth it. Bear with me aite.)

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years back I was on my local buy/sell app (henceforth named EbayButSmaller) looking for a new phone. Came across a few good deals, but none worth mentioning. Then, I saw this seller advertising the phone model I wanted, who was willing to do a trade-in for any older model and at a price range I could afford. Bingo, I (foolishly) thought.

I contacted the seller and arranged a meetup. (Due to the shady reputation of sellers on EbayButSmaller, meetups are 100% recommended) I make contact with this skinny-looking teen, Brad. He takes a look at my phone, charger, all the usual checks. Once done he passes me this box sealed with scotch tape. I don't sense anything amiss at this point (my mistake) and trust this guy. After all, nothing can go wrong at a meetup right?

At this point of time two strange goons turn up and hang around nearby. I don't really notice them but they do set off slight alarms in my head, due to the fact that they were fucking staring in my direction constantly. I jokingly asked Brad, 'these your goons?' and Brad just shrugs and gives a nervous laughter. By this point I should have sensed something was wrong but I'm an idiot. after I make the remainder of the payment ($200 of my dollars) Brad says a hurried goodbye and scurries off with Goons One and Two. What the fuck! I open the box of my supposedly new phone to find out its a reconditioned fake set. By this time Brad and his goons have left and are supposedly nowhere to be seen. By this point I'm seething with hellfire, and by the grace of the gods I spot the three of them hurriedly getting into a taxi a few metres away from our meeting spot. (Idiots do as idiots please I guess) Unluckily for them, I rode my motorbike over, and within five minutes, I had committed to memory the taxi's plates and was following behind them. Waited for them to stop, got out and confronted the three stooges.

**Me**: Hey assholes, how about returning my phone and money and we walk away like nothing happened?

**Brad**: Wha-how did you find us? (he's scared shitless at this point; really is a skinny dude, and I'm packing 176 pounds of muscle and military training.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now Goons One and Two try and square up to me for their poor friend Brad. Unfortunately, they're just as small as he is and not exactly trained to take down a dude twice their size. I calmly repeat my request, only to be met by false bravado and a whole lotta cuss words. By now a considerable crowd has gathered around us. I spot what I think to be my phone box in a white plastic bag that Goon Two is holding, and promptly pluck it out of his hands. Goon One tries one more time to rush me, but reconsiders once I start to move towards him. Word of advice: bikers use their helmets as a weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

I give them all the one finger salute, and ride off. But the story doesn't end here, no. Upon checking the contents of the box I realised I only managed to retrieve my phone charger (bummer). Brad must have the rest of my valuables on his person. No matter. I count my losses and move on. Now here is where the story gets interesting and a bit sleuth-y. I have a friend we shall call Z. Z actually was working as an intern at EbayButSmaller, and when I texted him about the incident immediately after, told me to meet him at the nearest police station. Once there, we actually sat down with the coppers and trawled through Facebook until we found all **three** of the crooks. Seriously, all I needed was to provide Z with a username and he did the rest. We got full names, addresses, even the schools they went to. So we gave everything to the police, not expecting anything to come out of the investigation.

Well we were wrong. A day after I got a call from one of the investigating officers, telling me that based on the information we supplied, managed to track down and arrest all but **one** of the three idiots. (Goon One got the tip off and managed to get away, but got caught on drug charges later. Another story.) He then passes me back my old phone but told me any cash would have to be collected after investigations concluded.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I thought it was good enough for me, 200 bucks wasn't exactly my life's savings so I was more than willing to write it off. Que two days later, and Brad actually texts me begging me to drop the case against him. I told him I would consider it if he wired me my money back.

Once I'm sure the 200 is safely back in my account, I texted him the following, ""Shouldn't trust everybody you meet online, buddy."" and block him.

Last I heard he's in reformative training with his two best buddies.

TLDR: guy tried to scam me out of my phone and two hundred quid, got him and his buddies in prison with some good ol' detective work and help from a friend.

9fkh9t,18,2018-09-13,I've overcome three big social anxieties this week,CastielGalafran,CongratsLikeImFive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/9fkh9t/ive_overcome_three_big_social_anxieties_this_week/,"I've been in a bad depression for the last month. I think it was triggered by starting up my master's program, the reality of having moved back in with my parents, and hormones. When I get in a depressive state, my social anxieties flares up bad. This manifested in three big ways, but this week I've taken huge steps to overcome them.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I was convinced no one in my graduate program would like me. Going to class every day made my heart race and I would often get in my car at the end of the day almost in tears. I just couldn't get those nagging thoughts that I don't belong and everyone is judging me out of my head. But there's this one girl, R, who is a 2L student (we're in the law program). She and I have the exact same fashion sense. We live in a super casual, shorts and t-shirt state, but we dress like we're in New York. At the beginning of the semester I complimented her on her clothes a lot and she did the same for me. I always was too afraid to talk to her though because I thought she was way smarter and better than me. But in this last week I worked up the courage to ask her to study with me. Turns out she's also really shy. We study all day together now, and we've helped each other a lot already. She has really good study habits and is helping keep me on track with not procrastinating in studying for our midterms. I'm a lot braver about asking questions in class and putting myself out there, so I've been asking the questions she is afraid to ask. She's really good at gauging the skill level of the rest of the class and setting study goals. I'm good at picking out specific skills for us to improve on to avoid getting overwhelmed with anxiety. 

2. I've been convinced no one would want to hire me and that asking about internships would just be a waste of time. I talked to my boyfriend about a lot of my fears this weekend, including this, and he gave me some good pep talks. So on Monday I emailed a patent attorney who was a guest speaker in one of my classes. I asked him about internships at his firm and advice on looking for work in that field. I don't know if he'll get back to me, if I wasted my time, or if I annoyed him, but at least I did it. I used to be really good at making contacts. It's how I got so many internships as an undergrad, but my confidence got badly shaken in the last couple years after life took a shit turn. Taking that step Monday was big for me. Even if nothing comes from it I did something I was scared of, proved that nothing bad would happen, and now I can do it some more.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I train in a martial art called Muay Thai. I've been doing it just shy of a year. These last couple months there's been this old man who watches me when I'm working with my trainer. He gives me tips and tells my trainer I'm really good. I have a lot of fear of men, particularly older men, because older men have done a lot of really bad things to me growing up. I was a target for predatory old men, and I have a strong suspicion of them now. So during practice I was scared of interacting with this guy and just tried to be polite but distant. Yesterday he spent a long time working with my trainer to help me improve my uppercuts. His advice was really great, and when he walked away I finally asked my trainer who he is. My trainer was really surprised I didn't know. It turns out, this old man has been a professional boxing coach for upwards of 60 years and has trained multiple heavyweight champions. He thinks I'm cool so he helps me whenever he's at the gym. I finally realized this guy is a pro and is just sincerely trying to help me. So after my post-training weight lifting last night, I worked up the courage to talk to him. I thanked him for all his advice, and then listened to him as he told me a lot of stories of his younger days as a fighter/coach. We had a really good conversation, and even though I was still a little nervous I'm really glad I got to know him. It's hard for me to let my guard down around older men, but I hope this guy knows I really appreciate his help. I know I'm not that great, there are a lot of men at the gym who are much better fighters than me, and I'm usually the only woman besides the gym owner. He could be helping the really good guys but instead he spends a good amount of time helping me, and that's really cool.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I made a lot of progress this week. Things have been emotionally rough for me for a bit, but I feel like I'm breaking out of that funk and I hope I can keep making progress."

*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa (but you can choose a different name, if you prefer). I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "

(10+ ideas inside),mjd931,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9fmimt/25_m4f_office_sex_10_ideas_inside/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see


- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.


THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

* **Submitting before January is considered submitting early.** There is a small advantage in submitting early but it is not overwhelming. Applying early does not mean you will hear early and this is not a reflection of your strength of application. 

* **Interviews begin in October.** They interview a subset of applicants (15 minutes, online). Being interviewed does not mean you're admitted but it's a step in the right direction. 

* **""Whole person"" approach is emphasized.** Every application is reviewed without any definitive score cut off.

* **Tests:** They'll look at all of your scores (last 5 years) but they care most about your highest score. This includes GRE and LSAT. It is not uncommon at all to see multiple test scores and it is not a negative at all. They will look at your highest score as the most important, but they do take all scores into context as well. 

* **Undergrad GPA:** They do look specifically at undergrad GPA more closely, even if you have graduate degrees. They will also look at your transcript and look at your grades and courses throughout the years. 

* **Resume:** Resume, not CV is requested. They recommend a clean, easy to read format. There is no preference for one page or two page, but it's better for them if it is easier and quick to read. Quantifiable information is helpful (number of clients, budget numbers, etc.) Want to learn accomplishments at your different roles, not just job requirements. Do not assume they know all the industry jargon. They will be read on a computer (useful for formatting). They ""actively prefer work experience."" No preference but it does depend on how much work experience/activities you have. 

* **Personal statement:** Two pages, double spaced, 11-pt font or larger. Use this to pull together your application. Definitely get a couple other people to read it over for you before submission and see if they get the same take home message that you intended. Sometimes people talk about their prior jobs and why this makes them want to go to law school but there truly is no specific topic. Do not need a ""Why X"" segment.

* **LOR:** Strongly recommend an academic LOR. Two are required, the third is really there if you need it but is not required. Two is usually sufficient. 

* **Video interview::** Last year, they interviewed around 1200 applicants. Interview is not an automatic admission, it is just a step in the right direction. They will ask a lot of questions about your application, your interest in law school, and will allow some questions at the end. Very brief!

* **Optional statement:** Diversity is not defined for you. People will write about their background (race, ethnicity, first generation, international, STEM major, etc.) You can use it if it is there but you do not have to use it. There is no advantage either way. 

* **Optional addendum:** Again, totally optional. Leave of absence, semester with personal difficulties, sick during LSAT, resume gap, etc. Usually 1-2 sentences is sufficient. Don't give a lengthy statement for something that be explained in a couple of sentences.

* **Inside the ""Black Box""** All files are read and considered from beginning to end. Application is open until Feb 1 but they continue making decisions past that date (they try to get all decisions by April 1) so do not be concerned if you haven't heard by a specific date. 

* **How have past applicants stood out to you?** It's really helpful to see an applicant who has put a lot of thought into their application and where going to law school makes sense for them. One example was a person who worked in education for several years who was interested in education policy and they weave this all together throughout their application. An application that has taken a lot of time and effort and shows cohesion is the best. Should understand why they want to go to law school and why it makes sense. They also make the most of all of the pieces of their application: they have an easy to read resume with a lot of information, a deeply informative personal statement, etc. 

* **What kind of applicant does the admissions committee see as a good ""fit"" for HLS?** The most recent class was ~560 students so there are a lot of different people who do a lot of different things. People come from tons of different backgrounds and lots of different academic backgrounds. In general, they do have folks with strong academic backgrounds. Looking for respectful, engaged students. 

* **Very strongly value work experience.** Graduate school studies actually count, as do internships and service work programs like TFA. Summer internships during undergrad do not count.

I feel like I have no time to look for internships or lab opportunities. I’m starting to hate every time I see people enjoying themselves while I’m here suffering.

I’ve also met this girl(23) who I’ve been talking to for a bit. She just got out a three year relationship with a trust fund baby. She talks about him a lot. She wants to know where I stand but I couldn’t even explain to her how I felt about her (Its the first time anyone has really asked me that). I really like her but, with where I am right now I know I can’t support her the way her ex could. It’s to the point were I’m pushing her away (not answering her text, bailing on dates)

My family (Nigerian heritage) keep pushing me into jobs that will take years of education to complete(lawyer, doctor,etc.). They offer me a safety net but, I don’t want to burden them and I can’t remember many moments I have.  I’m also afraid to tell them I don’t want to become a doctor anymore from the fear that’ll disgrace them and myself.

I’m stuck in LIMBO. Do I stop pursuing my biochem bachelors (I feel like there are not many jobs without experience or without going into post-grad) and go for a bachelors in nursing(which would take around two to three years) or should I just push through and attempt to go to med school? Do I continue to talk to this girl? Do I tell my family in the hope that they accept this?

I recently started working in my new job, in Graphic design in a small Marketing company that revolves around creating marketing strategies, developing websites, social media maintenance and other stuff like that. 
I started as an Intern 6 months later, they liked me and well enough they asked me to work on the team. Now, don't get me wrong, I get along really well with everyone at the company, super nice, positive, and I have a lot of respect for every one of them. But the problem begins right as I started working with them. We have a meeting, all of us, as we usually do every Monday morning, and our boss tells us we are in a financial crisis and because of some in work problems that have been amounting through time, from not responding to client email, to having bad work ethics and all those sorts of things, and have had a similar crisis before, and the way he dealt with it was pulling money from his own account and trying to wait it out. But this time was different, he had no backup money and unfortunately, the salary would have to be delayed, he was very honest with his approach. I was paid the first working month, but the second one was when the problem hit the team, I'm finishing the second week with no payment, and it's been super rough, not just because of the pressure we are putting up, but because I feel frustrated that I'm overworking over something I did not cause, at all, and I'm not even being paid! 
Now of course I understand it's not because he doesn't care or anything, It's not that type of situation, but I can't help but feel frustrated having to keep this up with this, the team is very determined to resolve this situation, and that's really the only part that gets me going. But I'm starting to feel really tired all the time, getting really fed up with everything, beginning to feel overwhelmed and I'm starting to feel impatient all the time, due to the lack of rest. 

My thing is, I respect them a lot and I know it's not something that anyone proud of and everyone is trying their best, but I'm going through a lot and I don't know when too much is too much. How normal it is to work without getting paid in this situation, or if I should quit and save myself the for getting overworked soo soon, wasting away my week for something I did not cause."
9fn445,1,2018-09-13,What's the point...,quietstorm04,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9fn445/whats_the_point/,"It's gotten to the point to where I started keeping a journal again because I finally realized that my ""friends"" aren't available whenever I need someone to talk to. I no longer trust them. Why keep telling me that ""I'm here for you"" but if I do speak about my issues I receive nothing but silence. I know that people have lives. I have a life to. As a matter of fact I went back to school to complete my bachelor's degree in digital media and I actually scored an internship, yay me! And the best part is that I'm able to work from home since it's just doing social media marketing. However, there are still days when I struggle to even get out of bed in the mornings. And don't even get me started on nights. Last night was the worse because my thoughts were really scaring me. I've been battling depression since I was in high school and wasn't really that open about it, all thanks to the stigma. And the worse feeling in the world is no one taking you seriously when you're going through an episode. Because I'm a minority, no one takes my depression seriously. I'm supposed to just hand everything over to God. If I'm having a good day, that's when my friends would want to have a conversation with me. But once I talk about my depression, which isn't all the time by the way, I don't hear from anyone. And most times months would pass before I finally hear anything. But people know how to call me whenever they're having issues and I drop everything to listen to them. It really hurts and I actually went through my phone and started deleting numbers and blocking them. I just feel like if they can't handle me on my bad days then they don't deserve to celebrate with me on my good days. I know that not all people are equipped to handle people with mental illness and no one is obligated to always be there but if you promised to be there for me and I call and get nothing then what else am I supposed to think? That's why I've turned to writing because at least I know that the paper won't judge me. The other day I was telling a friend how upset I was that this guy that tried to ask me was basically playing me because I later found out (thanks to my parents lol!) that he was already seeing someone. Mind you, he lives on our floor at our apartment complex. My mom said she saw him all over some woman outside by his car a few nights while I was away on a holiday. So of course while I was talking to my friend I had to vent and they basically blamed me for even entertaining him. I'm thinking to myself, um...how was I supposed to know he was already seeing someone. And it's not my fault that I attracted an asshole. Unfortunately we got into a confrontation and haven't spoke to them since. Unfortunately this very same friend would be the one to tell me to just snap out of it whenever I was going through an episode. If I didn't have my family I wouldn't have anyone because as of right now, I don't really have any friends. The worse thing I did was revealing my depression because either people started disrespecting me or just flat out stopped talking to me. Just because I deal with a mental illness doesn't mean that I deserve to be treated less than a human being. It's not like I'm not trying to get better. And unfortunately it runs in the family because my mom has PTSD and bipolar disorder. Most of my relatives are bipolar because it's genetic. What's crazy is that my mom has faced the same backlash from our family. Even though she lived with her mental illness she was still able to accomplish her goals and enjoy her retirement. As a matter of fact my parents are in the process of building their retirement home in the country. Anyone who gets off on treating people with mental illness like shit can really screw themselves.

I'm sorry for the rant but I'm just angry, hurt, pissed, furious...well, you get the idea LOL!! As you can see I have a good sense of humor. It's my way of coping. Actually another thing I do to deal with my episodes is watching my favorite movie, tv show and cartoons!"
9fof07,1,2018-09-13,Spending 96 days in France but had to cancel visa request. Do I need to change return flight before I fly or can I wait and decide what to do once in France?,Saint_Flex,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9fof07/spending_96_days_in_france_but_had_to_cancel_visa/,"I’m an American and I’m going to be interning in France for 12 weeks but I wanted to be able to travel on my own for a week before and after the internship. This would mean I’m in France/Schengen zone for 96 days and any stay longer than 90 days in the Schengen zone requires a long-stay visa. So I booked a round trip flight and applied for a French visa.

Long story short, there was some confusion between the French Consulate in DC and VFS Global, the third party company that now handles French visa requests. As a result, I was told I wouldn’t receive my visa in time in order to get my passport back and fly to France. I canceled the request and got my passport back but now I need to decide whether or not to change my return flight before I fly to France this weekend. 

I’ve considered making plans once I’m in France to travel on a trip or two to the UK so that I can circumvent the 90-day limit for the Schengen Zone. I’ve heard that any time spent outside the Schengen zone does not count towards the 90 day limit. So theoretically I could spend 7 days in the UK and keep the same return flight from France, (7 days in UK and 89 in France), but I haven’t had any confirmation that this would work or even be necessary.

Do I need to change my return flight immediately? Or could I decide once in France? I don’t want to be stopped at the border upon entering France and asked why I don’t have a visa.

Any advice or related experiences would be much appreciated!"

**That’s the message he sent this morning, when he [denied that 3,000 Americans died](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1040217897703026689) in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria last year,** and [falsely asserted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1040220855400386560) that the official death toll “was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible.”       
               
**Republican elected officials either ignored Trump’s attempt to blot out the memory of the dead,** or claimed to disagree with Trump, without condemning him:

And that’s really no one’s fault. It’s just what happened.”        
               
- [Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1040256236204253184) took the slightly different tack of spreading blame widely to absolve Trump for as much of it as possible. “Both Fed &amp; local gov made mistakes. We all need to stop the blame game.”       
               
- [Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA)](https://twitter.com/LisaDNews/status/1040273194089897985), who chairs the powerful Judiciary Committee, had the gall to prod Trump to do oversight of himself, and investigate whether there might be something to his awful conspiracy theory.       
               
**From Brian:** To the extent that there’s a “blame game” at all, it is because 3,000 citizens who could have been rescued died, and Republicans in Congress refused to hold a single oversight hearing about it, suggesting they believe a full accounting will reflect poorly on their government. We don’t know how avoidable this horrific death toll was, and unless Democrats win control of at least one chamber of Congress, we never will.       
               
**The Letter of the Law**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The arguments for delaying a vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination—or for rejecting it outright—continue to mount,** but Republicans, and even some Democrats, are doing whatever they can to ignore them.       
               
**[Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-dianne-feinstein.html?h_sid=64c32b8eb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21484&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;smid=tw-nytimes), ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued a statement Thursday** saying she “received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.”       
               
**The referral reportedly concerns a letter that Feinstein received which contains an allegation** that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct with a woman when they were both in high school.       
               
**Separately, on Wednesday night, [Kavanaugh submitted over two hundred pages worth of responses](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17853934/read-brett-kavanaugh-written-answers?h_sid=64c32b8eb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21484&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to questions for the record from senators on the Judiciary Committee.** His answers were in many cases [partial or evasive](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation-written-answers.html?h_sid=64c32b8eb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21484&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). He was unresponsive to inquiries about significant debts he carried on credit cards, which abruptly disappeared before his nomination.

**Kavanaugh’s evasions, and [several other incidents](https://crooked.com/article/brett-kavanaughs-bad-faith/?h_sid=64c32b8eb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21484&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) which suggest Kavanaugh has been systematically misleading the Senate for years,** prompted Sen.

**Perhaps these developments will change minds, but as of yesterday, zero Republicans had come out against Kavanaugh’s confirmation,** and many Democrats remained undecided.

**From Brian:** After holding scores of federal judicial vacancies open for two years and stealing a Supreme Court seat, Republicans have spent the Trump presidency stacking the courts with right-wing judges.

In response to extraordinary abuses of power like these, [Sen.

9fp4c2,3,2018-09-14,Am I crazy? Bankruptcy questions,susieq0245,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9fp4c2/am_i_crazy_bankruptcy_questions/,"Ok, just writing this out as it comes into my head so please excuse the disorganization and the book-worthy length of it. 

Also, just to be clear - I have worked since I was 14. I worked all through college, and have had multiple jobs at a time up until last year. My friends are always telling me I work far too much and that I am too stressed. I am not lazy, I am good at budgeting and making spreadsheets for my finances, and while I do sometimes spend frivolously, I wasn't buying vacations and stupid stuff. This was mostly groceries, gas, utilities, everyday expenses. 

To start, I have a LOT of student loan debt. Like I could have bought a house for the amount of money I spent on my bachelor's degree (over $100,000). Unfortunately, it is split between three different lenders and each is in a different name (mine, my mom's, and my dad's) so consolidation was not really an option for us. What this means is that my student loan payments equal almost half of my after tax income. (Salary job, $46,000 a year, roughly $2,200/month after taxes, healthcare, 401k, etc.)

So - I had a second job bartending, but the bar closed a little over a year ago. I had worked there 4 years and had the perfect schedule and the best shifts; closing bar Friday night and opening Sunday morning for brunch, which got me $1200-$1500 extra a month, without screwing with my full-time job schedule too much. Tried to find another bar to work at, but none would fit into my already full-time job, especially starting at the bottom of the totem pole again, plus be worth the time and loss of sleep. ~1/3 of my total income went poof.

Debt:
I lived off my credit cards after college for a year or two, because I had just moved to a new city (parents moved while I was in college), and I couldn't find a job in my field that didn't require 5+ years of experience and that paid more than $10-12 an hour (I graduated college in 2010), so I was again back to serving and bartending and internships and part time office work. Those barely covered my rent and student loans - everything else went on the cards.

Then I was in a TINY fender bender in 2014 and ended up (barely) rear ending the most nightmare of all nightmare people, the bitch who sues everyone (apparently there are 20+ other suits with her name on them in the surrounding counties). Found out my insurance hadn't renewed automatically the month before, but since there was no damage and I never heard from her about fixing anything, I thought we were good. Went to traffic court for unknowingly driving without insurance, paid the fine, done. Cue to 3 years later (2017, RIGHT before my 2nd job bar closes and three days before the statute of limitations expires on this accident) and I get served with a civil lawsuit for her ""neck injury"" and another 100k of pain and suffering, because apparently her insurance won't pay out. They think she's full of shit, and say she never made a claim when the accident happened, so they are denying her a payout. I get a lawyer, show him my finances, and he is asking me why I haven't thought about bankruptcy before, since I'm clearly drowning in debt. He decides he will not be charging me for his services (I adore him, he was even invited to our wedding!). Obviously I don't have any money to pay this lady; we settle for $1k.

I never thought about bankruptcy because I figured since I got myself into this mess, I've got to work myself out of it. I made stupid errors, like letting a car salesman talk me into a lease I couldn't afford, and taking out a personal loan to cover my credit card expenses at a lower interest rate (good idea) and then still using the credit cards (bad idea).

In any case, finally I got overwhelmed and talked to the bankruptcy attorney that my lawsuit attorney recommended. He was a dream and made me feel so much better about what I saw as a huge failure. We got along because apparently I'm a decent human being, and he charged me half his normal rate for filing. I know there are skeezy lawyers out there, but these two I've dealt with are honest-to-God amazing people. He walked me through the process, we filed in April, and the bankruptcy court official barely looked at my paperwork during my hearing before granting it and wishing me luck in the future. Easiest process I've ever been through. Obviously my student loans didn't go away, but the massive amount of credit card and personal debt I had accrued in large part because of them did.

*I also felt it was unfair to saddle my soon-to-be husband with my debt, so getting this out of the way before we got married seemed like a good idea. A fresh start, as they say. He recently started his own business, paid off all his debt, and now makes a good living. He has earned it, and as much as I know he would help me if I needed it, I would never ask him to take on all that mess. He helps plenty as it is. Plus he still has to deal with me and the student loans!*

Now that the long ass back story is done, here are some stats and my questions:

1. I had NO late payments for probably 2-3 years before the actual date of my bankruptcy filing (April 15th-ish)

2. My credit score was in the 660-690 range before filing

3. I had 2 credit cards with zero balances that made it through the bankruptcy without the accounts being closed, since I didn't owe them any money 

4. My car was just ""repoed"" today, but it was scheduled by me with the lender earlier this week and very cordial - I handed them my keys, my spare keys, etc and had a nice chat with the dispatcher on the phone as well as the repo man when he got there. Apparently they don't get a lot of pleasant interactions, ha!

5. My bankruptcy was discharged officially on August 27th. I got married on September 2nd.

6.  My credit score has not gone down. It dipped a few points a few months ago and then jumped up about 16 points this past week. I keep an eye on it and my accounts via credit karma, and even though the bankruptcy shows up and the accounts included in it are closing, it has not made my score dive.

Why is that? Everything I'm reading says my score will take a nosedive right after filing. That didn't happen, obviously. And now that it's discharged, it hasn't either, it went up! Am I missing something? I need to go get a new car (and by new I mean a used junker or cheap lease I can actually afford!) and I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop on my credit, so I'm scared to go and try to get a car lease! My now husband had near perfect credit, so he can cosign and help me get a better rate, but I still feel like I'm missing something.

I tried to Google my question, but the only thing that will come up is about credit scores going up after the bankruptcy drops off your report. I'm clearly not there yet, so that didn't help. 

Thoughts? Questions? Concerns? Advice? Should I expect a big drop to still happen?? What's the best way to get a new vehicle?

TL;DR - I went through bankruptcy and my already decent credit score went up instead of down. Why? Also how do I go about getting a new vehicle?

My rabbit(7 years) died, my dad moved out of the house, my car broke and a month after I fixed it, the car gets flooded and I lose it. Then my mom keeps yelling at me that I have to get rid of my 8 month old pup. I've had to endure this the whole summer, and I thought that as soon as go back to college things would change, this girl who I have strong feelings about was coming back, and I had hopes  that she reciprocated the feelings I had confessed to her. I was gonna finally share an apartment with my friends, including one of my best friends, and I had a really good chance of getting an internship to a big company. However the first week in, that best friend admits that the girl had told him she had feelings for him during the summer. He said he'd take it slow with her. That really hurt me. I really want the best for the both of them, but why did it have to be my best friend and roommate, someone who I saw everyday. And why did the girl i fall for has to be someone i have to work with every week.  Life keeps kicking me down, I keep pretending that everything is fine, and I just wonder when is it going to stop. I just want to live regular life and focus on this semester, which will be my hardest semester for my major. All I have right now is this puppy that as soon as classes pick up she'll take too much time to keep up with these classes. Idk where to go from here, I need something that gives me hope but everything I thought that was going to give me that is gone. I'm gonna tell her that I'll be distancing away from this her and I can hopefully find myself, and find another path, on be with less suffering. But right now I really just wanna end my life. I feel empty."

This coming spring is my final semester of college and I need a mandatory internship in applicable job role as a requirement for my graduation. Through a previous internship I have been in contact with a local but pretty large marketing company.

My contact in this company is an account manager, she does not deal with any design or development at all. This company obviously is very big in digital advertisement, but they have a whole division I would like to find myself in which revolves around SEO and micro-sites. 

Now to my question. Although I have a previous relation with this company, I need to apply for the internship position. I have no pieces demonstrating anything along the lines of SEO and by god I have never even thought about creating a micro-site, but I have the knowledge to create one. Would it be a bad move to create a *concept* micro-site to include in my portfolio? I want to include one more Web Design piece but I have to present my portfolio as a print (for some ridiculous reason) and am looking for one more solid piece. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I have the whole weekend to finish up my portfolio.

9fr8eo,1,2018-09-14,Should I Pursue Civil Engineering Further?,JustFishHunter,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/9fr8eo/should_i_pursue_civil_engineering_further/,"Hello, first post as a long-time lurker. Some background: I’ll be a 3rd year civil engineering student likely with a structural emphasis. I grew up in Silicon Valley where tech is incredibly influential and nearly all my friends/acquaintances with any good financial sense is doing computer science. Even though I believe I’m capable of doing CS (exceled in AP CS class), I chose civil engineering because dang it, megastructures like bridges, skyscrapers, and canals are super impressive, and I want to make a significant impact on the world and go against the herd.

Here, I’ll try to be frank and please bear with me for my lack of experience. 

The engineering classes and especially the last two internships (city/transportation and construction) I’ve had felt easy. I’m envious of the harder workloads of my CS/ME/EE peers (weird, I know). CS-related fields feel much more intellectually-demanding, evident by the continual knowledge/skill learning required. Furthermore, a civil engineering career doesn’t seem to work out financially in the Bay Area in the long term. 

Alright, I have questions:

1.	Is civil engineering an intellectually-demanding and high “learning ceiling” field? 

2.	Can a civil engineer live comfortably (with a house eventually) in the Bay Area? (Excuse my privilege, but I’m not thinking about moving to somewhere cheaper)

3.	Are most careers (including CS-related) kind of mundane and many people just deal with it for the paycheck?

4.	Do I need to taste more of the civil engineering field and straight up adopt a humbler attitude towards it?

I respect the civil engineering profession for its contributions to society, but I’m honestly lost or insecure and perhaps need assurance from others about my current path. If civil engineering ultimately doesn’t suit me, I’m thinking about switching to software thru bootcamp/self-learning or even pursuing an economics PhD. If It does suit me, I’ll simply strive to become the best civil engineer I can be. Thank you for reading and contributing to this post."

I can't decide between doing a general comp sci or a specialisation. 

All of these decisions are so confusing! Can any adult help me? I have to go to another country, when I can't decide what I want to do? How am I supposed to manage? 

Whatever was needed to pursue masters, I have done it in the last 3 years, research, internship, grades, the whole thing. Thing is, preparing myself for masters has been my aim, and now that it's accomplished, I don't know what my purpose is.

What is life? How is it like to live alone? What if I chose wrong? These questions hound me every single night. There's no one around who understands me. 

What am I supposed to do? I want to become a professor, and here I'm where I don't know about myself, let alone teach others, inspire others. 

What do I do? How do I decide? I want to talk so that I can get some clear space. "

9fspaw,1,2018-09-14,Automated Sequences on Linkedin,britneycar,u_britneycar,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_britneycar/comments/9fspaw/automated_sequences_on_linkedin/,"By now, most of us sales guys, marketers, growth hackers, whatever you want to call yourself, have come to terms with the fact that cold emails just aren’t as effective as they used to be 2–3 years ago.

It’s the truth. Open rates and replies are dropping. Sure, you can tighten up your subject line or improve the copy, but it’s still not enough.

The cat is out of the bag. I repeat. Everyone knows about email automation and everyone (and their mothers) is out cold emailing everyone.

That leaves you unnoticed by potential customers who are immune to your email sorcery.

But what if…
What if email isn’t the only way to reach potential customers and get your foot in the door?

Most of you are already using platforms like Linkedin to find leads.

Some of you even know about the “look back” and are actively engaging leads with soft social touches, namely profile visits and invites.

Many of you are doing this manually yourself or hiring interns, possibly even sales development reps, to run these engagements.

A few of you are ahead of the curve using basic tools like Dux-soup to automate some of these soft engagements.

Why it works
The concept of inbound marketing is predicated on others seeking you out. When other professionals look at your profile, it’s an invitation for you to check them out.

The trick is to get the right people to look at your profile so you can take it from there.

When you get a notification that someone looked at your Linkedin profile, you will almost always look back to see who they are. Potential customer? Investor? Competitor?

What do you think happens when you look at profiles of potential customers?

Chances are, they will look back and checkout your profile.

The more profiles you visit, the more people will look back. The more people who look back at your profile, the more likely you’ll get connected. And the more connections you make, the larger your network and opportunities to do business.

How many of you out there are sequencing soft social touches as you would with emails?
I’m willing to bet that number is very small in comparison. Meaning, now is the perfect time to start orchestrating these types of social touches on Linkedin before the word gets out and the tactic is adopted by the rest of the market.

You know what they say, “Early bird catches the worm.”

Imagine creating a sequence like this:


That’s already pretty cool in and of itself… but that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Here are a few future Linkedin hacks we plan on building:
Auto-skill endorsement
Auto-request recommendation
Auto-withdraw connect requests
Post like and commenting
Direct message sequences
There’s a few more hacks we’re keeping under wraps. Stay tuned.

So here’s the thing. Orca is a team of techies and growth specialists who believe in leveraging technology to help companies scale faster by automating the small, but monotonous and repetitive tasks that we think robots can handle just as well, if not better than humans.

We’re doing this, even if it means breaking the rules, because we know running a business is a ton of work and there’s definitely way more important things you’d rather focus your attention on.

There’s still a bunch of features we need to build to make Orca more powerful, but we’re pretty pumped with what we’ve built so far.

My experience: I attended the engineering career fair today and had a blast talking with different companies. I learned about internships available to me and felt like I made a really good impression on employers. I dressed profressionally, had about 10 resumes in a folder that I were able to hand directly to employers, and had my resume profressionally crafted with the help of career services. My professor even came up to one of the employers I was talking to and told them how good of a student I was. As you can see, connections and using on campus resources are very important. On the flip side, there were many improvements I could have made. I should have researched the conpanies ahead of time so that I knew who exactly I wanted to talk to. While my elevator pitch wasn’t bad, and caught the interest of many, I could improve it a little more. Also, having extra resumes, on nice resume paper, on hand would have been nice. As a sophomore I still have time to approve!

I haven’t been in contact with either of them since because I’ve been absolutely slammed at my new job at a law firm. Is it too late to email them and follow up on the LORs? I don’t really have anyone else who might give me good letters, primarily because this professor taught 3 of my senior courses and because my firm has a strict no-LOR policy.

And before I get shit for it, yes, I know. I should have kept in contact and been on top of my game. I realize that and have beaten myself up over this enough; I don’t need strangers from the internet to do it too."

The last time you were able to remember me and what was going on in my life, I was probably 15 years old. I am now 22 years old and today in particular, I miss you terribly. 

Nana, I’ve accomplished so much since I was 15! I went to college to study wildlife, I’ve had internships, good grades, and honors opportunities galore. Do you remember when I was still about 6 years old? We used to sit on your porch and identify the birds with your guide. I always wanted to see an oriole, because he reminded me of Oreos. I remember naming the flowers with you in the garden and learning how to caw just like a crow. That drove my mom nuts. I was way too good at it and way too loud. 

Nana, since graduating I have moved into my very own apartment with my boyfriend, and we got a dog! You would love him! He loves to beg at the table, just how you like them, and he never refuses a tiny taste of what you’re having. 

Do you remember when you would give me whipped cream, just because I liked it? It was such a simple act of spoiling me, but the way you justified your nana rules taught me to do good things just to see people happy. I’m so glad you taught me that. 

The reason I thought of you today is because I’ve started putting just a tiny bit of whipped cream on my dogs meals.. just because he liked it. I wasn’t even thinking “oh, this is what nana would do” until today. I’ve been doing this for a week. Suddenly I’ve been brought to tears because I feel as though you’re with me all the time now. I’ve never felt this way about a lost loved one before, and unfortunately you know that we have many. 

Nana, your love for others, nature, and for life has had such a profound impact on who I am, even years after we lived on the same side of the country.

It’s been about a year since you have passed away, and I miss you very much, even though it seems like your sitting right here. "

Back when I was in school besides your clinicals where you did a rotation in every unit (ex: labor and delivery, psych, etc) you had a month long unpaid internship if you passed your exams and were slated for graduation. 

The internships were given out by the head instructor and it went alphabetically, my last name ends in T so I was at the tail end. 

All the internships I wanted (emergency, med surge, etc) they had been taken. The instructor told me hey we have a Psych internship at major psychiatric facility. “Your a big strapping  guy! I’m sure you’ll be perfect”


Great psych I wasn’t thrilled, I had no interest in psych but I needed the hours to graduate and I figured I’d have stories to tell my buddies over beer. 

I had no idea. 

The hospital I interned at is quite well known so I’m not going to go into to many specifics but it has a psych ward that deals with many different psychiatric disorders. There’s a few floors, they had a rehab as well as a clinic for eating disorders. The floor I was assigned to the children’s psychiatric ward so children 18- with all kinds of issues. 

Since I was not licensed yet I didn’t distribute medication or really do anything besides work as a glorified orderly. Some of the kids were awesome, they had severe autism or other issues but they were still great kids. Then there was Adam (obviously not his real name) he was diagnosed with RAD as well as a bevy of psychological issues. He was 10 and had tried to kill his 6 year old sister, punched his mom so hard he knocked her unconscious, killed the family’s cat, among other things. 

He was not allowed general access, not allowed to do craft hour (access to scissors, etc) he was allowed an hour of free time where I or another staff member brought him to a small atrium where he’d run in circles or kick a half deflated soccer ball. Well one day it’s raining and the atrium is a no go so I was told I could let him in the small nurses lounge. The charge nurse swore she removed any weapons he could have used. So I brought him in there and while he sat in the corner and talked to himself I sat in a chair and waited. 

I get radioed from an orderly so I take my eyes off Adam for a millisecond and the next thing I know a chair is violently launched at me. It hits me square in the face and I go down , I was stunned not knocked out and suddenly there’s a ten year old 80 pound kid on top of me hell bent on killing me. Luckily he was easily distracted and at that exact moment the charge nurse came into the lounge probably to get coffee. I was able to flip him over and  get him subdued. The charge nurse almost wets herself then starts apologizing. I ended up with a broken nose and bruises. The head nurse was slapped on the wrist and my ass was kissed the next two weeks. Surprisingly besides Adam and a few others that place made such an impact on me after I graduated and became certified I ended up working there for four years. So I have many stories from my time there. 

Last I heard Adam was in a long term facility and with meds he is doing ok. "
9fu3i5,7,2018-09-14,Walk away? Warning: Detailed story,OwlConstruction8,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9fu3i5/walk_away_warning_detailed_story/,"I'm a 25 year old man.I don't know whether the experiences with my abusive mother and absent father are enough to warrant walking away from them.

&amp;#x200B;

As a young child, I was happy. I had an interest in the nature, animals and the way they worked in an environment. As a teenager, I was depressed and socially anxious. I had few friends. As a young adult, I became hooked and addicted to video games, with few or no friends, with no experience dating or with the opposite sex. Is it because of my trauma, that things became this way?

&amp;#x200B;

My mother, a scientist, a controlling woman with an explosive temper. Utterly self-centered, lacking in empathy and narcissistic, she has alienated both of her brothers. Everything must be done according to her order, otherwise she explodes screaming and shouting at the person. People should always be grateful for her and everything she has done for them. Other people are so, so, so jealous of her accomplishments. Treats service staff like shit. I thought this behaviour was normal for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

From a young age, she hired tutors for me, strictly controlled my academic choices in school, often barred me from socializing and going out. Violin and piano lessons were forced upon me. A password was put on the TV, and the computer. I could only access them when she wanted. I vividly remember that at age 11, when asked to read out loud a Chinese textbook, she grabbed and held up a pair of scissors, saying 'Read! Read it! Or I'll kill you!!!'  I remember tears streaming down my face as I turned and read the page.  Or the time, when I made an error in my Advanced math textbook from Singapore at 10 pm in the night, she devolved into a manic, shuddering hysteria, roaring and shaking violently as if in the grips of a rabid seizure. I was frightened for my life.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of this, I became withdrawn as a teenager. Constantly having to face the screaming and shouting every day coming home, always being insulted and told I was stupid and lazy, I developed social anxiety. I would avoid people and events and developed a stammer. Tiptoeing around my mother's roiling emotions daily, I became extremely sensitive to what people would say and became constantly frightened that people hated or disliked me. Most probably, because of the the relationship with my mother, her actions and words. This low self-esteem was profited upon by my former friends, who later turned into bullies, goading and teasing for an angry response. I left high school with no friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My father, a narcissist, was never there. After losing his job at 41, he established a new business in another country and would be away 9 months out of a year abroad. When he was back, he would regularly be belittled by my mother and shouted at. He would never stand up to my mother for me. He never had any advice for me, in relation to socializing, women, to take care of myself as a man.

On the few occasions he was here, when I would walk into his study to connect with him, he would literally stand up and walk towards me, body-block pushing me out of his room. When I asked him about this and why we can't get along, he told me, 'We don't have anything in common'. How cold. How can you say this, to your shy, depressed son, as a man, as a father? Is it not your responsibility to connect with your son?

&amp;#x200B;

At 60 and jobless for a few years, he spends his time writing insulting emails to his family. He has alienated his elderly mother and many of his siblings with the arrogant, condescending tone of communication he uses with them. He likes to boast about how he is an MBA graduate (25 years ago), how the logical skills he gained there enable him to supplement his arguments with his family over petty things such as my grandma's retirement home. Again, he has little empathy for other people and only has contact with one other person, my mother. He is a loner and spends his days on the computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, now a man. My career for the most part has been directed by these two people. In adolescence, my parents, having decided that my command of English and skills in History were good, decided that a career in Law was going to be my future. Using their connections, law internships were secured for me at ages 15 and 16. I was not interested in the work at all, but thought it was just me. Just have to work harder, I thought. Show them you can succeed. I went on to fail my Law exams in Year 1 and Year 2 of university (undergrad, UK). There, I became addicted to video games, playing 10 to 12 hours a day. I had no friends, wouldn't go out, spent my whole life on a screen.

&amp;#x200B;

After finally graduating with a law degree, I knew my low GPA would not make it in the profession. I began to recall my interest in zoology and animals. After announcing to my parents, who I was living with at the time that I was going to go back for a second Bachelors, the response was ridiculous. My mother screamed, shouted, tore up my things and threw a coin at my head. She called me a failure, money-waster, and a parasite.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew had to get out of there soon. Whilst still living with her, I thought that I would have to do as she wished. Too much pressure, shouting and screaming. I resigned myself to her argument that it would be too much money to go back for a second Bachelors. I would be throwing away my law degree. I found out that universities in Europe had courses for Masters in Management. I believed that I could find an interest in management and business given the breadth of the area, and get out and give myself a new working opportunity by doing so, so applied and got into a business school in Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here in Germany and having finished my Masters degree, I realized after working a corporate internship (and being fired because of lack of interest) that this life is not for me. I was unable to sustain an interest in it. With ADHD, I know that I can only focus on things that interest me greatly. I finally knew that I had to somehow go after becoming a zoologist, and the only way forward was to follow my dream. Since announcing to my mother that I will be finally starting a Bachelor of Science degree this fall, she threatened to disown me. She came to visit me in August, and out of five days we had five arguments. I counted. I hoped that she would have become more empathetic. My father, as negative as he is, only has bad things to say about my career path (going back to uni for a Bachelors, doing a distance learning degree).

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't care. Since realizing why my past made me the way I was, this has given me the strength of knowledge. I understand myself. Now I know that the only path forward is one that I build with my own hands, and will take every opportunity that I can do put myself forward. I have begun taking language classes here in German, going out to events. I have recently joined an acting school. Talking to girls again. Going to the gym three times a week. The games, long my scourge, have been thrown all away. I will get my science Bachelor's, get a Masters in Science and become a zoologist. I don't know how or how long the road will take, but I know that I am now on it and nothing will turn me away from it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should walk away completely, but I know that if I do I have all the strength to move forward with my life. What is your advice?

Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see


- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.


THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, my kik is mjd931, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

9fu9pk,3,2018-09-14,[M25] How to improve my appearance and social skills with women,MaB6,AskMenAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/9fu9pk/m25_how_to_improve_my_appearance_and_social/,"\[VERY LONG POST - you can go directly down to the questions, if you don't wanna read it all\]

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 25y.o. man doing my Ph.D., i.e. working in research. I've been supporting myself for almost all the years in the university and I've been living on my own since 19. I've never been a Tom-Cruise-level-looking guy, but I've managed to get one girlfriend in the high school and kiss with several other girls back then.

It's important to add, that I've always wished to experience casual sex with many women, as I have a high sex-drive and I've been most of my life studying (mostly because of my very strict mother) or later, closed in the office with serious middle-aged men. Also, I love the feeling of being attractive to someone and just enjoying a moment.

In the university I've been extremely busy studying and working at the same time, which resulted on missing almost all parties and clubs and also into several pretty serious health problems, which are hopefully gone now.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a few other girlfriends in those years (really not many), my last one being very sexually open and willing to experiment with threesome, knowing about my wish.

In that time (cca 2 years ago) I was feeling pretty well, despite being incredibly stressed from finishing my Major and working full-time.

When she arranged one of her friends for a threesome (who got multiple previous experience with it), the evening went horribly wrong. She was making out with my girlfriend, but when I came to the room, she rejected to interact with me at all (except kissing), with some silly excuse about her previous boyfriend. I've never felt humiliated like this, to be honest...

That was the first time I thought about being really unattractive.

After several months, a former schoolmate of my gf came to our city to visit her. They were together in my gf's old flat, where they were talking with another guy living there. I couldn't come that evening, as I had to finish something in work.

My gf's friend had sex with the guy and she's in contact with him despite having boyfriend. My gf talked with her about threesome and we arranged a date when we will meet her. She lives on the very other side of my country, so I booked a hotel and went there (my gf was already there for several days because of her job). When I've arrived, however, the girl was really cold towards me, telling me she doesn't have time that day and leaving me in the street, in front of my gf. Later I found out, that she commonly attends local group sex parties, so she obviously isn't a very censored person and have no problems sleeping with new guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I've gone through this even with my friend from uni, whom I helped some time ago finishing her degree (I've basically programmed all the software for her thesis). I talked about it with her and she told me, that she's too shy to do it etc. Shortly afterwards she found some much older, divorcing guy in his 40s, with whom she attended threesomes without any problems (and she wrote me her experience, of course). This was really depressing, as this guy is short, with poor facial aesthetics and terrible social skills (I know him marginally from the local climbing gym). He's also not the typical ""successful grown-up guy"", who is some high-ranked manager, making huge amounts of money and who can take his women to Florida 4 times a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting gradually more and more depressed by this, as nothing seems to work. I have zero confidence, as I can see, that I've lost my hair due to an excessive stress and I'm much skinnier, that what I was like 4 years back, when I was doing Judo and Kickboxing.

I'm repelling women on a daily basis, to the point, where I took my gf's friend to the climbing gym (she was talking about it several times), paid for her and took her there by car, but after training she was visibly annoyed and she insisted, that next time my gf will go with us (I've done nothing bad to her and we weren't talking about anything personal, which could offend her).

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping, that the situation will improve, when I'll move to another country, as I'm currently doing my 10months internship abroad. It didn't. To be honest, women are repelled by myself to the point, where secretaries, standing in front of the building, I've never spoken with, throw their cigarettes away and slam the door in front of my face, so they don't have to greet me and spend like 15seconds in my presence. I'm also experiencing this behaviour in the street, where women visibly look away, when I go around them or in the bus, when I'm going to the office in the morning.

So far, I've tried working out in the gym with the personal trainer with mixed success (put on some muscles, then lost it all due to an extreme stress and then injured my shoulder, which I'm still struggling with), shaving my hair completely, changing my beard shape and buying a new clothes. I've also asked two times for opinions on RateMe, AmIUgly etc., where I got mostly ""not very good"" rating ([https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/8rkjhc/m25\_being\_constantly\_rejected/](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/8rkjhc/m25_being_constantly_rejected/)).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, this thing is consuming my life as nothing has ever been. I need to do something about it, but I have no idea what. The worst thing is, nobody understands my position and I'm getting exactly 3 answers, whenever I try to bring it up:

1. Oh, so you've had some girls, you're just making this problem in your head.
2. You're very successful with your Ph.D. (in reality, I'm not successful at all, I'm simply trying to get it done somehow), so you should be grateful for that and women will come, as they love successful men!
3. You're SO shallow and womaniser! You don't deserve any women!

Of course, none of them is helpful, as every one of them puts me more and more into depression.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my long-term goals are:

1. Improve my appearance as possible
2. Get some time and self-confidence for clubs, as I'd love to sometimes just go there and chill out
3. Become attractive to some women (don't know, if it's possible at all)

Do you have any suggestions how to start? I'll welcome ANY answers.

Thank you very much!

&amp;#x200B;

P.s.: I'm very sorry for this post, but I really needed to get it off my chest."

One interesting detail in the [latest chapter](https://readms.net/r/my_hero_academia/198/5343/1) was how the interns of the first team, Kirishima and Tsuyu, were pretty sincere in how they took match.

One one hand you have Kirishima who was looking at it as a do or die situation, much like his bout with Rappa during the raid. 

Meanwhile, Froppy might feel guilty about how Nighteye was killed during her mission, despite not having any chance to affect the outcome. Much like Ochako, she wants to be a hero who saves people and she doesn't want to ever lose people on missions.

It's interesting how both of them seem to be taking things much more seriously since they had a taste of what the real world of the pro's has to offer, and what makes it even pronounced is their reactions contrasted against Koda and Kaminari's.

9furkh,0,2018-09-14,Cut down your workload by half to help your students better!,geekyrobert,TeachingUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachingUK/comments/9furkh/cut_down_your_workload_by_half_to_help_your/,"School today is bad for both you and your students. You work crazy hours within school and some more after school – so much that after a while you feel burnt out and terrible yourself. How can you inspire students when you yourself start dreading school? For students, many of them simply don’t benefit much: they come to your class, refuse to pay attention and walk out not knowing very much more than what they did walking in. And their test scores prove it – but wait a moment, I’m not saying it’s their fault for not paying attention – many of these students come from complex circumstances that shaped how they behave today.

The solution: 

Stop teaching and instead help your students to learn and grow – that is why you chose to become a teacher in the first place. 

How will my students learn what they need for the exams in that case?

Technology has come a long way since when you were a student. Now, there are ample learning resources available online in the form of YouTube videos and lecture notes that are all freely accessible online and high quality. Many of your students are probably already using them in their spare time. 

I feel that if these resources are mapped to specific points on the specifications, you can easily allocate specific parts you want students to learn based on your “lesson” objectives. To ensure accountability, I’m thinking of creating a website that tracks how much of these videos/notes each student watches/reads as well as the amount of homework they attempt. All these done for you in a matter of a few clicks (or if you want more customization, a few more). During regular “lessons”, students can now just focus on what they need to learn through a computer rather than to waste their time and your effort by not paying attention (as many of them do now). 

Because you have saved some much time and effort, you can now use that time to do things you always enjoyed but never found time for. You can help individual students with particular questions, do interesting stuff to spark their interest in your subject or interact with your students more to figure out how you can help to develop them as a person. 

This might sound like a crazy idea so think for yourself if what I wrote above makes sense. To assure you, I’m also seeking to work with the Faculty of Education here in Cambridge and the Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education to show that the idea works. If you’re interested or simply want to find out more, feel free to comment below or email me at zw322 (at) cam.ac.uk . If you’re keen but don’t want to go full in, we can definitely arrange for one or two “lessons” to try it out. Particularly, for those of you who are considering to quit teaching for good, give it a try because you don’t want your students to lose a teacher who genuinely cares.

Right now, this idea might be more suitable for STEM subjects for slightly older children (GCSE/A levels ) – particularly A level Chemistry which I’m most passionate about and ready to support you in -- but with some work and consultation, it can be shaped to meet the needs of other teachers as well.

PS. My background

I have been an intern teacher for grade 10 biology and chemistry students for 2 months with half the teaching load as a normal teacher. Still, I felt burnt out because of the ridiculous hours and amount of tedious repetitive work (marking, lesson planning) required. Most importantly, this stuff that was consuming most of my time didn’t contribute to spark the learning interest of my students or to develop them as a person. That’s why I decided that teaching isn’t for me and am now studying Education at Cambridge (as an undergraduate) to figure out how I can make school a better experience for both teacher and students through other  ways.

9fvts0,16,2018-09-14,I feel sick and so betrayed.,Picard-Out,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/9fvts0/i_feel_sick_and_so_betrayed/,"Yesterday my aunt, uBPD mom's sister, made a big deal about needing to talk to me uninterrupted.

I called her, and it turns out that uBPD mom found out that I had a couple of late payments on my student debt account. It's an account that she cosigned on back in the day. I hated doing it back then but had no choice, uBPD mom knew what she was getting into.

For the two late payments I called the bank and told them exactly when I would pay them, but of course it still affects credit score. I tried to get my mom off the account and to switch cosigners, but it's impossible. She signed, and she's stuck on the account with me.

Anyway. My aunt said that my mom went full on rage because the two late payments will affect her credit score and she's trying to but a new house.
First my aunt wanted me to ask my dad's side of the family or my husband's family for the money. I said no. That I don't need the added stress and that my mother knew what she was getting into. My husband has gotten more work so that we have more money available for the next year until I finish my degree. Then I'll have a paid internship and no more money issues.

So, then my aunt said that she would pay the full hundred grand that I owe, and that I could pay her back instead of the bank. I said no, but she insisted, told me how well off she is for now, how we can work out a payment schedule, etc.

I have a good relationship with my aunt usually, so I started thinking about it. How it would mean less interest, how I could build my credit score back up, and mostly how good it felt to have a family member care about me enough to disentangle me from my last tie to my mother.

I told her I'd discuss it with my spouse. I did, and then told her that we were onboard.

She replied and told me that actually she might wait and see if my mother's credit score is indeed affected, and may e become my mother's guarantor instead, and that she was doing this to get my mom her 'dream of owning a little house'. 

Keep in mind she tried to convince me for a good 45 minutes yesterday, and that her paying that for me and having me pay her back instead of thr bank seemed like a huge weight off my shoulders, with big implications for my little family. Right after I accepted, full of gratitude, especially at being free from my mother, she took it back. None of it was with me in mind, it was all for my mother.

I am so hurt, I feel sick. I didn't want anyone to pay my stuff for me, and I tried not to be late but my family was broke for two months, and even at that I told the bank exactly when I would pay them. I felt really bad that I affected my mom's credit score but now I feel nothing. I can't believe that my aunt would dangle that in front of me and then snatch it away. She knows I've been struggling, and that it was my 1 year NC anniversary from my mom, and still my mom's needs are like a black hole that eclipses everyone else's.

I can't believe that my aunt treated me like this. She was the last one left with whom I had a relationship, and it was a good one, and now I think that she's dangerous. That she'll toy with me and my family just to serve my mother's needs, and that means cutting out my aunt too.

I feel beyond sad. I can't believe this happened. It feels surreal. She fucking tried to convince me, and then once she did she just pulled the rug from under me. In less than 24 hours. Who does that. Fuck.

Edited for spelling."
9fw69v,2,2018-09-14,Any advice?,legaladvicean,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/9fw69v/any_advice/,"I struggle to write or express my current life situation because I feel it comes off as weakness in the form of self-pity. But here goes.

Financial:

I have a decent 40k M-F office job where I started as an intern in March and now work full-time. I’m living paycheck to paycheck due to bad money management, stupid decisions, and some legal trouble. In the past, whenever I’ve had some extra cash I’d usually blow it on weed, strip clubs, hookers. I’ve got 3 open marijuana charges. I have a lawyer for one of them, need a lawyer for the second (don’t know where that money is coming from), and the third one may not need a lawyer involved (3 different counties).

I need 5 more classes to finish a degree, but again, I don’t know where that money is coming from. It is an expensive private school and, unfortunately, they will not take credits from cheaper community or state colleges for the degree. I wasn’t approved for a private loan to cover what fed loan won’t (credit has gone to shit the past 4 years).

Family: I got married at 22. A big reason for getting married so soon was so she can become a US citizen and continue on to a university and get a degree. The marriage lasted 5 years before starting to breaking down. During our marriage, we moved about a 4hr plane ride away from all of our friends and family so she can take a well paying job. I quit my job and decided to finish college in the new state. Not too long after, we separated and eventually divorced but I decided to stay and finish school.

My mother and I have a bad relationship. As a child, I was sexually abused by my stepfather. I told my mother about it as a young child but she may have sunk into denial. I went to therapy for this last year for 9 months and it has been very helpful. Although the anger is mostly gone, I have no desire to fix my relationship with her.

I rarely speak with my dad, it’s awkward when we do. He was a bit verbally and physically abusive but I have no ill feelings towards him. We’ve just never had a ‘loving’ relationship.

I have 4 brothers aged 22-32 and two younger sisters ages 3 and 5. I only regularly talk with one of my brothers (31). He’s bailed me out financially a few times but I don’t have a plan yet on how I will be repaying the debt.

Social:

I find it difficult connecting with anyone these days. Conversations longer than 5 minutes are tough for me. My roommate has tried to get me to be more social and fun and I’ve tried as well. I’d just rather be alone, knowing that this desire for isolation adds on to my depression. But so does being bad at socializing.

Meditation has been incredibly helpful in turning off my mind for a little bit, but as soon I begin to realistically think how the next 5 years look like, my mind goes down a dark path.

Anyone have some advice?"
9fw96z,2,2018-09-14,I am an unhappy millennial.,messatworkthrowaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9fw96z/i_am_an_unhappy_millennial/,"We have a secretary at work who's a little off-kilter. She's short, walks with a limp and in her late 60's. She's very outspoken, odd, and a bit neurotic. Some of my co-workers roll their eyes, but I always chat with her for a little bit, ask how she is, and listen to her stories because she reminds me of my mother. Always worried about her kids, maybe a little too much. Always saying 'you millennials'.

&amp;#x200B;

Today she stopped me in the hall. She started to say ""You look tired"", like she does often, but she stopped half way and said ""You always look like something's weighing you down. Are you a \*happy millennial\*?""

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like a knife hit my chest. Was it that noticeable? I immediately wondered who else in our office might have wondered the same thing - did I really wear it on my face so plainly?

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a happy millennial, but I am a successful one. That's what I've been substituting for happiness, hoping that one day my work will pay off and I'll be able to buy my way into the world as a normal-functioning, worry-free adult. Every dollar I've earned, I've mentally stored it into a plastic-surgery savings account, so that men can find me attractive one day. Every date that I go on, I don't resist advances in the hope that this time someone will stay. Maybe then, I can finally find happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I have struggled with what I thought was depression, but what a counselor diagnosed as PTSD since childhood. I had a very sobering moment a couple of years ago when I was looking through childhood memories. When I was very young, I was a happy, beautiful little girl. But time progressed and I was always hiding my face from the camera, or upset, crying, yelling, ignoring the person behind the camera. Eventually every single photo of me was with a blank expression. Not smiling, not frowning, just completely absent. I must have been around 9 years old. The blatancy of it left me dumbstruck.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents should never have gotten married. But they were getting old, and were lonely. I grew up in a house where yelling \*was\* the inside voice. I slept in a shed a few times just to be away from them. things got worse as I got older, but I was able to detach. My mother's threats of suicide just became a nuisance rather than a concern. My father's verbal abuse and alcoholism were just accepted. When I wrote these things off to friends as jokes, they would stare at me in disbelief. I stopped telling jokes about my family around them. There were other things, but I'm learning to forget them now. I still have to go to the gym today, and I don't want to be a crying mess when I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I got to one of the best colleges in the world due to academics and sports - which, I was happy to find, was a wonderful escape and kept me from returning to that household until my parents were getting ready for bed. Unfortunately, another side effect was my mother's jealousy, accusations of an eating disorder and ironically enough - an actual eating disorder from my mother's constant nagging to eat and my refusal to become morbidly obese again, just like her, my father, like everyone in my family. But anyway. I got distracted.

&amp;#x200B;

College let me meet a myriad of wonderful people - I purposely picked one far, far, away from home. And with those wonderful people were their wonderful families. From those wonderful families, came a realization of the true extent of what my past was like, how far away from healthy relationships I was, and how unfair the world is. How parents aren't supposed to threaten to wipe your bank account clean when you disagree with them, how it wasn't normal for adults to spend thousands on a flat-screened TV and guilt their teenage daughter into paying household bills they couldn't afford. I spiraled into depression. I resorted to suicide attempts - again. I nearly drank myself to death - me! Someone who hadn't had a drop of alcohol until she was 21. I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, I moved back with my parents after I graduated because I got a really prestigious job offer in my hometown. I entered an emotionally-taxing relationship as an escape. I started dating men who were old enough to be my father. I lost my virginity at 23 to a stranger (which, I have to be honest - was probably the best romantic experience in my life. As a human, he was amazing and I don't regret it at all. We're still in touch and it kills me he's across the country.) I told myself the entire time that I was different from my parents. I was better than my cousins, who were suffering the same disease of instability due to our parents. I would be the one who escaped the downward spiral. I'd be the white sheep in the family of black sheep.

&amp;#x200B;

And on the outside, it appears that way. I'm 'living the dream' to a lot of people. My job is amazing, I have my own assistant who's 8 years older than me. I've been recognized by some of the highest-ranked members of our company. My work is effecting thousands of people directly, and I'm recognized on at least a state-level. I've been accepted into some of the top 20 business schools in the country and turned them down to begin my own small business. At age 24 I have several projects underway that could pay out 10000x fold in the near future - a far cry from the kid who grew up with parents telling her to marry rich so she wouldn't have to worry about paying bills. I have alumni and current college students from my alma mater calling and interviewing me, asking for internships and letters of recommendations. I've been told over and over how confident I am, that I'm a role-model, and that my success is intimidating. I've even been told that I'm pretty.

&amp;#x200B;

But when our secretary said those words, I felt like a mask had been lifted off of the performer. All my flaws and imperfections were laid bare. I felt that nothing had changed, and nothing would change. I felt trapped again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I just can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. I imagine if my coworkers really knew that the uptight, prudish little genius with a thousand different skills who's always so prim and proper lived a double life as a mentally exhausted, worn down, ex-dominatrix with an abusive childhood who gets drunk every weekend. What would their reaction be? Typing it out, I'm almost proud at how well I pull it off.

&amp;#x200B;

And then I brush away those thoughts, get ready for the gym, and keep making it through the day until someone else starts asking questions."
9fwxv1,12,2018-09-14,MSP Career: A Postmortem Review,cachem3outside,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/9fwxv1/msp_career_a_postmortem_review/,"I worked exclusively for MSPs for over twenty years. Like most systems engineers I started at a company as a bright eyed and bushy tailed ""IT Manager"" who saw the world at my fingertips, until I learned that printers aren't just thrown out upon their first paper jam, I hate printers, but in digress. 

I'm convinced that not all MSPs are bad but most are, I can't cite sources, but as a fairly well travelled tech I've seen a lot and have arrived at a conclusion with some fairly convincing evidence (**at least to me**).

MSPs rely on *BS* and generally pay a sales ""engineer"" fresh out of college (with a degree in cocaine use) about 50%+ more than the best technical resource in the shop. You soon realize that your job and by proxy, the business isn't about pleasing customers or even customer focused. Business is about extreme profit margins inflated as highly as they are able to get away with, relying on the implicit ignorance of their customers (since they came to a consulting firm..) and of course, lots of *BS*. 

I've seen partners eat into profits to such an extent that payroll became impossible, day five after payday without a paycheck, well, people just stop showing up to work, regardless of the excuses. I've seen good men and women turn into monsters, got to watch an ex smash out every window of 90K sports car of their previous lover - except it was actually a customers similar looking vehicle there for a meeting. Walked in on a married partner banging a random chick in the helpdesk 'bullpen'. It's all about money, but not in the honorable or ethical way.

MSPs whether knowingly or unknowingly perpetrate this trade fraud every day, they mark up the most innocuous parts extraordinarily high, you want a 6"" Cat5e patch cable (made by an unpaid intern from the local high school), got $30 bucks? Want a server that you think came directly from Dell? Prepare to pay 100% markup on an eBay special, warranty?? ""You don't need that, WE ARE YOUR WARRANTY, WE HAVE 3 MORE FREE INCIDENTS WITH DELL BRUH""

MSPs don't pay their bills, they just don't. I can't tell you how many times a call was erroneously routed to me and I was sternly warned by Al at Staples or Dell that our company credit line was nearing termination due to being 120+ days past due. The general hypocrisy is the fact that most customers of MSPs pay on time, sure there are some who don't (stop accepting SMB leads from your crap marketing firm) but the MSP has pretty compelling leverage...

This business model started as an idea that proposed (on fancy paper and the actual mythical COLOR INK!) that it was actually ``possible'' to replace an internal IT department or save businesses money by ""streamlining"" the efficiency of the ghastly practice of businesses being naive enough to hire their own employees, how dare they?.. There's more to it than that but seriously, does anyone fall for the ""one person can't possibly know everything, hire us and you get a 'pool' of talent and decades of experience!"" BS marketing slogan?? 

One company with 4 - 15 techs CANNOT take care of a business 10 times their size, it is a mathematical fact. The company who hired the MSP just wanted to make their technology and support of it more efficient, so they fired their underpaid, inhumanely overworked IT guy only to find out after a year that aside from constantly changing faces due to high turnover and low wages, they are just paying for another similarly inhumanely overworked and underpaid IT guy who is so burnt out that he only showers once a fortnight.

I know owners (and the amazing, totally useful ""silent"" partners) will condemn my message and refute my claims but they are doing so to defend their own ego defending rationalizations and justifications of their own fraud and deception, the MSP industry chews up and vomits out real high quality tech talent every day, burns you out quicker than you can say UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION and generally sucks. Working 60+ hours a week for months on end with 80+ hours of PTO that you aren't allowed to use while doing the work of 3+ people is just wrong. 

Bottom line of my rant? Work/Life balance is as or more important than most other aspects of a workplace. People have families, appointments with doctors, counselors and quality prostitutes. I missed so many of the important moments in my kids lives because someone just couldn't wait for that new Office upgrade or something else beyond stupid and a waste of my time.

peacekeeper: orochi

orochi: I hate knights

it didn't make any sense at all and it was completely random and i'm not saying I could do any better because i probably couldn't but the devs keep talking about how the characters have new personalities. if orochis personality is just they hate everything then that sucks. and the lines are way too small there should be more dialog between heroes like this

brackets are the mood there talking with

  

Round 1

Warden: (jokingly) so who let the dog out of their kennel

Conqueror: (tired) you come up with that on your own

Round 2

Warden: (annoyed) you ever use anything other then your shield

Conqueror: (sarcastic) don’t know Do you use anything other then your shoulder

Round 3

Warden: (jokingly) who’s bright idea was it to give you a weapon?

Conqueror: (sarcastic jib) same people who gave you a sword 

&amp;#x200B;

the dialog between the heroes when they are locked on to each other is also pretty bad 

Orochi: I'm not die yet  (not joking thats actually ""banter"")

&amp;#x200B;

It should be threatening or trying to rile the other player up like this

&amp;#x200B;

Lawbringer: I shall put your head on a pike for all to see who challenges a Lawbringer

Centurion: your death will add to my legacy/legend

Warden: that all you got I’ve seen squires fight better then you 

Shaman: I can taste your fear and IT IS DELICIOUS (Breaks out into crazy laughter)

I hope the devs hold on to the voices for a season or two and rework them then release them when there more polished and not just ""oh I hate knights""

I suck at these so if anyone wants to give it a go and write some dialog in the comments that would be awesome"
9fxt7d,1,2018-09-14,"Me [22 F] with my EX [22 M] dated for 2.5 years, but i got dumped by him 4 months ago. Love really sucks.",skyisalover,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9fxt7d/me_22_f_with_my_ex_22_m_dated_for_25_years_but_i/,"First of all, please bear with my bad grammar. I just have been extremely sad recently don't know how to move on. My friends all seem like they don't want to hear me talking about it anymore. I hope this is the last time I am gonna talk about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I started dating my ex during my second semester of college. He never dated a girl before so I was he's first gf. Although I did date few people before( in middle school and didn't last long), i am not gonna count that. So he was sort of my first boyfriend too. we didn't start off well, it was more like we just gonna try it. He was in a frat, but I wasn't those kind of party girls. I did go to few parties with him, but i just didn't like the environment. We would argue about frat/drinking/him using tinder to talk to other girls, but he did change a little bit( deleted tinder).

&amp;#x200B;

Then junior year came, He cheated on me by having an oral sex with a girl. I was so depressed about it because we got to know each other better, and I actually developed a stronger feeling for him. I forgive him but that whole year was terribly spent. We would argue about everything, and i would cry about everything. My GPA dropped. I got frustrated about everything. Although sometimes we did have fun. Junior year summer came, he went to Seattle for his internship. Sometimes I would get mad at him for not responding me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then senior year came, he said he doesn't want to see me anymore. So we stopped seeing each other for 2 weeks. I was so depressed and sad that i reached out to him. He agree to see me again. I picked a new recently opened restaurant ( I know he likes to eat) , and we met up over there. He told me that his roommate suggested him not to talk to me again. But things did go well. I gave him his birthday gift and a souvenir I got when i went to NYC for vacation in the summer. I promised him, I would leave the past behind and we can try again. He agreed to do that. Things got better, we stayed over at each others places. Then things started to change again when we were about to graduate. He started to tell me that I'm kinda boring, and his friends didn't think I'm cool. He also invited another girl over to his frat while we were dating, and he suddenly became very cold to me. I was literally crying on campus that day. I also did a stupid day. I took his phone, which was at the charging station and texted the girl asked her if she wants to date him, and the girl rejected. My ex got so mad at me for doing that because it made him look like a coward. I apologized, but i don't regret i did it. Me and my ex stopped talking to each other for few days.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he saw me at the library with my (male) friends, and he got jealous so he asked me back. At first i didn't accept because I had the feeling he was gonna dump me after graduation or something like that. When he promised me that he will try after graduation, I took him back. Then We had sex ( both of us were virgins) . I thought we were finally going somewhere, but I got dumped after graduation. I called him one time, it sounded like he just don't want to have anything to do with me Now he's in seattle, and I'm just in a college town doing more school.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have made many many mistakes in this realtionship, and I know he did too. I love him too much and always forgive him for all the things he did to me. I just don't know how to move on. I see him on FB going to out people, clubbing and partying with people, but I'm just here being sad. I told him to block me because I just can't move on by myself. I tried to be more outgoing and social, but at the end of the day, I always think about him before i go to bed. I am so tired of myself living like that, and cry about it. I went on few dates with other people, but at the end i just rejected to see them again because I am scared to get hurt again. I am scared to see him dating other people. It's probably the best decision for us both to be done with each other but I'm always hoping for something else.

tl;dr:  I am being very honest about this.Please don't be so harsh on me. Thank you for reading !

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

9fyl5r,4,2018-09-14,I believe my [22F] boyfriend [22M] looks down on me and is ashamed of me,brokenheartsheep,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9fyl5r/i_believe_my_22f_boyfriend_22m_looks_down_on_me/,"I met my boyfriend in college summer going into my junior year (\~2years ago). We both had similar interests such as video games, and motor sports which really kicked things off for us. He was studying computer science after switching from neurology and I was studying political science and I was just switching to mechanical engineering. Long story short, I had no interests in politics after an internship I had, and I knew I needed to make money somehow, so I switched to engineering because it was something I knew I was interested in. As you can imagine my transition into this discipline was one of the most difficult things that I have done so far in my life. My boyfriend helped me a lot through some of the computer science classes that I had and with other homework as well. 

My boyfriend and I spent almost all our time together, where every day between classes and after classes I would be at his apartment (even though I had my own place). I unofficially became the 5th roommate of his apartment of 4. Although he did help me a lot with homework, he often would not be doing homework for very long after classes. The schedule often went like this: after class (3pm) we both would meet up at the apartment, we would decide what to eat, then watch tv, and by then it was 7pm. I would then have only 3 hours each night to get my work done. This was often how the weekends went too, where we would spend most of our day doing nothing but have fun then do work later. He would always get his work done but it was harder for me because this curriculum did not come easy to me. I managed to get my homework done on time, but exams is what I struggled with. 

Over the next year I struggled a lot and I ended up having to retake some classes to get into the program officially. I often came to him crying about how I didn’t do as well as I wanted on tests or homework and we discussed about things that I could change. Arguably, there were more things that I should have done to get the help I needed to get the grades that I needed such as going to study sessions more. Before the semester ended I was being more proactive, and I decided to go to the internship/career fair that was being held just to brush up on my interviewing skills, etc. Then out of nowhere this summer I got an engineering internship in a city that was \~3hrs away from where we both go to school. I was so excited, because I had no engineering experience and this company decided to give me an opportunity. I was so fucking excited and proud of myself for landing this opportunity because I know how difficult it can be to get experience in engineering. I told him I got it he said he was proud of me. Then this may he graduated from college, and I am on track to graduate in December of 2019 (1.5semesters). I am so proud of him because like me he hates school and we both work better in a “work” environment. 

Anyways, While I was gone he used his new salary to rent a new two bed apartment, where he completely furnished the bedroom, living room, kitchen, and the second bedroom that he uses for his at home office. I am so proud of him for not only finding a job he enjoys but also putting himself in a position where he can afford all these nice things. Once I came back from my internship about 3 weeks ago everything was back to normal only I wouldn’t be able to visit him as often because his new apartment is a 40min walk from campus. Not a big deal we spent a whole summer apart we can spend less time together too (since I have homework to do).

Fast-forward to last weekend, I was finally able to see our friends because everyone is back for school, so we were going to the bars. The night was a blast, and we ended up coming home at around 2am. I can’t really remember how we started this conversation, but while we were sobering up I told him about how I used to self-harm (punch myself in the stomach because I was gaining weight). I was in tears at this point and he was comforting me. Then it transitioned into him talking about how he thinks about how much more school I have left until I graduate. He brought up past frustrations of me having to retake classes and his concerns of not knowing where he is going to end up (concern about having to move far away for a different job). He stated that he is following success. He also stated that “I’m really pushing it, that I won’t be graduating for another year and a half” and this is something that he thinks about a lot. Then he started crying about how he felt responsible for my lack of performance (which I can’t disagree with to some degree), but I reassured him that it was my fault because it is always going to be up to me to perform in my classes. What really hurt me is that he stated that my internship didn’t matter because it wouldn’t get me that paper saying that I graduated. I lost it at that point because I was crushed to hear this. Like I said before this was something I was so proud of, so I called him out on it. I kept explain to him that this was valuable experience and it will help me with my career. I understand that it is not a requirement for my major, but it will help. Even if I took more than one class this summer I would have still been on the same graduation track. We talked for about 2hrs and it was 4am at this point were we both went to bed. 

Next morning, I felt like I was given an ultimatum. Either I graduate, or he will leave me, which I understand. We both acted like nothing happened for the rest of the day. This is the first time that I have heard his concerns regarding this issue and I’m not sure where to go next with this. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense but it has been on my mind for days now. I can’t help to think that he is embarrassed of me. 

He has since been on a business trip and is now visiting his sister and brother in law. I have been texting him asking about his day and he sends me responses like normal and we are “flirting” like we normally do but he won’t say “I love you” back to me after I text it to him. He won’t acknowledge those texts. I’m sure he is busy with his family since he is also seeing his two nephews. He his close with his very successful brother in law and I’m sure he is talking to him about me. I just can’t shake this feeling that he is just going to break up with me.

TL;DR Boyfriend is concerned about how long it is taking me to graduate stating: “I am pushing it...” after having many drinks. Woke up the next morning not acknowledging the crying conversation that we had 8 hours prior. Reflecting, I feel like he is embarrassed of me and is giving me an ultimatum. Current plan is to keep going with this academic success that I am riding off my one class this summer and prove it to him that I will get it done (over time). Not sure how to proceed. Should I bring it up again? If so, how? "

9fytas,5,2018-09-15,Feels Like I'm Trapped in Hell,Boltcrash5,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/9fytas/feels_like_im_trapped_in_hell/,"So I made this account just to post my story, because I have nobody else to talk to. I'm falling apart and I'm afraid to go into the next day. Life seems more like an ordeal than anything. I should probably explain what got me to this point.

I recently got out of college, and I've been unable to find a job, which is really frustrating. I went into Vet Tech school, but despite getting my certificate, and having an internship on my resume, I still can't get hired. But that's only the beginning of my problems.

About two years ago, I started having an existential crisis that I don't think I've fully recovered from. It started with the death of one of my cats, while I was living away from home, which hurt me pretty hard. I've always been close to my pets, so when they die, it always depresses me. But then, I don't remember what kicked it off, I just started thinking about things, and how they don't last. Then it me: Nothing lasts. My pets will grow old and die, and pretty much none of my possessions will last. Video games will wear out, game systems will wear out, Dvds will wear out, and yet I'll still be alive. And it just adds up and makes it impossible for me to enjoy anything.

Another thing is the loss of shows and things I enjoy. A lot of my time is spent on writing fan fiction, reading it, and stuff like that, since I don't really have any friends. My favorites are the Marvel Cinematic Universe and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (Yes, I know, I swear I don't jack off to it). The latter in particular really surprised me. It's one of the most creative fandoms I've ever seen, with stories, artwork, music, freaking everything. But it's approaching it's ninth season, which I believe is confirmed to be it's last, and people will move on to other things. There's an entire website dedicated solely to fan fiction for that show, and once the show's gone, how long is it gonna last? I've started obsessively downloading every single story I've added to my favorites, but it's taken up over 130 MB, and I don't know how much room I'm gonna have left. Plus, I've seen things like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvMbi3xlhlk), which makes it feel futile. People will stop making these wonderful things and forget about them, and the videos and stuff will vanish from the internet. I also try to drown out my anxiety by watching stuff on youtube, like the Nostalgia Critic and Game Grumps, but then my brain reminds me that eventually, these creators will stop creating. I don't know what's gonna happen to their stuff when they're done, but I'm betting they'll vanish from the internet eventually. Yes, I know it's pathetic to get upset over stuff that's so trivial, but that's all I have.

I'm already in therapy and getting medication, but it doesn't help. I don't see the point. And I hate the philosophy that something is beautiful because it doesn't last. All that does is leave me with cruddy memories of wonderful things that will never come back. Even death doesn't feel like an exit, because I'm afraid of whatever comes next. I'm agnostic, because I've never had that inner feeling that God existed, and I couldn't discount the experiences in other people. But now, my brain won't let me stop worrying about it. Because if there's no afterlife, there's no chance to ever meet my loved ones again. I guess reincarnation wouldn't be so bad, because I wouldn't have memories of the things I've lost, but again, there's no guarantee of that either. My biggest fear is that when you die, you just go to a bottomless black void where noting exists, you can't see, you can't feel, and you can't move. Just alone, for eternity. Even worse is that I can't make myself commit suicide, because my bitch of an older sister and I are pretty much all she has, and even in the depths of my despair, I can't make myself hurt my family. It's like I'm in a living hell, and there's no alternative. I don't know what to do. I need help so badly, but I don't see how anybody can change my circumstances. God, I'm so lost..."
9fz5t7,28,2018-09-15,My greatest manifestation yet!,octoctoct,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/9fz5t7/my_greatest_manifestation_yet/,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share my successful manifestation of an amazing internship! 

So, I am an on-off user of the loa. Recently, I've been off... but just now while revisiting this sub I realized that I haven't been actively thinking of the loa because I've been really busy at the internship that I manifested!

I had been wanting to intern for quiet some time. So I started manifesting at the beggining of this summer. 

I would imagine what my day would be like if I was interning, what I would wear to work and so on. When I went to the shops, I would look for work clothes and I also finished making my profile on a job platform and fixed up my CV. 

I can't remember the exact timeline of things now but soon after I did all that I was contacted by a company for an interview. I was unsure of the position but went to the interview nonetheless. It was awful. The interviewer was late and unprepared and the working environment was less than ideal. Anyway, I turned down their offer even when they increased the salary. 

At first I felt a bit disheartened but after the frustration of that day subsided I felt really optimistic because I had gone through my first ever interview and learnt a lot that I knew would help me in my interview for the perfect internship. It also boosted my confidence that a company had reached out to me and liked me. I had good vibes. 

A little bit later, I was contacted by another company for an amazing internship opportunity. I got the position and I am loving it! 
Although it is coming to the end of my internship there is talk of me staying on part-time if my college schedule makes sense. 

I'm going to the uni today to see what I can do. I know I will get good timings that will allow me to continue working!

It's crazy how I manifested this really amazing experience for myself that has been even better than I thought possible, and didn't even realize it. Now I'm taking time to really feel gratitude for this opportunity that the universe presented me. I never even applied to any jobs I just attracted applications from companies!

I think I was successful because I didn't harp on it. I just imagined it and then carry out actions to get me closer to where I want to be and then forget I ever manifested until I had already been living out my manifestation for weeks!  

I hope this gives you good vibes and makes you believe your manifestations will happen too :)

9fzhu5,8,2018-09-15,Mandy (2018) is exactly what you think it is,YuunofYork,IMDbFilmGeneral,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMDbFilmGeneral/comments/9fzhu5/mandy_2018_is_exactly_what_you_think_it_is/,"[Trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI054ow6KJk).  

*Mandy* is exactly what you think it is.  This is a film that will defy any conventional rating system with even the pretense of objectivity; rather it's better evaluated on your mood that day and tolerance level.  People will either love it, or love it a little less.  Surely destined to be a perennial choice for cult midnight showings in revival theaters, now and a decade from now.  

Speaking of decades, *Mandy*, like Cosmatos' *Beyond the Black Rainbow* before it, also lies squarely in the recent tradition of 80s nostalgia (*Stranger Things*, *Summer of 84*, *Super-8*, etc.), only instead of Spielberg and Lucas, here it’s metal, satanic panic, and the slasher.  That’s not to say it’s derivative - the truth couldn’t be farther from.  It bathes in its inspirations, from the buckets of blood and the unsubtle villainy of Linus Roach, down to the guitar-shaped axe Cage forges with his own tears.  It's a modern metal opera, and the omnipresent, swelling musical score is a character unto itself.  
 
The film’s a trip, and its highs are *so* high, but the marrying of a Bronson revenge flick with a visceral 2-hour tone poem is an aspect vital to the film that limited my enjoyment in unexpected ways (mild spoilers here but not really since this is a revenge film and there is only one protagonist not named Nic Cage, you do the math).  &gt;!I knew the plot from the trailer and from its influences, that Riseborough's character would be the kicked puppy early in the film, but I didn't figure how much she'd continue to have a presence and impact in the film, and so was unprepared to mourn Mandy for the entire duration, to feel pain on the level of a fucking Cagegasm after every joyous baddie dispatch.  I think ‘rollercoaster’ is a misnomer for the distribution I ended up with; I’ve never had one of those.  The net result of this emotional dissonance is simply that the glorious carnage I came to see was ultimately tempered for the rest of the runtime and just never allowed me to enjoy its potential.  No doubt the more acutely sociopathic or the jaded horror aficionados among us won’t suffer this problem.  At least when 80s Action Man lost his wife and family it was at the 5 min mark and we mercifully never even learned their names.  But *Mandy* is smarter and much more emotionally complex than those examples.  Cage can’t go three minutes without re-experiencing his wife’s skull sift through his hand like sand, and so neither can the viewer.!&lt;  This intrudes even into the many moments of situational comedy throughout the movie.  Cosmatos is kind of a prick like that.  

The point of this film is mood, its positives and its negatives.  The kid I bought the ticket from even went glassy eyed for a moment, like he’d just discovered the remains of his childhood dog in the fridge that morning, ground up into a mango Lassie, and he only realized it when he sucked an eyeball through the straw; he repeated the title, and managed to whistle through his nose, like I was in for a treat, but it wasn’t genuine.  I think that nose whistle was a vain attempt to reconnect to the rest of the human race he'd been ripped from on preview night, and that what was really being comnunicated was, I was in for an experience.  That, or he had catalogued mass graves for UNESCO during his summer internship, but it fits the facts.  

So is any of that even a negative?  Not in terms of the filmmaking, no, it’s necessary and earned.  Is it a problem with enjoying oneself? - quite likely.  It’s a really uncomfortable and disorienting watch that nevertheless contains all the things people wanted and expected out of the trailer.  For me I’d say it falls somewhere between *Oldboy* and *Salo* in terms of rewatchability.  I can’t really come up wih a rating I feel is satisfactory, so 8/10 is just on gut.  It's a beautifully-made expression of joy and joylessness, the best of its kind, but the extent to which that is appealing is entirely on the viewer.  

I think the most interesting thing for me regarding the story, which is as bare bones as it gets, was its refusal to reveal itself as truly supernatural.  I appreciated that there’s enough in throw-away lines and drug-induced ‘battle vision’ to offer the viewer a choice whether Cage is really dealing with a renegade gang of Manson cultists, or the devil’s own (I vote cultists).  Either way it culminates in a descent into hell, whatever its nature, that is real enough.  "

It's for a Systems/Software Engineering position. I was wondering if anyone who's worked/interned at Rockwell Collins could tell me about their experiences.

So I finished university 4 months ago with a degree in a area that I have no absolute no interest in. Honestly, the only reason I didn't drop out was I would have absolute nothing going for me in my life, so I kept lying to myself and telling myself it's gonna get better....... it didn't. By the end I had lost all interest and was barley going to class but still managed to pass with slightly above average grades. I hated the course and university the entire time I was there, no doubt they were the worst 3 years of my life I reconected with a girl from high school who transferred into my course who ended up basically using me to get over her ex, then ditched when she couldn't get over him for another guy who is very similar to her ex (not my proudest moment) and had almost 0 friends at university (We don't live at university in Australia, go there like you would go to school and go home). I didn't go to the graduation ceremony, despite my parents pleading me to go and take them because they felt I had achieved something important. Honestly, I didn't think it was a much of a achievement at all. I (who I would describe as average intelligence at most, who was usually surrounded by lazy kids throughout high school who made me look way smarter than I actually am) spent 3 years half assing it and still finished with above average grades... What does that say about the course and the type of people doing it?  

Anyways, fast forward to now. I have no clue what the hell I'm going to do with my life, I see all my friends and people around me moving forwards in their lives, weather it's getting new jobs in their fields, getting into new relationships, starting their own businesses or travelling the world or getting internships in amazing countries. While I am exactly where I was years ago, working at a part time retail job making half decent money while I continue to live at home with my parents like a total looser. 

I know they say you should be happy to see other people succeed, and most times I am, especially when I see my friends succeeding. But it doesn't mean it doesn't make me feel like absolute worthless piece of trash. I wouldn't say I'm depressed (I would know, I studied it!!) but very close to it. Some days are just sooo bad. I feel miserable all day and exhausted without having done anything, frustrated, angry and in shitty moods constantly and usually taking it out on my family members (with whom my relationships have slowly deteriorated). 

I have a small but good group of friends (which im cool with but find it diffcult to open up about this kinda stuff) and I'm constantly trying to expand my friendship groups, but it's super difficult when you're pissed off and exhausted 24/7 not to mention meeting new girls with this attitude usually sets me up for spectacular failures.

I've been reading and listening to self help books daily trying to improve myself as a person and love myself, but it's just soo hard and I can't understand why. Have no idea what the hell I'm meant to do with my life (only ideas I have usually tend to be unrealistic or childish) and feel like I have accomplished nothing in my life (or at least what a imagined I would've accomplished by now). Feel like a total failure compared to people around me and a major disappointment to my parents. My life is nothing like what I want it to be and I am nothing like what I know deep down I am capable of. Any advice on what the actual fuck I can do to turn my life around  and live a happier life and figure out what the hell I'm meant to do with my life??? Major thanks to anyone in advance who read my long ass post, much appreciated. U da real MVP!"

9g264n,7,2018-09-15,In limerence with (straight) close friend,nav992,limerence,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/9g264n/in_limerence_with_straight_close_friend/,"Title says it all.

Last year, I started my new job. I was hired as an intern and my LO started his job with me. 
During my 6 months internship, me and LO were like coworkers ""friend"" - like occasional talk here and there and sometimes a cup of tea together. I never really liked him during that time, I used find him quite arrogant and a show off. 

However, things changed drastically after internship. He initiated close friendship - by calling me after work, basically asking me out for  his errands during lunch time. We used to talk for hours - and at one point I speculated that he might be gay too.

His interacts with me peaked during October- December past year, he was constantly calling me after office (even though we used to spend almost 9 hours in the same office space), telling me about his personal stuff. However, he never ever talked about his relationships  and he behaved oddly during any conversation related to sex. 

All of this lead me to think that he was interested me and I basically fell for him. But starting of this year, he started hanging out with other coworkers and started to make other connections. I felt ignored and totally shattered. This led to much drama, me going mad at him - and him trying to explain that I am reacting  over stupid and silly stuff.

Currently we still are friends, we still call each other once and in a while, he cares for me in the sense that whenever I am not well or I need something, he shows huge concern. 

But he and I are no longer as close as we were. It drivers me mad. Basically I feel drained when he is not around (during weekends specially), I long for his phone call. I hyperfocus on his interactions with me and I get jealous when he talks about  his other friends. I am prone to mood swings when he's around and I still overreact over stupid stuff. 

I cannot get total no contact with him since he's a close friend and we work together and share set of common friends. I cannot tell him I have feelings for him since I live in India and it is a conservative society. 

I don't know how to deal with this and I really hate it."
9g26qa,843,2018-09-15,The whole “first in the family to go to college” is annoying as fuck,throwawaycgdcs,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/9g26qa/the_whole_first_in_the_family_to_go_to_college_is/,"My sister told me, “That’s so crazy how I’m the first person in our family to go to a university,” and I told her not to say stupid shit like that. I don’t care how rude it was, but it made her shut up and she hasn’t said anything of the sort since. I understand it may feel like something to be proud of, but it’s pretty fucked up and self-centered to even think about, especially considering her upbringing compared to ours (siblings).

She’s not the oldest nor the youngest (I’m the youngest), and she’s been pretty much babied her whole fucking life. Our mom paid for literally everything for her, she literally only cleaned twice in her whole life up to 22 years old, and to this day, being a whole ass married and having a part-time job while going to uni, our mom STILL pays her fucking phone bill. Her bullshit excuse was, “I have to pay for my kids’ things if they’re in college.”

Bitch, WHAT? I was paying for my own phone bill in college, my own food, my own phone, and pretty much everything. Even in HIGH SCHOOL, I bought my own fucking bed frame, mattress, desk, and bookshelves. I even had to clean my own sister’s fucking room one too many times because it was almost always a fucking junkyard. It was only when I got older did I pretty much tell my mom, “Fuck you, pay me to clean up after her mess.”

My sister never had to work a day in her life until she was 21 or whatever, and even while she worked part-time after finish community college before going to a university...our mom paid for everything. And my sister spent literally all of her money on clothes and eating at restaurants and fast food joints. Didn’t even save a pretty damn dime for uni. It’s why she has to work part-time for much less now. 

Meanwhile, I was busting my ass as a computer science major and our mom constantly gave me shit for everything, blamed me for everything even my sister’s mess, and pressured me to work and pay bills. I thought that maybe I could get an internship and still go to school, but that only added more stress.

I’ve never done anything wrong, yet most of the pressure has always been on me, which always led to us fighting. 

So I had to fucking drop out of college to work full-time because I had my eyes set on saving up and moving out to avoid the pressure. The rest of my siblings (all much older) have also had to work and navigate through struggles, so none of them finished even community college just like me.

So it pissed me the fuck OFF when our sister said she was the first to go to uni like it’s something to be sooo proud of when she receive special treatment her whole motherfucking life. Fuck that shit.

I’m still pissed about it because I wanted to get my bachelors in computer science, but I couldn’t. This would have been my last year, yet I’m working to make six figures by this coming spring so I won’t feel far behind from my high school peers who are in their last year of college. And I want to show and tell people in my similar position, “It’s possible, but it’s going to fucking suck for a while. Either just as bad, not as bad, or worse, but I’m telling you it’s possible.” 

Since dropping out of college, I became homeless for a moment, nearly trapped in an abusive “relationship,” was throw into so much debt because of my abusive ex, and considered suicide one too many times. There was a time I only had $70 and no job (lost my first real one because of my ex) and considered prostitution for just a short while to get money, but I found out I was pregnant and only wanted to die at that point, and then I had a miscarriage. It wasn’t until then that I thought, “Fuck this. This is MY life,” found a good job, and moved out of the state to fully take control and escape my abusive “relationship.”

I’d probably be the biggest asshole right now if I wasn’t making good (not great) money for my age and living on my own, and it’s all because I’ve been working my ass off to climb to the top and putting pure skill into my craft.

It sucks having to put college on hold, but such is life when you have to put work first because you’re not fed with a fucking platinum spoon covered in diamonds.

So fuck that “wow, I was the first to go to uni” bullshit.

EDIT: I appreciate all of your support and letting me know to be proud of myself, especially pointing out my resentment and bitterness. I don’t like feeling that this especially when it comes to family, so having it being told to me will definitely help me reflect on my accomplishments and attitude toward things more. Thank you so much, and I’m sorry this post is so long!"

Some brief back story, I had an boyfriend for a year and  7 months. He was charming, great and really wonderful at the start. It deteriorated after a few months. He started to gaslight me, say I was stupid, my clusmy-ness is a huge problem, say I did nothing for him, I was good enough for him and that I'm lucky to have him for putting him through my busy days at school. I am a quadruple fellow undergraduate in Chemistry and English, have a research fellowship and have to consistently go out of state for conferences for it. I'd have to do research reports, presentations, I have now published twice and currently going under my third. He would torture me. He said I was awkward and that's why I never had friends; that I was too busy for him even though I would make time for him almost everyday, he said I was dumb and an idiot for minor things, he would get mad if I'm late by 2 minutes from work because I should know better.... etc 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think he'd affect my academic and work performance. He would fight with me for around 6-8 hours, then proceed to get angry when I would study for some time after. He said there was a curfew with my studying and group studying was more of a date so I had no friends. He would not let me study without giving me the silent treatment and ignoring me for hours. He said I always prioritized work and that he would prioritize me. For a lot of my conference and out of state opportunities, I canceled them because he wouldn't be able to go. If I was to have one, I had to let him know months ahead of time to buy his ticket and have him sleep in my hotel. When we first started dating, it started very fast. We were only 2 months into a relationship and I was leaving to an internship at a national laboratory (summer 2017). He said he would end it if I left without him. So, I brought him with me. Little did I know, he was going to abuse me every day for my late work days, if I made a simple mistake of looking the wrong way, if I didn't have time to clean (I worked 40+ hours and continously ran experiments). He would psychologically hurt me by saying he fantasized about his ex. He would ignore me if I didn't introduce him to others. He would guilt trip me to not do my work on the weekends and I often got in trouble with my bosses for late data. After that internship, he moved in with me. I paid his side of the rent even though he had some money saved and I only make 10k a year. I paid to show that I loved him. He denied it and said that me helping him financially didn't mean I loved him. So, I would spend a lot of time trying to cook his favorite dishes (lobster, shrimp etc) and write poetic pieces for him for his approval of my love. It never was enough. I wasn't enough. I was always ridiculed for my attempts and even after arguments, I would make some favorite meal of his just to be told ""You never do this when we don't fight"". I ALWAYS did. I cooked almost everyday. 

That following fall 2017 semester was torturous. I lost so many opportunities in terms of my travel. I was supposed to go to an award ceremony because I won a research award. I lied and said I was sick because he did not approve of where it was. It was on a cruise ship at night. He said someone would hit on me and if I really loved him, I wouldn't do it. We got into a huge fight and the police were called. That semester, I had a very difficult courseload. I needed to study consistently. I don't understand concepts very well so I have to study a lot in comparison to my counterparts. He would mock me for this. I did his classes, cooked and paid rent. He argued about my financial hole and said I was reckless. I only made 1000 a month, 800 goes to rent and the last 200 dollars went to my cell-phone bill, his gym member ship etc. I was never appreciated. He later stopped letting me study. I couldn't study without him hating on me and giving me the silent treatment. He argued with me everyday before  a very important exam, we argued for hours. The worst was when he argued the day before: He made me cry for 6 hours, I only studied for 3 and he criticized me for it. I went to the exam depressed. I thought I did well but I was severely depressed. That weekend was my birthday weekend and he made it miserable. He said I was a brat to ever think that it was a special day. I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him. I didn't even get a gift or affection. The next day I got my test score. Significantly below average. I was in the C range in the class. I immediately walked out and cried. I dropped the class knowing I would end up having to take my 5th year for him. I knew I lost it all. I knew that my heavy heart and mind was being attacked. He said it was my fault. He ruined my self-esteem by saying he didn't have me fail that exam. In reality, he really did. I wasn't allowed to study and if I did, I got hell on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

 In summer 2018, I was going back to that lab but he said he would leave me if I went. So although I was supplied a location, he objected. I went against my mentor and boss's wishes to soothe him and went to a city 1 hour away from the lab instead in the area. He had me like a puppet with the trauma bonding. I tried to show my love always. I got into a lot of trouble at work for shooting my bosses down. I disappointed my mentor who helped me move forward in life. I was devastated. I thought he would see my love when I went against my mentors. He invalidated me and said that's what I should do for a relationship. I would be devastated from the attacks of my mentors for my mistakes. I would cry to him and tell him it hurts so much to disappoint them. He told me I was selfish for crying about this and that I could not speak about it again or he would threaten to leave me isolated away from my work. I was silent. I would do his classes too to prove my love when he said that I was selfish, he got A's. I worked 40 hours, cooked, cleaned, wrote reports and took two of his online classes. His reasoning was that I was the reason why he had to take online courses. I was the one that ruined it, I have been doing his coursework all the time and tutor him. I even allowed him to sleep with other people because he felt that he was missing out on his 20s. I was NOT allowed to do the same. I allowed him to cheat on me. I was getting drained and he didn't understand why.

 He wouldn't let me text my male friends and he isolated me from my friends. My colleagues ignored me because they did not like me for what I did that summer. I think it was because they knew about my abusive relationship. I did not have friends for two years and I was not allowed to talk to my brother without his permission. I could not hang out with anyone longer than 3 hours because it took away from out time. I was stuck in an area away from my friends, family and colleagues. I was in hell. 

Once I came back, it continued even more so. His abuse became too obvious that my brother kicked him out when he realized how much damage I was receiving. I ran after my partner and left my family. My partner still said that I was in the wrong and that I caused this. I let them see the way he was acting. In brief, he told me we should do our own thing, abandoned me at a panera, turned off his phone and blocked me. I thought it was over. I packed his things and my brother realized my sadness. I told him that my boyfriend just disappeared and packed his valuables. I told him what he did. My brother realized the situation. Once my partner arrived back after 7 hours, he messaged me and said ""I didnt mean it to seem like a break up"". But, my brother was angry. He kicked him out. I ran away with him. I thought that was enough to show that I'd leave my family for him. It wasn't. He would guilt trip me, have me cry for hours, humiliate me in front of his family. I cried every night. I wasn't allowed to speak to my family. I couldn't have them message me bc he would see it and had access to my email... That week... I went to domestic abuse program at my school. I talked about the abuse and that I wanted to leave. I couldn't do it anymore, I was getting weaker and my patience for him was leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a shelter with my friend for that friday, told my family I was ending it. I did it over the phone and when I said I was far away. He never contacted me again since that day.

&amp;#x200B;

I cried so much. I tried to help him with his problems and listened to his vulnerability. I gave him a home and made him my world. Now, I miss him. I can't stop thinking about how alone I am, I don't want to get back with him but I miss his presence. I have had a few people ask me out during the past few weeks after our breakup. I declined because I know I am in such a bad state of mind. I didn't want to get into a relationship again with someone who would abuse me. I deleted my fb and blocked his accounts. One day I looked him up and saw that he seemed happy in his photos. I am suffering. I can't cope. I found friends but they don't understand why i'm struggling to recover. I am in the victim empowerment program. I love him endlessly... I miss him but I needed to focus on my future because he was taking it away.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; abusive partner for years took away parts of my work, family and friends. I finally left and now I miss him endlessly. I am envious of his ""current happiness"" because I am struggling to recover. I am scared to interact with people without feeling like he is watching. I am afraid about dating. I can't focus at work or school. I am losing my mind. I know I can't go back or call him. I know what's best. But I cherished and did so much for him, I forgot to love myself. Now I am trying to get my sanity and get backon trackwith my fellowships. I have missed multiple deadlines and haven't focused on upcoming scholarships and homework. It has been hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to help and move forward? I do yoga with family, I try to be positive and focus on academia, I participate in programs for domestic abuse but I am empty and feel so alone.  I feel so lost. Please help.

I would like to hear from locals regarding the tech scene in Vancouver. Do you think it is growing or shrinking?  Do you see professional opportunities increasing or more IT professionals looking elsewhere for better opportunities? Obviously some commute into Portland for work. But it would be nice to work on WA side when possible.

&amp;#x200B;

We're planning a move to Vancouver/Camas. It seems some companies are setting up shop on the WA side in need of tech staff. While I'll be working remotely in IT (software engineer), I wonder what the local scene is like? Do most still cross the bridge into Portland for work? My son will also be majoring in Computer Science and attending Clark College initially while looking for summer internships, etc... before transferring to a WA university.

Thanks,

9g3tlx,1,2018-09-15,25 M4F Office sex (10+ Ideas inside),mjd931,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9g3tlx/25_m4f_office_sex_10_ideas_inside/,"Hey there, I am Michael 25 from London England and I love the idea of office sex, maybe it's the sexy office attire women can wear maybe it's the idea of bending a woman over a desk or perhaps it's sneaky sex in the stationary cupboard anyway I love it. Here are some ideas we can go with.


- I am the boss and you are my best friends daughter and I get you a job and you are very thankful or you are shit at it and don't want to lose your job etc 

- Perhaps we are already a thing and you're about to leave next week and we want something sexy one last time, so we decide to just fuck in your office so everyone can see

- I am your boss and I find some sexy toys in your draws and I confront you about it

- I am the bosses son and thats the only reason I am there, you have worked hard to get there and really want that promotion and want me to drop out and find a way to make me 

- You are an intern during the summer and really wanna stay on, you come into my office to plead your case but I tell you we are keeping you, you're so thankful you decide to show me how much.

- Perhaps I don't work there, you're my girlfriend who I am visiting and you're so sorry I don't see you very much so you decide to treat me to some office sex in your bosses office

- Me and you are both up for the free trip to Miami and I am winning, you want that trip more than anything so you decide to ask me to bow out the only way you know how

- You're my boss and you've worked me so hard lately, one evening I am in your office and you ask me to take some rest and I fall asleep, I wake up to you touching yourself

- You're new to the office and want to get a promotion, whats the easiest way to that, Work? Fuck no? Fuck you're way to the top

- There is a new position opening up when I leave, but I have been asked to select out of you three, (You'd be playing three characters) and you all want the job so bad, one of you decided to help her case and the other two heard and wanted to even the playing field.


THIS IS MY FAVE AND LAST IDEA

- I am the new mailboy who is nerdy and nervous and I am doing my first rounds of the day meeting loads of new people, I head into an office and you play two (Or 1 ) women in that office, I go in and they immediately take a liking to me and keep staring at me as I walk in. There are two desks and a load of holes in the wall for letters, I spend some time there putting each letter in the correct hole, the two of them who are hot and big titted decide to tease me and make me even more nervous and see how big I am in my trousers and decide to fuck me :)  


I hope you made it to the end, below I will be putting my kinks, come find me and we can chat about it or maybe decide another idea.

 

Clothed sex, I love women in over the knee boots and leather clothing,

I love sneaky sex, so maybe one of them sliding their foot up my leg at dinner or having some fun the the coat room.

Public sex too, as with sneaky sex, maybe we end up at an after party and were sitting on the couch and you put a blanket over us and you play with me.

Blue balls and teasing, I would love you to tease me, make me hard as hell and then say no by walking off, make me as hard and want it so much that I want to take it.

Bending women over, I love the idea of eventually bending a woman over, weather it be bending them over a pool table, a desk of having them on all fours for me.

Dirty talk, I want to hear you say my name, I want you to tell me every little dirty thing you're going to do to me........

9g3zvz,2,2018-09-15,My (21m) relationship with my (20f) gf is getting really strained due to alot of different circumstances,ranven,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9g3zvz/my_21m_relationship_with_my_20f_gf_is_getting/,"So I've been dating this girl for about 4 months now and thing are going great in terms of personality compatibility. However, her mom is extremely nosey. My gf and I both attend the same college and she lives off campus in a single apartment. 

Her mom lives in the same state but far away. The issue is that she came over to stay with her for 2 weeks and those two weeks were hell for my gf and I. Not only did we not get to see each other but her mother is extremely judgemental and controlling of her behavior and made her cry multiple times.

Now her mother is apparently going to try and stay longer than the initial  2 weeks, perhaps this entire semester. My gf spent yesterday night crying in her bathroom because she knows she won't be able to stay out with her friends or see me or do anything other than work and school until her mom leaves. (Her mom checks her location from her phone and also check her Snapchat and asks her to snap where she is)

I've been extremely supportive of my gf through this but I'm honestly not sure I want to continue this relationship due to other reasons as well. 

My gf might be going across the country for an internship opportunity for 5 months and we most likely will not be able to see each other because I'll be busy as well.

Also, while this might sound superficial, I'm not completely sexually satisfied in our relationship mostly due to her having other mental issues in that department. She doesn't reciprocate orally despite me making her very satisfied with it and also is afraid to do or say anything that makes her feel promiscuous.

I really don't know what to do here because this is the first time I ever formed an emotional connection with a girl. With every other girl I've been with, if the circumstances became difficult or the sex wasn't great I broke it off instantly.

While these issues don't bother me now, im afraid that they will most likely make me resent her. Is it worth trying to continue this relationship when the circumstances of it make it difficult to do so?

TL;DR 

i love my gf and she makes me happy but I'm also not comfortable with trying to start a long distance relationship and I'm also not completely sexually satisfied."
9g429j,0,2018-09-15,please pray for me,ashrek1,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/9g429j/please_pray_for_me/,"this is going to a little long the writing will probably be janky and broken I'm sorry but please read this.

I am currently in the processes of applying for a data science internship that i really want to do last year i applied and made to to the final 300 possible applicants but ultimately didn't make it. It hurt me deeply but god has done so much for me this year I now understand and am glad i didn't get accepted last year.

I went to an amazing youth camp called Chrysalis(a youth version of emmaus by the upper room) it was amazing just 3 days worth of pure love and learning about god, i went in not believing going because i was forced to after 5 hours i was torn down and broken the rest of the weekend was a constant cycle of breaking down and rebuilding. Now I'm trying to have a good relationship with god I'm not always winning i have so many bad habits that I'm trying to break. I don't have any christian friends (my church is in an old age home so there was never really any youth there.) so its not overly easy to stay on the path but my heart is still overflowing with his love. that weekend meant the world to me and renewed my heart and spirit. my friend also lost his leg due to a hit and run and i was able to be there with him every step of the way from icu (his parents lie to the nurses and told them i was his brother) to rehab.
i wouldn't have had the opportunity if i got in since id be living somewhere else if i got in. God has been so good to me this year and I'm truly grateful that i didn't get accepted.

that weekend i camp i went on the day i got back home i was emailed that they recommended i reapply my mom felt this was a sign. I reapplied and my aptitude tests were good enough to pass phase one. on Monday i start phase 2 and I'm scared i want this so much it could change my life, i trust god now and if i don't get it i know it means he still has plans for my life. I'll praise him regardless but the bible says ask for what you want and this is what i want.

what i ask of you people please pray for me. pray for me to get this data science internship god can change and move the hearts of people if he see's fit I'm an example of that this year. 
also i ask please pray that i manage to break my besetting sin that I've had for years and am trying to break

tldr(want to learn they didn't want me and god had other plans for me changed my heart and mind over this year, i want to learn at the same place again and start my second testing phase for this place on monday i really want to get in and am asking for prayer to get in and to break my besetting sin's)

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9g6hd5,100,2018-09-15,Last Stuff To Talk About,arielzao150,humblebundles,https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/9g6hd5/last_stuff_to_talk_about/,"I'm an intern at the moment, but on October 1^(st) I'm getting hired and I will no longer have time to do the giveaways here.

It's been a really difficult month, and I feel like shit. For the past 3 years I had been dating this girl, and she broke up with me a month ago. I'm ok with the break up, but the she was basically my only friend throughout all this time. I've been feeling so fucking lonely. It's so hard to stay alone at home, not speaking to anyone, not even digitally. I know I have people that care for me and love me, but at times like these I just feel unwanted anywhere I am. All of this affected me being a mod here, since I just had no will to mod this sub and do the Challenges and ah...I hope you guys can understand all of this, because I know I'm not being able to express myself right now.

So yeah, apart from feeling like shit and awful and lonely and unwanted, there is something that's been the light of my days: God. And yeah, I know how the internet is with religion and all that, but I just really feel like I need to say this. I have been a Christian since I was born, but I truly believe in God, and ever since the break up I have been drawing closer to God every day. Dudes, I know how shit life can get, and I am probably going through one of the worst moments of my life yet, and being Christian and following Jesus is not a way to makes things easier, but it's **the** way to make things better, and not only better, but the best! I don't really have any message to write to you guys, but if you are curious in any way, or if you are feeling hopeless (like I usually do), or if you don't know who to talk about your doubts about God, I am here for you. I may not be the best guy for instructing you in any way, but I can promise you that I will do my best to do so.

Anyway, as I'm leaving as a mod and won't be doing any giveaways any longer, I will need someone in my place. So if you are interested in being a mod and doing giveaways here, feel free to message me.

Thank you guys for everything, and thank you for letting me do everything I wanted here. I really loved doing the giveaways, and even more the challenge, but I just won't have time for it anymore. I need time to focus on my life, make new friends, study for college, and learn the way that God wants me to take. Just being a mod didn't take that much time, but the giveaways always take way too long to finish, and I would have to do it on Saturday from now on (all day \[yeah, it takes that long\]).

Ok, I need to wrap this up. I will make the next giveaway as well (on Saturday), but I want it to be the last one. God bless you guys, and don't forget to hit me up if you want to be a mod. PEACE!"

9g70jx,23,2018-09-15,Getting back on track after several years of spiritual burn-out.,agh151,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/9g70jx/getting_back_on_track_after_several_years_of/,"A bit of backstory, since I feel it's relevant. I (24 F) grew up going to Baptist/nondenominational church, but was saved around the age of 14. After graduating high school, I moved across the country to Texas to intern with a Christian missions organization for a year, then decided to do another year with them a few months later. I felt the Lord wanted me there full time, so I set about trying to raise financial support for the next three years, during which time I worked as an office manager and did bookkeeping for my local church.

I never had one person pledge to support me during those three years, and it was extremely difficult - but the organization said I could go ahead and come back, as they needed the help. I happily moved back to Texas...

... only to leave after just *one year* (about two months ago). Being there full time was different than my time as an intern in a lot of ways. Still a great group, great mission - but I just felt so drained and stuck; every day I hated waking up and going to the office. I stopped going to church and prayer meetings altogether, realized I hadn't read my Bible or really had a personal practice of my faith in years. I guess I had started to associate church with work, and it lost a lot of meaning for me.

So now, here I am in a new area, with no connections or family close by. No church group. No job even, until this past week. I started to become depressed due to lack of social interaction, and got really existential. Specifically, the thought of death terrified me, and I went through a lot of re-studying what I actually believe and why, which has led me to a kind of clean slate, where I can start getting back into my faith with the correct mindset and hopefully move forward and continue to grow spiritually. Even praying and remembering/reconfirming that there is a spiritual realm was a HUGE thing for me.

I plan on going to church for the first time in over a year tomorrow; I'm excited to be digging into things again and regaining a proper perspective.

If you've made it this far, I can't thank you enough for listening. I guess my question is, as I kind of find my way out of this ~4 year spiritual and mental fog, what are some ""baby"" steps I can take? Where do I start? How do I work through certain doubts, such as the difference between simple human emotion and the actual work of God in our lives?

I know there's a lot to unpack in my novel, but thank you in advance.

TL:DR - I'm a Christian, but after working for several years in church and missions, I ended up focusing only on the work aspect, which caused my spiritual life to decline and basically vanish. It got to the point that I hadn't read the Bible or prayed on a personal level in years, stopped going to church, prayer meetings, etc. Moving forward from this 4 year fog, just moved to a new area, with a secular job. How do I go about rebuilding my spiritual life?"
9g7oto,2,2018-09-15,Considering becoming a CFP. Where would I start?,Darclite,CFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFP/comments/9g7oto/considering_becoming_a_cfp_where_would_i_start/,"So I've been reading more and more about becoming a CFP, and it looks like something that very much suits my goals. But I'm getting bogged down in all the things that come with it, and was wondering how I should proceed.

For context: I am 24, live in New York City, and have an Economics degree. My work experience includes my current work for a nonprofit handling mostly development and bookkeeping (1 year, full time), my previous job for a publishing agency doing bookkeeping and handling rights/contracts (4 years, 2 full time), working as an administrative assistant/bookkeeper for an attorney (4 years, part time), and working as an intern for a city council office (1 year, part time). On the side, I've done a decent amount of canvassing/fundraising for political campaigns and have managed the budget and production of some theatre productions. I'm also about to take a bookkeeping course at NYU my current employer is paying for, and when I'm done with that in ~6 weeks this is what I'm looking to proceed to

So basically, what I'm wondering is: What path would you recommend, and how would you recommend going down that path? 

Do I try to find a company to hire me as an apprentice/associate who will pay for my training/certification? Is this common and/or feasible?

Are there any businesses you suggest applying to work for, and is there something that I can do in an application or interview to put me ahead?

Do I just start studying right now for the exam and start hunting after I have the certification and work elsewhere in the meantime?

Should I pursue a company that also handles insurance sales or something like that?

Should I first take another exam or pursue another certification (e.g. Series 65)?

Will the CFP certification make me able to safely become and remain employed, and at the start, make close to median income (like in general, not for CFPs)? 

Is there any general advice you have?

Perhaps a strange question: does my experience and background lend itself to something similar that would be more ideal?

Another: I've applied for positions at NY Life and NW Mutual, and the recruiters were very enthusiastic about bringing me in. Should I be wary of this? Had the feel of an MLM (I'm assuming I'd be paid on commission for insurance or something with no base salary.)

Sorry this is long. I'd really appreciate any help."
9g7p9o,1,2018-09-15,[M4F] Seeking a girl to indulge my lipstick fetish in one of these simple starter ideas. Leave your mark!,this-ismyname999,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9g7p9o/m4f_seeking_a_girl_to_indulge_my_lipstick_fetish/,"Hey. I think lipstick is fucking sexy. And it only gets hotter when a girl leaves her mark on some lucky guy. So here are some brief starter ideas off the top of my head. I’m more than open to any tweaks, twists, and turns you'd like to throw or add to them. Just warning that I'm fairly vanilla, and not interested in much that's illegal/nonconsenual. Also please forgive me dipping in and out of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person mid sentence. 





You catch your boyfriend cheating and storm over to his apartment to get your things and get a little revenge. I'm his loyal BFF and roommate who he hurriedly begged to ""protect his shit"" before bailing, unable to face you. So we're alone together for the first time. There's a few ways this can go, but the general idea is that he was very possessive of you. It'd kill him to see your favorite lipstick smeared on another guy, much less his BFF. You could take my phone while you're riding me on the couch and text him ""She's gone. Door unlocked. I got pizza."" and then laugh to yourself and ask me to bend you over towards the doorway.



It's almost Christmas, so I'll go ahead and throw in a Mistletoe Party. This could be a neighborhood/suburbs affair thing, with a younger guy home from college and a bunch of horny, wild MILFs wearing red lipstick and hanging out under the mistletoe. The queen of the suburb would definitely want to re-introduce herself to this young man, and then walk around the party with him wearing her smooches across his cheek and neck. Or an office party, with the boss taking his fill of his employee's wives and somewhat cucking them, parading with different color lipstick kisses on his cheek, almost like collecting trophies from the women married to his subordinates. Fuck, that's kinda hot. Another twist could be the Boss' Naughty Slut Daughter. I could end up under the mistletoe with her before I recognize her. You'd purr at me, lying, ""Oh, I'm a new accounting intern"" as you plant another couple kisses along my jawline and glance across the room to see if Daddy notices yet. I don't want to get fired, so we could go somewhere more private, but then your pretty red lips would get a little more… messy.



Rainbow Party - you might remember this as some urban legend from Oprah. But it's been a fantasy of mine for a while. One version went that three girls invite three guys over. Each girl wears a different color lipstick, and sinks to her knees and starts sucking. After some time, each girl switches to another guy, then again to the final. So by the end, if each girl did their part right, each guy's cock would have three distinct different colored lipstick rings. Then I guess they can pick their favorite and cum in their mouth, or they keep trading until they cum, or it just turns into an orgy after that. But the idea of getting different shades of lipstick on my cock and somehow showing it off has always been a massive turn on and fantasy. This doesn't have to be a multiple girl character thing, it could totally be one girl who changes outfits/lipsticks/looks maybe throughout a night or party or something. 



Deepthroat Contest - Okay, backing up, this one is kind of a multiple character thing. There's not much to this - it could be two best friends, roommates, sisters, coworkers, whoever arguing over who can take more dick in their mouth. I'd be just any passing waiter or lucky dude that happens to be nearby. Maybe I'm someone that they know is ""notorious"" for being hung, since they know they need a long dick to prove themselves. Of course, the only way to prove where the girls' lips have been would be for both to put on a generous amount of some bold color lipstick…





Sci-Fi / Future / Fantasy / Vagueness - This is a bit of a last catch-all. I said I was kind of vanilla, but I do like some of this weird stuff. I had a hot prompt and couple stories go about mind control lipstick. I also wouldn't mind some kind of lipstick that makes the kiss-ee unbearably horny, or possibly one that enhances cum production when kissed onto a lucky man's nutsack. I also had another recent one about a sorority witch coven with spell casting lipstick and stuff that had some fun. 




Anyways, I hope any of this catches someone's eye. Part of this is just organizing my own thoughts and some ideas I could make into better, bigger, more full-fledged prompts. These are all aimed at women players, but I'm always open to messages from anyone just to chat about lipstick fetish/story ideas.

9g88rd,2,2018-09-16,Business Analyst vs Financial Analyst? NEED CAREER ADVICE [CAN],GeneralTsoChikn,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9g88rd/business_analyst_vs_financial_analyst_need_career/,"So I'm in a dilemma. I'm currently a Math and business student in university, and have had both experiences as internships during univerisity. I'd like advice on the prospectice career path I should consider with consideration to things like work/life balance, salary and work environment. Here's my experience (but as a paid intern) so far....


As a business analyst in Toronto at RBC, the analytical side of it and working with the business users and developers was neat. I saw the full timers get super busy with meetings, planning and projects associated with the systems so it sure looks demanding. Sadly, as a co-op, I found they didn't need a co-op on the team, so my role went from BA to a QA and I essentially just did a bunch of boring testing. I guess my own experience isn't what a true BA would do, but based on what I saw my team apart of, its a lot of diverse work, and lots to learn. The team however, can sometimes be a bit stale (i.e. very introverted, not really ""fun"" and predominately older). I've had two business analyst roles in two different Toronto banks, and work was similiar (i.e. suporting business users with the systems they used while working with developers).


I've also had a Financial Management Reporting role at an insurance company. I saw a major difference in the environment and work ethic. They had me involved in month end tasks, but also business day tasks at the start of each month and I was happy to be very busy. The only issue was that I found repetitiveness in the tasks I did (mindless entries/reporting) which was stale compared to what I did as a BA (analyzing different issues/bugs). This may also have been due to the fact that I was a co-op, and didn't get the actual in depth analyst work. This has me worried because I always thought I'd like the accounting route and would get my CPA, but is this really what a Financial Analyst is like?

Now on to the pay. Personally, this is an important factor for me, considering the nature of my program, and the return I'd get for the work. While browsing this sub, it seems like unless youre a partner, you don't make that much as an accountant and actually hit a ceiling once you're there. Whereas a business analyst, you can also be a senior business analyst or a project manager and climb up in terms of a salary increase (entry level BA actually seem to make a decent amount though too). I'm just confused. Is my perception of a Financial Analyst wrong? What is the base salary look like for Financial analysts and does work diversify? I think entry level for FA is ~40k versuse a entry level BA is ~60k. Has anyone else had experience with both? Would a CPA help as an FA? This is totally off tangent, but i was also considering a career as a Tax analyst, but wasn't lucky enough to have such a co-op experience :/

EDIT: TL;DR - Can anyone give me advice on the job prospective of being a financial analyst (or choosing the accounting path and getting a CPA) versus being a business analyst (and potentially climbing up to be a senior BA or project manager) and tell me about the Canadian salary differences, need for jobs and overall work environment/life you'd expect to see?

I stayed at New Beginnings solo for top surgery recovery from 9/6/18 to 9/14/18. When I left I sent LeLand and Bonnie the below email about my experience. Their response to my email was to call me, apologize, thank me for sharing and insisted that my feedback would be addressed, and that Intern C had been fired. That response was refreshing to here....until Bonnie said that the part of my email that ""concerned"" her the most was that I was going to share portions of the email as a review

I am going to repeat that.

The part that “concerned” them the most was not the actions…or inactions…of the inexperienced interns they left to run their retreat. But that I was going to share my experience with others.

Additionally, I received word that Intern C is still in the house. And, when I asked for a partial refund via text, because I did not feel I fully got all that I paid for, I was informed (via text) that they only charge for the room and the rest is volunteered service. When I replied that the website description of what is included in each price package has “nurse and therapist” as the first item. Their response was that they do not charge for that. They have since edited their website to remove “nurse and therapist available” as part of the “package”. (I have screen shots of their website from before they took it down). Overall, my impression is that they were telling me what they thought I wanted to hear on the phone so that I would not share my experience with others.

\*All patient and intern names have been changed.

“Hello LeLand and Bonnie\*,

I hope all is well with you and you are enjoying your vacation. The retreat house is lovely, and I enjoyed my electric recliner. I am writing because I want to share my experience with the three staff you have left in charge. I saw “Patients First” written and underlined at the top of the instructions that were left for them and feel you would benefit from hearing about my experience with Intern A, Intern B, and Intern C. I will start with the pros: Intern A and Intern B are very friendly and personable. Intern A always washes his hands before touching the drains and offered me breakfast and lunch the first two days of my recovery. I always felt safe with Intern B driving and she is very on top of following the list of instructions you left. She also does the added job of following up with the guys, particularly Intern C, to ensure they are actually doing their portion of the household maintenance (laundry, checking the rooms, preparing the rooms for the next guest, food duties, etc). Intern A accomplishes these tasks much better than Intern C does. Intern C is good at basic assistance requests such as “can you bring me a Tylenol"" or ""can you turn the light on”.

Now to the cons. They are all absolutely unqualified to be providing any sort of care or assistance to recovering surgery patients and anyone staying here without a friend or parent caregiver is taking a serious risk.

I will start with Intern C. He refuses to assist with the drains, be it the dumping or the “milking”. At first, I thought it was because he did not know how to but later learned it is because he does not like to. This was a direct statement from him. Often, Intern C, who I learned has been here a week or so, is the only staff member in the house and spends a lot of time on the roof, making himself inaccessible to patients. His refusal to assist with drainage resulted in Mark’s mom, myself, and other patient’s parents/friends doing the milking and emptying of drains for other patients. Example, I woke up 9/13 to find Arthur sitting in the living room waiting for someone to come by to do his drains because Intern C wouldn’t, it was Intern A’s day off, and Intern B was asleep (will get to why Intern B was sleeping in a bit). It took me ten minutes to milk his right drain because the blood was so coagulated since no staff member had offered to help him or had checked in on him. I do understand it is partly on the patient to reach out regarding assistance; however, if you're in a new space, under the impression staff will be checking in on you every now in then, and had the first experience of you asking for help be the only staff member available not providing assistance because ""they do not like to""....it can be a deterrent to calling or texting the other staff members. Intern C could have at least offered to go get Intern B or Intern A. Intern C also walks around the house playing his music without wearing headphones frequently enough for it to be an issue. He also makes judgmental comments about patient’s dietary choices (there are some Vegans presently staying here and he made his opinion of that dietary choice very well known). We are paying upwards of $1,000 to stay here and his mannerisms and comments to patients and their families give an air of “This is my home and you are in my space”. The exact opposite of “Patients First”. Additionally, his limited ability to assist patients and frequent trips to the rooftop leave it looking like almost every day is his day off.

Intern B. I appreciate her warm personality and she is by far the most attentive of the three. However, she does not wash her hands before touching the drains. The first time she helped me with mine she had come from helping Keith. I asked if she had washed her hands and she made a dismissive comment about how it was okay and proceeded to continue touching my drains without washing her hands. Now, Intern B is attentive when she is ""on shift"", which I think is fair given they are balancing a lot. However, I was having serious pain issues with my right drain and wanted a staff member to look at my back to make sure it was not leaking. No staff member was there when I first had this thought early in the evening because Intern B was at her other job, Intern A was at the beach with other patients, and who the heck knows where Intern C was. Probably on the roof. That was fine. What was not fine is I did not know when they got back and ended up calling Intern B around 830/9ish to check my back because I did not want to wait any longer and did not know if Intern A was back from the beach. She put on her robe and came to look at it, affirmed there was no leakage, but when I asked if she could help me change my shirt she said that she had  “had a really long day” and “really wanted to go to bed soon.” My shirt was already off from her checking my back. All helping me put on a shirt would have consisted of was pushing the recliner back to access the closet, pulling a shirt out, putting it over my shoulders, and pulling the recliner back. Would have taken less than 5 minutes. She would not do that because she wanted to go to sleep. Nor did she offer to ask another staff member to assist me.

Intern A. He is also friendly and welcoming and, for the most part, assisted when asked. For the most part. I asked for four Tylenol’s the evening of 9/12 after he assisted me with my right drain. He said “I’ll get them for you right now. I’m running late for a meeting, but I’ll be right back”. 15-20 minutes pass. I send him a text saying “Is the Tylenol hiding” he sends me a text 6 minutes later saying “Crap. I’m sorry I had left already was running late, Intern C is present!”. I called Intern C and he brought me the Tylenol pretty quickly. Intern A did not pass on to Intern C that I had asked for Tylenol, which he should have if he put “Patients First” or he should not have offered at all to be “right back” with the Tylenol. Here’s the best part of this. The afternoon of 9/13, when Intern B was taking me to my post-op appointment, she was very excited to tell me about the amazing night her and Intern A had the evening before (9/12). Here is the meeting that took precedence over the delivery of pain medication and returning to close my door (I was immobile from the pain caused by milking the right drain, which Intern A had just assisted me with and was why I asked for a stockpile of Tylenol. Intern A was well aware I was immobile from the pain). Intern B relayed on our drive that they attended a Light Beings Community meeting, met up with friends they had met in Costa Rica, went out dancing, smoked hookah and “other stuff” that she then asked I keep hush about (implying the other stuff was marijuana), went skinny dipping, and did not return to the house until 5am. She knows it was around 5am because Arthur happened to text her asking for his medication and the only reason she got the text was because she was just arriving home from that night’s activities. This is also why no one in the house was available to assist Arthur with his drains in the morning. It was Intern A’s day off, Intern C refused to assist, and Intern B was not awake until 11am-ish because she was recovering from her and Intern A’s night out.

All three of them, at some point in my stay, said that they were going to come back and check on me and then did not come back. I’ve been referring to them as “staff” because they are who you have left in charge. Although Intern B does refer to herself as an intern. When I asked how the internship program works her response basically summed up to “I am here because I am dating Intern A.”

I have CC’d Mark’s mom in this email, as she experienced very similar treatment as I, bared witness to these actions…and inactions…and basically did Intern C’s, Intern A’s, and Intern B’s jobs in patient assistance for me and Keith. She also had an encounter with Intern A the day after my surgery which involved Intern A saying, “eh it’s the weekend and we have other things to do” in regard to checking in on me and other recent post-procedure patents. Chris’s mom is presently forming similar opinions and I cringe to imagine what other patient’s experiences are going to be like while you are on your vacation.

To conclude, a large reason solo surgery goers choose your retreat is because your website states the following:

“All packages are per night and include: • Nurse and therapist available”

and

“At the retreat you are able to come alone or should we say without a companion and you are never alone or feel lonely. One of us on site will go with you and be your companion”

I imagine you two are the nurse and therapist? And this is included in the $129 per night cost I paid. Is it legal to offer a package deal that includes a nurse and therapist available when they actually are not available? What is the per night rate if the full package is not delivered? I do not know the answer to the legality question but am sure I can find out with a little googling. Additionally, your future paying customers would appreciate hearing directly from you that you are not going to be there. Everyone who works so hard to build something deserves a vacation and I am truly sorry that I feel the need to send this email to you just at the start of yours. The space is great for recovering and I really enjoyed being able to meet fellow brothers going through the same experience. Unfortunately, the present people responsible for providing the assistance and peace of mind that is advertised on your website and in reviews is not happening in your absence.

I will be leaving portions of this email as a yelp review, Facebook review, Reddit review, and anywhere else I can leave a review. As anyone traveling to your retreat alone absolutely needs to be aware of what kind of assistance they can expect when staying here.

I hope you are able to use the information provided in this email to provide constructive feedback to Intern A, Intern B, and Intern C. Intern A and Intern B are great house caretakers. Intern C is great at occupying space. None of them put ""Patients First"" nor are qualified to do so.

Humbly,

Kinks: cumplay, being degraded/humiliated, cuckqueaning, raceplay, dirty talk, dom/sub, power imbalances, body writing, public/risk, dressup/outfits, rough sex

My ideal scenario is that I join the same sorority as you do and become friends, but secret rivals. I love the idea that you're attracted to both me and my boyfriend and you decide to seduce him (cuckquean me) and dominate me, kind of creating a three-way relationship where the two of you are dating and dominating me. I have a fantasy of nonwhite girls seducing all the good white guys because they're so much more feminine and sexy, leaving white girls to try to fend for themselves.

However, I'm open to many more scenarios! Another really hot scenario is that I'm a trophy wife to a really succesful businessman who's aged beautifully. He's aged like a fine wine and with all of his charm, success, and confidence, he's a catch for any girl. You're a younger, hotter, and more exotic girl that catches his attention and cuckqueans me. Is he a professor, and you're in his class? Are you his new intern at work? Are you my friend's daughter? Anything goes!"

Just looking for some advice.

Girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 months. Visited each other 3 times. I live in Wisconsin she lived in Texas.

We're ready to move in together. :) 

Well, there's some things and issues in the way.
I start nursing school in January and currently finishing up regular classes right now.

We thought about moving last time I was with her (August break) and decided December would be good. Once this semester finishes before spring semester. 

It's before nursing school starts which is a plus. The downsides are though. 
1. Money money, money. Currently I don't have a job steady job. Going to school, do have some money saved, but currently looking for anything right now. . She is working at a planet fitness and aflac and does doordash but doesn't have a lot saved up.

2. Obviously moving to Wisconsin in the winter is going to be rough since the weather isn't ideal.
3. Currently we both still live with our parents.
So we'd get a apartment together.in my city.

The issue mainly is money and expenses.

Between, rent, car insurance, car note, cell phone, TV, furniture etc stuff for the apartment. It adds up quickly.

Any advice on when you know it's ready to move, more so on the financial side. She's on board with it and we can make it work. But hints she wished she had a little more time to save. 
The next time would be late April. But the issue is when she moves here I'm going down there to help her. Then driving up here together. And idk what all entails between nurses semesters along with applies for internships etc. 

Just would rather have the moving and all.that out of the way. It's going to be tough no matter what moving and doing all that. 

Any advice :/ would be greatly appreciated! Thanks"

(Incest/Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation)

I'd like to play a role where in I step in on my brother being bullied and his bullies publicly humiliate and degrade me while he is forced to watch. Would like to build into each of them taking turns to force us to do more daring things. She's smart and well respected, her brother dumb, weird and constantly picked on.

**II. You're in charge of the new female employee handbook**
(Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation)

I'm the new latina hire who is going to be your new boss in an all male office. It was a promotion that you had worked hard for years, management decided to institute a diversity program and hire me. To make things worse, you've been put in charge of my orientation and overseeing my transition into the new role as the manager of the entire office. Fuming, you decide to have some fun. I'm very naive, and afraid to offend any traditions/culture of the new country I'm going to be visiting.

**III. Bartender At Biker Bar Likes Being Groped For Tips**
(Raceplay/Humiliation)

She's a curvy latina bartender in a rowdy biker bar. She teases them, by wearing booty shorts and low cut tops. Every regular knows to place the tips in her cleavage or her shorts. The larger the tips, the longer she lingers. (She does not do ""things"" for money! This is a dub-con roleplay) Look to r/burstingout for tops and r/ShortShorts/ for shorts ;) Creative replies get attention! Bonus points if you pick her outfit.

Cuck brother sends a dick pic to a cheerleader who's dating the quarterback. -&gt; Nerd Sister has been crushing on the quarterback helping him with his homework. -&gt; Cheerleader and Quarterback plot together and forward Brother's Dick pic to me, claiming it to be his. -&gt; Sister gets excited and compliments dick pic. -&gt; Quarterback and Cheerleader forward my msgs to Cuck Brother. -&gt; The both ploy together and trick us to go to local glory hole. Invite all their friends to witness the spectacle.

That's the ploy. I'd like to play this out from the first text sent to the cheerleader. This roleplay could end up with me and my brother becoming the play things of this power couple. I'd love you hear your ideas or how to take this forward. All characters are 21+

**V. Social Worker and Homeless Men**

Title is sort of self explanatory. I like being tricked, degraded and humiliated by filthy, filthy men. Let me know how you would like this to play out. You'd have to play multiple homeless men, I love an audience ;) 


**VI. Lost Latina**
(Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation/Potential Beast)

Terrible with directions, she ends up at a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. Everyone's excited at the prospect of a lady in their presence, making lewd comments and advances as she goes around trailer to trailer asking for directions.

**VII. Naive Sperm Bank Intern Goes Looking For Donors In Public**
(Raceplay/Humiliation/Potential Beast)

You know how people play pranks on the interns, well my colleagues have told me that our sperm bank is on the verge of shutting down if we don't get 20 samples by the end of the day. They've sent me out in the open world with empty vials that need to filled up.

That's about it. How would you take it forward? Does she approach strangers in public? Maybe she goes looking for homeless men? A biker bar? The men's room of a strip club? Does it have to be human sperm? You'd have to play multiple men in the role. Maybe I do such a good job, they make me do it everyday?

I was just browsing this sub and noticed a post about ""brain fog"" -- my girlfriend is incredibly intelligent, witty, and quick on her feet, but after her last flare, and even now that she's fine, she still is - but she's... a little slower, and she zones out - a lot, she's less able to handle things herself. She might be looking out of the window in a car - I'd say her name a couple times, she'd ignore me. Or, I'm talking to her while she's scrolling Facebook, she'd ignore me. 

I never got mad at her about this, but brought it up once - and she told me she tends to do it with people she's close with. Her sister even gave it a silly nickname, and her mom wanted to get her ears checked. 

She's also really stressed because her amazing background got her a really prestigious internship, and she runs her own non-profit - she has trouble focusing, getting work done and she feels bad about it - she binge eats / doesn't exercise / is almost always shopping for new clothes (she shops almost everyday) - I think maybe as a coping mechanism. 

I want to help her, but I don't know how - and I don't know if ""brain fog"" is indeed what she's going through. Her last flare took a pretty big toll on her, she had prednisone induced mania (she was *clinically insane* for weeks), and they had to give her antipsychotics that brought her back to normal for a while, then made her sleep 12-16 hours a day, eventually slowly weening her off. She's fine now, well, mostly? "
9ganz4,1,2018-09-16,The fear of losing control? And some general questions,MrSkywalker1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9ganz4/the_fear_of_losing_control_and_some_general/,"Hello Forum!

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so lately i have been having a lot of anxiety again. Which i thought i had overcome since i haven't had any severe fear, obsession or panic in like 2 years. Its making me sort of hopeless again. However every time i do have this severe feeling i am finding myself being obsessed about fixing it. This includes constantly scanning my emotions and thoughts, searching the internet (for approval?). And every time when i find some convincing symptom or 'root' cause i feel sort of relieved for the short term. As well as when i find a video or article with solutions on how to fix the anxiety.

Anyways with all this obsession i came with some root cause that make really sense this time (even though i have said this 100 other times with all other symptoms or root causes i found). What if this anxiety is some kind of fear to lose control? It makes sense checking myself all the time and obsessing about it.

Every time when a negative feeling or thought arises i have to convince myself that it is okay. I also am freaking out about losing my mind or become mentally ill or depressed (losing control?). Lately i think its somewhat time to move out of the house and start living on my own. I am not planning to leave my parents anytime soon but i have been orienting some bit. I find myself looking at a neighborhood and judge it based on my feeling. Some neighborhoods just feel depressive or boring. But i think it is just the fear of becoming depressed or anxious or unhappy in that place? I constantly seek positivity but i know life isnt all about positivity. I do have to admit that this week was really stressing for me since i'm quitting smoking and my favorite artist died and i have started my internship since 2 weeks now. The first week and before the internship i was really excited, but now i feel like i have to quit school because i'm worried i might have picked the wrong study and my future job. I do realise that i have the choice to quit whenever i want, or just finish my study and see how life will go. And if it doesnt suit me i can always change right? However i'm just worried about becoming depressed or unhappy or having a burnout from all this stress and worrying or just in general. Which fuels the obsession but i think the obsession is also a never ending cycle.

Anyways i dont think i have an axiety disorder or OCD, even though i have the symtpons. Its not that i have a constant panic or ocd behavior only in these stressful situations. I do however find myself always checking in with myself even though the fear or stress is just a little. I still check but i dont panic. I guess because i panic now its so sever and became an obsession. Now i have been convincing myself all the time that it might be this or it might be that. And i do know that obsessing is only making it worse but i cant help it, i need to 'fix it'. So now for the 100th time im sort of convinced it might my the fear of losing control. It does feel like my fear and cause of obsession though. But since i know i have been telling myself all the time it could be this and that i thought i might hear other opinions of fellow anxiety sufferers. Im just so done with these situations because i feel like its holding me back and im sure life isnt all about happiness and joy so i will have another episode in the future if i dont address this.

&amp;#x200B;

I also do have some general questions:

Isnt it possible that any anxiety (disorder) is somehow caused by a deep rooted fear of something? I.E. My fear of losing control?

And if so isnt it possible to completly overcome this 'disorder' by fixing the root cause?

Is it possible that when panicking or having some stress or fear is causing a person to think not rational and make wrong or impulsive descisions? (Like i have to quit school because i might think it is the wrong study for me, probably because i panicked at internship) Which will only help in the short term but not in the long term. 

And if so eventually you might create habbits or things to avoid stress and certain situations that might trigger the anxiety?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! i look forward to your opinions and thoughts."

I met this girl late June at a party, and we had a mutual attraction to each other. I got her number, but I was going on a backpacking trip all of July, so I told her I would text her after that. I started texting her a few days after I got back from my trip, and it quickly became clear that she is a bit of a workaholic, and she never really responded very fast. There were a few times when texting would be back and forth quickly, but typically she would take 1-8 hours to respond. This wasn't took much of a problem for me because I hate text conversations, and find myself feeling and acting far more awkward over text then I ever do in person. Anyway I eventually asked her out on the first date around mid August. That date goes great and we go on a second during the week afterwards. Things slowed down a bit since we're both students and classes started at the end of August, but we went on two dates two days in a row over memorial day weekend (9/1), and the second was her idea. They went really, really well. She opened up to me about her past and family stuff and I did the same. At this point, I was pretty sure with the way things were going that we were at the start of a pretty good relationship. But, after that point things kinda changed.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week we were both pretty busy with school stuff. We texted a bit the Monday (9/3) after but didn't really talk again until Thursday (9/6) and I asked her how her week was and she said it was crazy, but didn't elaborate past that. I asked her out both Friday (9/7) and Saturday (9/8) that weekend but she was busy both days. I wanted to see her Sunday, but I elected not to say anything since I knew that would seem kinda needy. She texted me late Sunday night basically saying that the weekend had been crazy and she hated busy weekends. I interpreted this as a sort of like a 'sorry we weren't able to do anything this weekend, I really was just busy.' I tried to continue the conversation by talking about my weekend and asking about hers but she left me hanging a couple texts later. We didn't talk Monday (9/10) , and that Tuesday night (9/11) I asked her if she was gonna be free any day during the week. She said it might be possible Wednesday/Thursday but I ended up having too much work on Wednesday and Thursday. So, I asked her Friday (9/14) if she wanted to go out and hike this weekend, and she said maybe, depending on how much work she could get done. She texted me Yesterday morning and said it was a no-go since she was going with her friends to the football game that afternoon and was gonna be hanging with them before/after. I responded by asking her how the outlook for today was, and she has yet to respond, its been about 24 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I guess my question is, am I being overly needy/clingy? I'm trying to not be, but my ex texted like crazy, and was always the one asking to go out after the first date, so I got used to that and I'm trying not to be overly needy but I've never really been on this end of a relationship like this. Part of me knows that she is really busy (she's taking a full class load while working \~20 hours a week and is involved with several campus clubs), but at the same time I kinda expected her to try and make a bit more time, or text me when she was free since the first few dates went so well. At this point I can only think of a few reasons she might have lost interest but it seems like I might be overthinking it.

* Maybe I didn't move fast enough for her, we cuddled the third date, and made out on the fourth but I didn't attempt to do anything past that because it didn't feel right in the moment. I figured it would be better to take things slow anyway.
* She's very involved and already has a job lined up when she gets out of college (she's a senior and I'm a junior) and it might have been a red flag for her that I'm not super involved with my major (I'm honestly here for the paper at the end) and that I don't have internship stuff lined up for next summer.
* I'm very, very bland and boring over text because I hate having real conversations over it, they just feel empty and I would much rather talk over the phone or face to face. Sometimes I feel like people start to thing of my text personality as being my personality, when in reality I'm much better in person.
* I admitted to having depression/anxiety in high school. I'm better now, but occasionally it still comes back a bit.

Any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated :)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Went on four dates that went really well, but haven't been able to set up a fifth after two weeks of trying."

9gcpvk,0,2018-09-16,I need help about late virginity and sexual failure,cobalt1728,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/9gcpvk/i_need_help_about_late_virginity_and_sexual/,"
High school was an okay experience, I had a small group of friends on the cross country team, however I never really felt that close to them and always felt like I was never really part of the group. I never went to ANY of the school dances at all. I simply had no prospects. I did try to approach some girls in class and outside of school but I was always shot down. I never was overtly bullied, but I did put up with some pretty significant disrespect from my peers. Once time a “friend of mine” said that I was ugly infront of a group of girls that we were at a coffee shop at. I did not do anything about it. Those group of friends then told me I needed to drive our other friend home which was way out of my way and I did it anyway. I look back at this and Cringe.

There was a time as well when I was in a computer typing class in high school and I got into a confrontation with another guy. He said that I was the ugliest kid in the school. It escalated into him challenging me to a fight and I regretfully backed down like a pussy. I believed that “violence was bad” when in reality, violence is what solves problems and keeps people in line. A girl that I tried to ask out witnessed this and now I know why I was turned down. YOUNG WOMEN, IN HIGH SCHOOL ESPECIALLY, WANT A GUY WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO BE THREATENING AND USE VIOLENCE.

Another embarrassing event was during track, the whole team always did a warm up run around the track, guys and girls together. A fellow teammate completety pulled my pants down infront of the whole team. I am not hung very well (I was always worried about my size as society basically says it’s the most important part about a man, I eventualy grew to dead average size thank the lord) and I am sure I looked really small. At the time I laughed about because I really didn’t give a shit but as time has moved on, I should’ve threatened to bash his fucking skull in.

At the end of highschool, I started feeling the signs of depression and my self esteem was basically declining. I had a dream of joining the airforce to become a fighter pilot or being a doctor or lawyer. I was sure that I was going to be a doctor or a fighter pilot. At this time I thought that I was still able to accomplish either one of these.

Went to college at a state university (a known party school) at 19.

I realize what a mistake it was to go to a school like this, where the only thing that is important is drinking and acting like a fucking moron. However, I did have some good times at this school and it wasn’t ALL bad. I started off in the dorms and I knew that I was going to major in engineering, as I can always become a laywer, or doctor after getting an engineering degree or just do a bachelors and get a job after that. I met some cool people on my floor. It was fun. I did go to some parties during my time at that school. It was during some of these parties that I realized that I was behind the curve when it came to sexual experiences. The scenario always looks like this, group of guys or guys and girls are ina circle doing a drinking game or outside smoking cigarattes. The subject of virginity WOULD ALWAYS come up during drinking games especially. The first few times it happened I was honest and did say that I never had sex. I could always tell and see the fucking resentment and judgment in the people eyes and faces around when I would reveal such information. Another classic scenario is during “locker room” talk with some friends and talking about stories of having sex in closets or cars or things of that nature. I always never had any cool stories to tell so I would either just smile or I would flat out leave the situation before anyone can tell that I have nothing to tell. After enough times, this became a source of anxiety and self hatred. It began to naw at me throughout the day. This is during freshman and sophomore years. There was one friend who, during one of these drinking games, laughed at my face. He was a nerdy short fat kid so I have no idea how he had the balls to do that to me. I should have fought him.

So now, at this time I am now 21 or 22 and am a junior at college. I am living off campus with a group of guys that I met. These roommates were super nerdy, smoked a metric ton of pot a day and played video games all day. They made no attempt to improve themselves at all really, but I needed a place to live and all the other people on my floor created alliances, if you will, with each other and excluded me, from what I can tell. I did enjoy living with these roommates as they were good people at heart and were fun for the most part. It is also during this time that I started wondering what was wrong with me in that I never had any luck with girls at all. I did try approaching girls around campus and I would have conversations and phone numbers but they always would never respond.

I then started to believe that I was ugly, thanks to my failure with girls and the fact that the kid in highschool said I was the ugliest kid in the school. I became obsessed with being as muscular as possible and as lean as possible. I started spending upwards of 3 hours in the gym a day doing endless amounts of weights and cardio. I started to look good. I was never fat in college, but I was not really ripped either.

I started noticing more attention and some interest from girls. I immediately associated increased muscularity with better response from women. How could I ignore that trend that was so obviously true?

At this time I also found “the Manosphere” which consists of “theredpill” and other type communities of men with similar stories to mine. I begain to digest the information on theredpill on reddit and could not believe the lies that had been sold to me my entire life. I started to implement the strategies which includeded, “fake it till you make it” confidence, and push pull techniques in which you would act aloof and that you don’t give a shit about the girl you are interacting with. I always knew the society looks down upon and shuns virgin or inexperience men, but theredpill taught me that women actively despise these men and that you never EVER reveal any type of inexperience, yet alone virginity.

I had my first sexual encounter at 22 I believe with a girl from one of my engineering classes. She was below average in looks and I almost feel bad about doing this, but I was so depressed with where I was that I felt like I just needed to get sex over with so that I knew what it was like so I decided to try to have sex. I was not attracted to her really and obviously it did not go well, I could not get hard at all. I got concerned about my performance.

It was sometime after that that I was in a class, I forget which one it was, where a girl in the class found me on facebook and introduced herself to me. I recognized her and I went to talk to her in class and she was so nervous that she ran away from me. Lol. Long story short I thought she was cute and we went on an ice cream date. I remember walking into the ice cream parlor with her and saw a large group of girls at a table. Now I want to preface this by saying that I never have gotten attention from women really other than the girl on facebook. But when I walked with with this girl from my class, I looked over and noticed ALL of the girls were looking at me. I looked away so I could place our orders. I looked back over and saw that they were STILL looking at me, staring at me. I thought to myself “why are they looking at me like that?” It was then that I realized the phenomenon known as “preselection” was happening before my eyes. The fact that I was ALREADY WITH a somewhat attractive girl, meant that I was more attractive to them since another girl found me attractive enough to go an a date with. I realized that women only want and are attracted to guys that other girls like.

She came back to my place and this girl was all about me. We had a lot of fun, but long story short she was begging me to have sex with her and I could not get hard. She bent over in front of me and was telling me to do it and I was as soft as a wet noodle. It was a TERRIBLE feeling. I did not know what to do. I just looked at her and said “I cant, im not sure whats going on” I got incredibly anxious. She was understanding. The next day I immediately booked multiple doctors appointments to figure out what was wrong. I felt defective, I felt like a complete loser, as if my self esteem was not shit already. The doctors told me that there was nothing wrong and that it was all in my head. A urologist I saw said that I needed therapy if anything. He did give me Cialis and a script for Viagra. I went to the pharmacy to fill it and it was incredibly expensive. I had no money to pay for it. I had to call my mom and tell her I needed money for the prescription and that was the most embarrassing thing I have ever had to do, let alone having the YOUNG FEMALE pharmacist explaining the drug too me and how to take. OMFG.

I was also placed on a few different antidepressants. I also learned about testosterone and its sole in the human body. I had multiple testosterone tests which indicated normal total levels, but almost abnormaly low free testosterone levels (which is where the rubber hits the pavement)

She would come over a few more times, and I received oral from her and I was able to do that while being on Viagra. Even with Viagra I was not able to maintain enough to put on a condom and have sex. Eventually the problem created a wedge between us and we stopped seeing each other.

At this point I became depressed. I began to doubt everything about myself. I then dropped out of engineering and I also never ended up enrolling in ROTC because I read that you had to pass very hard tests to be an engineer/doctor/fighter pilot and I believed that I did not have what it took to accomplish those things. So instead I switched to business finance. I regret this horribly.

By senior year I had an internship as a campus representative for a non profit in which I was tasked with enrolling people into the student club and hosting events and activities. I was horribly depressed at this point. I also noticed my quality of sleep declined DRASTICALLY. I was waking up 3 to 5 times a night and feeling absolutely terrible throughout the day. I began using insomnia medication which I still take today. Another thing that happened was I was at the gym and I walked into the locker room and I overheard one of my friends talking about me with a few of the guys from my floor and he said “Yeah Cobalt1728 basically doesn’t have any friends or anyone that likes him.”

I never confronted him about this.

I then hit rock bottom when I got another girl in bed and I failed gain and she looked down and asked “why are we not having sex?” I had nothing to say and I just sighed and we went to sleep. I then was tasked with recruiting students to go to Olympia to watch the legislature make a law. I had a few people going but nowhere near as many people as I wanted. The day of, every single person bailed out and I had to tell my boss that I had no one coming with me. She expressed great disappointment with me. I asked if I should even bother coming and she still wanted me to attened so I drove across all of Washington by myself to go to this event with no guests. It was at this point that I decided that I did not want to live any more. I called my mom crying so hard while driving. She picked up and I told her that I wanted to die. She started sobbing and was saying that she was scared and I told her I was gonna do it as soon as I found a way to do it. I began to actually make plans, like take an entire bottle of Benadryl and then use a garden house to funnel exhaust gases from my car into the cabin and fall asleep with the engine running.

My sleep continued to get worse and my self esteem was non existant.

I eventually graduated and moved to a big city with my dad while I looked for a job. I landed a job at a bank in retail sales.

About a year into the job I meet this other girl from a different branch, we hit it off pretty quickly. I thought she was incredibly attractive. The 2nd or 3rd time hanging out she invited me over to her house which was on lake Washington, she rented a room with a few friends. We were drinking and made some food. She sat on my lap by the fire and that was nice. Eventually we got to the bedroom and all I could think about was if I was going to be able to perform. I was using Cialis. We were doing forplay for a while and eventually I was on top of her and she was on her back and I didn’t know what to do because I wasn’t ready. She says “are you nervous around me” (she could tell because I believe I was visibly shaking) and I said “no of course not.” We went to sleep.

I would meet up with her a few more times and eventually I was able to get aroused enough to perform but I would either lose it when It was time to put it in, or I would cum from petting and foreplay. She at one point got up and yelled “I DON’T GET IT!!! WHY CANT YOU HAVE SEX WITH ME” I felt terrible. At this point I decided that It was appropriate to tell her I was nervous and have problems with this. She then asked if I was a virgin and I said kinda but not realy as I had done other things. This was incredibly hard to admit. The last time we were intimate was after disclosing that to her, was when I finally did have sex with her, but it ended extremely quickly (30 seconds max) and after it happened she got up and said in a sassy tone “DID I JUST TAKE YOUR VIRGINITY??” I almost cried right there on the bed. We went outside the room to the kitchen and she ignored me and went on her phone. Eventually it got late and she told me that I had to “sleep in the guest bedroom” because she was going to “drop me”

I ended up just driving home. I cannot communicate properly the despair and hopelessness I felt on that car drive home. This is where I became suicidal for the 2nd time. How was I supposed to get better at sex if I am not given any time to do it? I love how our society expects me to be a total sexual lion with no faults.

I got with a few more girls on tinder in 2015 and had ed every time. It destroyed me.

It was at this point that I was fed up. I learned a lot about testosterone and did a lot of research. I began to think that I was fundamentally flawed. I needed something to make me better, because clearly, people hated me and I was not good enough.

I got myself some testosterone and started a full on testosterone blast of 500mg a week of testosterone. My sex drive went up, my confidence went way up. I looked great. That’s right, I started taking steroids. I have no shame in doing what I did.

I noticed that my temper became shorter. I already had a bad temper, and my self esteem issues probably played a role there. But being on testosterone amplified what was already there.

I am now 26 years old. I then made another attempted on tinder and matched with this really attractive real estate agent girl from san Francisco (she just moved to the area). We met up for drinks and we got along pretty well. We would go out to dinner a few times and go to the dog park and we even went ice scating. She came over to my house twice and I was finally able to have sex. I was even able to put on a condom and I was proud do myself because I had sex with her in missionary for about 2 or 3 minutes. I was always sure to get her off in other ways wether that be oral or with my fingers. I thought things were okay in bed honestly. I did notice however that she was pretty selfish in bed and made no real attempt to return the favor to help me get ready. I continued seeing her because honestly I was 26 and I just wanted the experience. The second time I was not able to use a condom. She told me she has an implant in her arm. I went ahead and went without a condom, and that made me start to climax very fast. I pulled out to calm down and she grabbed me which then triggered me and I finished on her. She got mad because there was “no warning” but I pulled out to calm down so I thought it was obvious what I was doing. Nonetheless, I simply laughed about it and told her its because shes so attractive….. she was not amused. Again, women expect me to be fucking PERFECT.

Long story short, she ending up standing me up on a date where I was going to introduce her to my friends, I had driven all the way to seattle to get her and she didn’t show up. I go incredibly mad. Mind you, I” am on testosterone at the time. I nearly crashed my car I got so enraged. When I confronted her the next day, she told me she just “forgot”: and I told her how much of an inconvenience this caused me. She then proceeded to tell me that “You are not worth it, the sex was horrible everytime and you are being a total dick about the date” She literally blames me for HER FLAKING OUT on me.

I got home took my bass guitar and smashed it into 1000 pieces on the garage floor and I called my best friend Eric screaming and raging into the phone about how I am not able to get good at sex and that I am a failure. I nearly ripped the steering column out of my car by the sheer force I was exerting on the steering wheel as I was driving and screaming on the phone.

My anger became a big problem. At work I nearly got fired for putting my fist through a closet door. Eventually I would get fired from the bank for slamming my phone on my desk and throwing a starbucks coffee onto the ground outside the branch. I became very bitter and angry.

After this event with this girl, I would go 14 months with zero intimacy. That ended 4 months ago. I was introduced to a girl named ashley, who was one of my younger sisters friends. ashley is 3 years older than me and is 30 years old. When we first met it was obvious that she was into me, but I ended up ghosting her because I was not in a place to get involved with a female. I simply could not expose myself to further humiliation.

It was pure coincidence that she showed up at a BBQ (july 4th 2018) I was having at my house. We reconnected and we went out. Eventually we got into bed and I know I was going to need Viagra so I had my dad give me some. The first two attempts were failures. On the third attempted, she was asking what I needed and or what she could do, and I did not have an answer and we gradually escalated into an argument over the matter. She rolled over on the bed and was pouting and I told her that I was going to have a beer or two. She did not like that I wanted to drink to ease my nerves. Eventually we reengaged and she was not looking at me the same. It was as if she saw a different person. I do not remember the exact sequence of events but eventually one of us started crying. I was sitting in my office chair and she was on the bed. I completely broke down and started bawling. She came off the bed and sat on the floor and grabbed my legs and we both cried. I was so incredibly distraught.

It was at this moment that I decided that I was going to die that night. I started sobbing so hard and yelling “I don’t want to live!, I don’t want to live!” And she was crying so hard and It escalated and I got up, with her still hugging me. I was moving around but she was still clinging on to me and I then shoved her off me onto the bed. I then went to grab a small box of .22 ammunition I had in my room and I told her that I am going to garage and I going to kill myself. This was a 500 round box of ammo so, I had to rip apart the cardboard to get to the bullets, and she described it as if I was a starving person that had found food in a box. I was literally ripping it apart to get the bullets to kill myself. She saw what was happening and she threw herself onto me with all of her strength to stop me from leaving the room. After a few moments of struggling with her, I began crying again and I gave into her attempt to restrain me. I could have broken free but I didn’t.

We had a very long and intense talk and we went to sleep. She called my best friend, eric and told him what happened. He had to step out of a work conference that was mandatory for him to take the call. He then told ashley that she had to tell my parents and she did. eric sent his friend mike, who I also knew, to come over to visit me and to take the gun out of my house. He told me I had no choice. My parents then talked to me and my mom wanted to admit me to the emergency room to be admitted for a week or however long it took to get a proper evaluation. We decided not to do it because the ER would look at me and say that there was nothing wrong, as 48 later, I was not in a suividal crisis any longer. Eric called me and was in tears about what had happened. He already knew that I struggled with girls and sex but I am not sure if he knew it was to this extent.

Me and ashley took a break for a week or so and eventually started seeing each other again. Eventually, I was able to have satisfactory sex with her. I was taking 125mg of Viagra each time. It was incredible. I was lasting 4 or 5 minutes each time and a few times we actually orgasmd at the same time. Without the drugs however, nothing happens. I feel incredibly ashemed that It took me until 24 to have sex. I hate that every girl has about 10x more sexual experience than me. I feel inferior and I do not know how I am ever going to get over these feelings. I also would like to not kill myself but I have a suicidal track record.

I am now paying 120 dollars a week for fucking therapy because I am so fucked up. There is not a day go by where my scars of being a late male virgin does not haunt me. I feel inferior to all men around me even though I am bigger and more ripped then all of them. IF agirl expresses interest in hooking I have to decline. I can never have sex with someone until the 3rd or fourth attempt. So if a girl is just afling type girl, I never pursue as I will fail and she will tell everyone, because that is what girls do.

I am 27 now, I own a house and car and motorcycle and work a white collar finance job.

That’s it for the back story thank you for reading,

EDIT:
TL;DR:

Got kind of bullied in high school mistreated in college, didn't get laid in high school or college.  Hooked up with girls in college and had ed with almost 8 girls.  Started feeling suicidal and had a breakdown over the phone with my mom while driving across the state for a event that I was supposed to bring people too for the non profit I worked for when everyone bailed.  Had ED with more girls and was also ridiculed for my virginity which I eventually lost at 24.  Got dumped by a girl for what I believe to be my bad sex abilities.  Then I got dumped again by another girl who straight up told me I was terrible at sex even though I tried to get her off in any way I could, fingers, mouth ect…  (I have found that girls actually do not like this stuff, they only want penetration).  I had a fit of rage after this a broke a bunch of stuff in my house.  Didn't go to work for a few days.  Went back to work and punched a whole through a wall.  Got fired from Bank Job.  Went 14 months no intimacy, got depressed.  Got introduced to a girl who is friends with my sister, we actually dated before sex.  I explained my issues, she uinderstood.  The first 3 attempts didn't work, on the third she got frustrated and rolled over and was pouting.  I completely broke down when I realized that I was losing another girl to this.  I grabbed bullets out of a 500 round box and told her I was going to the garage to kill myself, she tackled me like a line backer and I kind of tried to keep going but I stopped and had a complete mental breakdown.  She was sobbing terribly as well at what was happening.  My family found out (she told them) and I was almost admitted to a hospital for suicidal ideation.  instead I started therapy.  We continued going out and I continued using VIAGRA which started to work and we had normal sex for 3 months before she had to move.  MY PROBLEM IS A FEEL ASHAMED I WAS A VIRGIN UNTIL 24, AND THAT I SUFFER FROM PRETTY BAD ED.  I FEEL INFERIOR.  I DO NOT HAVE ANY WILD SEX STORIED TO TELL.

10 Things I Hate About You"
9geedd,5,2018-09-16,Career fair CSE freshman,quirkykoala,uofmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofmn/comments/9geedd/career_fair_cse_freshman/,I'm trying to get an internship for anything computer or engineering related for the summer.  What should I expect? Should I bring resumes? I don't have much experience in my field but I did work in retail for 2 years before college.
9gejii,4,2018-09-16,Lots of Rejection this Season. Incredibly Stressed. What do I do?,Bancroft97,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9gejii/lots_of_rejection_this_season_incredibly_stressed/,"*from phone so sorry for errors in advance.


Welp Ive been rejected for interviews from all Big 4 In my area and RSM. 


Undergraduate GPA was a 3.4. Accounting GPA was a Not good. I have one internship at a small tax firm. I also finished my bachelor's in three years, but I dont think anyone gives a shit.


Last year (my senior year) the two interviews I had left me with rejection, so I never got a second internship. GPA was a 3.3 at the time and accounting GPA was even worse.


Ive been trying to turn things around in my Masters. I took 3 classes in the summer and currently have a 4.0. I also joined BAP as an initiate. 


So far recruiting season has felt rough. I already mentioned the B4 rejections. I had an interview for a firm I interviewed with last year on Thursday. It felt good, but so did my interview with them last year, so I feel like I probably won't get a call back. 

I have another interview with a firm I'd like to work with on Thursday, but they are a pretty decent firm, and I don't think I will stand out much with my accomplishments (or lack there of). I do have a family member who works there, but I feel like that doesn't give me any leverage.

Ive applied to 3 other firms, two of which are industry, which I absolutely don't want to start out in. Theres one firm who called me that I need to call back that wanted to meet. There was another firm I met that looked great, but there websites application thing is screwed up, so i will probably need to call them Monday. 


Basically thats my situation. I feel like I'm gonna come out of recruiting season with nothing. I'm not sure if companies recruit in the winter, so if I continued with my current GPA and obtained full BAP membership that would help me. 

Does anyone have any advice in my current situation, whether it be interview tips, how not to want to kms, or just general advice? Any help is greatly appreciated!"
9gerta,72,2018-09-16,The Three Day Squatter,AttilatheMascot,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/9gerta/the_three_day_squatter/,"So after a few weeks of casually cringing at other peoples' posts, I figured it was my turn to give it a go.   
Content warning: Language, General Angst.  


To be fair, I wasn't sure if this was appropriate for r/badroommates because this didn't have to do with my roommate at the time. His name was Jake. We were in our last year of college, and had known each other for five years. It was arguably the best living situation I ever had in college. We both kept busy with our major requirements, we had enough in common (friends, hobbies, TV shows) where we could enjoy time together but had different enough schedules and interests where we could do our own thing and not worry about it. We also both had partners at the time that lived a decent distance away, so we were pretty cool about respecting space on the weekends. We cooked for each other, managed keeping the place clean well (To be fair, I'm a cluttered asshole so my apologies, Jake.), and genuinely enjoyed working/coexisting around each other.  


The problem was when ***Andy*** came to stay.  


So just as some background, one of the only ground rules that Jake and I set when we moved in was that we'd give each other a week's notice of any houseguests whenever possible. Given that we only got to see our partners on weekends, we kind of wanted to have enough leeway to give each other privacy when needed. So imagine my surprise when Jake's old roommate, Andy, showed up at our door one Friday afternoon with a duffel bag and a sleeping bag in hand.  


Some background on Andy:  
\-He and Jake lived in a house with 3 other people for a solid year.  
\-My best friend lived in that house too. One time Andy thought it would be okay if he just borrowed his car without asking.  
\-Andy was perpetually late on rent, utilities, paying the bills he was responsible for on time.  
\-He failed out of the college about halfway into his sophomore year after being on academic probation for two semesters.  


I checked back my texts. No, I didn't miss that he was coming. Jake never texted me, told me, let me know in any way.   
So I called him out. ""Bro, what happened? I thought we agreed on a week's notice!""  
""Shit. You're right. He kinda sprung it on me and backed me into a corner. I'm sorry.""  
""Well how long is he staying?""  
""I think just until Sunday.""  
""You think?""  
""I hope?""  
""Shit.""  


Either way, it was too late to kick him out now. So he stayed. For the first day, he was pleasant. We went to a party that night, and we pregamed and hung out as a group. It was a nice time! 

&amp;#x200B;

The second day was fine; we had a hungover breakfast together, worked and studied all day, etc. Jake was good about his houseguest, and I was okay for the time with him taking over the living room. Andy spent the night at one of his frat brother's place, didn't tell us when he was coming back, and banged on the door at 3 a.m. since his phone died. Annoying, but hey, shit happens.  


Cut to Sunday. I'd noticed that Andy's stuff was more spread out. his clothes draped over more surfaces in the living room. I had to step over other shit he had brought. His laptop was hooked up to the TV playing livestreams of sports. No sign of packing up. Either way, I thought he'd be gone by the afternoon. I was out at a meeting and then at a study group for most of the day, and as I walk back into the apartment around 5, I notice that Andy is still sprawled on our couch, prodding Jake (and now me) about what we want to do for dinner.  


My answer? I want to make some mac and cheese, Facetime my boyfriend, and then watch anime. On my couch. That you're holding hostage.  


Okay, I didn't actually say that, but after we ended up going out to Chipotle, by the time we got back I'd hinted pretty clearly that Andy's time here was running out quickly.  


""I have an interview at a restaurant in the early afternoon, but after that I'll probably head out.""  
This was news to me and Jake. but sure.  


One of the things we kept in mind on that Monday morning is that we had full days of classes. I started at 8 and went until the early afternoon. Jake started at noon, went till the dinner hour, and then had an internship that he did a for a few evening hours a couple nights a week. So naturally, someone is always home.   


One of the problems that day was that I had a meeting with a professor in the afternoon that overlapped with Andy's interview My meeting was about an hour and a half, and Andy's interview was only supposed to take about 45 minutes. That meant that if he got done before I did, nobody would be there to let him back into the apartment.  
""Okay, so I'm going to be at \*academic building\* for a while. If you get done, you can just go chill at \*coffee shop under 300 feet from our front door\*  or wherever you want, and I'll meet you there when I'm done.""  
""I don't want to just wait around for 45 minutes! Just leave the front door unlocked.""  


*Leave. The. Door. Unlocked.*  


One detail I've left out: Jake and I had an apartment on the busiest street in town. Facing the street. A lot. A LOT. of people walked past it on the daily. Anyone in that regular foot traffic could pop in and grab our TV, Jake's PS4, etc. And we didn't exactly live in a low crime town.  


""I'm not leaving the door unlocked. Way too many people walk by.""  
""Come on man, It's not a big deal.""  
""Dude, just because your shit wouldn't get stolen doesn't mean it's not a big deal.""  
""I didn't say that. You're literally going to leave me outside? You're being really inconsiderate.""  


I'm being inconsiderate.  


I, who let you squat on the couch I bought in the apartment I rent with no notice or chance to talk about it, am being inconsiderate by making sure **MY BELONGINGS DO NOT GET BURGLED.**  


I packed my things for my meeting, shooed him out the door, still grumbling and complaining, and booked it. On my way, I sent Jake a text.  


***IF HE'S NOT OUT WHEN I GET BACK FROM MY MEETING, I'M PUTTING HIS SHIT ON THE CURB.***

&amp;#x200B;

God bless, Jake, man. By the time I got back, there was not a trace of Andy left in that apartment. And he made me the mac I'd been longing for.

&amp;#x200B;

Two months later, Jake got a call from Andy that I overheard, asking to stay over again. As I heard Jake slowly relenting, I snatched his phone, shouted ""NEVER AGAIN"" into the speaker, and hung up.  


TL;DR: My amazing roommate was too kind to say no to a shitty houseguest who stayed too long, draped our living room in his shit, and asked that we leave the door open for him while we weren't home in a high crime area. Bitching ensued."
9gez9i,114,2018-09-16,Advice on succeeding at a Meet the Firms night,FormerPartnerPhD,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9gez9i/advice_on_succeeding_at_a_meet_the_firms_night/,"For most schools, Meet the Firms is coming up in the next week or so and so I thought I would offer some thoughts on how to succeed at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 1: Your objective from MTF is to be sufficiently memorable to get an interview and nothing more. No one that I know ever got a job offer as a result of MTF. Your job is to go and be sufficiently memorable that they can remember your face when they start to evaluate resumes.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 2: Being memorable is pretty easy. There will be tons of poorly dressed people who lack social skills that are going and so you can be memorable by being dressed appropriately and having a 2-3 minute conversation with at least one but preferably multiple people at the table. My suggestion is to have an easy throwaway line that you  can use repeatedly in order to avoid hitting the poor recruiter with their 1000s elevator pitch. I recommend, ""Boy this looks like it is going to be a long day for you"" or ""It sure looks like &lt;firm&gt; is popular here"". Just say anything other than launching into your well-practiced elevator pitch.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 3: Be sure you have a well practiced elevator pitch. You are going to give it dozens of times and you need to be very comfortable with giving it. It should include your name, your major, your year of graduation and what you are looking for (audit/advisory/tax and full time or internship). Once the recruiter says something to you, you can launch into the second part of your elevator pitch (interned with xyz firm, really like topic a, etc).  Then you need to move into a conversation versus a monologue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 4: Know something about every single firm that you intend to talk to.  PwC has been doing this, KPMG has been doing that. ANYTHING that shows that you did an ounce of preparation. Don't try too hard on this but definitely have something.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 5: Pay attention to your personal hygiene. If you get sweaty palms, dry them on your pants/skirt before shaking hands. Don't overdo the cologne. Have a fresh haircut and neatly pressed clothing. Men, be freshly shaved. Women, go easy on the makeup. Both men and women, dress for the job that you are interviewing for and not a night out at the club. YOU should be memorable and not your clothing choices. LOTS of people have lost an opportunity due to bad clothing choices but no one has ever gotten one because of their clothing choices.  Go very safe and mainstream in what you wear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 6: Don't monopolize the person that you are talking to. They have hundreds of people that they need to speak with and so you need to be brief. Do  your pitch, speak for 2-3 minutes and then excuse yourself while noting that lots of people want to talk with him/her. Pay attention to the recruiters cues to know when it is time to go. Hint: once they break eye contact with you to look at the line, it is time for you to gracefully move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 7: I have attended these as a new staff member all the way up to the time that I was a Senior Mgr. The insights of every single person matter and so don't rush the Associate 1 in order to push your way to the Senior Manager. If my Associate 1 does not like you, you will not get an interview even if I did (as the Senior Manager). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thought 8: No later than the next day, follow up with a personalized thank you to EVERY person that you spoke with, remind them briefly of what you discussed, attach your resume and indicate how excited you would be to get an interview with them. My recommended email is: ""Dear &lt;Person&gt;, Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me about &lt;firm&gt; and &lt;function&gt; at &lt;University's&gt; Meet the Firm night. I was especially interested in your observation on &lt;interesting topic&gt; and how it is going to impact the future. It confirms to me that &lt;firm&gt; would be a great place to work (note...NEVER say to start). I look forward to interviewing with you and have attached my resume to this email. Best regards, &lt;You&gt;"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck to all of you and feel free to reach out with questions. To those of you who have been through this before, I look forward to you adding your observations.

9gezut,12,2018-09-16,New Retail Pharmacist with a (possibly dumb) questions for more experienced RPH’s,newrph7,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/9gezut/new_retail_pharmacist_with_a_possibly_dumb/,"Hi everyone, sorry if this is a dumb question. I’m a new floater pharmacist and have done a few shifts so far at my new job at a chain pharmacy. Depending on what store I’m at, some days there’s very little tech help or the tech is new so I end up doing a bulk of the typing. The difficult part is is that I only started working here a month ago myself (previously I was an intern at an independent where I did very little computer work) so I get stuck a lot. Usually when something looks weird on a prescription, I look at the patients profile to see if they’ve had it before and how other pharmacists went about it. But when it’s a totally new RX that’s when it gets tricky. For issues with directions/interactions I just call the doctor. But something I’ve been noticing lately is quantity is frequently an issue. For example, for creams/ointments the doctor will just write “1 tube” even though there’s 3+ different sizes. Same with liquid meds and eye drops. For example the other day for Promethazine DM the sig was  “Take 5 mL BID” with no duration and the quantity was “1 bottle” even though the only bottle we had was 473 mL (which is super excessive). The doctors always make me feel kind of dumb when I call to clarify and usually just say “so just switch to a smaller size, I don’t see why this is an issue” or “yeah whatever cream size you have in stock *hangs up*” but I also get nervous just guessing what quantities they want to give. I’m worried there will be that one patient who will complain, and someone will just see I just changed it. Sometimes, the doctor will prescribe a quantity we don’t even have (45g tube of ointment but we only have 30g in stock), so I was given advice to just give whatever’s closest to not waste the doctors time or order it if there’s no size that’s close enough. Do any of you more experienced pharmacists have any advice? I really appreciate it in advance! "

what do you do as a KCIT Apprentice? i read the description but still don't fully grasp it. i have basic knowledge of C++ and some python, both classes i took in college. and alot of personal experience in computer design ie building, debugging, fixing stuff and sorts?

Right now i currently work at retail store (was part time, now seasonal) and have about 5 year worth of experience in the retail field. while looking at the KCIT it offers a part time and a internship. If i apply for the part-time position or internship can i defer it? im taking a lot of classes this semester and don't have time to work and was wondering if i apply now and get hired can i say i can start working around January, or should i wait and apply next semester?

thanks."
9gfpd2,0,2018-09-16,EDUCATION - Student in need,ColtonT24,gofundme,https://www.reddit.com/r/gofundme/comments/9gfpd2/education_student_in_need/,"Hello! I’m Michael and I’m a student at the University of Akron. I am in my 5th and final year here at Akron and set to graduate this coming May.  I am majoring in Math Education where I am aiming for teaching grades 7-12. With this being my final year, I will be doing a lot of work in the classroom with my clinicals and student teaching. 

While in college, I do work to help offset costs. I worked a full-time job 40 hours a week in addition to my 16+ credit hour semesters at Akron. Since this is my last year of school, most of my classes will be clinicals and student teaching meaning I will be spending any and all free time in actual high schools as I begin my capstone projects. This has forced me to step down from full-time to part-time which means less money coming in each week. Come this January, I won’t be able to work as I will be student teaching 5 days a week in addition to creating lesson plans, grading students’ work, colloquium classes and my homework. 

Student Teaching is honestly an internship without pay. Many degrees here at Akron have internships that pay students to work and gain experience. That is the struggle of education majors. We are expected to put many hours of work into improving our selves and gaining experience, but we are not getting paid for any of it. Not only do I have to pay to do my student teaching, but I have to pay out of pocket all fees for my licensure testing and background checks for the state. 

The high costs to attend college has made me weary as I will essentially have little to no income coming in all of the upcoming spring semester during my student teaching. 
My payments on my college loans will kick in as soon as I graduate in May 2019, which potentially means I will have to start paying on my loans before I even get a job in my field. This is in addition to my normal cost of living expenses, insurance, car payments, etc.  

Please help me continue my dream to educate and inspire many students and show them that mathematics is fun and exiciting!

Thank you for your time and your generosity! I hope to stay in contact and share my journey. 

Sincerely,
Michael

9gfuf6,0,2018-09-16,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9gfuf6/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.  
 
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x F or M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x F or M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

SHE/HE'S MINE! (M x F or M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x F or M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x F or M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x F or M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9gg42x,7,2018-09-16,Did anyone in any of the CS majors (incl CSB) graduate really unqualified and had it work out?,Flag30,Lehigh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/9gg42x/did_anyone_in_any_of_the_cs_majors_incl_csb/,"Basically I'm very unqualified compared to most CS students here (esp. CSB) -- GPA is barely 3.0, only internships have been research, and I definitely wouldn't even begin to be competitive at top companies. However, I don't wish to live in CA or NYC and don't really like the culture of the top companies anyway (I'm not as smart as they are) so I don't really mind this. I understand that I should have made better choices, but my childhood was really horrible (poor, abused, homeless for some lengthy bits of time, etc.) and I have a lot of confidence issues as a result which prevented me from taking advantage of my opportunities fully. Even this isn't an excuse, though.

Has anyone else been pretty unqualified upon graduation and had it work out, or am I screwed?"
9ggzwl,2,2018-09-16,I don't know whether this is right for me.,cantwaittillcollege,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/9ggzwl/i_dont_know_whether_this_is_right_for_me/,"Hi Reddit pre-med students, I'm a college freshman who is waiting for college to start in roughly a week.

I do not want to go into 4 years of undergrad and 4 years of medical school pursuing neurology if I am not sure medicine is right for me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a child, I was diagnosed with epilepsy (that I grew out of). Ever since then, I took it as a ""calling"" to become a neurologist so that I can help others with the illness. Because I know how it's like. So, for the last 7 years, I have been dreaming of becoming a neurologist. I was so passionate about neurology. I loved learning about the brain. I was so, so, certain that I was going to pursue medicine that I took as many psychology, biology, anatomy classes in high school. I have a large amount of interest in anatomy, the human body, and psychology btw. I love learning about these subjects. That was another confirmation that I was going to go to medical school to become a doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

Over my time here, I've always seen the posts on Reddit about how people have $400K in debt, or they're in their 3rd year of medical school and don't want to do it anymore, or that they have so many sacrifices to make. And to be honest, every time I saw those posts, it made me want to do medical school less, gradually. Money was a big factor. I'm holding off on dorming in undergraduate years because I have to save up for medical school (instead, I have to commute \~2 hours everyday just to get to school). I have to hold off on working a job (which I desperately need) because I have to volunteer and build up my resume. I have a burden of building up my resume during my undergraduate years with shadowing, scribing, volunteering. I was just afraid to admit to myself that I may not be able to do this. Another factor was family. So something that is really, really important and valuable to me is family. I grew up with a pretty bad family environment with divorced parents, and without much love. So a big part of my life that I'm looking forward to is creating my own family. I've always dreamed of having the family that I never got. But if I pursue medical school, I'll be a neurologist roughly by age 32. This makes it hard to plan having kids (right after finding a job?) and being a doctor in general... is very time-consuming. I'm afraid I won't be able to spend time with family or friends. I also desperately want to fully enjoy my 20's with loved ones instead of studying, studying, stuDYING. I also certainly don't want to live my life with a large portion of my day in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also deathly scared of burning out. Medical school, volunteer work, shadowing work, internships, MCAT, undergraduate GPA, is all SO OVERWHELMING to me that I'm already like, burnt out from listing what I have to do and I haven't even frickin' started college.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past few days, I admitted it to myself. I was so set on pursuing neurology for the past 7 years.... But in one night... that dream got shattered. And I've been so heartbroken and surprised just thinking about it. I had my future plan laid out, but now that I'm thinking about reality and my future family, I'm questioning everything.

&amp;#x200B;

My other interests consist of psychology, the brain, marketing (because it's psychology-related), and maybe pharmacy. So it's not like I don't have a back-up. I'm just trying to find the right career for me. Any advice for what I should do to effectively decide? I would like to thank everyone for reading my story that has been literally eating me for the past couple of days before university starts, and also offering advice/encouragement. Literally, my parents offer no advice or encouragement, so this thread is a huge blessing to me. Thank you all. Sincerely."

9ghltf,7,2018-09-17,Buying a used motorcycle?,BiologyBaby,Hawaii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/9ghltf/buying_a_used_motorcycle/,"Hey!

I'll be here for the next 4 months until I'm done with this internship. 

I was told by my employers that transport was excellent and the bus system got you anywhere ya needed to go. 

This is clearly a lie, it's been a month and I'm exhausted from being in a bus for 4 hours anytime I go out. 


I didn't expect motorcycles to be so pricy here, to be honest. 

I was able to sell and buy my previous rides very easily for far less, but I spose that's just cost of living here eh? 


Anyone have experience buying here? Are the local used motorcycle shops here legit? 

 Craigslist and offerup are coming out dry for any ride under $3000 
I'm just looking for something that will get me on the highway.
That's it. 
Nothing special required. Just an engine strong enough to meet the highway criteria. 

Should I just bite the bullet and get a scooter? 

Is anyone selling? 

Thanks!

* Zeitraum: 05.09. - 07.09. in Harrisonburg, USA
* Am 17.08. aufgrund von Planänderung kündigen wollen
   * Kündigung über HRS-Website nicht direkt möglich
   * Stornierungsbedingungen: CANCEL BY 4 PM LOCAL TIME DAY OF ARRIVAL (steht so bei HRS)
   * E-Mail ans Hotel geschrieben
   * Keine Antwort innerhalb von 24 h
* Am 18.08. HRS angerufen und die telefonisch angehauen das für mich kündigen lassen
   * 21:30 hatte ich die schriftliche Kündigungsbestätigung von HRS im Maileingang
* Urlaub in Nicht-Harrisonburg gemacht
* Gestern mal die Finanzen aufgeräumt
* Abbuchung von meiner CC: 120 Dollar vom Hotel Harrisonburg
* HRS angerufen, nachgefragt
   * HRS: ""Komisch. Das hätte nicht passieren dürfen. Bleiben sie mal dran, ich rufe in Harrisonburg an.""
   * Während ich warte, meldet sich meine ING-Diba App und sagt:""Vorgemerkter Umsatz auf CC: $120 von Hotel Harrisonburg""
   * HRS zurück am Telefon. ""Die Dame in den USA sagt, dass nicht fristgerecht gekündigt worden ist und hat dann direkt aufgelegt. Das ist sehr merkwürdig, ich leite das intern an die Beschwerdestelle weiter, wir melden uns.""
   * Ich: ""Also melde ich mich jetzt erstmal bei der ING-Diba und lege Beschwerde gegen die Kreditkartenabbuchung ein""
* ING-Diba angeschrieben:
   * Beschwerde eingelegt: Buchungsbestätigung, die niemals beantwortete E-Mail und die HRS-Kündigungsbestätigung hochgeladen.
   * Als Kommentar gleich mit reingeschrieben, dass der Vorgemerkte Umsatz auch (meiner Meinung nach) rechtswidrig ist.

Warten.

Offene Fragen:

* Ob ChoiceHotels mich verarschen will?
   * Fristgerecht gekündigt --&gt; Die ersten 120 Dollar sind schon ungültig. Aber aufgrund eines Fehlers kann es ja vorkommen, dass die erste Nacht in Rechnung gestellt wurde. Kein Problem denk ich mir, hab ja ne Kündigungsbestätigung.
   * HRS ruft da an, nächste Abbuchung wurde vorgemerkt --&gt; Die zweiten 120 Dollar sind doch nur noch Schwachsinn?
* Muss ich noch was tun? Muss ich irgendwas beachten?
* Meine Idee ist, dass ich sage:Liebes Hotel, ich habe eine Kündigungsbestätigung von HRS. Macht das unter euch aus, aber ich zahle da gar nichts. Werde jede Kreditkartenbuchung zurückweisen, im Zweifel meine Karte sperren lassen.
* Kann man so stehen lassen, oder?"

Tesla has been on my radar for a couple of years now due to my fascination in electric vehicles and the progress Tesla has made with their products.

My school has a solar car team I plan to join this Fall as well. 

Is there any potential Tesla would consider me for one of their engineering internship roles?

How can I set myself apart from everyone else? Should I reach out to employees at Tesla with similar roles on LinkedIn and tell them that I have applied to show them my interest?

I was devastated that my ex boyfriend broke up with me a couple months before I wanted us to celebrate my birthday together (spent most of the day crying). Although my friends at the time tried to cheer me up, I felt like I  could NEVER stop wallowing. 

It's been over a year since we broke up and gone NC, and I have to say that time really does heal your wounds. In the last year, I've managed to accomplish so many milestones (graduating from University in the top 15% of my program, travelling, living abroad for an internship, etc) and meet TONS of people along the way. Despite all of that, I still don't think I'm completely over my first love. And I'm slowly coming to terms with that. Just know that you shouldn't feel ""rushed"" to be over someone who you truly cared about. It'll be tough but there's a light down that tunnel. 

When I woke up this morning, I wondered if my birthday ever crossed his mind. I wonder if he ever thinks about me from time to time like I do about him. But you know what? It honestly doesn't matter. Since I'm living in the Now, and right now, this past year has been a fucking blast without him. Onto the next :) "

Maria van der Zanden was a 22 year old female from Putten, the Netherlands. Putten is a relatively small place in Gelderland with currently 21.690 citizens. Maria lived as an only child at home with her very religious parents. Maria described herself as a devoted Christian. At the age of 20, she starts with the study general linguistics. Her dream was to eventually work for the Wycliffe Bible Translators. Just before the start of her study, she gets an accident and harms her tailbone. She is forced to live with the pain because treatment is not possible. She is no longer able to sit for many hours in her classroom, so she quits her study. After some time Maria wants to work at a daycare for small children. She was accepted into an internship and enjoys her time.

**August 6, 1994.**

It was a very hot summer day. Maria enjoyed going on bike tours, and told her parents she'd go for a quick tour around the area. She told them she would be back at 18.15 PM for dinner. Her mother had a bad feeling about this, but told herself that Maria was almost 23 and she should not worry. Maria promised her mother that she won't go to the forest. Maria did not take much personal belongings with her, only a bag that contained some sandwiches. She left around 1:30 PM.

18.15 PM - Maria does not turn up. Her parents are immediately worried, because it's very out of character for Maria to be late. They call the police but are being told that they have to wait until the next morning before they do anything. The next morning Maria still fails to show up and the police starts investigation. No trace of Maria was ever found.

**Possible related cases.**

In January 1994, a 23-year old flight attendant Christel Ambrosius was raped and murdered in Putten, the same place as where Maria lived. Maria and Christel knew each other since they attended the same school. A male named Ron P. was convicted with the crime in 2011.

Ilona Németh was a 34 year old female from Utrecht, the Netherlands. She was related to Maria because they went to the same Bible Study Group in 1987. They are photographed together.

[https://maudoortwijn.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ilona-vermist-en-maria-vermist-3web2001.jpg?w=301&amp;h=225](https://maudoortwijn.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ilona-vermist-en-maria-vermist-3web2001.jpg?w=301&amp;h=225)

Ilona went missing in July 2004. Her body was found in August 2005. Three years after her body was found, a male named Amin M. admitted that he raped and murdered Ilona. The police claims there is no connection between the cases, but it is quite a coincidence.

What happened to Maria van der Zanden? Was she murdered - and why would anyone murder her? Did she run away? Is it possible that Maria committed suicide?

I just recently graduated college (CS Degree), and I have no idea how to start looking at what people do for Home Servers. I don't have questions about hardware per se as many of you post that here already, from what I can tell. I am more curious of the following questions:

1. What do people pay to have their servers running?

2. How many servers do you run?

3. What do you run on your servers? Is it personal or business related?

4. Do you run PHP applications on your server? I'm really familiar with PHP, and actually did some intern work with PHP. However, I see a big rise in NodeJS and specific frameworks.

5. Do you have physical servers or are you in the cloud?

6. Why or why not go to the cloud? (Actually curious about this one with the rise in going ""serverless"" or ""to the cloud"")

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to everyone willing to answer these questions, I really appreciate it.

Lookup if your not up to date, or if you just want to wallow in pleasure.",Are_y0u,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9gkvw3/eulcs_teams_at_worlds_quick_summary_about_the/,"Have you've watched the regional qualifiers and the finals from EU and want to know a bit more about the teams? Or do you just hyped up for worlds and want to read something about your teams going to it. This might interest you. (Sorry for the ""wallow in pleasure"", this comes straight from the dictonary).

Let's start with the second place team **Vitality**

At the beginning of the year, VIT bought 4 players from the winning Challenger Series team Giants. They proceeded to go 7-0 in the spring split and surprised everyone (VIT also did crush FNC were Jiizuke on Ryze killed Caps(Azir) and SoaZ(Vlad) in an 1vs2). Then they became a bit mediocre and ended on place 4 in the *spring split* to barely miss RR. But they didn't stop and went to a Korean bootcamp and came back prepared.


In the *summer split* they started strong again, but lost their momentum at one point and the team had intern differences. *Gilius* the jungler was swapped for **Kikis** and then they started to smash again. They reached the 2 place in the regular split and they looked amazing in the tiebreaker games against Schalke and G2. But they chocked in the *semifinals* and Schalke was able to defeat them 1-3. Against MSF however, they were able to come back and claim 3t place for the second world spot from EU (FNC still needed to win the finals for them). Especially **Jiizuke** got back to his early spring split form and he managed to get a 7-1 performance on Leblanc and his old signature pick Ryze. Making it to worlds with 3 rookies is quite a statement and Jiizuke crying after the win against MSF let you also look behind their cocky attitude in interviews and on the rift.

They play super **early to midgame** focused and are probably one of the most aggressive teams in Europe. Draft 3 winning/pushing lanes and *go ham on the enemy jungler*, or create numbers advantages for *early game ganks and dives*. If they get ahead they go for risky plays and fight at every chance. They are on the same page and even if a play isn't that great when all 5 players go for it, the play suddenly becomes good. The problem is they also do this when they are behind, this leads to some crushing loses in games that can't get snowballed. **They are kinda a one trick wonder**.

Speaking about Wunder, let's talk about our third place. **G2 got through the Gauntlet**.

**G2** once the **kings** in **Europe**, had an exodus happen. The last man standing was **Perkz**, but he got some new high calibre players around him, especially Jankos and Wunder stepped up in the *spring split*. The managed to reach the finals but were defeated 3-0 against FNC. They were simply not good enough at that point and even Perkz (maybe a bit nostalgic because he lost his super team) said later on he didn't thought they could have won that b05.

In the summer split they were one of the teams that embraced the 8.11 meta. **The best Western funnel team**, great on bot lane mages and a super scary *Heimerdinger* did lead to a 6-0 start but once funneling got removed, they fell into *identity crisis*. They didn't really found a working way how they should approach the game. This led to failed early games or midgame throws and an inting Jankos(jungle). They ended up in a huge slump coming into playoffs. **MSF destroyed them 3-0** in the Quarter finals. Everyone thought they were done coming into the gauntlet. But then they bounced back.

In a **messy 3-2 against Splyce** they found their confidence again. Especially **Hjarnan on Heimerdinger** brought back that Series, after Perkz performing outstanding on **Akali** and trying so hard in the first games but inted after a crucial mistake from his team in game 3 and it got even worse in game 5 were he ""missed"" his Malzahar ult and had nearly half the deaths of his team. It's still nice to see this, because Hjarnan and Wadid were one of the most criticised botlanes in EU because they stepped into the shoes of Zven/Mithy^(Does someone know how they're doing?).

But one night was enough and PerkZ came back and even with Heimerdinger on permabann **G2 crushed Schalke04**. They got their ticket to worlds with pretty dominating 3-1 performance. It looks like G2 have found their **identity** and **it's quite aggressive**, with multiple carry picks all over the team, a *utility botlane* and a pretty dominant early to midgame. They like to play around the topside of the map with *midlane priority* and *heavy counterjungling*. They look a bit like VIT but with more focus on the mid and toplane and a more stable play around objectives. Hopefully they can **fix** a few more **problems** coming into worlds, so their games can **get** a bit **cleaner** overall and they can settle on this new found ""identity"".

And now we have to talk about the winner of the spring split finals, and the summer split finals. They dropped out in the quarteferfinal at MSI and where the only team to win 2 games at these years RR-final. Finally **Fnatic**

Are they the **best western team** this year at worlds? Hopes are high and written in **CAPS**. The team didn't change much coming into 2018. Jesis left and Hylissang joined. But they also got the coach **Youngbuck** and this pick up turned FNC into a new team. After a dominant performance in the *spring split*, they struggled to get out of groups at **MSI** and **brother TL was needed** to let them face RNG in the Semi. Rekkles was criticised a lot for his group performance and that got to his nerfs so he was probably mental blocked against **RNG**. It was a **0-3** but that doesn't tell the whole story. They actually played well and won every early game. Especially in Game 2 they lost a super crucial *baron smite* and later on a Elder Dragon that costed them the game.

In the *summer split* **Rekkles benched** himself because 8.11 made crit ADCs shit for a few patches. Their toplane substitute **Bwipo came in** and became a botlaner. Rekkles could get a mental reset and the team could show they can play without their star botlaner. This change **unleashed the beast** for FNC. Hylissang got more integrated on the team. He and Broxah stepped up and made the lategame shot calls while **setting up Caps** nearly every game. Bwipo and Hyli smashed enemy botlaners. Caps embraced that situation and picks like Irelia, Yasou or Zoe destroyed enemy teams or surprised them in case of *Wukong*. This performance helped **Caps to get the MVP** this summer split.

**Rekkles came back** in week 8 and even after a rusty start, they locked in the first place. In the playoffs Rekkles got to pick his *Tristana* and *Sivir* again and while it didn't look that clean against MSF in game 2-3 (and Caps needed the outplay to win game 3 on midlane Vayne), they came in and crushed Schalke. Hylissang even got to pick Pyke. We had some *Kai'sa* and *Xayah* performances from Rekkles and he promptly got the MVP for this series.

So coming into worlds FNC looks like they want to go a bit back to their roots with Rekkles on scaling picks while the early to midgame revolves around Caps. They look really good against EU teams playing their scaling comp but maybe tougher opponents need different **trump cards**. Bwipo could sub in as ADC for a surprise in the botlane or Rekkles on a pick like Ez could allow Hylissang to pressure other parts of the map. They are the best lategame teamfight team in Europe while still having a quite proactive midgame. They can snowball the game but don't rely on it to win their games. In comparison to most other teams in the region they look way more reliable while still being creative in their plays and picks especially around the midlane. Toplaners (Soaz, Bwipo) and the jungler Broxah are often on tank duty but is it really a surprise if you have the best mid and adc Europe has to offer? Their early game could improve and that's one thing to worry about coming into worlds and some people still say Rekkles plays to scared.

**What will, should or can happen at worlds?**

**VIT** and even **G2** getting out of groups would probably be an upset for a good looking group. Especially VIT needs to prove that they can play their style against the big eastern teams. G2 still needs to win the play ins, but they are a clear favourite against ~~wildcards~~ *upcoming regions*. If they can improve in the boot camp they might make it out of their group, especially if they can find a group where LPL or LCK is missing. **Not sure how they can fight in a bo5 against the best teams around the globe though.**

**FNC** on the other hand looks like the best European team at the moment probably stronger then G2 last year.  No one would give them a high chance, but the hopes for many western fans are with this team right now and also the players want to win badly. Winning against LCK teams or RNG is something the west has struggled historically and hopefully they dodge their arch enemy RNG. It's unlikely they gonna make the run especially if you see the LCK Gauntlet, **yet I still believe they have a chance!**

They have the **best EU (western?) midlaner**, a reliable ADC, a Rock solid jungler, multiple toplaners and a X-factor in Hylissang and the Bwipo botlane swap. They are unmatched in their region and are eager to battle it out against the toughest opponents. They might have the power to **top 2015 FNC** with Huni and Febiven in best form. Winning it all seems like an impossible mission but that's what they want, what the fans want. I would still be proud to see them in the Semifinals or making it out a tough group.

*What do you think will happen at worlds and how do the teams look like?*

9gl1d1,51,2018-09-17,CZ Grad School,impishraccoon,illnessfakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/illnessfakers/comments/9gl1d1/cz_grad_school/,"http://imgur.com/a/92q0iLO

CZ has posted in the past about her school, and I have personal experience with it, so it was not hard to figure it out. I blocked out the name of the school, but if I missed one PLEASE let me know and I'll fix it, this isn't trying to out her, just sharing some perspective. 

All of the stuff CZ has been posting about the school has really gotten in my last nerve, so I finally decided to make this. 

The school CZ goes to is seriously full of the nicest and most helpful people I have ever met, that truly just want to see you succeed. I have a very hard time believing that they aren't being helpful, unless it is something that she has not told them the whole truth about, or she dropped the ball on and how there's nothing they can do. 

An observation I have made over her posts is that anytime she is in the city where her school is, including on the campus, she makes her ""illnesses"" as invisible as they can be. She isn't in her chair, she doesn't user a walker, she keeps her port covered, etc. I'm really beginning to think that get school has no idea about her ""illnesses"" and that's a big reason she had been named the school outright in her social media. 

A big part of all of this school's programs is over all health and wellness, including physical activity. She has posted photos in one of their yoga rooms, in yoga clothes, clearly having just gotten a good workout in. 

She calls it a dual program, it's not, it's a counseling program with an emphasis on dance therapy that does prepare you for a national certification. 

She's constantly talking about how much work this program is and how hard it is. This specific program is typically not the first Masters degree people get, and most of the other people in it are practicing in some way in the mental health field. However, CZ makes a big deal about how hard classes and a 12 hour a week internship would be. 

Sorry if this is rambling or doesn't make sense, I just had to share.

9gl4b3,1,2018-09-17,Human Trafficking in the Philippines,WemissGian,u_WemissGian,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WemissGian/comments/9gl4b3/human_trafficking_in_the_philippines/,"The United Nations defines **HUMAN TRAFFICKING** as:

&gt;*“The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.”*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vtd65tywdtm11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Or in other words, it is the exploitation of persons. There are 3 types of human trafficking.

1. Forced labor
2. Debt bondage
3. Sex trafficking

Forced labor, also known as involuntary servitude, is the biggest sector of trafficking in the world, according to the U.S. Department of State. Debt bondage is another form of human trafficking in which an individual is forced to work in order to pay a debt. Sex trafficking disproportionately affects women and children and involves forced participation in commercial sex acts. In the United States, any child under the age of 18 who has been involved in a commercial sex act is considered a trafficking victim. Women and girls make up 80% of the people trafficked trans-nationally. Yearly, traffickers exploit 1 million children in the commercial sex trade.

When we think of human trafficking, we often think of women forced into prostitution. But this is just one face of human trafficking. Survivors of human trafficking also include men and children, and these survivors are exploited by any number of means. They may be forced into any types of labor such as:

* Prostitution
* Strip Club Dancing
* Matchmaking for marriage (a spouse visa provides an individual with the possibility to remain legally for, often, an undisclosed period of time in the destination country)
* Adoption
* Foreign training / internships
* Religious pilgrimages / movements
* Family tours (where individuals pose as family members to secure visas)
* Cultural exchange / promotion

These are just some of the types of labor which every victims have experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6opeu3kzdtm11.jpg

Human Trafficking is also very rampant in our country, Philippines.  The number of child victims of prostitution is estimated as 100,000 (Javate de Dios, 1999).  Philippine law defines the worst forms of child labor as all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery; any use of a child in prostitution, pornography, or pornographic performances; any use of a child for illegal or illicit activities; and work that is hazardous, including nine hazardous categories. The law criminalizes trafficking of children for exploitation, including trafficking for sex tourism, prostitution, pornography, forced labor, and the recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law establishes the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine for trafficking violations involving children and provides for the confiscation of any proceeds derived from trafficking crimes. Despite of this Social issue being rampant, the country is doing its best to control and prevent this issue to spread.

In 2007, the government's Interagency Council Against Trafficking established its first anti-trafficking task force at Manila's international airport to share information on traffickers and assist victims. In 2006 the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) issued new employment requirements for overseas Filipino household workers to protect them from widespread employer abuse and trafficking.

As citizens of this country, we must also help each other to avoid and hopefully erase this issue in our country. Even in simple ways we can already help and give a big impact. Another example of helping in preventing this issue is by:

* Promote education (formal, informal and non-formal)/ vocational training/ scholarship programs for women and children to minimise their susceptibility to being trafficked;
* Strengthen programs for training of law enforcement agents, social workers and related personnel;
* Encourage a gender and child sensitive perspective in the training of law enforcement agents, prosecutors, lawyers and community leaders, among others.

Together, let us all help our country to be safe in this issue which is destroying the lives of our fellow humans.

9glgfm,1,2018-09-17,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9glgfm/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.  
  
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "

I do IT / write software for a local health insurance company at $15 / hr for 30 hours a week (40 in summer).

I'm planning on graduating Spring 2020. I'll have $11,000 of student loan debt (federal unsubsidized) - most of it from my first attempt at college when I was 18.

Questions: When I was 18 I had a nice internship that netted me $10,000, but events in my life caused be to withdraw basically all of it a few months later. This was 2015. In Spring of 2016 I got a notice from my bank (BoA) saying they are closing my account (which had &lt;$200 at the time and I hadn't made a deposit or withdrawal in several months after the big withdrawal). This past month I opened up a TD Ameritrade account and put $100 in it at the time of account creation, and bought 2 stocks. 2 weeks later (last week), I received a notice that they are closing my account.  Disclosure, I am a convicted felon, but not for anything financial related. Could that play a role into the BoA and TDA account closures?

Personal Financial stuff: I'm going to need to buy a new car in the next 2-3 years (nothing fancy, $25,000 tops), planning on proposing to my long time girl friend (when largely depends on where she lands for grad school next fall), I want to start saving up for a house, and I'd like to have an investment portfolio I can contribute $100 to every month (the last two can be related). 

As I said, I'm graduating in May 2020. It is a very reasonable for me to be able to pay off the entirety of my student loan on graduation day, but I am unsure of what the best way to go about achieving these goals. I've looked into opening up an 12/18 month CD at my credit union, as well as open a higher interest savings account (requires $1,000 balance). Thoughts?"

getting diabetes early on in my life 
I'm quite sure that I have PCOS which increases the risk of diabetes type 2 and it's driving me insane...  my doctor tells me not to worry about my blood sugar and that it' s ok at the moment however that doesn't make me calm down at all since I'm constantly thinking ""Even if I don't have diabetes now, I'm gonna get it soon"" 

To top it all of I'm also studying medicine which kinda makes me embarassed to tell this to anyone in real life

I'd like to play a role where in I step in on my brother being bullied and his bullies publicly humiliate and degrade me while he is forced to watch. Would like to build into each of them taking turns to force us to do more daring things. She's smart and well respected, her brother dumb, weird and constantly picked on.

**II. You're in charge of the new female employee handbook** (Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation)

I'm the new latina hire who is going to be your new boss in an all male office. It was a promotion that you had worked hard for years, management decided to institute a diversity program and hire me. To make things worse, you've been put in charge of my orientation and overseeing my transition into the new role as the manager of the entire office. Fuming, you decide to have some fun. I'm very naive, and afraid to offend any traditions/culture of the new country I'm going to be visiting.

**III. Bartender At Biker Bar Likes Being Groped For Tips** (Raceplay/Humiliation)

She's a curvy latina bartender in a rowdy biker bar. She teases them, by wearing booty shorts and low cut tops. Every regular knows to place the tips in her cleavage or her shorts. The larger the tips, the longer she lingers. (She does not do ""things"" for money! This is a dub-con roleplay) Look to r/burstingout for tops and r/ShortShorts/ for shorts ;) Creative replies get attention! Bonus points if you pick her outfit.

**IV. Sister tricked into gloryhole with brother** (Incest/Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation)

Cuck brother sends a dick pic to a cheerleader who's dating the quarterback. -&gt; Nerd Sister has been crushing on the quarterback helping him with his homework. -&gt; Cheerleader and Quarterback plot together and forward Brother's Dick pic to me, claiming it to be his. -&gt; Sister gets excited and compliments dick pic. -&gt; Quarterback and Cheerleader forward my msgs to Cuck Brother. -&gt; The both ploy together and trick us to go to local glory hole. Invite all their friends to witness the spectacle.

That's the ploy. I'd like to play this out from the first text sent to the cheerleader. This roleplay could end up with me and my brother becoming the play things of this power couple. I'd love you hear your ideas or how to take this forward. All characters are 21+

**V. Social Worker and Homeless Men** (Raceplay/Degradation/Potential Beast)

Title is sort of self explanatory. I like being tricked, degraded and humiliated by filthy, filthy men. Let me know how you would like this to play out. You'd have to play multiple homeless men, I love an audience ;)

**VI. Lost Latina** (Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation/Potential Beast)

Terrible with directions, she ends up at a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. Everyone's excited at the prospect of a lady in their presence, making lewd comments and advances as she goes around trailer to trailer asking for directions.

**VII. Naive Sperm Bank Intern Goes Looking For Donors In Public** (Raceplay/Humiliation/Potential Beast)

You know how people play pranks on the interns, well my colleagues have told me that our sperm bank is on the verge of shutting down if we don't get 20 samples by the end of the day. They've sent me out in the open world with empty vials that need to filled up.

That's about it. How would you take it forward? Does she approach strangers in public? Maybe she goes looking for homeless men? A biker bar? The men's room of a strip club? Does it have to be human sperm? You'd have to play multiple men in the role. Maybe I do such a good job, they make me do it everyday?

**VIII. First Time Dog Walker** (Beast/Humiliation/Degradation/Pet Play)

I jog through the park everyday, I see a wanted ad for a dog walker. How hard can it be? I decide to answer the ad. I know nothing about dogs and you decide to teach me how to behave with dogs, what's normal and what isn't.

To be honest, I'm absolutely terrified because I don't clearly see how the stuff I'm learning in my courses translate to actual jobs. Yes, I understand the theory that's being taught, and I'm assuming forecasting is a typical entry level job, I just don't understand how I'm supposed to translate my schooling so far to an internship while not being even close to comfortable. Are my tasks something that would be taught during training? What are some typical supply chain jobs you recommend me research to get an accurate understanding of this field?

Secondly, there are a few networking events coming up that I'm interested in, but I have no idea where and how to start. I don't want to approach someone and seem like I know nothing, even though it clearly feels like that. What are some questions I should be asking if I'm interested in obtaining an internship or just information about their industry?

&amp;#x200B;

I finally finished grad school for a statistics degree by the skin of my teeth, due to a program coordinator who believed in failing 50%+ of the class by giving crazy, sometimes impossible assignments. 

Due to the crazy schedule I was pulling, packing got left to the last minute. Luckily, some friends helped me out and we got all my stuff into storage so I could go work an internship!

The internship went well at first, as I was working for this company for the entire previous year while in school. I end up finding a better job once i find out my company wasn't planning on hiring any new staff until October (3 months is a long time to wait without income or a for sure position). I end up taking the other job, and inform my boss. I get fired for an ""attitude"" change. I get kicked out of the company supplied housing, and am forced to drive 4.5 hours to my girlfriend.

Job starts in a few weeks. I have everything setup; company provided moving expense reimbursement, so moving should be painless. Get to my new city, find an apartment, hire movers, everythings looking good!

Turns out the *day* after I left, there was a huge flood and everything I ever owned was submerged in water and literal shit. I was able to save a lot of important memorable things, and recovered all my cookware. I lost a lot of things from my childhood and I'm still feeling like shit over it. I find this out the day before my first day at my new job.

Que 4 weeks of frantically finding furniture on craigslist and blowing through the little savings I have left, and spending every night cleaning muck off of my cooking supplies and whatever else. I just finished cleaning the muck off today, a month after the flood.

&amp;#x200B;

Things are looking up now, but wait, there's more! The fridge in my apartment breaks, destroying $300 worth of food I had just purchased. My cars brakes were on the fritz, so I decided I needed to get something done, so I go to drive to a mechanic before work. I end up getting rear-ended, am 2 hours late for my job, and now have some whip-lash symptoms as a result, so I will have to find time to go to a hospital inbetween my new, demanding job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Add to this that I am all alone in a new city, with no friends or community yet. I just have wanted to cry for the last 3 months. I have most of my furniture, but this stress is causing me to make errors at my new job, and I feel I'm going to be fired. My boss is aware of all these things but I'm afraid I'm coming off as somebody who doesn't have their shit together.

9gnzh3,23,2018-09-17,Advice on gaining Entry-Level experience after graduation,brks14,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/9gnzh3/advice_on_gaining_entrylevel_experience_after/,"I'm hoping to get some advice from those who may be having/had similar experiences. **(tl;dr at bottom)**

**First, a bit of background:** I am a recent graduate of an ABET accredited university with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I finished with a decent (not great) GPA, (3.48 in major and 3.18 overall) and am currently having a lot of trouble gaining any attention from local industry. I was not able to secure any internships during my time at the university but I applied every year at every career fair, nonetheless the available internships went to those whom already had previously interned, or to those with friend/cousin/uncle/brother/aunt's already in the industry that had essentially reserved a spot for the applicant; which is understandable. I'm from (and live) in a relatively smaller city on the gulf coast where nearly all of the local engineering industry is oil/gas/chemical refineries. 

Since graduation, I've passed the FE and obtained the EIT cert. and intend to pursue PE. I have applied to numerous, if not all of the local refineries and firms within approx. 40-50 mile radius. I have a had couple ""phone interviews"" (which I prepared for and felt they went very well, even followed up with the interviewer for feedback which was all positive) yet I'm still having trouble moving to the next level. In complete honesty, I have very little interest in working at a refinery doing maintenance/reliability. Although if an oppurtunity arose, I would gladly accept in hopes to gain relative engineering experience; as I am currently working 3 part-time jobs (restaurant/local grocery/teaching engineering labs at the university in the evenings) to make ends meet and pay off student/life debts. 

**Finally to the question/advice part:** I am very much interested in Aerospace. Unfortunately, there is hardly any aerospace industry where I am located. Northrop Grumman has a site here, but its a smaller maintenance based site that is incredibly hard to get in to. I've noticed that most of, if not all, employers in the local engineering industries prefer individuals with 5+ years experience. 

Which leads me to the fork in my path: **(A.)** Move away to a larger city in Texas or possibly Florida where the are more available opportunities for entry-level aerospace engineers. This would be ideal but logistically it's the most difficult option, leaving behind my family, friends, and long-term girlfriend whom still has \~2 years till she completes her degree. **(B.)** Take the GRE and apply to Master's programs in Aerospace. The department head at my university offered to write me a letter of recommendation, under the condition that I attend Texas A&amp;M. LA Tech also has an Aerospace program, but other than those universities the majority of graduate programs would require a substantial move. Additionally, at 29 years old I don't know if it would be wise to put off gaining work experience any longer as I have no insurance or retirement plans established. Which adds additional stress lol.

**(C.)** A friend from university that currently works at Northrop suggested applying to the local Community College to get a degree in Aviation Technology. This is my least likely option, as I wouldn't expect employers to really notice an Associates degree after an engineering degree. Additionally, I already have an Associates/Technical degree in Automotive technology with years of hands-on experience in technical diagnostics and repairs. But perhaps some ""hands-on"" training with aircraft and the option of obtaining an A&amp;P cert. would be beneficial. 

**Question, question:** Are there any involved in the Mechanical/Aerospace industry with advice for my current situation? I'm beginning to grow desperate, disheartened and even depressed with my career search and am having trouble deciding what my next, most beneficial, steps should be. 

Thanks to all in advance, 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Graduated in May and have had 0 luck finding work in engineering. Im interested in Aerospace but am unsure if I'm qualified to pursue that industry and it would almost certainly require relocation. Any advice or tips on becoming a successful engineer."

Let’s call him Kith. Kith is very intelligent and very hardworking. He does 7 classes in school, takes 2 classes online every semester, he does 6 clubs (officer of 2), he does 2 sports, etc.. He also is well-researched in how to make his college resume pop out, so no one doubts that he has paved a very successful life in front of him. One day, as he was discussing how he would try to do an internship over the summer while doing a job, 

I told him “Holy s dude, you don’t have any free time at all. I can’t imagine the stress.” 

Kith: “yeah I hate it but it’ll all be worth it in the end.” 

Me: “that’s really impressive. I probably won’t work too hard because I can’t personally take it. I’ll just get my A’s but I prob won’t even go to college and just teach myself a skill... Unless I get a scholarship. But all I have to do is not get married, and I’m fine.

Kith and other friend was smiling until I said the last sentence. 

Kith: what do you mean not get married. I will find a good (he probably meant conservative) girl and live off my career. I’ll make it so she won’t work at all. Plus married means you get lower taxes. 

Me: Nah bro, marriage is just bad news. Last I remember 55% of marriages end in divorces and...

Kith: Then you’ll just have to find a good woman. I think you’re anxiety says more about you than it says about marriage. 

Me: You didn’t let me finish: close to 80% of women initiate the divorce. Alimony and child support is bullshit. infidelity is rising. And imagine you working so hard to get that awesome life only for a woman to take 50% of everything you own.

Other friend: Then you’ll just have to sign a document where you both agree that none of those stuff should happen. 

Me: You mean a pre-nup ? Yeah those thing are pretty much rendered useless in court because biased jury don’t give a crap about that.

Kith: the fact that you research those stuff is kinda sad. Are you that anxious? Holy crap.

Me: The numbers don’t lie dude. You watch all these conservative channels making fun of “sjws” who ignore stats but when numbers don’t align your way u ignore them? That’s kind of hypocritical.

Kith: Im pretty sure you’re just spouting bs. I barely know any divorced Indian couples.

Me: That’s because they were arranged couples and the Indian patriarchal values before. But those values fade off into the next generation bc of feminism (Kith is conservative so he hates feminism too). We’re in America bro, Indian girls that live here might as well be these white and black hoes, literally no difference.

Kith: You’re kind of pathetic, you know that right?

I didn’t like his insults, of course, but I didn’t want to fight fire with fire so I just changed the subject. “Whatever dude. I’m probably just an incel and I’ll change my mind.” ( I didn’t actually mean what I said)

I feel bad for anyone like him and I really don’t want him to do all that work just for a woman to screw him up. I know many stories where men just killed themselves because of these things happening. But who knows maybe I’ve sown some doubt into him. Indians are very blue-pulled and some would never learn the truth until it’s too late. But Knowing that he’s very smart, maybe he’ll eventually take the red pill. For guys like him, you can’t force the red pill, you just have to make them skeptical and a couple of relationship burnouts later, they might end up taking it on their own.

So when I had to go for a week to visit a customer at their facility, out of state, I suggested she come along, which is not something most interns would have the opportunity to do. 

It didn’t hurt that she’s drop dead gorgeous. 5’0, maybe 90lb, long blond hair, freckles, blue eyes, lean, but with full B cups. Like a little surfer pixie. I knew she was attractive, but I had no idea just how good her body was until I saw her running around in shorts and a bikini top at the company picnic. 
 
Brianne and I flew across the country and checked into our rooms agreeing to meet for dinner after freshening up. We were staying at a local casino/resort because it was the cheapest place available. We met at one of the restaurants, ate dinner and split a bottle of wine. We were both feeling pretty good when we left and went to one of the bars for a couple more. 

After a while, I noticed that it was getting late and we had a meeting with the customer early the next morning. I walked Brianne back to her room and after opening her door, she gave me a big hug and kissed me on the mouth before turning around and closing the door. 

I figured it was just her being drunk, but holy fuck it was hot and I was rock hard. I went back to my room and tried to put it out of my mind. 

We were both pretty hung over the next morning and with a few Advil and a good amount of coffee made it through the day. 

That evening, we were a lot more restrained, and after dinner, when I said that we needed to review our presentation for the following day, Brianne suggested that we meet in her room. 

We go over the presentation in her room, I’m sitting the desk chair and she’s looking over my shoulder Just as we’re finishing up, she leans in and whispers in my ear, “When I kissed you last night, I meant it as an invitation. “  and with that, she swung herself over me straddling my lap, no doubt feeling my rock hard cock as we started kissing, pulling off each other’s clothes. Soon my chair was pushed back against the bed and Brianne was kneeling between my feet putting her lips to my throbbing cockhead. 

It was heaven seeing those blue eyes look up at me as she slid her lips up and down my cock. I didn’t last long and pumped what felt like a quart of cum into her pretty mouth. She sat back, smiled, opened her mouth, showed me my load in her mouth before she swallowed it. 

As soon as I could move, I tossed her on the bed and pulled her shorts and panties off revealing the smoothest, pinkest wet little pussy I’ve ever seen. I licked and sucked, tonguing her clit as she moaned, devouring her pussy until she gushed all over my face.  

I stood up, pulled her over so her ass was on the edge of the bed, and stuffed her tight little pussy with my hard cock. Jesus fucking Christ she was tight as a vise and soaking wet. She squealed as I grabbed her ankles held them to my shoulders and pushed my cock in balls deep and started pumping. “Fuck me hard Daddy, cum in me!” she growled as I picked up the pace. I didn’t last much longer in her pussy as I soon blew load number 2 deep inside her before we collapsed on the bed, both of us sweaty and breathing hard. 

We cuddled for a bit while my hands explored her body  before she stroked my cock back to life and climbed on top to ride me.I managed to shoot one more load before collapsing, exhausted into a deep sleep with Brianne snuggled in my arms. 

We were there two more days and fucked like rabbits any chance we got. 

I live about 45 miles from work in the same small city where Brianne lives and goes to school, we were able to continue our encounters and indulge each other’s kinks for the rest of the summer and even into the school year though i suspect the frequency of our encounters will decrease as her classes pick up.

9gobip,1,2018-09-17,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9gobip/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE!  (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

N1njastar28

Hope to rp soon!

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

9gpyac,2,2018-09-17,M4F Cuckolding Your Husband With A Boy Stud A Third Your Age,freeusestud,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9gpyac/m4f_cuckolding_your_husband_with_a_boy_stud_a/,"This is a prompt directed at all the women of dpp who are a little more experienced. By that I mean, you’re not the tight assed college coed you used to be. You’ve been married for a while now, and have the stretch marks and slightly sagging ass to prove it.  
    
Things weren’t always this way. You can remember a time when just walking through the door used to give your husband a hard on. He used to come up behind you as you rummaged through a drawer, and press his crotch against your ass as he reached around to mash your tits together. 

Send back then was more fulfilling. I mean, you used to look at yourself in the mirror as you fucked and think  l*damn, we could be pornstars* as you watched your husbands firm muscular back move as he plunged his throbbing 26 year old cock inside you. 

But things have changed. Your tight toned thighs are less so, having never really gotten back into shape after the first kid. Instead of coming up behind you to grab a feel, he’s tapping you on the shoulder to ask where the tums are, his heartburn getting the better of him. 


On the rare occasion you do have sex, he’s always tired, and it’s a quick sorry affair. After he pulls out of you, ten strokes after entering, you lay back and sigh, unsatisfied, with his cock barely doing much more than get you frustrated. You might even sneak off to the bathroom to play with someone who’s become a friend over the years: your detachable showerhead. 


Now that the kids are all off in college, it’s even worse. You either putter about an empty house, or come home from work to a house with just you and your husband, with him asking you for help putting in his new anti fungal cream. 

But one day, that changes. Maybe it’s the new neighbor, a 16 year old boy living off a trust fund. Or the high school intern at your corporate office.  Or maybe even a new trainer at the gym, the young junior quarterback. You joined a year ago, hoping that you getting back into shape would spark something in hubby, but nothing. He barely acknowledges your new, tighter abs, or realizes that your ass is firmer than it’s been in years. 

But this new man, he notices. You start to feel deja vu when he looks at you. The desire in his eyes reminiscent of earlier days, when you could walk down the street and know that every man in sight was looking at you like that. 


So, that’s my idea. To be clear, I’m not looking for a one off wham bam thank you ma’am here. I want to build a story. You aren’t going to throw twenty years of marriage away for a quick fling, you’re going to make me work for it. Maybe at first we have a frantic make out in the janitors closet, or the gym after hours. But slowly I’ll wear you down. You’ll end up coming to the gym, knowing that as soon as everyone else leaves, you’ll be peeling down your tight yoga pants as I dive between your sweaty legs and lap away at your musky pussy. Or getting on your knees beneath your own fancy oak desk and trying to get your nose to push against my pubes as you deep throat my cock. A cock, by the way, that is bigger than your husbands ever was. 

Then the clincher. The day you invite me to your house. I show up around noon, and make my way up to your room. You’re sitting in your bed in a lace negligee, laying out on satin sheets as I enter. We spend hours making wild love, interspersed with slow, passionate sex, the kind where we look into each other’s eyes and cum together, in a wave of physical and emotional pleasure. 


The time passes by without us noticing, that’s how engrossed we are with each other’s bodies. It happens during a particularly animalistic session, the fourth time we’ve fucked that day. I have you pressed against the wall, your legs wrapped around my back as I bounce you on my cock, your pussy juices, mixed with the previous loads I’ve left inside you, running out of your pussy down my balls. Your husband walks in, horror etched in his face. Instead of you jumping back and crying excuses, you tell me to go ahead, which I do. In front of your horrified husband, I come deep inside you. My balls clench as I blow my hot potent load inside you, overflowing your gash. 

Well then, I had a lot of fun writing that. If you sympathize with this character, or just like the idea, I’d love to see if we can work out some sort of roleplay together. I can’t wait to see your messages. "
9gpytl,1,2018-09-17,An SGI insiders Story of the cult (current member who is going to quit),big_buddh4_stev3,u_big_buddh4_stev3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_big_buddh4_stev3/comments/9gpytl/an_sgi_insiders_story_of_the_cult_current_member/,"(I apologize in advance for this is a long post)

So, I am a member living in the state of Hawaii and want to leave.  I desperately want to stop being a part of the cult of personality that is the SGI.  Problem is, my family are deeply entrenched within the org.  My family is well known throughout the Hawaii members as being among the first to subscribe to this nonsense.  Apparently, we spread the ""mystic law"" so much all throughout the island of Oahu.  My mother is very much into this cult that when she gives me advice about stuff going on in my life she always somehow finds a way to relate it back to the org.  

Now, keep in mind she is a good person.  She is just blind to the fact that she isn't understanding what a time, money, and effort sink the SG really is.  In fact, I subscribed to this nonsense from when I was a preteen all the way to my college days, which is from about 2007 to 2014.  When I first started working fellow YMD's started hounding me for monthly donations.  Not knowing any better, I donated $100 a month.  Calculated over the period of a year, I gave this faceless and soulless organization $1200 a year.  As a poor college student, this was my first realization that SGI wasn't a grassroots organization, but a seedy way for rich people to only get richer.

THen in 2015 I went to FNCC.  This place was reminiscent of a reeducation center that groups like Scientology or even maybe fascist group would use to reaffirm the insanity within the SGI echochamber.  They had us chanting for sometimes 3 maybe 4 hours at a time.  Lectures would start at 7 sometimes and last till around 8 or 9 at night.  THis was bad for someone like me from Hawaii as they never gave us a day or two to acclimate to the 5 to 6 hour time difference.  So while I was being reeducated on how great Ikeda is I was fatigued, tired, hungry, and missing important classes I needed to graduate.  To me, paying the near $1,000 for food, lodging, and my flight, going to Florida was not worth it at all.  This was my second revelation.

Now today in 2018 we have the 50K LOJ festival coming up in less than a week.  I do not care.  I repeat, I.DO.NOT.CARE.  At all, not one bit.  I am done wasting my weekends going to pointless practices and watching over a center I do not care about wearing a cult-like outfit.  I do not want to chant anymore as I feel I can be doing much more with my time, such as more research for my grad school projects and assignments and I could be taking more shifts at work (I am a manager at a movie theater) or pulling more hours for my internship.  I haven't been to any of the practices for about 4 months, and my life hasn't really felt any different.  I want to quit and leave the practice.

This is my last year within the SGI and once I move out next year I intend on going full stop with quitting the SGI.  I don't intend to pick up another religion as I am way too critical and jaded of organized religion.  This is more than likely due to being in the SGI for my whole life and despising every moment of it.  Now before any of you criticize me for being in my mid twenties and still living at home just note that Hawaii is an incredibly expensive place to live and I have only now just been able to move out with a small group of friends NOT in the SGI.

Thank you."

This is my last year within the SGI and once I move out next year I intend on going full stop with quitting the SGI. I don't intend to pick up another religion as I am way too critical and jaded of organized religion. This is more than likely due to being in the SGI for my whole life and despising every moment of it. Now before any of you criticize me for being in my mid twenties and still living at home just note that Hawaii is an incredibly expensive place to live and I have only now just been able to move out with a small group of friends NOT in the SGI.

Thank you."
9gq92g,4,2018-09-17,Should I be concerned about not remembering how to do everything I learned in undergrad?,donutsandpi,STEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/STEM/comments/9gq92g/should_i_be_concerned_about_not_remembering_how/,"Mostly posting bc I'm worried and need support.
Background info: I graduated in April and I have been job hunting since about March. I did my undergrad in math (with a minor in genetics) and then a graduate certificate in bioinformatics, which is the field I'm trying to get in to.

Today, a research job, I was supposed to find a function to represent a bunch of data points over a year. I took a lot of statistics courses in my undergrad, and based on how the data looked I knew there was a certain analysis technique/ method to use, but I could not for the life of me remember anything about it. 
I also find myself googling even the simplest stuff when programming, which concerns me bc I'm supposed to be able to program fluently based on my graduate certificate. 
It doesn't seem like there are opportunities to shadow, or intern, or volunteer in my field right now. So if I am able to get a job somehow, will my lack of memory be a huge issue?"
9gqkt5,1,2018-09-17,New Mac user here and have some questions,DataBois,mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/9gqkt5/new_mac_user_here_and_have_some_questions/,"Hello everyone! I'm a new mac user here and I just bought a 15"" 2018 macbook pro I7 6 core 16gb 512gb. I'm a windows fan boy and always bashed apple because of their overpriced products. Now, I just throw away my pride and bought the macbook and I can tell you that it's a great experience so far and I will be sticking to it for a long time now. I will primarily be using mac for web developing (some day a full stack developer), video editing, digital drawing and other stuff. Now for the questions, I bought my macbook at bestbuy and I recall that you get 1 year applecare. My question is, do I have applecare when I bought my macbook at bestbuy? If so, can i buy the applecare+ in late summer next year (like in august or june)? The thing is that I am a student and I don't have money lying around right now and on summer I plan to have internship during summer to get some money (or not) and get some experience. My apple care expires at September 15. Do you guys also have tips (I'm currently learning the keyboard the keyboard shortcuts)? App recommendations (I prefer that doesn't take too much space)? THANK YOU!

Ps, I have surface pro 4 with 4gb. I multitask alot and can't keep up anymore."
9gqsyx,2,2018-09-17,I'm tired of thinking of her. So much so that Im moving across the country.,BearSlapAttack,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/9gqsyx/im_tired_of_thinking_of_her_so_much_so_that_im/,"Hey all, just venting I guess but Im open for advice or just people who can relate.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved to a small town to go to school while living with my parents. Came from Austin Texas and went from more friends/social life/fun than I've ever had to no friends and no social life or things to do (other than schoolwork). I met and fell in love with the girl at the only coffee shop in town and it's been a hard complicated 2 years since. We both have a form of HPV so intimacy has been tense (and unwise in hindsight). Shes broken up with me 3 times in these two years, all through text/letter/not in person. They all hurt incredibly but got a bit easier each time. The second time hurt the most because I found out she slept with her friend after we broke up the first time, considering I hadn't had sex with her yet, it hurt immensly, which led to the second breakup.

Shes my only friend here and we have usually drifted back to each other to just stay friends but it kept leading back into wanting to make it work between us. Most recently we were doing well for about six months and then we both had summer internships that put us in different states for 3 months. I've been in the Idaho wilderness for three months and can only communicate through snail mail. Before I left I just had an feeling I would lose her while I was gone, considering our history.  I was right because a month in she sent me a breakup letter that broke me. Fortunately being out in the wilderness and having an incredible time made me get over it fairly easy. It was probably the best possible time and place to get a break up letter, and I said as much in my response/goodbye forever letter.

Internship ended and I'm back in town. I do something incredibly stupid, I got on Tinder (last thing I need now is a trashy rebound). I found her on there with a ""no gag reflex"" in her bio. Man it messed me up incredibly. I know I have no right to judge or blame her for being on Tinder, but it was just something I never want to see and didn't expect from her ever. It really fucked me up. 

We eventually had to meet and talk again to trade stuff that was left over at her place. Again she said she misses me and that I'm her best friend. But I also find out that she has caught another strain of HPV which puts her in another cancer-risk situation. She said it could of been from someone else years ago because they can lay dormant, but I'm not buying it. She most likely got it from me, or there was another partner(s) in the last 2 years. My guilt is overwhelming considering I want nothing but to move out to Portland OR like I've always wanted and to eventually have a day in the future where I don't think about her. I know that's not fair considering I likely put her life at risk with this rocky relationship, and I genuinely believe she loves me and means it when she said she misses her best friend, just like I do.

I will be moving to OR at the end of the semester in December simply because I have been so miserable here for too long. I am unprepared and not graduated but I feel like my mental health is more important at this point. This town will never be anything to me except a reminder of the failed relationship we had and how for 2 years she consumed me.

I don't think she deserves me just cutting ties and contact. I feel we would be very happy together if we didn't have HPV that puts her at risk for cancer. But I cant deny how my trust has been jeopardized so often, and how 3 times she didn't have the courage/respect to break up with me to my face. And I cant stop thinking about her being with other dudes and that awful Tinder bio. I guess Im just unsure what to think and how to handle myself between now and the oh-so-glorious day that I get to move out of here."
9gr24r,1,2018-09-17,Muslim Dating,Raezul,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9gr24r/muslim_dating/,"So we're both sophomores in college and we knew each other for a year and we have the same math class semester so far. Originally I saw her as a potential girlfriend, because she's really attractive and nice but she kinda curved me a lot so I friendzoned her. 2 days ago she confessed to me through text and i was shocked because I had no idea that she liked me. So I unfriendzoned her because I wanted to give it a shot because she's like almost the perfect girl for me.So I meet up with her in math and after class we talked in my car and she was talking about how much she has feelings with me but can't date me because of her strict dad and how if someone found out she had a boyfriend her reputation would be ruined because she sees dating as temporary. She kept saying she felt bad for me and all that but that ended up hurting me even more and how much she wants to date me but she cant? I felt fucking played. Here I thought ""Wow maybe I can actually be in a functional relationship for once, she has all the qualities"" She doesnt want to regret being with me. She also cant hang out with people in general when her dad is home as well. The last generation of muslims are so strict with their daughters, literally every muslim girl i know rebel and lie to their mom and dad to try to enjoy life because theyre depressed and scared. Also it doesnt help that Im afghan either, because her parents prefers an arab. SO basically she just confessed to me and then rejected me. Wow I seriously cant win, and i also got rejected by and intel internship just 15 min ago too. Im taking Ls all day"

9grdfv,1,2018-09-17,What am I doing wrong?,sloweroll,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9grdfv/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,"I'm beyond broke.. I graduated with a bachelors last year and have been unable to find a career related job since then despite having done internships and stuff. I've only been able to do terrible jobs like retail and serving.. even then, i can't even find a job with that. I hate being unemployed. I think i'm going to just kill myself tonight. I'm too scared, but idc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even get replies back for research studies that compensate for my time. I can't find ANY job, i'm in so much debt and i'm so broke and i'm lucky my parents even let me stay at home. Maybe something is wrong with me, i don't have any friends, i have a boyfriend who lives in another country from me so we can't see each other often. I literally have no other friends.. I don't want to go on medication, i don't want to gain weight and get more acne and i dont even have insurance. I have been trying everyday for the past few months with self improvement, not going on social media, making my bed, not sleeping all day, doing yoga, more exercise.. but i feel like nothing is working.

I'm just going to kill myself, i dont care anymore. "
9grg8l,1,2018-09-17,Living the Dream and the Nightmare,maxwellian_daemon,u_maxwellian_daemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_maxwellian_daemon/comments/9grg8l/living_the_dream_and_the_nightmare/,"I finally have my life together on paper.  Three internships under the belt.  Two of them were extended into the semester.  Leading two robotics team projects as well as being social coordinator for the team.  The research laboratory with the experience I want.  I am graduating a bit behind schedule with two bachelors of sciences and one minor (One semester), but I paid for everything with scholarships and jobs.  I am also on two sports teams.  Personal projects out the kazoo.  Wow wow wow.

Dear God. I have never been more overwhelmed in my life.  I have also never been so aware of my failures as a person.  Today, I had to ask for someone to sub for my position on the boats because I need to work.  Reddit, my friend, I am tired.  I feel like someone slapped me with a brick across the head.  I want to be there.  I just can't.  I am so overwhelmed.   I don't know if it is a failure on my part or a failure on my part.  Hahaha.   I am so funny.  Anyways, I have to drive to work tomorrow.

Anyways, it is honestly a struggle to associate reality with my life because sometimes reality is bleaker than the beauty and potential I see.  Sometimes, I am going to write jaded pieces like this one.  It is hard when the only person who values you is yourself.  It is hard when you take advantage of your friends to have some moments of comfort and fearlessness.

I never wanted to ask my friend to sub for me in the boat.  But my biggest fear is falling asleep behind the wheel because I did that.  And that was so scary.  I was driving home from a regatta in A.  I was so tired. The night before, I had finished two assignments (major projects) and I was the leader for my capstone group (We had an assignment due that weekend that was pushed back.  However, I finished on time.).  I attended my best friend's engagement ceremony, did the regatta, went out with my brother, and I was going through the emotional issues of my first break up.  I apologize for how badly I am writing at the moment.  I am really upset.

And when I was driving, I was tired.  I lived in A over the summer, and I wanted to go get coffee at my favorite coffee shop.  However, I was lost.  I ended up in someplace called P, and I had never been there before.  I think I was looking for R, but I took some exit and ended up in the middle of nowhere.  And I was in the wrong place. My phone ran out of battery (Thank you tracking software.), and I just had to use my memory of what the roads were to navigate back.  When I finally was on the way to C, I started to feel sleepy in E.  And I fell asleep.  Going 65 mph.  When I woke up, I was going 80+ mph and was on the wrong side of the road.  I nearly hit a truck.  I have done some dangerous driving stunts since then, but I am so scared of repeating that situation again.

I can't make myself that tired anymore.  I am scared of the consequences of being in an accident.  I am so scared.  I want my fears to be validated.  I can't tell anyone about what happened.  But I was scared.  And every time I think about driving tired, I feel as if my stomach is full of jumping beans.  I should have carpooled, but I was so busy.  And I need to go to H tomorrow for work.  I want to do my masters.  Pursue higher studies.  I want to be well-rounded.  But when I am doing things by myself with the luggage I carry, I need to be validated.

Here is the thing, I am not stranger to pain.  I love hard workouts.  My legs and arms are covered in bruises, scratches, and scars.  I love working out.  I love the accomplishment.  But the idea of permanent damage.  Of death.  Of ruining someone else's life because I was pushing myself beyond my limits.  I can't.

One of the reasons I am trying to remove my addiction to coffee (and caffeine) is because I push myself beyond my limits.  I don't want to do that anymore.  When I don't have coffee, then I fail miserably.  That day made me want to quit.  I need to set my limits, provide consistent results, and not hurt anyone.  I can't keep failing others.  I can't fail myself.  I know what I went through.  I am taking care of myself.  I am empowering myself.  I am being my own paramedic.  I believe in me.  And I will keep believing in me.  Because when I believe in me, I can help other people.  Because I will be a stronger person for them to lay their burdens upon.  And I can celebrate their successes with them because I will be able to be there with a hundred percent of my being."

**""Epic thrills, heart-punching romance, and a marvel of a hero"" --Adam Silvera,** ***New York Times*****-bestselling author of** ***They Both Die at the End***   
The people of Uztar have long looked to the sky with hope and wonder. Nothing in their world is more revered than the birds of prey and no one more honored than the falconers who call them to their fists.   
Brysen strives to be a great falconer—while his twin sister, Kylee, rejects her ancient gifts for the sport and wishes to be free of falconry. She’s nearly made it out, too, but a war is rolling toward their home in the Six Villages, and no bird or falconer will be safe.  
Together the twins must journey into the treacherous mountains to trap the Ghost Eagle, the greatest of the Uztari birds and a solitary killer. Brysen goes for the boy he loves and the glory he's long craved, and Kylee to atone for her past and to protect her brother's future. But both are hunted by those who seek one thing: power.  
In this first young-adult fantasy novel in a trilogy, Alex London launches a soaring saga about the memories that haunt us, the histories that hunt us, and the bonds of blood between us.

9gt47r,0,2018-09-18,Skat being Skat...,cangur93,Denmark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/9gt47r/skat_being_skat/,"Hi guys, so long story short I have an issue with Skat. 

During last year I took an internship in Stockholm for Electrolux in Sweden right after graduating from my Bachelor's degree. During that time, I was unregistered from DK and my room was rented out. I was on temporary residence permit as I had less than 5 years in the country (I am EU citizen). 
After 6 months I came back to DK to start my master's degree and I didn't give any more thoughts to it anymore until Skat barged in asking me to pay 17k for the period I was in internship. Like what the fuck?! 
I wasn't registered in DK and I paid races in Sweden. When I came back I had to reapply for a new permit and re-open my old cpr, why do I have to pay taxes in this case? 

Plus, it seems that when I talk to them they don't really know how double taxation works, thus the questions comes, how did they know to tax me? 

I am willing to fight this all the way so if anyone has experience with the topic, would greatly appreciate your input! "

So I graduate towards the end of next year, it would have been sooner but taking classes with a full time job and other responsibilities is a challenge enough as it presently is. That said, I really enjoy what I am studying and was wondering how hard it was to find employment after graduation? Did having an internship help? How about job fairs? Connections? Networking? Unfortunately, for me, I am unable to intern because of my credits which have already been applied, which is a bummer for me, however I really would like to jump into my field of study in the workforce world. I tried the mentor thing briefly but the mentor disappeared into the void as it were after an e-mail. As a side note, I have been trying to network with no success and I don't really know anyone around me that is in my future field.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insights would be appreciated.

Also, it’s taxation of corporations and partnerships so there are a lot of specific rules/interactions when it comes to problems and I hate missing class because I feel behind. Do you think that if I miss the pre-interview social to go to class that I will have less chance of getting the internship? "
9gvcax,19,2018-09-18,she babbles ✨💞 [about life] [and gwa] [and kinks] [bored and tired at work],naughty_charlotte,naughty_charlotte,https://www.reddit.com/r/naughty_charlotte/comments/9gvcax/she_babbles_about_life_and_gwa_and_kinks_bored/,"hi everybody,

first of all: there's no need to read this, no important announcements or anything. i'm just bored and sleepy and feel like babbling a bit about how life is going these days.

on a personal front, things are great. i've been seeing someone for a while and things are happy - he's very supportive about gwa, my kinks, my polyness, my existence basically haha. so that's been great.

it's also been needed, because for some reason lately i've been feeling *extremely* subby, more so than ever before. like, obviously during sexytimes i've always been subby, but lately i feel like it's bleeding into the rest of my life - i just get episodes of extreme subbiness, dare I say even slipping into littlespace. i don't know why it started, but most days i don't mind too much. after all i have someone to help take care of it. and it's not like there's anything wrong with being subby or little!

i'm working a bit more these days and procrastinating on studying for my last exam before my internship starts, yikes. i'm also trying to fit in lots of social time, which is both nice and tiring. i like seeing my friends (we just went on a trip for four days!) but i'm also feeling my introvert tendencies during that - social interactions cost lots of energy.

i also feel bad because i've been promising you guys so much great content and it's just not coming - i know i shouldn't feel bad but i still do, because i *want* to create for you! but my recording opportunities are *so* seldom these days, it's frustrating. because i have so much fun stuff that i wanna record and can't! gah! tomorrow i'm headed home to my parents house for the rest of the week so i'll likely also not get an opportunity then, but hopefully afterwards i'll be able to hoard some stuff. my 500-subs-special is all planned out, but it's pretty ambitious. hope i can get that to you asap.

i still love hanging around gwa though! i've made so many friends around here, and it's a wonderful pleasure to talk to them and hang out when i feel like it - nothing better than having an open minded support net. as for content creating? especially writing has been so fun for me lately, even if it's mostly been the same themes. i mean, i have a board spectrum of things i like, but when it comes to kinks i love enough to write scripts about, the field narrows down a bit. add to that these phases and voilá! you end up with lots of scripts with the same themes haha.

with phases i'm sure you understand what i mean - sometimes i just stumble or re-find a certain kink or theme and suddenly that's what i get off to almost exclusively for a bit until it fizzles out. it's kinda funny. so that's where i'm at now.

anyways i'll shut up now, work is over soon and then i can go curl up with my blankie and nap until i have to head out again tonightttttt. ugh. i'm kinda looking forward to being babied at my parents place bahaha.

how are all of you doing? anything interesting or exciting happening? let me know!

9gvs4i,1,2018-09-18,"Hi! I'm moving to Minneapolis next year, need advice on neighborhoods to look at.",AFivePointedSquare,Minneapolis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/9gvs4i/hi_im_moving_to_minneapolis_next_year_need_advice/,"(Disclaimer: I read the entire wiki page on relocating and I come armed with that knowledge. Please don't direct me there.)

Hello! I have had a crush of sorts on Minneapolis for a couple of years. I went there this summer for an internship, which reaffirmed that I would love the city - it was amazing through-and-through. I received a full-time offer to work at the company, which I will be accepting shortly. Now comes the question of where to live when I return.

I lived on the campus of the U this summer, got around quite a bit and saw many parts of the city, but I want some people with a bit more perspective to help guide my decisions. Here's what I'm working with:

* I will be working downtown.
* I need to be relatively close to the U - I am moving with my SO who is planning on transferring there.
* I will be our sole source of income for the time being, and while we won't be strapped for cash, I am looking for something that will allow me to save some money.
* Neither of us are party people and we would gladly live in a sleepy neighborhood far from bars/restaurants/etc. if it meant peace and quiet and cheaper rent.
* Seriously, I have a somewhat pathological hatred of distant party music, so the quieter, the better.
* I am an avid biker and am willing to bike up to 30 minutes to work. SO would prefer to use the light rail to get to campus.

Based on what I saw this summer, here are a couple preliminary options I had in mind:

* Marcy-Holmes - proximity to campus is a plus, and the greenway runs straight into downtown. I assume as a college ghetto it'd be pretty affordable. My only concern is that it'd be really loud (I was never there on the weekend to confirm).
* Seward - I went here a few times for concerts and it seemed like a really cool place. It's pretty close to campus and also not too far from downtown. I have no idea what rent or crime is like in this area, though.
* Northeast - only went here a couple times, not really sure what it's like other than hipstery and cute and primarily residential.

Any insight or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
9gvtex,90,2018-09-18,"Thank you, Questions, and Living Dolls",forgotusernamex5,Instagramreality,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/9gvtex/thank_you_questions_and_living_dolls/,"I stumbled upon this sub, and wow, how helpful. I've been having bad episodes with BDD and struggling with disordered eating again recently. My two good friends also struggle with this, and I've been trying to show them examples. My girlfriend won't post photos online without using filters, and it's affecting her quite negatively now. I tell her over and over she looks great and REAL in her untouched photos, or that simple smoothing or color correction is one thing, but the big warped eyes and noses it just looks... creepy. Thank you for giving me evidence to back up how a lot of social media is edited. Thank you for showing people reality. 

I have a creative background and I was taught traditional photo editing at an internship- we basically had rules about ""don't do anything you couldn't do with makeup and lighting"" and I do know about all the warping and pinching photoshop tricks but we were instructed not to do anything heavy like that. I'm not on social media (aside from Reddit), I didn't realize how widespread and extreme this got, it's shocking!!

I have a couple questions. Are there any other subs like this, that demonstrate how warped things get with photoshop, outside of just IG? Also, would you have any links for more male focused editing? The second friend I mentioned is a male and he use to cheerlead me on when I was at the worst of my ED and now I see him having BDD symptoms and it's really sad to see this in him. I want to help him like he helped me.

Also I have a bonus, because wall of text. I'm surprised no one has posted about the ""living dolls"", maybe because it's not specific to IG.

Thanks for listening."
9gw03o,2,2018-09-18,Wondering if I need a dose change or meds not working.,maddieice11,zoloft,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/9gw03o/wondering_if_i_need_a_dose_change_or_meds_not/,"Hi all, I’ve posted here before as I took Zoloft for about three years, stopped for three months, and went back on just this past July (around the 18th). I am 20F, a college student with bad anxiety. I was very worried Zoloft wouldn’t work the second time around, but it has brought me out of the dark place where i was for the three months off (panic attacks, extreme depression, awful side effects, really anxious about everything. Crying at least twice a day). I am functioning, going to classes, an internship, play on the lacrosse team, involved in a sorority and i try to be social as well (attend football games, go out with friends, drinking occasionally, etc). I’m very outgoing however my anxiety will make me want to hide away in my room and in my bed all day, but forcing myself to stay in a routine and socialize really helps. My biggest problem is probably self discipline. 

Anyway, i have now been on Zoloft again since around July 18th, started 25, quickly up to 50mg, and the doctor wanted me up to 100mg asap (i bumped up over the course of two weeks, and he thought i would be fine with the fast bump as i have handled Zoloft before.) 100mg is my highest - i was previously on 75mg tops, and dipped to 50 for a few months. It always worked fine. I have now been on 100 for a while, i also have .5mg Xanax for panic attacks (which i use very sparingly. Really for emergencies only, and i generally only take half! So .25mg). 

Basically, i have been feeling pretty good. Definitely out of my bad place. I am functioning and doing pretty well.  Minimal panic attacks, maybe one every three weeks or so - if that. However, the past two or so weeks i have become very dizzy/off balance. Almost a vertigo feeling. I have headaches fairly frequently. I am also feeling an increase in anxiety suddenly - just overall more worried about everything (i don’t have any sudden stressful surroundings or anything. It’s all been pretty routine). This has been for about a week and a half or two weeks. My doctor said just to keep an eye on it, but i really hate the dizzy feeling - my anxiety actually stems from a severe fear of passing out / fainting, so that off balance sense really just turns into a vicious cycle of worry/more dizziness/more worry and i freak myself out into a fit and want to just lay in bed. 

I find that a routine of exercise daily really helps me to clear my mind, and i had gotten a little out of my routine, but started back to running yesterday and am going t focus on working out and eating better overall. 

I’m wondering if anyone has had an experience like this - almost if the meds are slowly decreasing in their ability/how well they are working, if i should go up or down or switch meds at all, if there are any habits i should pick up (i read certain foods can be good?? But not sure if anyone has experimented with this themselves!)? Anything that helps this awful dizziness and increase in anxiety would be much appreciated!! I’m also looking into getting a therapist for some CBT as I’ve heard it’s good, so if anyone has an experience with that I’d love to hear it as well. 

—- also, i understand drinking does affect the ability for these drugs to work, but i really don’t drink habitually. I’m a college kid who will have a few drinks maybe once every week and a half or so, so i don’t think it would affect it that much (i also drank when i took Zoloft the first time and was fine!) but also open to advice on that.

Thanks so much guys!! 😊

My car recently ran into a bunch of mechanical trouble and I will need this car for my internship starting at the end of may. The cost to repair the car exceeds the funds that I have at the moment. My internship pays biweekly and I will repay in 3 installments of 300 each. Proof of internship and other documents can be provided.

9gxads,3,2018-09-18,Illegally Unpaid Internship,qvx1,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/9gxads/illegally_unpaid_internship/,"Hi all,

I recently completed a short internship for a firm in London. The details are as follows:

* I applied for a 2 week internship online
* I interviewed for the position, was accepted for the position, and received a contract (detailing salary, etc...)
* Due to a misalignment  of availability, I asked if the dates of the internship could be moved. I was told that the firm would be able to 'take me on' for one week in September. I had not signed the contract that was previously sent to me because the dates it detailed were different to when the work actually took place
* At the end of the internship I asked the HR department about how they were going to pay me, and they told me that I was only there for work experience and therefore would not be paid (despite many of my timetabled meetings/events referring to me as an 'intern')
* I was obviously upset that I was not being paid, as I had taken leave from my previous job to do the internship






According to the 'Work experience and internships' section on gov.uk, there are a few exemptions from paying workers:

 
'You won’t get the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage if you’re:
a student doing work experience as part of a higher or further education course
of compulsory school age
a volunteer or doing voluntary work
on a government or European programme
work shadowing'

I do not believe I fall under any of these categories, as the work was not part of a higher education course, and it cannot be described as 'work shadowing' as the work I did included the independent creation of a database for use of the company in the future.

I have been in email contact with the HR department and they have been rudely telling me how it is 'against company policy' to pay people who are there for just work experience. In their latest email to me, they have agreed that they will cover my travel expenses, and have also asked for more details regarding which employee the independent work I did was for.


While I am very keen to push this further, I would also like to stay on the good side of the company, as it is likely that my future employers will ask me for references as a part of background checks. 

Please give me any advice about if I am in the right, and if so, what the best way to approach this situation would be.

Thanks for the help"

I switched into ChemE in my fourth semester and will still be graduating in 4 years through a lot of catch up. As I always thought I wanted to pursue a PhD, this past summer was spent doing research rather than pursuing any internships. After 2 semesters and a summer of research I’ve come to accept that the research life isn’t for me. At this point, i’m so close to graduation with practically no industry experience or internships. I have a decent GPA (~3.65) and feel like I have good soft skills, but I just feel so far behind my peers getting industry jobs. Is it too late to secure an industry job before graduation? What can I be doing to increase my chances of scoring an entry level job? I feel so lost after switching majors so late and even later just deciding that grad school isn’t something i’m pursuing. Anything advice helps."
9gxn5o,1,2018-09-18,Specialized CPA Firm - Exit Opportunities?,NateDogg762,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9gxn5o/specialized_cpa_firm_exit_opportunities/,"This is a very unique situation so please bear with me....

My Background:

I have attended a 2 year college since 2016 and will be transferring to a small private college this spring in order to get a bachelor's degree by the spring of 2020.  I have a 4.0 at this college, have taken many upper level accounting classes here, and was president of the IMA for a semester.  I am interested in becoming an auditor at a small, medium, or big 4 firm after graduation and I will be able to sit for the CPA exam upon graduation.  I am currently an intern at a small company in Ohio.

Last busy season (2018) I was offered an internship at a mid-sized, national CPA firm that specializes in tax credits and the real estate industry.  I mostly did audit and tax for small partnerships within a new markets tax credit structure, and I found that audit is what I want to do as a career choice (I really enjoyed it).  However, the team that I was placed on did consulting work (forecasting, AUP's, etc) and in general they do not usually do that many audits or tax returns (they let the interns do them). 

The Story:

Long story short, I was given a full time offer at the end of my internship in which i would start in the spring   
of 2020 (2 years down the road). The problem is that the offer is for the consulting team in which I will mainly be doing forecasting and consulting for tax credit structures.  I was thinking that I would try that out for a year or so and see how it works out, and if I ever got tired of it then I could just ask them to move me to a team that does more audit/tax work.  I accepted the internship because I wanted to make sure I had something on lock down for when I graduate so I wouldn't be so stressed out about trying to break into the public accounting field, especially since I'm not going to a big reputable school.  Therefore, I figured I'd keep the offer in my pocket (it's my ""ticket"" into public accounting) just in case I can't get a job/internship at another CPA firm that has a more diverse range of clients/industries.

The Questions:

Will working for such a specialized industry limit my exit opportunities?  Keep in mind that my end goal is to be an auditor as I really enjoyed doing audits. How easy would it be to move from this extremely specialized firm to another, diverse auditing firm?

Also, will it look bad that I am currently looking for other opportunities (public accounting internships) even though I signed the offer? Should I tell the companies that I'm currently applying for that I have already signed an offer? Or should I just call the place that gave me the offer and tell them that I changed my mind and hope that I get another internship at a place that is more focused on audit with a more diversified client/industry base?

I know this is a very odd position but any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

9gycpk,6,2018-09-18,Broke my one year record during two weeks of no work.,CHAKOTAY99,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/9gycpk/broke_my_one_year_record_during_two_weeks_of_no/,"Just want a text box to vent into. 

I haven't played any games for my entire first year at university, I stopped playing with my clan because everyone was too busy to pickup the FPS titles and everyone was suffering burnout. I had been talking about quitting gaming for a few months at that point and during the breakup I took the plunge. 

During the year the most that I played where maybe 5 matches against AI in Total War Medieval 2 as well as a few against the AI in Mount and blade in total. It was the only time during the year that I actually logged into my steam account. It was so rare that I didn't really consider it as an issue.

I saw the addiction first-hand when I talked to other players in my course and added them as friends, one of them ended up dropping out and it was easy to see why. He was practically always logged on to steam and playing some game, so I told myself that I would never become that and just preoccupied myself with books and course-work. I also watched a lot of tv especially Star Trek and Star Wars before going to bed instead of playing.

Unlike a lot of users here I kept my PC as it was a software development course, but I made quite a lot more use out of my laptop. I didn't like sitting at my gaming desk anymore because I was always disgusted looking at it, so-much-so that my family noticed that I didn't really care for games anymore, which my father was happy of. It was nice not hearing about the comments that they made when I played for a long session and I generally felt better in the morning due to sleeping a bit earlier. I also gave my graphics card to my brother who still games the recent titles (which I am soo out of touch on like Overwatch) when his burned out. My family thought it was odd but I could still use my pc on integrated graphics and I didn't play anymore.

I also did better socially I think in university, I made sure to talk to almost everyone in my course and stuck much closer to the smarter people, the only actual player in the group plays Minecraft but I think its a good outlet for him/her and they were the smartest person I have ever met. Since I didn't think about loadouts and stuff like that during the day, talking to people was really the only way I could waste my time a bit. I also read about and listened to a lot more news podcasts. I didn't go out much sadly as planning meetups was not really my strong point which I hope changes this year.

Fast-forward to the title. I finished my summer internship and as planned it ended around a week or two before starting university and I coudn't find anything to keep me occupied so I thought what everyone would think two weeks before uni starts - I felt like I deserved a break. 

Using mainly linux I was kept away from the titles I ADORED playing like Arma and other FPS titles but I could easily install other titles too like Civ 5. So I played Civ for a few hours on my integrated graphics and thought nothing of it. With an almost yearly detox the game was doing nothing for me, sure there was the ""one more turn"" itch here and there, but deep down I knew it wasn't that enjoyable and would probably stop playing after finishing the match. 

Unfortunately I caught the attention of a clan mate I used to play with and was asked if I would consider re-joining as they re-formed. And oh my god is the thought of playing together again killing me. They sortof knew that I was done with gaming after not logging on for about 300 days and they asked me if I was going to play again or just mucking about (total war and Mount and Blade). Even as I am writing this I am looking at purchasing used graphics cards just so I can play these games again with them. 

I loved the people I met and enjoyed my time with them, but in the back of my mind I know I am probably going to spend until 2 am ranting and arguing and playing, feeling like shit the next day, thinking about the best scenario during a lecture. I see this every day when I look at my brother playing and feel disgusted on how hooked I was. And I can't get it out of my head, just two days ago I begged him to let me play for two hours an FPS I played on his pc because I gave him my GPU. I was soo salty when I died I coudn't believe it but it was soooo fun! I usually don't game in the morning because I woudn't focus for the rest of the day and I didn't.

The hobby is probably fine when you already graduated, with a job and settled down, which is why quite a few members do play. But for those of us who have yet to enter into the workforce, get our degrees and settle down, its probably not for us. I think its also more difficult to handle nowadays since we are a generation born into technology, then those who are older and have experienced life without it.

**For those who have played/are playing with international guilds/clans:** Before I quit, I tried my best to converse with all the long hour players in the guild. You will find that some are very successful and managing their degree and life whilst also playing a decent amount, and you will also find those who have dropped out and doing under-the-table work to make a living and fund their hobbies. As a shitty student at the time I knew what my life could have fallen into and I still do because I am still a student and it did convince me to quit, it is up to you to know what you can handle. I should also mention that I also saw fellow players who broke off from gaming (not logging on for months) so people do quit but they don't share their experience.

**Things I found helpful to quit:** Remove all game related media from your feeds. My youtube transformed to mainly gun-related and tech-related channels. Target shooting was a hobby I picked up with my dad, its expensive where I live but fun. Not games or gaming news. Although I did break off for a week when I heard about the passing of John Bain (totalbiscuit) who I liked to listen to when I used to game. The only gaming channel I occasionally peeked into was MandaloreGaming which at the time was a small channel dedicated to dated games which I knew I would never play, it was just nice to look at them.

Now I am going to try to think about if I should buy a graphics card and try to get back into the group, playing for about two sessions a week or if I should hold off the urge. Its really difficult because I loved these guys and I could usually vent to them about a bad day at work and talk about random shit, but I also saw that I could manage my life without gaming much better. 

Thank you for letting me vent here and I wish you all the best in your dilemmas.

TINY EDIT: I noticed a part where I said that people who gamed dropped out. I do not know their circumstances in life that could have led to them dropping out. I just looked through my view of the world, as while I do not know their life experience, I do know that I have access to a free university and did not have any major family/other issues at the time that could have kept me from performing well in school, socially and in sectors of my life. I was lucky enough to not have to worry about employment during my studying."

The whole experience was underwhelming, when I go there the girl looked very different than the as ( she looked 5-6 in person and dirty while on the ad she was a solid 9). I live in the UK so prostitution is legal.

I was a complete virgin who hadn't made out with a girl before . She started by kissing me but didn't french kiss, even tho on the ad she said she would. She then proceeded by giving me a blowjob covered by a condom. I didn't even get a full erection and came with a semi after a minute or two. I then proceeded to wait 15 mins and the we fucked again with me only being able to get a semi. We did it with her on top, then me on top, then doggy. This whole fucking was meh.

I discovered the redpill about a year ago and spent about the past year on self improvement. I am in a much better position than I was a year ago, I have a strong social circle and my physical appearance is much better. I was also spending my time working full time in a remote area for a year as an internship and am going back to uni now.

I have a couple of girls that are interested in me but I have been to anxious to pursue as I am inexperienced and was hoping this experience would make me learn . I don't even know how to french kiss. I have installed a tinder a week ago and I have 4 girls that are hb 7-9 that are down to meet to coffee and was hoping to arrange a meeting after getting experienced with this hooker , but now I'm worried about not being able to get my dick up.

I hadn't masturbated/porn for 4 days before seeing this hooker. Any advice on how to proceed from here ?"

I'd like to play a role where in I step in on my brother being bullied and his bullies publicly humiliate and degrade me while he is forced to watch. Would like to build into each of them taking turns to force us to do more daring things. She's smart and well respected, her brother dumb, weird and constantly picked on.

**II. You're in charge of the new female employee handbook** (Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation)

I'm the new latina hire who is going to be your new boss in an all male office. It was a promotion that you had worked hard for years, management decided to institute a diversity program and hire me. To make things worse, you've been put in charge of my orientation and overseeing my transition into the new role as the manager of the entire office. Fuming, you decide to have some fun. I'm very naive, and afraid to offend any traditions/culture of the new country I'm going to be visiting.

**III. Bartender At Biker Bar Likes Being Groped For Tips** (Raceplay/Humiliation)

She's a curvy latina bartender in a rowdy biker bar. She teases them, by wearing booty shorts and low cut tops. Every regular knows to place the tips in her cleavage or her shorts. The larger the tips, the longer she lingers. (She does not do ""things"" for money! This is a dub-con roleplay) Look to r/burstingout for tops and r/ShortShorts/ for shorts ;) Creative replies get attention! Bonus points if you pick her outfit.

**IV. Sister tricked into gloryhole with brother** (Incest/Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation)

Cuck brother sends a dick pic to a cheerleader who's dating the quarterback. -&gt; Nerd Sister has been crushing on the quarterback helping him with his homework. -&gt; Cheerleader and Quarterback plot together and forward Brother's Dick pic to me, claiming it to be his. -&gt; Sister gets excited and compliments dick pic. -&gt; Quarterback and Cheerleader forward my msgs to Cuck Brother. -&gt; The both ploy together and trick us to go to local glory hole. Invite all their friends to witness the spectacle.

That's the ploy. I'd like to play this out from the first text sent to the cheerleader. This roleplay could end up with me and my brother becoming the play things of this power couple. I'd love you hear your ideas or how to take this forward. All characters are 21+

**V. Social Worker and Homeless Men** (Raceplay/Degradation/Potential Beast)

Title is sort of self explanatory. I like being tricked, degraded and humiliated by filthy, filthy men. Let me know how you would like this to play out. You'd have to play multiple homeless men, I love an audience ;)

**VI. Lost Latina** (Raceplay/Humiliation/Degradation/Potential Beast)

Terrible with directions, she ends up at a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. Everyone's excited at the prospect of a lady in their presence, making lewd comments and advances as she goes around trailer to trailer asking for directions.

**VII. Naive Sperm Bank Intern Goes Looking For Donors In Public** (Raceplay/Humiliation/Potential Beast)

You know how people play pranks on the interns, well my colleagues have told me that our sperm bank is on the verge of shutting down if we don't get 20 samples by the end of the day. They've sent me out in the open world with empty vials that need to filled up.

That's about it. How would you take it forward? Does she approach strangers in public? Maybe she goes looking for homeless men? A biker bar? The men's room of a strip club? Does it have to be human sperm? You'd have to play multiple men in the role. Maybe I do such a good job, they make me do it everyday?

**VIII. First Time Dog Walker** (Beast/Humiliation/Degradation/Pet Play)

I jog through the park everyday, I see a wanted ad for a dog walker. How hard can it be? I decide to answer the ad. I know nothing about dogs and you decide to teach me how to behave with dogs, what's normal and what isn't.

I do like a lot of build up, creative responses jump to the top of the line. PM me with the prompt header and your thoughts on how to take this forward.

I ran my own in NJ and my driver's check as well, and both came back with no results. However, my WA conviction is still present in a national search, as a DUI in that state can not be expunged.  My internship has not asked me about my record, so I did not bring it up (not sure if right move). I hope that if it is serious, they will just talk to me about it, and if not I can just move on. However, I am wondering if it will show up at all since it does not come up in my home of record state, how long a background check takes (from ADP btw), and if anyone been in a similar situation?

Jenny, the intern, was in the table, completely naked feeding me grapes. My business partner in the in her knees sucking Will's cock. He had been employee of the week after all. As I hear the phone I answer. ""Oh hi... Yes you can come to the office tomorrow,"" the caller asked if he could come today ""no sorry we don't take unexpected visits. This office is all about routine. We never mess with a normal day in the office""

Two week early this was a normal office. It all changed when you arrived. I don't think you knew what you did. I'm not even sure you did it. Yet I don't know what else could have made it happen. You were the first one to show symptoms.

It was your first day. I didn't hire you. My business partner did. After I saw you I knew why Sarah liked you. You where very good looking. ""Another one"" I joked at her. There were 3 hired people in the office. Jenny, Will and you. All of them good looking. 

The AC had be broken for a week now, so it was decided that the office would have a casual attire, everyday unless a client is coming. So everyone wore normal clothes. You took it too a new level. Within couple hours you asked without shame you asked. ""Could I take off my shirt."" I don't know why I agreed, but I did. Maybe I wanted to see what you were hiding. You did not disappoint. No one seem to think this was weird, no one glared or anything.

The next day, you already had your shirt off. ""Hot day"" you commented. I try to act unfazed. Who did Sarah just hire. To my surprise Will was doing it as well. Another piece of eye candy. I decided to ignore it. Everyone else did. The day after it went to new level. Not only where you and Will were shirtless, but so where Sarah and Jenny. They were wearing sports bra. I wanted to do something, but I wanted my employees being comfortable, so I allowed it. Still at the end of the day I pulled Jenny aside, to ask her if something was going on. Her face turned red. ""Well we know you think we are hot. We were trying to impress you, we were trying to make you happy."" I feel shocked by this development. ""Okay... "" I respond. ""As long as you guys work hard, I will be happy.""

When I arrived the next day. Everyone had arrived early. Jenny explained ""Working had boss."" It had escalated again. Everyone was only wearing underwear. I called Will to my office. ""Okay what is happening!!"" I exclaim. He seemed utterly confused. ""What do you mean. Can I get back to work. I want to get as much done as possible."" I just stare at him. ""Sure, go back. But wait I talked to Jenny, yes you are all very attractive, but you can't walk around wearing only your underwear."" I explain. He nod back at me and left. Assuming that the this would stop. Next time I saw Will he was completely naked. No one seem to care nor notice. You soon followed. Before lunch Jenny and Sarah where also naked.

I called everyone to my office. ""Okay what is happening. I want answers. Why are you all naked."" You all responded as if it was normal. ""I mean it is hot and we can tell you like it."" Jenny said we could do the thing Sarah tough would relax me. I just stare confused. As Jenny gets on the table and spreads her legs. Sarah gets behind of me. ""I have seem your search history, I know we know what you like."" she confesses. ""Orgies, girl on girl, hung guys. This is your fantasy. Enjoy it. It is for you."" I finally let in and start pleasuring Jenny. They were right it was my fantasy.


So that is the rp. I would love to hear from you. I'm Moira and willing to play female or futa. You can do whatever you want. The rp would take place in an office that has suddently taken a sexual turn. The only one who kept her mind was me, but why resist. I am loving it. I have three ideas of when the rp could take place. First two weeks after the transformation. Second, after the first time I go down on Jenny. Or third, during the transformation.

Regardless hope to hear from you."
9h0j18,4,2018-09-18,[Career Advice] Lied with my experience in a BPO Company,KamoteGaming,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/9h0j18/career_advice_lied_with_my_experience_in_a_bpo/,"I am a college degree holder of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am currently 24 years old, and had worked in the BPO industry for 6 months and just recently just got hired in a very big BPO company; like very big it has Fortune 10 accounts.

My problem is: I went AWOL on my first company. 

As per the reasons why I left? It's because I am always anxious and doubtful of my choices. But, right now I want to stick with this one and hope for the best. Although, I am not 100% sure about this as they might do background checks and I would probably have problems with BIR as I would need a 2316 form.  


Any advice? Should I Just wait until next year so I won't have to face any problems with that, as per my knowledge and research I think it would only apply if the employee was hired into different companies within the same calendar year.  


If ever fail the background check? What should I do? I have no IT related experience besides my internships on several start-up companies (unfortunately, they are both out of business). Should I just keep finding jobs in BPO industry, if yes would I stick to lying again? Because; I applied for more than 7 companies and this one was the only successful one because I lied.  


My economic status is not that bad as I am living off my parents, no student loans, no car loans and no debts, I am not dissatisfied of the current salary.  I am also doing side-hustles like taking freelance works such creating websites for small-medium enterprises. Although, this side-hustles are not reliable as I get only 1-2 clients per year.  


And If ever, I manage to get past the background check. What should I do with my career? I don't know what do with my career in the next upcoming years. I am not sure what should I invest in and worried for the future.

Should I invest on growing my career thru getting a Master's Degree?   
Should I migrate to another country where salaries are bigger? If yes; suggestions for list of countries.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr version  
I went AWOL, lied to my employer, got hired and worried they might found out about the lie. If ever(hopefully), I pass what shall I do with my life in the future?


EDIT:
thank you for all the advises and taking your time. It's a quite a relief and hoping I can at least get some sleep now because I got like 5 hours before shift. Soooo... yeah."

9h0pjo,1,2018-09-18,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance Rps,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9h0pjo/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance_rps/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

N1njastar28

Hope to rp soon!

9h0t6h,5,2018-09-18,Darkness &amp; Acceptance,[deleted],LifeTHRUothers,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTHRUothers/comments/9h0t6h/darkness_acceptance/,"When I was around 19 or 20 years old, I rented a studio apartment.  For most, this would sound like sweet freedom at that age, but the circumstances made it bitter.  I had been kicked out of my home due to a family dispute, and basically dumped there by my step-father.  Being thrust  into independence as a full time college student, I was barely able to make ends meet, leading into a spiraling depression.  I remember there were trash bags on the window when I first moved in, and I simply left them there for weeks instead of getting blinds.  That's how little I cared, how much I was out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

One night, while watching videos on my cheap laptop, someone knocked on the door.  I tensed up, because I didn't have any friends in the neighborhood.  I had very little friends at all; I was in a stage where I was shutting down and blocking people out.  I answered, and it turned out to be a co-worker from the retail store I worked in.  Or rather, ex-co worker; he no longer worked there.  We hardly knew one another at all - he visited once with a couple other co-workers a while back but that was it.  He was a few years older, maybe around 26.  His name was Jason, for the sake of the story, and he was desperate.  Either he was vague in the details or I don't remember, but he essentially had no where to go after being booted out his place somehow.  He asked to stay with me.  I was stunned, but having been in the same situation, my heart went out to him and I agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

It was very uncomfortable at first, because we didn't have a relationship to start with.  I gently started asking him to start finding a place because I was becoming a bit annoyed with the lack of space and privacy.  I honestly just wanted the space to sulk.  Even though his options were limited and money was tight, I was on the verge of kicking him out.

&amp;#x200B;

The early first sign of any depth entering out relationship was when he left his wallet home one day on the kitchen table.  It was black leather and thick with junk.  I saw a couple of business cards sticking out and curiosity got the best of me.  I peaked at the card subtly, then picked it up completely when I saw what it was.  It was a business card to a gay bar.  I was surprised, but shrugged it off because it honestly meant nothing.  If he was gay, I assumed he didn't want me to know or it just didn't come up.  Either way, I tucked the card back in the wallet and went about my day.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, I was home alone again.  On top of the DVD player was a disc that simply said ""Latina XXX"" in sharpie.  It had to of been Jason's because I never seen it before.  I wasn't all that into porn, but still smiled to myself and decided to pop it in.  Then main menu showed some guy posing.  This should have told me something, but like I said, I wasn't a porn type of guy.  I skipped to a random scene because - honestly, who cares about the story line - and saw a man getting oral sex from a woman.  I watched for a moment.  Then I squinted and leaned in.  The camera angle changed and - yup - that wasn't a woman.  This was gay porn.  I cried out ""Holy crap!"" as I fumbled with the remote.  I ejected the disc, now realizing the sloppy hand writing in sharpie said ""Latino XXX"", with a o, not an a (having an ""a"" would basically signify women, for all those who speak zero Spanish).  I laughed to myself.  I put the disc back just the way I found it and let the experience give me something to chuckle about for the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

A few more days passed.  There came a night where I couldn't sleep and Jason was actually home instead of out partying or going to a gig (he was a singer and performer).  We started talking, me laying in my bed and him in the pull out coach just a few feet away.  Slowly we began opening up and having our first real conversation.  I had one other friend at the time who kept me sane as I shut myself off from the world, but it felt great to suddenly have such a fresh, relaxed discussion with another person during a time when my hope and trust in people was slowly dying.  I told him about my family - who didn't talk to me anymore - and he told me about his life.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point, Jason hesitated, saying he wanted to tell me something but was afraid of how I'd react.  Already having a feeling what it may be, I asked him to just go on with it.  He stuttered, laughed nervously, fidgeted - he was genuinely anxious but clearly had a strong urge to share.  Finally, he took a deep breath and said ""I'm bisexual.""  In the dark, I could see him waiting for an response.

&amp;#x200B;

I said, ""Oh.  Yeah, I was waiting like two weeks for you to say something.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jason was completely floored.  He told me I was full of it, but I recounted the wallet and the DVD incidents, and he covered his face in complete embarrassment.  I laughed and told him it was his fault for being so damn messy and leaving stuff around.  At that moment, I could feel this huge wall break between us, mostly from his end.

&amp;#x200B;

What Jason couldn't believe was how much I didn't care.  How I didn't say anything or acted any different.  I told him it was because it wasn't a big deal; it was just who he was, and he seemed speechless.

&amp;#x200B;

From then on, we were completely different.  All we did was talk and laugh and play jokes.  We never got sick of each other, and I didn't want him to leave.  He didn't want to leave either.  The cloud that floated through that apartment lifted, and he made me happy to be home.

&amp;#x200B;

But what I learned about Jason was that he was in fact struggling with his sexual identity.  He didn't seem completely at ease with accepting it.  Believe it or not, I was the one more comfortable with his sexuality than he was - to the point that it made HIM uncomfortable.  I'd ask him how his dates were, or casually follow through with discussions about cute guys, and out of nowhere he'd pull back, as if snapping out of it because he was not used to casually sharing that part of his life.  I'd joke that we were married in front of our friends, just because they found it funny how we joked and bickered.  This made him very anxious, because he was afraid they would find out.  I never stopped, though.  I just kept pushing the envelope.  I suppose I was trying to nudge him out of his fear now that I look back.

&amp;#x200B;

One example I remember was a day I was cleaning the apartment.  I was a neat freak and Jason was a slob, so I was always picking up.  He left another porn DVD laying around, this one with full cover art and everything.  I just put it in his drawer and kept cleaning.  When Jason got home and he saw I was cleaning, he started looking around.  I noticed and said ""Oh, I put your movie in there.""  He just stared at me, smirked and then shook his head.  I didn't get his reaction until he made a comment.  I remember feeling back for him at that moment.  The fact that he saw such a simple act as some kind of sign of acceptance.  He really was truly to be judged, probably because he had been once, in a harsh way.

&amp;#x200B;

Jason taught me something about myself.  Seeing his struggle with his identity made me interested, and so I requested to do my internship at an LGBT drop in center for youth (I majored in Social Work).  I encountered many struggling kids who were rejected - even disowned by family - because of who they were.  We constantly talked about safe sex because it was not uncommon for them to sell themselves on the street to make ends meet (sadly enough, their clients would usually be people on the down low, so they were the very people who would see them in public the next day and make fun).  At first, they were wary of me, being straight.  They would try to test me, joking that I was lying to myself and knew I was gay, etc.  I think it all shifted one day when we had an open discussion and one of them jokingly said ""You know you thought about it, being with a guy.""

&amp;#x200B;

I shrugged and simply said, ""Well, yeah.  I think all guys do.  They just lie about it.""

&amp;#x200B;

They all kind of got quiet. I explained, ""I'm sure some of you figured out you were gay after giving the opposite sex a try.  I've always been attracted to women, but after seeing a couple of gay guys at my high school, the thought crossed my mind.  Am I and I don't know it yet.  I had a close male friend at the time, and I did actually try to envision myself with him.  I thought it for a while.  But there was no way.  I just couldn't, and I left it at that.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think they ever heard a straight male be so open about gay thoughts.  From then on, they all seemed to relax around me.  Even as I was leaving, the kids and co-workers wanted to me to stay as an employee.

&amp;#x200B;

Jason taught me about how empathetic and accepting I am.  At a time when my soul was darkening, he and my one other close friend constantly reminded me of my identity. And Jason saved me.  He kept me afloat; he showed up one random night and pulled me up from drowning.

&amp;#x200B;

I never saw him again after I lost the apartment.  It sort of broke my heart that he just disappeared.  But I still cherish our time together.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been expected and I let them know a month ago I was planning on moving in.  


I graduated college a few months ago, got a full time job at my internship, and i plan to move in with my bf who I have been dating for 6 years.  


There are so many feelings...  


First off, when ever I tell my mom I'm staying over in person, she usually gives a semi-sad but mostly emotionless vibe, because I know she wants to see me.  


When I decided to follow up with I will be moving in soon, I got the same thing. just ""okay""...nothing else...  


I then decided to follow up with ""but i plan to have a weekly or bi-weekly dinner or something"" and she said ""okay...by the way we are going to watch the last baseball game together on Saturday.""  


okay...i wish she said more, but I definitely get the sad vibe, but she's not saying her thoughts...which bother me more.  


Other things to mention is that a lot of times I come home late and leave early for work or whatever and then see my bf which I feel like is more preferred because than she at least could see me and know what's going on. But I guess it's different if I am moving out. In a way I figured this is better, I can actually make time to talk and maybe play a board game vs just being home to sleep or what ever. I will also be 25 minutes away. So I tried to be positive with it all but I don't get to really any reaction.  


The other thing is, judging by her current life situation, which I don't want to go into details about, I can tell my moms depressed, but I also never really see that because when she gets to talk to me, I feel like she's happy because I am her son and she loves me. So I feel like I am taking that away with her where I will just make her feel more depressed.  


Besides that, from my standpoint, I've been living with her for 24 years, even through college. So this is a big change for me, and has been really difficult me to say.  


So I am just depressed about it all and I wish I got to hear more from my mother. I am going to make an effort to make me not sleeping there not matter, but it doesn't change the fact I just don't live there. I have no idea what to say or do. She hasn't been vocal and I just don't know how to feel. I wanna see her to but by how I schedule my time, since I sleep there, it's only there when my day is done and I'd rather actually put down time to talk, play games, or help her with the house...

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had a similar experience? I know I'm rambling...but I need someone else to talk to about their own experience if they had something similar...I'm just depressed about all this, but I know I have to move out at some point...Maybe I should have waited longer. I don't know...it's just a difficult feeling..."

**TL;DR - if the person is right, distance doesn't matter. Me \[24f\] and my boyfriend \[24m\] have a great LDR.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Our Story:

Long story short, I was deeply unhappy in a marriage. Ended up studying abroad in Japan to give myself a fresh start, as I just felt so stuck in life.

About halfway through my study abroad program, and I was feeling more confident and amazing than ever before, I thought it would be fun to try and meet someone. I downloaded Tinder and after a lot of conversation duds, I finally met a guy who I just immediately jelled with. I started talking to him on a Saturday and made plans to meet the next weekend, but because of what I actually think may have been a miscommunication due to my terrible Japanese, we ended up going out together that Monday!

It went amazing. He paid for my dinner and everything that night (which my ex NEVER did for me except special occasions) and we even hooked up that night. He held my hand and kissed me goodbye on the train (you have NO IDEA how rare that is of Japanese men!!). The next weekend we went out again as we had originally planned, and multiple other occasions throughout my last month over there. My last day there, he took the day off work to drop me off at the airport. God, I'll never forget that last hug.

I've never been smitten with someone so fast, and he felt the same way. So, we decided to stay together in an LDR. He's visiting me for New Years, already booked! Next summer, I'm going to do an internship program to be with him for 2 months. Once I graduate the year after, we're going to live together in Japan, hopefully in Osaka, but because he can transfer to his company's Tokyo office, maybe there instead.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why I love our LDR:

At this point, we've now been in an LDR almost twice as long as we were together. So while obviously nothing would make me happier than being together again, there are some positives that I want to share. Probably also courtesy of some New Relationship Energy, but these are basically unrelated positives.

1. We are building our relationship on a foundation of a lot of trust. Neither of us seem to be jealous of the other's friends. We love each other and have no choice but to trust the others' actions.
2. We are fiercely independent. I depended on my ex WAY TO MUCH and he couldn't provide the support I needed. I've gotten closer now with my own friends and have learned to do things on my own (i.e. travel, go to shows, bars, restaurants, etc). I usually text him while I'm out, and it's a really therapeutic experience. This is something I'd NEVER explore if I was dating someone locally.
3. We have great communication (despite a language barrier). I'm a bit of an introvert, so I tend to be a very indirect communicator. This has helped me learn to say exactly what I say and mean. Not to mention sexually - with my ex it was ALWAYS weird to talk dirty. In my LDR, we talked dirty right from the start, but it helps to normalize it even more for me which helps any nervous aversion that I have leftover.
4. I'm able to focus on my goals. I get distracted easily and this is a busy time for me. I'm self-studying Japanese, in my junior year of college taking 6 classes, working an internship. Especially with new relationships, I can't help but want to be with them all the time. Since I can't, I HAVE use my time to focus on my goals. Not to mention, I HAVE to reach my goals if I want to be with him full time. Talk about serious motivation.
5. We can't move too fast. With my ex, we ended up moving together after like 6 months together or less, I can't remember. This contributed to long term problems that I think I ignored because it felt so serious so soon. Even though we talk about our future all the time, we can't make any mistakes like this.

Thanks for reading, what are some things you love about your LDR?"

**Last Mitch Effort**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has given Dr. Christine Blasey Ford a Monday deadline to testify about her allegation that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her** when the two were in high school. ""She could do it privately if she prefers, or publicly if she prefers. Monday is her opportunity,” he said.       
               
**But in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley Tuesday night, Ford wisely [requested that the FBI investigate her allegation](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/politics/ford-letter-fbi/index.html?h_sid=699123454a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21641&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) before she appears, noting that** ""a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.""       
               
**Republicans are setting up a process designed to prop up Kavanaugh at Ford’s expense, and she is fighting for a level playing field.** Both President Trump and Grassley have said the FBI will not reopen Kavanaugh’s background check to investigate Ford’s accusation, which leaves the Senate as the only investigative body currently interested in the matter. Grassley has also stipulated that the Senate will only [speak to two witnesses](https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1042029347392180224): Ford and Kavanaugh.       
               
**Grassley could easily wait for an updated background check. He could also easily invite Kavanaugh’s friend Mark Judge, who allegedly witnessed the incident;** the other teenagers who were at the same gathering; and Ford’s friends and therapist, with whom she discussed the incident prior to Kavanaugh’s nomination to testify as well. But he refuses to take either step, and refuses to explain why.       
               
**However the hearing shakes out, Republicans are already laying the groundwork to support Kavanaugh:**       
                
- [Trump](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/politics/trump-kavanaugh-testimony/index.html?h_sid=699123454a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21641&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) said Kavanaugh is “not a man who deserves this.”       
                
- GOP judicial operative [Carrie Severino](https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/1042120034129080320) said the incident Ford describes might qualify as “rough horseplay.”       
               
- [Grassley](https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1042049695630192640) said, “I’d hate to…have somebody ask me what I did 35 years ago.” (He was serving as a U.S. Senator.)       
               
**Republicans are offering a buffet of excuses:** He didn’t do it, but if he did do it, it might have been [rough housing](https://www.businessinsider.com/brett-kavanaugh-allegations-sexual-assault-judicial-crisis-network-2018-9?h_sid=699123454a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21641&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). And even if it was attempted rape, it was a [long time ago](https://twitter.com/laurenegambino/status/1041759000910614528). What matters is marching toward confirmation, not assessing the truth of whether Kavanaugh deserves a seat on the highest court, or if he’s a serial liar credibly accused of sexual assault. It’s pure partisanship and the desire to win at all costs.       
               
**From Brian:** The subtext of the Republican response to the Kavanaugh allegation—from trying to rig the Senate inquiry, to their conflicting arguments about the significance of Kavanaugh’s guilt or innocence—is that they aren’t confident in his denial. At all. Republicans are currently at risk of losing not just a fifth anti-abortion justice, but Congress, and possibly the entire Trump presidency. They are doing whatever they can to stave off a worst-case scenario, and that includes this grotesque abuse of power aimed at silencing and discrediting Christine Blasey Ford on behalf of a man they believe may have assaulted her.

9h3ffq,0,2018-09-19,My mom's affair with another man [MF],Kimmy-Trini,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/9h3ffq/my_moms_affair_with_another_man_mf/,"
Hello guys. This is Aditya. I am about to narrate stories of my mommy's relationship with my best friend's dad. Me and Tariq were in final year of engineering and he often used to live with me and my mom. My mom treated him as a son and we all were in good bond. I lived in a flat having a room and a hall along with balcony, kitchen and washroom. Me and Tariq often slept in hall and mommy used to sleep inside the room. 

My mom was in her mid 40's and was a very beautiful north Indian lady. As we lived in Bangalore, she looked odd with her fair skin. She used to wear old ethnic and western outfit. At home she used to wear tops with shorts and sleep in nighties. Since she was a bit shy minded, she always liked talking to us only in hall and not in room. She used to keep privacy with herself. I knew Tariq called her aunty but had cozy feelings for her from inside. Once, he told me that my mom is much hotter and younger than her's. We even used to watch mature porn. I knew he had fantasies for her. 

Once, he invited us to his place for dinner. We all got together. My mom and his mom became friends and slowly started meeting regularly. His dad too became friend's with my mom. He used to visit our place for evening snacks and leave along with Tariq at night. He was in his early 60's and almost 15 years elder to my mom. He was bald, kept a big white beard and was very fair. Both Tariq and his dad were body builders and so had a muscular body. And both were 6 feet in height. His dad was more bulky than him though. I was a bit shorter than Tariq and my mom was around 5'6"". And 65 kg weight. 

Tariq's family was a rich Bangalore family and had a big bungalow in a posh locality. Tariq's dad was a smoker and looked deadly in white beard and bald head with aviator sunglasses and a thick gold chain around his neck. He even occasionally drank and was a very exciting person to talk to. My mom was reserved and talked less.

Tariq had an internship in Mumbai and left for a fortnight. Me and mom were sad because both of us missed him. Me and mom planned for a movie during the weekend. We both had some quality time together and then returned back. My mom wasn't fully happy as it looked. As we returned, I found tariq's dad was waiting outside. He got some fruits for us from his orchard and then started to leave. My mom told him to wait as she wanted him to join for dessert which she had cooked during day. She looked happy in tauseef uncle's company. We then together started going out manyatimes in his car. We went to parks for outings, movies, shopping etc. I knew uncle liked my mom. He once gifted mom with an expensive necklace too. My dad never did. My mom too liked tariq's dad. Although he was 15 years elder than her. 

I should mention one thing that my mom was devoid of sex life as she used to have it only when we went to our native. She wasn't happy with that too as I noticed my dad couldn't last long and their door used to open up in minutes. 

Tariq's dad once got a classic music show ticket for us. I wasn't interested in going so I denied. They both left in his car in the evening. I got jinxed with whether leaving mommy alone with uncle wasn't a great idea but at the same time she needed some time out without parenthood and live her personal life. Both uncle and mommy looked like a couple that time really with uncle in jeans and a tshirt and my mom in a blue capry and a formal white shirt. She looked gorgeous. Both left for the show and I slept for a while as I was tired of collegework. 

Mom returned around 11 pm and went to sleep. She looked a bit tired. I also slept as next day was college. I left in the morning and went to college . That day there was an early dispersal because of some strike and returned early. When I returned I saw tariq's dad's car downstairs. I also went upstairs. 

I opened up the gate and I was a bit surprised to see my mom's room locked from inside. I doubted a bit. I really thought what was going on. I sneaked in from the keyhole and I was shocked. 

I saw uncle in underwear and mom was completely naked. They thought I wasn't going to come early. A porn movie was going on in the desktop screen too. Uncle started to lick mommy's toes. He licked her neck and stomach. My mom was fully excited. I was finding it an odd situation though my dick too started to erect. Uncle liplocked mummy with his bald head and white beard. My mom's tongue was repeatedly being licked by uncle. 

Mommy then started touching uncle's penis. She put her hand inside his underwear. She took it out. It was huge. Maybe thrice my size. Uncle too with his muscular body lifted mommy upside down and now went behind the back part. He first kissed her legs then started licking her asshole. He went hard with this. I could hear my mom's moans. Uncle was a big dirty horny guy. Now he lifted mommy with his hand with her arms on his shoulders and inserted his dick in her hairy pussy. He started banging her hard now. Mom with her screams was having a time of her life. Uncle's rod was so big that it wasn't going inside the pussy properly. Mom was ripped with his monster dick. They started to ease up a bit as both had cummed by now. Both then went to the toilet together. 

Meantime, I got time to hide under the almirah and did so. Both returned back with mom's happy face and she looked ready for more. Now both went on bed in 69 position with mom on top. I fantasized it earlier but I was witnessing it in real. Uncle then went on top and but his huge clock in mom's mouth and began licking her pussy. He then started milking her boobs and vigorously licking it. I was amazed to see my mom's boobs. They were sexy boobs. 

Mom cummed again as uncle licked her pussy badly. He was still going hard with his dick in her mouth. Mom tried to resist a bit. But he didn't stop. He then took her dick out without cumming. 

Mom was aware by now that she was being fucked by an insane sex addict. She told her to stop for a while. Uncle stopped and lighted up his smoke. Mommy was down and out. 

Now he put his penis in her asshole. When mom took it out, he held her completely so that she couldn't move. He again inserted it in her asshole. Now I could hear my mommy's real painful scream. She was down but again got energised and began loosening her ass. She liked it by now. Uncle went berserk and cummed in her asshole. I could see the sperm coming out of mommy's asshole. Both were completely wet in sweat. Mom was completely done and uncle too after cleaning up a bit left too.

I never really talked about this to mom. But told to Tariq when he returned. He replied that he too doubted all this from the starting. 

After some days, uncle took us to a forest lodge in his car. It was his own lodge and we four went there. I told Tariq to stay with me and give the elder couple their time. Around midnight after dinner, he took mom to a backyard place in the lodge. Me and Tariq too followed hiding ourselves. He made my mom lay in a dog's position in naked. I could see my friend tariq's horny stairs at my mom and also saw his dick peeping out of his boxers. Tariq told his dad was very horny and was going to go dirty with my mom. 
Uncle pissed on mom and told her to shit. He wanted a clean asshole. Mommy farted a bit but couldn't poop. Uncle then started licking her asshole and then put his rod inside her asshole. They went with this for a long time as mommy by now loved ass fucking more. I guess they observed some presence, maybe ours. So slowly with his dick inserted inside her ass, he lifted her straight to the bedroom. After that we couldn't observe"

 **Don’t miss one of the most heartwarming young adult novels of the year. Perfect for fans of** ***Water for Elephants*****,** ***Wonder*** **and** ***All the Bright Places*****,** ***When Elephants Fly*** **shows that how we choose to live our lives matters, and that there are some battles worth fighting even if it means losing yourself.**   


T. Lily Decker is a high school senior with a twelve-year plan: avoid stress, drugs, alcohol and boyfriends, and take regular psych quizzes administered by her best friend, Sawyer, to make sure she’s not developing schizophrenia.  


Genetics are not on Lily’s side. When she was seven, her mother, who had paranoid schizophrenia, tried to kill her. And a secret has revealed that Lily’s odds are even worse than she thought. Still, there’s a chance to avoid triggering the mental health condition, if Lily can live a careful life from ages eighteen to thirty, when schizophrenia most commonly manifests.  


But when a newspaper internship results in Lily witnessing a mother elephant try to kill her three-week-old calf, Swifty, Lily can’t abandon the story or the calf. With Swifty in danger of dying from grief, Lily must choose whether to risk everything, including her sanity and a first love, on a desperate road trip to save the calf’s life, perhaps finding her own version of freedom along the way.

9h3nio,6,2018-09-19,Summer's Last Gasp [MF] [Outdoor] [Romance],JackFisherBooks,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/9h3nio/summers_last_gasp_mf_outdoor_romance/,"Summer Reya wasn’t used to warm weather going away. She’d grown up a tropical climate where a “chilly day” was anything under 60 degrees or made wearing flip-flops uncomfortable. Then, three critical events changed her life.

First, she got a scholarship to a major university up north. That was a big deal for her and her family. Neither of her parents had gone to college and she was the first of three siblings to attend. The move was supposed to be temporary. Then, the second critical event happened.

She got an internship that turned into a career. While in school, she started working for an up-and-coming biotech company. That company grew quickly and before she graduated, they offered her a full-time position, complete with benefits and a fat salary. Summer still remembered gasping in disbelief when she saw her first paycheck.

That kept her up north a little longer. Eventually, she still wanted to move back home. Then, the final – and, by every measure, the most critical – event happened. She fell in love. That effectively changed her plans for good.

“I can already feel it,” Summer said distantly as she admired the setting sun in the distance. “The extra chill in the air…the lack of humidity at this time of day…even the smell of the wind.”

“Are you telling me you can actually smell winter?” said a humored, but loving voice. “For some people, that counts as a super-power.”

“There’s nothing powerful about it. It’s just one part of my life reminding me of another…the past affecting me in the present.”

“Does it make you feel homesick?”

“It used to,” she conceded, “but then I met you.”

With a smile that could’ve warmed any climate, she turned towards the figure who had done so much to keep her warm. Unlike her, Christopher Bennet was used to the cold weather. He’d spent most of his life up north, enduring harsh winters and never using sub-zero temperatures as excuses. Bearing a thick beard, a rugged complexion, and broad muscles that he’d forged working at rock quarries, he looked like a man who could handle harsh conditions.

That was just one of the many things that had attracted her to him. She’d met Chris in college. In fact, during the first major snowstorm she’d endured, he came by and shoved the driveway of the crowded townhouse she’d shared with three other women. Seeing him brave that storm in nothing but a sweat-shirt while she wore three layers to stay warm impressed her. That one impression led to so much more.

“You don’t have to worry, Summer. You know I’ll keep you warm this winter,” Chris told her as he tightened his embrace on her.

“You always do,” she said as she ran her hands through that thick beard of his, “even though I don’t make it easy for you.”

“I don’t mind the challenge. You help keep me on my toes. I need that in my line of work.”

“A guy who works in a quarry needs a woman who works in a climate-controlled office…there’s just something so fitting about that.”

“I know. You know how to endure the heat. I know how to handle the cold. But together…we find a way.”

He smiled back at her before kissing her softly. Summer gladly returned the gesture. At the same time, a sharp gust of wind blew over them. It was the coldest gust she’d felt since March. It was as though nature itself was warning her that she was going to need her husband’s ability to keep her warm for the next several months. It was one of those warnings that she didn’t mind heeding.

Sitting in his lap, straddling his waist atop a picnic blanket, Chris imparted plenty of warmth and not just in terms of body heat. They had taken a trip to the top of an isolated hill that overlooked the small pond at the north end of their neighborhood. It was one of those places that most people didn’t know was there, which made it even more special to them. From it, they could see the sunset, the trees, and the lights from the downtown area in the distance.

She and Chris had discovered it on their third date. Since then, they’d made it a point to visit their secret hilltop, as they called it, on the last weekend of summer. It signaled the end of days where they could just lounge around in swimsuits and shorts. In the weeks to come, she would have to break out the sweaters, sweatshirts, and jackets that she never had to wear back home. It was bittersweet, but Chris made it worthwhile.

In addition, their little end-of-summer picnic had another important tradition that she was eager to get to. Based on the way Chris felt her up as he kissed her, he shared in that eagerness. Wearing only flip-flops, jean shorts, and an under-sized T-shirt – her preferred attire for hot, muggy weather – it didn’t take long before a different kind of heat consumed them.

“Speaking of finding a way,” Summer said, their lips parting while they remained in a tight embrace, “I think we’ve got one more heat wave to enjoy before I pack away my bikinis.”

“I love the way you think, Summer,” Chris said with a grin.

“It’s going to get cold tomorrow…the first of many,” she said.

“I saw the weather forecast too. I know how it works in these parts. We’re in for a long winter.”

“Which is why we should make this the hottest night of the year,” she said seductively, already trailing her fingers through his messy hair. “If it’s going to be the last one, I want to make it count!”

“And we will,” he replied, matching her seductive undertone. “That’s why before that sun sets, I’m going to make love to you in a way that’ll keep us warm until next spring!”

“Is that a promise, my love?”

“I don’t make promises, Summer. I just tell the woman I love what I’m going to do. Then, I do it!”

There was such certainty and intent in his words. Chris was not the kind of man to make bold promises that he didn’t meet. He said what he meant and meant what he said. No matter the weather, he didn’t let it change his intent, even when it came to making love to her.

Like a man on a mission, he began doing as he said he would. He kissed her passionately, his tongue quickly becoming entwined with hers in an outburst of passion. As he tasted her lips, he laid her down on the oversized picnic blanket, shoving aside the cooler and lunch bags. Summer, her arms and legs still wrapped around his imposing form, soaked up the warmth of his love. With the sun setting fast and the summer warmth already fading, there was a growing sense of urgency.

With the energy of two horny teenagers on prom night, she and Chris made out atop the picnic blanket. They kissed and touched with such intensity, his hands roaming freely up her womanly curves while hers slipped under that dirty T-shirt of his to feel those masculine sinews. With that intensity came heat and before long, clothing became a burden.

“Off!” Summer gasped as her love kissed down her neck. “Please, Chris…get these clothes off!”

Without saying a word, her husband stripped her naked on the spot. He wasn’t playful about it, either. He swiftly pulled her shirt off over her head, undid her bra with ease, and pulled her shorts down her legs, panties and all. The feeling of the cool, evening air grazing over her naked skin sent shivers throughout her body, contrasting with the heat they’d created. Those shivers didn’t last long, though.

As soon as he tossed her shorts and underwear aside, Chris shed his clothes rapidly. He didn’t even care that he threw his shirt into a patch of mud near the blanket. Nothing was going to keep him from capturing the last bit of summer heat.

“Feeling chilly?” he teased.

“A little,” Summer quipped coyly.

“I can tell,” he said, giving her hardened nipples a slight pinch. “Don’t worry. Things are about to get hot…very, very hot.”

He laid down on top of her, naked skin pressing against naked skin. He kissed down her neck as well, evoking a light gasp as intimate touch triggered intimate sensations of all kinds. Again, Summer embraced him with her arms and legs. Without the burden of clothes, her breasts pressed up against his chest, her nailed raked along his bare back, and his growing manhood rubbed up against the heat building between her inner thighs.

From there, their outdoor make-out session evolved into full-blown foreplay. Chris rubbed her breasts, squeezed her butt, and slithered his tongue around her face and lips. Summer returned the favor, running her fingers through his hair and whispering words of lurid passion into his ear.

“I want you, Chris,” she told him in her most seductive voice. “I want you inside me…that big, hard cock inside my hot, wet pussy. I want you to fill me with your sex…and your love.”

Summer felt his manhood stiffen faster. Chris had always been fond of dirty talk. She just what to say and how to say it get his blood flowing in the right direction. As he neared full arousal, he stepped up their foreplay, working his hands over her exposed flesh and allowing the weight of his body to press against her.

It was like wearing a blanket of warm, manly flesh. Even with a chill in the air, it still felt like a muggy day at the beach, especially between her legs. It was a powerful feeling, her husband making out with her in a naked heap. Something about it – being outside in the elements, feeling the shifting winds of the season, and warming one another with their passions – triggered an arousal within her hotter than any approaching winter.

“Are you ready to really heat things up?” Chris whispered, his member now fully erect and pressing against her inner thighs.

“Yes!” Summer said without hesitation. “I’m ready, Chris. Please…make me feel hot.”

Already covered in a light sweat, she braced for more heat as her lover ignited the final proverbial spark.

Shifting his grip to her thighs, he rose up slightly and positioned himself between her legs. Then, with his masculine body glowing in the light of the sunset, he entered her. Almost immediately, Summer felt a surge of hot sensations.

“Hot enough, yet?” Chris said in a husky tone.

“Ooh, yes!” she moaned.

“Good,” he said, “but I’m not convinced.”

Spoken like a dedicated worker/lover, he began making love to her at a fervent pace. He dug his knees and feet into the ground, giving himself extra leverage as he worked his hips with power and passion. In and out, his manhood slithered inside her, hot flesh embracing hot flesh. The end result was equally hot sensations that mirrored their shared desire for one last heat wave before winter.

She moaned in delight as those desires were realized. She did not mute herself in the slightest, her cries of passion echoing into the twilight. She knew how much Chris loved to hear her moan during sex. They motivated him even more, inspiring the kind of determined grunts that radiated with strength and vigor.

“Chris…ohhh Chris!” Summer exclaimed. “I feel it…so hard… so hot!”

“That’s…what I want,” he gasped in between grunts. “I want…to make you…hot.”

“You are! You make me…so hot!”

That heated proclamation took on a literal and figurative sense. She could already feel the sweat from his body mixing with hers, the results of their heated lovemaking taking a very tangible form. She could also feel an orgasm coming strong.

When it hit, there was no warning. Summer rarely had to tell her lover when she was on the brink of orgasm. She made it exceedingly obvious in other ways.

“Oohhh fuck yes!” she cried out.

In an instant, that warm feeling she and Chris had created with their love became a burning ecstasy that shot through her body like a wave on a tropical beach. For Summer, having spent much of her life on those beaches, it was extra satisfying. Beyond the raw pleasure, though, there was more to the feeling. Between the picturesque setting and the prospect of limited heat over the winter, the moment was extra meaningful.

“Yeah…I’d say that’s hot enough,” Chris said.

Had she not been immersed in pure euphoria, Summer would’ve laughed. For a brief moment, the winds, the birds, and the bugs were all temporarily muted as she soaked in the feeling. Her eyes closed, her back arched, and she squeezed her bouncing breasts, creating the kind of spectacle that always gave Chris pause, even in the midst of passion.

Even in her blissful daze, he leaned in and kissed her. His naked, sweaty body now on top of her once more, the flesh kept that passionate heat going. The air around them felt as warm and muggy as a sunny day in July. In that moment, it felt like summer again.

“God, you’re beautiful,” Chris told her. “No matter how hot or cold it is…you never cease to astound me, Summer.”

“Speak for yourself, my darling,” she replied. “I swear you can make the coldest winter feel like a trip to the beach.”

“What can I say? I’m a man of many talents,” he teased.

“And I’m a woman who loves to nurture that talent,” she quipped, “and in case you haven’t noticed…the sun hasn’t fully set.”

“Believe me, I noticed!”

Grinning playfully, they kissed again and the lovemaking resumed. If that evening was going to be their last taste of summer heat – literally, to a large extent – then they might as well enjoy every last second of it.

Since her husband had been so dedicated to warming her body and spirit, Summer decided to return the favor. His rigid member still inside her throbbing folds, she grabbed him by the shoulders and turned him over so that she was on top of him. From there, she began riding his cock, quickly re-establishing the same vigorous rhythm he’d so passionately demonstrated with her.

“From now…until the sun disappears,” she said, “we keep making love!”

“That a…challenge?” said Chris, already panting heavily.

“No, my love…a promise!”

She sealed that promise with another kiss. He sealed it too by wrapping her in his arms again, holding their naked bodies close as they danced the lover’s dance together in the diminishing twilight.

From there, a fresh round of heat surrounded them. More hot sensations followed, supplemented by a steady progression of moans and gasps that echoed throughout the surrounding woods. There was nothing fancy or theatric about their lovemaking. It was just the kind of raw, directed passion that could shelter any lovers from the approaching cold.

If the goal was to just keep the fire going and work up more sweat, then they definitely succeeded. Guided by love and a shared desire to sustain the heat, they pushed the limits of their stamina, sexual and otherwise.

After riding his cock for a good long while, they just rolled around atop the blanket, going at it from various positions. They didn’t get too elaborate. Summer didn’t have to test any of her old gymnastic skills. There was a common theme to it, though. Every position was one that maximized body contact, ensuring naked skin rubbed against naked skin. Friction made heat. Heat made more sweat. Together, it made for hotter sex.

It led to more orgasms along the way, complete with more proclamations of ecstasy that stirred the surrounding wildlife. Summer swore the trees trembled as she and Chris rocked the area with their lovemaking. It was as though their passions were fueled by the last gasp of the summer season, the energy flowing into their naked bodies and guiding them through one last round of heat.

“Chris…my warmth…my love,” Summer gasped through the intimate daze.

“Summer…my favorite time of the year!” Chris replied with a beaming smile.

She smiled back and kissed him again, pushing her physical limits to keep the passion going. Chris stayed with her every step of the way, showing off the stamina that had made for so many hot nights. It was a testament to his dedication, doing what he had to do to keep the heat flowing and deliver to her what he promised.

Keeping that promise soon took on a greater sense of urgency. Summer could see the sun was just about to set over the horizon. The final light of the season was about to disappear. That gave them a small window with which to make that moment count. She was on the brink of another orgasm. For the final push, though, she wanted her lover to share it.

“Chris, I…I’m close again,” Summer told him.

“Me too, Summer,” Chris said through labored grunts. “I…I’m so close!”

“Please…come with me. In one more taste of summer…let’s come together.”

As she said those desperate words, he caressed her face while she clung to his neck, holding on for one last rush of summer heat. Their eyes locked, the glimmer of the sun fading fast, they pushed their bodies and souls to that special threshold. It was like the end of a journey, but one they could only finish together.

When they finally crossed that line, she and Chris let out a shared cry of ecstasy. A wave of warm, unabated pleasure consumed their sweat-covered bodies in harmonious release of passion. She threw her head back while he buried his face in her neck, the sounds of their love mixing with the gusts.

For a brief moment, time stood still. It was like the entire season of summer had stopped just to tell her and Chris goodbye. From her position, Summer could see the sun disappear over the horizon one last time. With her lover in her arms, his embrace keeping her so warm, she smiled at the fading twilight. As much as she loved the warm weather, she had no doubt she and Chris could endure any winter.

With the sun now set, she and Chris collapsed atop the blanket. Their bodies parted, but they remained in each other’s embrace, lying side-by-side and absorbing the lingering warmth of their passion. Together, they had forged a special warmth through the rhythm of love and sex. It felt like a fitting celebration for the final days of summer.

“I love you, Chris,” she said to him.

“I love you too, Summer,” he told her.

“Thank you for keeping me warm. Thank you for making every day feel like summer!”"

before I’m talking about the topic I want to present myself first. I’m 26 year old, I live in Frankfort, Germany and I’m studying computer science right there. I got my bachelor of science this year and I’m interested in an internship outside from Germany. 
Obviously the first country that came in my mind is USA. I love the states even if I haven’t been there once (sadly). One of my favorite cities of the US is Boston. Probably because of the sport teams which I’m a big fan of or maybe just because of reasons, don’t know. I like the people from Boston, how passionate they are about their city and  I like the history of the city. 

However I want to make work experience in computer science (especially in software engineering) and improving my English ofc. I’m looking for informations about internships in Boston. Are there companies that you can suggest? Do you know people that have done this aswell and can give some tips? Is there maybe a programm that helps people who want to do smt like this? How much do companies pay for an internship? How much does a small apartment in Boston cost, in general how difficult is to find a good apartment for the time of 6 months - 1 year? Any thing I need to know about the us, the people from Boston or what I should avoid? Is it common that people do things like this? 

I think that should be all the questions right know, I will probably add some more. 

Thank you very much for your help :)"

Her friends are all cool guys, and I am able to communicate alright with them, but when they start to discuss school and internships and all the fuss, from time to time I start to feel like a worthless pos. It doesn't help that we are basically in the same field, although slightly different areas, so I know what they are talking about, and some of the subjects they discuss at ease are exactly what I was struggling with and what partly led to me dropping out.

I'd say I'm a little bit more grown up than them, having a full-time job, owning a car, living separately, speaking english fluently and all that, so it's not like I feel completely intimidated, and I communicate alright with all of them, but they will graduate and do everything I do now, and have significantly more successful careers almost instantly, and I still will be the same old dumb me without clear future.

Any opinion on how to fix the situation or my attitude to it, or any opinion on the situation at all? Thanks"

het bericht ‘Fiscus blijft informatie achterhouden in rechtszaken om  
kinderopvangtoeslag’ &amp;#40;ingezonden 19 september 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1      
Herinnert u zich dat u in de beantwoording op eerdere Kamervragen heeft  
aangegeven dat de Belastingdienst zich in het bestuursrecht vanzelfsprekend  
zal houden aan de uitleg van de Hoge Raad, die in het onderhavige geval  
inhoudt dat de Belastingdienst alle op de zaak hebbende stukken zal  
overleggen &amp;#40;de uitleg daarvan van de Hoge Raad is als volgt: ""Tot de op de  
zaak betrekking hebbende stukken behoren niet slechts de stukken die de  
inspecteur heeft gebruikt ter onderbouwing van zijn besluit. Daartoe  
behoren in beginsel ook stukken als hiervoor onder i&amp;#41; en ii&amp;#41; bedoeld die de  
inspecteur wel ter beschikking staan of hebben gestaan maar die hij niet  
heeft gebruikt ter onderbouwing van zijn besluit""&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
2     
Betekent dit dus dat als de telefoonnotities toegevoegd dienen te worden,  
alle telefoonnotities toegevoegd dienen te worden &amp;#40;tenzij een beroep gedaan  
wordt op artikel 8:29 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek, waarbij de  
Belastingdienst gemotiveerd aangeeft waarom bepaalde stukken niet verschaft  
worden of alleen aan de rechter gegeven worden&amp;#41;?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3      
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het artikel in Trouw: “Fiscus blijft informatie  
achterhouden in rechtszaken om kinderopvangtoeslag”? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
4     
Klopt het dat de fiscus niet alle telefoonnoties in het dossier gestopt  
heeft in de onderhavige casus?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5     
Wilt u controleren of alle gespreksnotities overhandigd zijn en een lijst  
geven van de telefoonnotities, die niet overhandigd zijn? Wilt u dan vooral  
kijken naar bijvoorbeeld notities met de data 10 juli 2014 en 9 december  
2014?  
&amp;nbsp;    
6      
Klopt het dat op 9 december 2014 bij de notitie staat: “LET OP!: Burger  
niet melden dat er sprake was van rechtsmatigheidsonderzoek ivm verhoogd  
toezicht. Bij bezwaar, klacht of andere afwijkende behandeling &amp;#40;waarbij  
sprake is van toekenning&amp;#41;, dient de behandelaar contact op te nemen met het  
IST team via Toeslagen IST CAF_Postbus. Beoordeling CAF11, geen toekenning,  
bewijsstukken niet akkoord”?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7      
Deelt u de mening dat deze notities gewoon aan de rechter voorgelegd hadden  
moeten worden en dat het aan de rechter &amp;#40;en dus niet aan de  
Belastingdienst&amp;#41; is om te bepalen of zij relevant zijn voor de zaak?  
&amp;nbsp;    
8      
Klopt het dat de Belastingdienst tijdens de zitting verklaarde dat het de  
bevindingen van 30 september 2014, waarin stond dat er recht was op  
zorgtoeslag, niet in het dossier gedaan had 'omdat het niet relevant was  
voor de beslissing om toeslag stop te zetten'?  
&amp;nbsp;    
9     
Deelt u de mening dat het aan de rechter en aan de rechter alleen is om te  
bepalen of dit stuk relevant is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
Wilt u de antwoorden op vragen 13, 14, en 15 herzien die vragen naar  
interne instructies om onder andere toeslagen niet toe te kennen? U  
ontkende dat ze bestonden, maar misschien ligt dat nu genuanceerder? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
Wilt u zich niet verbergen bij het antwoorden achter het feit dat het een  
lopende zaak is, aangezien het juist dan belangrijk is dat alle stukken op  
tafel liggen tijdens de rechtszaak en de rechter op basis van álle stukken  
een besluit kan nemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
Is het in het CAF11-dossier vaker gebeurd dat niet alle stukken zijn  
overlegd aan de rechter?  
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
Welke maatregelen neemt u naar aanleiding van het achterhouden van notities  
bij de rechter, tegen het arrest van de Hoge Raad in en tegen uw belofte  
aan de Kamer?  
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
Wat kan een burger &amp;#40;of bedrijf&amp;#41; doen wanneer hij vermoedt dat de  
Belastingdienst niet alle stukken overlegt bij de rechter in het  
bestuursrecht? Heeft de burger op dit moment enig rechtsmiddel?  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
 Is het hier gesignaleerde probleem een incidenteel probleem of een  
structureel probleem?  
&amp;nbsp;    
16  
Kunt u garanderen dat de Belastingdienst telkens het volledige dossier aan  
de rechter voorlegt? Welke acties zult u ondernemen om daarvoor te zorgen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
17  
Wilt u nog dat ik u herinner aan het feit dat:  
-  de Nationale ombudsman in 2017 in deze zaak concludeerde: “Toeslagen  
heeft een groot aantal gezinnen door zijn onevenredig harde aanpak in  
financiële problemen gebracht en hun vertrouwen geschonden. Het is aan  
Toeslagen om het geschonden vertrouwen te herstellen. De Nationale  
ombudsman beveelt Toeslagen aan om de vraagouders die overlast hebben  
ondervonden door de aanpak van Toeslagen excuses aan te bieden en een  
tegemoetkoming te bieden voor het aangedane leed”, maar dat tot nu toe geen  
enkele ouder een tegemoetkoming is aangeboden? 3&amp;#41; 4&amp;#41;;   
- bij het niet melden van de zelfevaluatie CAF11 toen om een intern  
onderzoek gevraagd werd &amp;#40;omdat dat twee verschillende dingen zouden zijn&amp;#41;?;  
- u eerst meldde dat er maar vier stukken waren en later nog twee andere  
stukken vond en die moest nasturen? 5&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
18  
 Bij hoeveel ouders is de kinderopvangtoeslag op vergelijkbare wijze  
stopgezet in 2014 en 2015? Kunt u aangeven hoe die zaken zijn afgehandeld?  
19  
Bent u bereid om de gang van zaken rond het stopzetten van de  
kinderopvangtoeslag nader te onderzoeken en hier serieuze openbare lessen  
uit te trekken?  
&amp;nbsp;

9h5r9k,1,2018-09-19,I like this girl,ReddKral,love,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/9h5r9k/i_like_this_girl/," 

Dear brothers and sisters from Reddit,

The daughter of the girlfriend of my mother. Which I only know from face never spoked to. However lately we ran into each other a lot. Most of the time in the train and she kept looking at me when noticing me....

So I added her on Linkedin and after she viewed my profile. I saw her again at the restaurant of the company where we follow an internship. She looked at me and at that moment I was on the phone and could not say HI...

She is really cute and I always fail to get the girl I like somehow, but get attraction from women I am not into. What should I do???"
9h726h,1,2018-09-19,Issue with employer,HummingFolly,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9h726h/issue_with_employer/,"So this is a long one,

I’m currently employed for a retail company where I’ve worked for about 7 years. Of that time I was in a management position for roughly 3 years. I’m going back to school so stepped down from management and went back into being a full time employee. I asked 5 months ago if I could be brought down to 4 days of work to help with school to which they complied and even made the agreement to keep my hours at least 32 to stay in full time status. 4 shifts at 9 hours (minus 1 hour lunch) where the other full timers work 5 shifts at 7 1/2 hours for 35 hours total (1/2 hour lunch). 

I was called into the office the other day by my new manager  because they wanted me to change my availability to incorporate a 5th day even though  this contradicted my previous agreement with my former manager. The main message that she was getting across was they were trying to make it fair and level set it across all full timers and that it was unfair that I only work 4 days. I’ll spare the finer detail of our conversation because they were a lot irregularities in her statements and what I know to be true (I knew the policies as a manager). If I don’t open up to 5 days then I can’t be full time anymore which means I lose all my benefits. She also said that my hours would no longer be protected so I could be susceptible to cuts. 

I know that a requirement of a full timer is to have 5 days of availability but I thought I had come to an agreement with my former manager whom said she spoken to the district manager about our agreement. Though when discussing this the other day he exclaimed that he had no idea of the details of our agreement. 

My main struggle is opening up my availability, 4 days of work is just enough for me to pay my bills, and have some money for savings and expenses of life. I don’t go out and blow my money but I don’t want to be in a tight spot every week. I need the extra time to work on school work and it’s only going to get more difficult the further into my studies i go. Unfortunately not working is not an option but I don’t want to go back to part time because of the loss of benefits and the uncertainty of hours is unsettling. It’s not the end of the world but it could be a very hard hit. 

I’m weighing my options to see if I should get another job all together, or stay. And if stay I’ll have to decide as what, I might be able to work 5 days but I’m not sure. With school some weeks are tougher than others. My main goal was to work for a few more months maybe a year more before I start applying for internships. I know that the internships won’t have benefits or vacation time but that’s something I’m planning for when it happens. I also hoped to be in a better position when I left for internships. 

Other little issues that bother me in this situation is how Two-Faced my company is. I know that nothing was in writing so technically there’s no obligations but I changed my availability and my school around this deal. Now they’ve changed their mind and I have to scramble to make a decision that benefits them. I know they run a business and they have to think of the needs of the business but I just feel used. I’ve worked there for so long and I feel like I’ve given them so much. All I want is for a little consideration but they couldn’t do it. During my conversation it felt like I was talking to wall she made her decision and nothing I said would change her mind it was basically comply or lose. What irritated me about that was how defensive she seemed and blocked off to what I was saying but had the nerve to make comments about how I was overreacting. 

I know that when are emotions get the better of us It’s hard to hide it and I’m very expressive on my face. It’s just very disheartening when management or people in higher authority can say and be whatever they want but you can’t react. If you react or show any sign of discomfort or disagreement you’re shut down and seen as disgruntled. I feel like this technique is used a lot in my location but I could be bias (lol)

I guess I’m ranting and looking for advice, should I keep my head down and comply, hoping school doesn’t get out of hand; stay but take the cut in hours and benefits now so school is still protected or leave for somewhere else and start fresh, I won’t have benefits and the hours may vary too but I could be doing something else with my life potentially gaining new skills or finding something with better pay to make up the difference. 

Thanks in advance guys sorry if it was too long I just needed to vent. 

TLDR;
Boss told me to change my availability or lose full time even though I had made an agreement with the previous manager to work my limited availability and still be full time. "

I graduated with a degree in Data Science from *a top university* (generalizing for others) just a few months ago and have since applied to 25+ entry-level Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles with little to no success. My skillset aligns with the qualifications asked of most entry-level positions (Proficiencies in R, Python, C++, SQL, ML,  Data Mining, Data Visualization/Reporting, Advanced Statistical Analysis, and so on..). However, my biggest obstacle seems to be my lack of professional industry experience as most ""entry-level"" positions list that they want 3-5+ years of industry experience. 

**The question I would like to address:** *With only an undergraduate degree in Data Science how can I build professional industry experience to find myself being legitimately considered for entry-level positions?*  

Some solutions I've considered:

- Working Independently on projects (thinking Kaggle Competitions) and adding them to a personal portfolio to send to recruiters along with my resume.  

- Applying to startups 

- Starting with an internship (This is less than ideal as nobody wants to intern post-grad but is coming closer to being a reality) 

If anyone else has suggestions or solutions to add it would certainly help me and hopefully others in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all!

&amp;#x200B;

I've received an offer from Lockheed Martin to join their Software Engineering team and am super excited! They will have internal work for me to do while I wait on my clearance, but I'm a little nervous about going through the process of federal investigation. Here's the details:

\-Received a reckless driving ticket in late 2014 I believe. Have gotten one more traffic violation in mid-2016, but that case was dismissed. Never had another issue with driving.

\-Was admitted into a mental institute when I was 17 in the summer of 2015 for family reasons/potential for self harm. Was let out early after family counseling, and willingly took self counseling about a year later. Issue has never resurfaced and my family and I are closer than ever and a huge reason why I am here today.

\-Have been arrested once for underage possession of alcohol at the age of 18 in Dec 2015. Pleaded not guilty I believe, took a VASAP course (Virginia alcohol awareness class), and got it expunged from my record recently. It was my first semester in college, and since then I've joined multiple organizations and have focused on my schoolwork in order to better spend my time. Have never had another serious run in with the law after this.

\-I've smoked marijuana about 11 times in my life, last being December of 2017. I stopped after I was applying to a nuclear energy company as an intern and didn't want anything silly to affect my career. I passed their background screening no problem, but I did not have to get a security clearance for the work I was doing. Have never done other illegal drugs. I have no intention of smoking again in the future, and the people who smoked around me are no longer in my inner circle (my roommate who left school in Sept 2017, and a few friends back home who I don't speak or see that often.) I drink occasionally with friends despite being 20 years old.

Aside from that, I've got excellent credit and financial history, and I am sure I can find as many trustworthy references that they need- professional, personal, or academic. I am a naturalized citizen (born in India) but I have renounced my Indian citizenship. In the past 7 years, I've visited the following countries in order: India, England, Ireland, France, the Bahamas, Canada (all for family vacations) and Canada once again this summer for a music festival with friends (only drank, nothing else.)

From the start of 2018, I've just been super focused on doing well in school and starting my career on the right foot. The security clearance is Secret (not sure if it matters) and I'm really just afraid that my slightly rough past will prevent me from getting a clearance. Is there anyone who can provide some insights or advice for me? Thanks in advance!!

Much love."

I made videos and short films, just goofy ones but they we're ones I had a good time making. I noticed as I got older my anxiety got worse and worse. Once I reached the 8th grade my filmmaking stopped. I was too afraid to ask people to help me make videos. I was too afraid of what people might think of my ideas. Growing up I had my brothers and neighbors to help me but now that I was older I had nobody. I just stopped doing film all together. Senior year of high school rolls around and my school introduces a film class. I signed up in an instant and so did my best friends. That class was the best time of my high school years. But that obviously didn't last forever. After that class ended I went back to being my anxious self, my friends didn't seem to show any interest in making more videos. Now I am a junior in college majoring in what is basically design(working with digital spaces). I chose this major because making stuff is all I ever known but my anxiety has only gotten worse. I am afraid to show my work. I don't design much stuff outside of class so I have nothing to show when it comes to applying for jobs. I need an internship credit for this major and I am having terrible anxiety about that. I have no self-confidence and am worried for a time when someone asks me to show them some of my work and I will have nothing to show. Its just a downward spiral of depression, anxiety, and lack of self-confidence. I am not suicidal but this is the lowest point of my life.  I want to be able to have fun and make shit but I can't when I don't have support around me and I especially can't do it if I'm anxious all the time. Anyone else ever been in a similar situation or anyone have any life/career advice?"

That being said, I feel like I've hit a wall. Like, I was interested in it at first, but I honestly don't know what the heck I would do with it. The knowledge and style of thinking is helpful, but what the heck can you actually do with it?

9ha49k,0,2018-09-19,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Roleplays,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9ha49k/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_roleplays/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9ha7ys,3,2018-09-19,Post-college crossroads,Time_Champion,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9ha7ys/postcollege_crossroads/,"I just graduated college and to be honest I really don't miss it. Sure, I miss seeing a lot more of my friends on a daily basis, but otherwise I just don't see the difference because I still just want to be happy. I'm sad because deep down, I thought I would have everything figured out by now. I thought I'd have the cushy engineering job, the girlfriend, the gym body and the inner feeling of ""wow, I did it."" I've been on a path of self-care, self-improvement and admittedly *sometimes* self-destruction. Reading books on happiness, philosophy and self-improvement trying to find myself. Stepping out of my comfort zone to try and grow. 

 But I'm 22 and I still feel like I'm on this hedonic treadmill, where some days I am super positive and then I'm back down even though I *really* thought it was all turning around. I worked an internship for over a year now and everyone said it was only a matter of time before I was hired. They made me full-time but only on an intern salary doing the quality of work of a full-time employee, it seems like they don't want to offer me more money when they could just get another intern to do the same job. 

I come home from work and want to be more productive and also work on more programming because I don't feel like I am strong enough on it yet. But I am tired and worked all day, part of me wants to relax and take a break. But how can I take a break if there's still things to do? If I'm still not good enough then I gotta work on it. 

 I still feel too ugly and scrawny or have the personality to be attractive to the girls I like. More importantly, I am still not the guy that I want to be. Maybe I don't act like it though, because I have a lot of friends that don't seem to realize it. I've talked to a few, but maybe they can't relate. I get a lot of ""I feel that"" when I try to open up about myself. I think that's just a conversational cue to be a little quieter about being unhappy. I am not a suicidal person, I just want someone to listen.. But I also REALLY don't want someone to feel like I am just a bummer or that my shortcomings define me as a person.

I don't really come from money, haven't been on a vacation since 2008, but my family has always said that I am different and do whatever I want. This set me on the warpath of engineering and improving so that I can make the money to make the necessary changes to my life. I want to go on vacation. I want to be happy. This is my affidavit.

I'm not really sure what I wanted out of writing this post but I do feel better. I think sometimes that maybe just want to be desirable. Does anyone else ""feel that?"""

The advice I need is in relation to obtaining either a part time job or an internship during my sem- break. I will be having a break from mid November up to mid February however I will be going for a family trip until the end of December. Once I get back to KL I plan to either work part time or get an internship in a company that is related to the field of study that I am in. The issue is, I am unsure if I will be able to obtain a job for a month and a half. Also, after a quick search online, I found that most companies require a minimum of 3 months of commitment time. 

With that, it would be lovely if I could get some advice on what I should do ://. Also if there are companies that are known to have short term internships or part time placements that fit my requirements, could you please share them. Thank you all in advance !! :)

Can I work my way up there from team member status? The person in HR at my store worked for target for 10 years before she got there 🙃. ( I’m wondering if slow upward mobility is common across other stores so if anyone has details on that and that worries me...) 

Can I get an internship at target if I had already been a team member?! 

I’ve never had the chance to even ask my etls/stls their background. They all seem very reluctant to share so I figured I’d ask here.

Screenshots of evidence will be posted at the end of this post.

Joe Cohen had posted a link to take an interview to join his company. In the beginning, there is text about how nobody can pass his tests and if you do you will have the opportunity to join his company which of course, as stated in the text, everybody loves. As I go along the interview everything seems fine until I run across questions that are blatantly ripped off from a standardized testing body. I googled the questions and lo and behold they are taken directly from the LSAT sample questions on their website yet another red flag. Clearly, he needs better writers if they can’t even come up with their own original testing material. I continue the interview only to find out that they are in need of not only writers and editors, but developers as well. Embedded right into SelfHacked's HR software is a Cambridge Brain Sciences game that I am familiar with. I did some more digging into Joe Cohen and found his Facebook page which states that his HR software is revolutionary and going to change how hiring is done. At this point, I think it would be in his best interest to first reach out to Cambridge Brain Sciences to see if they want to get in on his very own revolutionary software. He mentions in his Facebook post that there is “little possibility for racism or sexism” however, he doesn’t mention there is a high opportunity for plagiarism all throughout his genius software. Be wary of anything involved with this company and its owner, many others in the previous thread mentioned that he’s full of crap but this only confirms that and more.

My post and screenshot evidence from the other thread:

I took your interview, do Cambridge Brain Sciences and the Law School Admission Council know that you are stealing their property with the intentions of making money off of it? I did some more digging and found your Facebook page where you state that your HR software is revolutionary and that you plan on commercializing it soon, I can only assume that this link is what you are talking about when you speak of your HR software. I've attached screenshots of ""your"" HR software and a screenshot of the Cambridge Brain Sciences game to show people that you are blatantly stealing and taking advantage of other people's hard work, just like this ""token of appreciation"" to scour your sites for hours to maybe get 10 dollars.

EDIT: ANOTHER LIE, also Joe Cohen has verified that he did in fact steal the Cambridge Brain Science games

Joe Cohen makes an oddly specific claim that he does not steal Logical Reasoning questions but here is proof that he steals READING COMPREHENSION questions, I googled the very specific question and person in the text which verified that it was ripped directly from the LSAC website. Lie by omission...

The Reading Comprehension questions are stolen directly from section 4 of a sample LSAT:

[https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-4](https://www.lsac.org/lsat/lsat-prep/practice-test/section-4)

PROOF 9/20: An archived link of the HR software that shows a blatant rip off of a 1996 LSAT logic game from section 3, the words are changed but the exact format of the questions are identical. You can still confirm this until it is delete by going to SelfHacked, then careers, and then clicking on the the ""Intern"" position and creating a burner attempt. This is content stolen directly from the Law School Admission Council...

[http://archive.is/JPJNL](http://archive.is/JPJNL)

Here is the page it is ripped off from, if anybody has a copy of the LSAT Super Prep book from the Law School Admissions Council with the test from 1996 they can confirm this for themselves:  ISBN-13: 978-0-9793050-6-1  ISBN-10: 0-9793050-6-3  are the ISBN numbers for the book it's from. Notice how Joe Cohen changed ""coordinator of an exhibition"" to ""carpet store owner"" and then changed ""rugs"" to ""carpets"" but literally everything else is identical, what a coincidence!

9haz08,61,2018-09-19,"Surreal Bus Ride Home: Man with a Gun Tattoo'd on His Forehead, Let's Not Meet",menagerie_my_library,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/9haz08/surreal_bus_ride_home_man_with_a_gun_tattood_on/,"This happened a few years ago. It was a Friday after Thanksgiving and I was on my way home from an internship at a hospital. It had been a busy day with a number of patients. When I decided to take a detour home from work to go to my favorite grocery store, I had completely forgotten most people were off-work due to the holiday. This is notable because my normal way home on the subway and bus went express and stopped at very well-lit secure parts of the city and the other went down a dark road and the stops were not well lit.  But I had taken this bus home before and during rush hour it was usually full of people. I wish had remembered most people were off work the Friday after Thanksgiving.

I got on the bus nabbed a seat in the middle section where there were three seats that face the back door of the bus. The seats in the front and back section of the bus face the bus driver. From this vantage point, I could both the back and front section of the bus. As the bus was pulling away, I noticed out of the corner of my eye, an African American man (this matters later) with a beard and a gun tattoo in the middle of his forehead. I have ridden on the bus with people with face tattoos and am heavily tattoo'd myself. But something about him seemed different, he looked angry. And it was a pistol in between his eyes. The area where I was riding the bus around is known for having significant gang activity and rivalries. Tattoos like the gun in this area are often symbolic of gang activity (like the role in a gang) or a reason someone went to prison. Even if I was wrong, someone I did not want to mess with. I contemplated getting off at the next stop, but I saw in his hands a book about forgiveness. I thought since it seems like he was trying to turn his life around I felt safer. Having ridden the bus around a lot often in less secure neighborhoods and working with (and having)  persons living with serious mental illness, it is likely I had a false sense of bravado. And being a youngish white woman (will matter later), I am often (correctly) identified as working in health, education, or the social services therefore I am generally left alone  and not mistaken for rival gang activity or being from a rival neighborhood or carry tons of money to be mugged or a tourist etc  (I could be wrong about the significance of the gun tattoo as any engagement in illegal activities).

Deciding there was nothing to worry about, this ride was no different than any others I had taken. I put in my headphones and settled in for the ride. That was not a wise choice.

Every so often I looked over and this man would look at me scowl and mutter something. At that point there were a number of people on the bus and he was seated far away, so I wasn’t quite sure. Then proceeding to go back to my music.

As the bus moved on more and more people emptied out and because it was November, it became dark. I was use to going into fairly insecure neighborhoods, so I focused on my music and took deep breaths. The bus passed by a university and emptied out even more. A couple of stops later a girl in her early twenties gets on. She has bright yellow dyed hair, head-band with two yellow ears, exaggerated red blush on her face, a tail, is dressed in all yellow, and had a red backpack. On the backpack was a key-chain, and on that key-chain was….you guessed it…a Pikachu. While normally I wouldn't take a second glace assuming that maybe she is going to a costume party or a fun kinky party. It was what wasn't there. Unlike normal, the bus was not packed full of people on their way home and to work. I felt like I had entered the Twilight Zone. Like the weird bus in the third Harry Potter book when everything went Topsy Turvey.

I was on the bus with a Pikachu.

I looked around at the empty bus with the man with a gun on his forehead, a Pikachu, and a couple of teenagers in the back seats. I have never been so thankful for teenagers in the back seats. Today is a holiday and I should not be on this bus.

We were getting close to where I lived, when an Asian man with bleached blond hair stumbles onto the bus and sits right next to the man with the gun on his forehead. The man with the gun tattoo twists his face into one of agony and moves to the first row of the back of the bus, close to where I am sitting in the middle.

Now I can hear him mumbling and decide I needed to turn down my music but keep my headphones in.  “What the fuck is a white person doing on this fucking bus” he mumbles.

I focus on my breathing to stay calm, I am the only white person on the bus, I froze. But I wasn't sure in this man’s possibly deranged state he thought the Asian man was white because of the bleached hair. And the man with the gun tattoo on his forehead was clearly exceptionally offended that the other man sat next to him.

“Don’t you fucking worry, I am going to fucking get you.” I focus my eyes ahead pretending my music is loud. The man with bleached hair gets off the bus.

“Don’t you worry, I am going to find you and kill you. One day when you least expect it, I will kill you” He voice was cold and calculated. Was he referring to me I wondered. I was not sure if he had a psychotic disorder or was a psychopath - maybe a combination of both. I was not going to wait to find I thought of all the ways he could come for me.

“What the fuck are you doing on this fucking bus. I will find you and I am coming to kill you. Don’t worry I am going to find you.”

Whether he is talking to me or the man with bleached hair, I was not waiting to find out.

I knew I could not stop near my house, it was dark, unlit, and I never wanted him to be able to find me. We were about to pass a hospital and some emergency call boxes nearby that I could run to if he followed me out of the bus. There is usually security/police and it was also a labyrinth. I had been lost many times in those halls, I was pretty sure I could lose someone. Or at least come out the other end in a way that was non-sensical. Also, it was hospital complex area for blocks, no houses, so I figured for all he knew I worked there, was visiting a patient, or was going to the ER etc.

I had experience working with people living with psychotic disorders and knew (1) not to look at him or make eye contact (2) act like everything was absolutely normal, no sudden movements. Wearing earphones, I hoped might also make it look like I was completely unaware of him.

Picking up my groceries, I slowly and deliberately walked to the front of the bus without ever looking at him or in his direction. Quietly, I told the driver I would tell him what stop I wanted. If I had requested the stop by pressing a button it would have alerted the whole bus. The driver nodded, I am pretty sure he heard the man a few times. It was dark enough that I pretended I was looking for my stop. After letting a few stops pass, I picked a well-lit stop with an emergency call box nearby and I could get into the hospital quickly. I rushed across the street to the emergency call box and looked back to see if I had been followed. I saw him through the bus windows.

The man with the gun tattooed on his forehead’s mouth was twisted into a distorted yell, similar to when the man with the bleached hair sat next to him.  Like he was in anguish that I had disappeared.

Turning around, I rushed into the hospital complex, through corridors to an exit by security. Then ordered an uber home.

I am still not sure if he meant me or the man who sat next to him. Usually, I hope that he was mentally unstable enough or violent enough that he is locked up now. And therefore cannot come and find me. Always, man with the gun tattoo on his forehead, let’s not meet.

Edited: Typos and grammar. Clarity on though process behind gun tattoo and how I might have a false sense of security etc."

I'm the guy that comes here for the information without providing much value other than the occasional obvious shit post comment. I'm a leach and you guys deserve better for the effort you put in. Honestly, I never really feel like I have much value to add. 
I've come to the place we are all trying to get to, and in the process I've found myself and lost over 100lbs. Everything I hoped to gain from this process has been achieved and then some. 
When Rollo suggests that women desire and fear a man that knows his value, he is speaking to me in this moment. I have found my peace and I know my value. When Rollo taught me that desire is not negotiable, he is speaking to me now, only ironically. 
Here's my problem, my wife is trying so hard to win back my favor and regain my trust. She means it, I know she does. She has made herself available to me in ways I never understood she was capable, in all facets of our marriage. Only, my desire for her has decreased significantly. I want to find her desirable, but the years have fogged my glasses and I can't see my wife for the field. 

I was a ""nice guy"" for ten years. I white knighted her while she completed post graduate studies and internships, being the emotional tampon. She treated me like absolute shit for it, and I resented my covert contracts. For a long time. Fast forward... We have two kids, she's on board with the marriage and I feel a confidence about myself like I've never had, only not about my marriage. I have let the past go, and I am looking forward. My Map is in tact. What I want is to find my wife attractive and have the family that I want, intact. I'm starting to feel that I may not get both.

What has been the experience of others that have arrived to this point concerning a waning attraction for your spouse?

Do the glasses eventually unfog and I should give this time for desire to rebuild?

9hbd2g,0,2018-09-19,I (24M) am consumed by invasive jealous thoughts and anxiety about my ex (21F). It's starting to mess with other parts of my life.,limelazer,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hbd2g/i_24m_am_consumed_by_invasive_jealous_thoughts/,"This post's really long, but thanks to anyone who takes the time to read it through.

\*\* **relationship background** \*\*

Tricia and I started 3 years ago with a hookup, when I was a junior and she was a freshman in college. At the time I was pursuing another woman, and made this clear to Tricia. Tricia happily agreed to no exclusivity, but I later found out it was only to appease me. Once things fizzled with the other woman, I moved to make us exclusive, and we became boyfriend and girlfriend. From our very first nights together we felt like we'd never felt before; talking until six A.M., and having tireless sex. In these two ways we were undeniably compatible.

\*\* **problems** \*\*

From the get go we had issues though. Some stemmed from my attitude towards the way Tricia lived her life. I tried hard in college, stuck to a rigid workout routine, got good grades, and while I drank/smoked regularly, was cautious around hard drugs. Tricia had trouble sticking to commitments and was willing to take risks with drugs and alcohol. Often I would judge her and resent her if she bailed on a workout, skipped class, or did something embarrassing while drunk. I'm far from perfect, but this difference in discipline prevented me from adequately respecting her.

There was jealousy as well. Tricia was always very sexually confident, curious, and open. At first it excited me, but when combined with her impulsiveness, to me a lack of control, I became upset. She would tell me stories from abroad of following male strangers into parks at night to smoke weed. Or going to the birthday party of a man who had flirted with her at a store. I would berate her over the phone. I told her I was concerned for her safety, but I was equally jealous. I viewed her as at best naive for not recognizing the risk, and at worst unfaithful to me.

\*\* **breakup** \*\*

My view of her character (lack of motivation and discipline, impulsiveness, immaturity) kept me from considering her as a life partner. When it was time to discuss plans after my graduation, I told her I wanted to break up. She was disappointed, but acquiesced. After graduation however, the foundation of our attraction had not faded at all. So within a month of my graduation we decided to try long distance.

During this time things soured. She wasn't showing up to her internship and I saw it as a manifestation of her weak willpower. I felt miserable. I was in the adult world and thought that I needed a life partner who was mature and prioritized discipline. So I broke up with her again, but this time I fully explained the faults I found in her character. I thought we were incompatible.

\*\* **reverse** \*\*

Two weeks later I fell into another relationship. but about a month in I started to miss Tricia and feel guilty about how I had criticized her. That terrifying impulsiveness made her fun, passionate, unique. Over this time, I realized I still loved her, and in a counseling session I admitted that I would marry her if she gave me that chance. I started to feel positive that she was the one, and that I needed to win her back. After four months of this internal conflict I broke up with my new girlfriend. I tentatively reached out to Tricia and was firmly rejected.

But I visited her, and we found we both had a lot of passion left for each other, although she still hated me for what I had said and done. I maintained the position that I loved her, would wait for her, and would go through these fights and any hardship to prove myself. I told her I would always love her. I have never done this with anyone else, nothing close, because I have never felt this way. She started to soften and said she wanted to see me again at the end of summer.

Over these months we stayed in touch, in a constant cycle of feeling in love, then her getting furious with me and me staying like a rock: apologizing and soothing. Sometimes I felt like things were well and truly over for a couple days, but then she would come back around with more hope than before. 

\*\* **here's where my post title comes into play** \*\*

It's two weeks before we see each other again and she mentions she has been seeing/sleeping with other people. Of course I'm not thrilled but it's fine because after all we are not together and she is a long way from trusting me again. But it nags at me and I end up asking for details. It was spur of the moment sex with an old friend while they were high. Hearing this trips all my alarms and I spiral out of control, not being able to sleep or work from constant invasive imaginings of them. I have to stop talking to her, but I hate myself for getting so upset about something totally within her right. It's torture, but I tell myself everything will be better when we see each other. 

And many things are, we have an awesome time, and for most of it we are fully lost in each other. She says she thinks we'll end up together, that she still loves me, and that she still feels about me like no one else. But she ends up telling me more details about her friend, even pantomiming certain sexual actions with her hand, and at one point it comes out that I'm not 'as big' as him. Finally, she notifies me that she fully plans to keep sleeping with this guy in the coming months.

I'm destroyed by all of this. I can't stop thinking about it, and it's derailing my health, my work, and everything I hold onto for my self worth. I hate myself for it because she has told me she sees a future for us (eventually) and she's fully willing to talk through things whenever I need it, but my jealous obsession is ruining it. I'm trying everything to get out of my head; working out, meditating, seeing friends, even going on dates, but nothing seems to help. It's at the point where I'm starting to falter in other parts of my life. How can I keep this from completely dragging me down?"
9hbq8o,9,2018-09-19,Emily Doe's Powerful Statement (Brock Turner Case - Episode 58),scribbledpretty,CourtJunkiePodcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/CourtJunkiePodcast/comments/9hbq8o/emily_does_powerful_statement_brock_turner_case/,"**Your Honor, if it is** all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly.

You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today.

On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself “big mama”, because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.

The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.

Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me.

I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said “Rape Victim” and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a Nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.

After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.

On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs and I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.

My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweatsuit, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours in silence my younger sister held me.

My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, “I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?” I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find \[my sister\]. Again, he asked me, “What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?” I said yes, and hung up to cry.

I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real.

I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For over a week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.

One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me, this can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.

It’s like if you were to read an article where a car was hit, and found dented, in a ditch. But maybe the car enjoyed being hit. Maybe the other car didn’t mean to hit it, just bump it up a little bit. Cars get in accidents all the time, people aren’t always paying attention, can we really say who’s at fault.

And then, at the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extracurriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened.

The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up.

The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue. The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub.

Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us even speaking, a back rub. One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it.

I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.

I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.

When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.

Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering questions like:

*How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’ d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, well, we’ll let Brock fill it in.*

I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who had me half naked before even bothering to ask for my name. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now.

And then it came time for him to testify and I learned what it meant to be revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.

So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.

He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear. Even in his story, I only said a total of three words, yes yes yes, before he had me half naked on the ground. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.

According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls down help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls down, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls down help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don't take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that's why she wore the cardigan.

Next in the story, two Swedes on bicycles approached you and you ran. When they tackled you why didn’t say, “Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you.” I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen.

Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet. That was never the point. I was too drunk to speak English, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, “At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.” Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I became unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?

You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Pick the pine needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the two guys had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year.

On top of all this, he claimed that I orgasmed after one minute of digital penetration. The nurse said there had been abrasions, lacerations, and dirt in my genitalia. Was that before or after I came?

To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by Swedes for reasons unknown to you is appalling, is demented, is selfish, is damaging. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity of validity of this suffering.

My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, hair messed up, limbs bent, and dress hiked up. And even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, significant trauma to her genitalia, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to your attorney attempt to paint a picture of me, the face of girls gone wild, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.

He has done irreversible damage to me and my family during the trial and we have sat silently, listening to him shape the evening. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.

You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count, thirty ­six yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. ​Then I read your statement.

If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. This is not a story of another drunk college hook­up with poor decision making. Assault is not an accident. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused. I will now read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them.

**You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she.**

Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference.

**You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.**

I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want to be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not.

**You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.**

Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and my own sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.

**You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.**

Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold.

**You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to “speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.""**

Campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to people about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.

Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, *Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.* Campus Sexual Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide. Rest assured, if you fail to fix the topic of your talk, I will follow you to every school you go to and give a follow up presentation.

**Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.**

A life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.

See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was “unconscious intoxicated woman”, ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All­ American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, my life was put on hold for over a year, waiting to figure out if I was worth something.

My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you. The pain became so bad that I had to explain the private details to my boss to let her know why I was leaving. I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be. I did not return to work full time as I knew I’d have to take weeks off in the future for the hearing and trial, that were constantly being rescheduled. My life was put on hold for over a year, my structure had collapsed.

I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning.

I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.

You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.

You cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.

When I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over again she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney's closing statement began, ""\[Her sister\] said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister."" You tried to use my own sister against me? Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her.

You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.

Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. But right now, you do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You have been convicted of violating me, intentionally, forcibly, sexually, with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.

Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.

My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.

I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time­out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, an insult to me and all women. It gives the message that a stranger can be inside you without proper consent and he will receive less than what has been defined as the minimum sentence. Probation should be denied. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.

Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s report, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of “promiscuity.” By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction.

The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.

As this is a first offence I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative.

The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. How fast Brock swims does not lessen the severity of what happened to me, and should not lessen the severity of his punishment. If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? The fact that Brock was an athlete at a private university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.

The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say.

What has he done to demonstrate that he deserves a break? He has only apologized for drinking and has yet to define what he did to me as sexual assault, he has revictimized me continually, relentlessly. He has been found guilty of three serious felonies and it is time for him to accept the consequences of his actions. He will not be quietly excused.

He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.

To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my grandma who snuck chocolate into the courtroom throughout this to give to me, my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.

Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.

And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. As the author Anne Lamott once wrote, ""Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining."" Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you.

9hbs1b,18,2018-09-19,God damn this shit is hard,auktastic,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/9hbs1b/god_damn_this_shit_is_hard/,"Long time lurker, finally subscribed, first post, all that jazz. Giant feelings dump incoming. Sorry. I guess I'll tag this as an introduction post?

My baby is 6 months old and he's amazing and wonderful and makes me smile every day. He lights up when I walk into the room and it makes my heart grow three sizes like the grinch's on Christmas morning.

He also has WAYYY too much energy, I could barely get him to nurse before bed tonight because he was busy trying to bounce/jump on my lap, by which I mean plant his feet on my leg and launch himself sideways, head-first off of my lap and onto the floor. He also has an independent streak a mile wide and he's on the verge of getting mobile (thisss close to crawling and already starting to pull up to standing). He's going to be a nightmare of a toddler, I can see it now.

We sleep trained about a month and a half ago, and it's been... sporadically successful? Just in the last couple of weeks he's started going right to sleep (within 10ish minutes) at bed time, but not always -- tonight he screamed for 23 minutes before finally going to sleep. And when he wakes up at 10:30 or 11pm like he sometimes does, I'm never sure whether to go in to him, and then I end up listening to him cry and being filled with guilt and sadness and frustration and indecision. I always feel like I'm doing it wrong. If I go in and feed him, I'm undermining sleep training and reinforcing the wake-up, but if I leave him to cry it out, I get to listen to my baby cry and feel like a shitty mother for ignoring him. Even on good sleep nights for him, he's still up once or twice to nurse, and I usually wake up more than that imagining I heard him, so I haven't slept through the night in 6 months. I'm always tired.

I'm basically a SAHM right now, but that will be changing soon, since I was/am a PhD student and my dissertation proposal recently got approved and I need to start collecting data soon. I'm in an education program, so this means going out into schools and observing teachers doing their thing, which will only be a few hours a day and only on certain weeks. Pretty much all of the daycare centers with infant rooms in our area, though, have weekly tuition, not hourly rates (or at least the ones that we've looked into), and we don't really want to pay for full-time care when we don't need full-time care. So I need to look into finding a baby-sitter/part-time nanny, but I haven't even done that yet, partly because I haven't had time and partly because I'm kind of in denial about not being with him all the time anymore and leaving him with someone else. Right now he still takes three naps, and he goes down independently for the first two, but I can't get him to sleep for the third one unless he's on me, I either nurse him to sleep or throw him in the carrier. Occasionally he'll fall asleep in the car for that one if we're on the way home from an outing, but it's a crapshoot. I have no idea whether/how well he would sleep for that third nap with anyone else.

I can't leave him with family because we don't have any nearby. We moved in June (when baby was 3 months old) to a different state for my husband's job (he's a medical intern, which means fairly ridiculous hours, although he's going into psychiatry, so not as terrible as they could be) and now all our family is about 6 hours away. We didn't find out what program he'd been matched to (and thus where we would be moving) until 6 days after baby was born, which means that house hunting and everything took place during my post-partum period. We came down here the weekend that baby turned 5 weeks old to look for houses, and before that, I told my husband that I thought I maybe wasn't up to the trip and wasn't sure if I was up to dealing with the baby on an inter-state trip like that. We had a fight about it in which my husband told me he felt like he was doing all the work/making all the decisions for the move and I was basically just sitting around not doing anything. (I ended up going, and I'm glad I did because I was able to have some actual input into us buying a house, and everything with the baby went fine.) We also had a big fight the weekend that we did the actual moving about when to leave our old apartment (Friday evening, husband's choice vs Saturday morning, my choice) that resulted in my husband getting his way and me driving 2 hours across the state to stay with family (husband drove down that night to the new house to meet the movers, I stayed in our home town for a few days until my MIL was able to ride down with me so she could keep baby company in the backseat) with a hysterically crying baby (my fault, I got him to sleep but then accidentally woke him up, but it wouldn't have been as much of an issue if we'd made the drive during the day and could have timed it better with his naps). He apologized both times and we talked about it and made up and whatever, but there's a little part of me that feels like those incidents permanently damaged our relationship and I'm just good at compartmentalizing it away. Our relationship is currently good-ish? We aren't having any major fights or anything, but lately it feels like we've mostly been taking turns being snippy and pissing each other off over minor things. We talked about it a little bit tonight, but I don't feel like we really solved anything. I'd like to work on making things better but I don't feel like either of us really has the time or the energy right now, frankly. Also, sex hurts now, so that doesn't help. 

I don't know anyone in our new city. I don't have any friends. It's been too hot this summer to take baby to the playground or on walks around the neighborhood. I took him to a baby and toddler music class one day hoping to meet some other moms, but it got over at like 11:30 and everyone rushed out to get their kids home for lunch and nap. Plus, he was the youngest baby there by far, the noise was overwhelming for him, and I couldn't get him to nap when we got home. I haven't been back. They have baby storytime at the local library, but the timing doesn't really work for us because it's at 10am. I don't even shower until he goes down for his first nap at 9, and half the time he's still sleeping at 10. Our subdivision had garage sale weekend a couple of weeks ago and I had planned to take baby out and try to find some secondhand clothes for him and meet some of the other parents in the neighborhood. It was 60 degrees and pouring rain all weekend, and I saw exactly one garage sale going when I put baby in the carrier and went out with an umbrella. I do try to get out with him most days so we're not just cooped up in the house, but it's mostly to like, Costco or Target. I'm close to my sister, but she has her own shit going on right now so I don't feel like I can really vent to her. Ditto for my best friend who lives two time zones away and just had her own baby 3 weeks ago.

I know I have it easier than a lot of people (my sister, with her 7 month old baby, is currently stuck between the rock of her emotionally abusive pos boyfriend and the hard place of living with our mom and her dad who sucks, so I definitely know). My husband is a good dad, we have a house, we're doing ok financially. I'm essentially on ""easy mode."" But I'm lonely, it's mentally and emotionally draining being home alone all day with a baby (especially one who's super fussy because he's on the verge of a developmental leap) but also sucky to think about not being home with him all day, and as much as I love my baby and am glad we had him, this shit is hard.

To end this vent/introduction on a positive note: my boobs have finally stopped leaking for the most part and I slept without a bra last night for the first time in 6 months."

I just started school for a degree in Software Development which has a track in C# and would like to learn it well to eventually build apps, use it for DS&amp;A when I learn that, and apply for internships in summer 2020 or winter 2020. My ultimate goal is a jr position or internship with MS (but obviously I'll be applying everywhere). I'm moving to Washington soon as well.  


Would it matter between the two when starting? I was thinking of doing Bob Tabors course first then Scott Allens 5.0 C# after, but I feel like this would be spinning wheels since they're both intro courses in C#. Scott seems to have a bunch of other courses in C# following his 5.0 course which I think would be beneficial to pick up in some sort of order. His stuff has great reviews. Anyone have experience with either?"

I've taken two huge Ls in both my career and love life.

Career - I almost got promoted to a new department at work, but I got one-upped by someone who had a tighter connection to the hiring manager. I even got 100% positive feedback on my interview, one of the interviewers even told me she wishes she could've hired us both. 

What sucks is that this department is one that I have no experience in, so if I look elsewhere, it will be a shot in the dark. Or I would have to look for an internship, even though I'm a couple years removed from college. Getting promoted into this department at work would've been the fast way for me to break into this industry I want to be in. I was so close, and it fell short. I just want to scream. What am I supposed to do now?! 

Love life - I maintained No Contact with my ex for nearly a year. Then I re-initiated contact because it seemed like he wanted to talk to me, he sent me some ""breadcrumb"" texts throughout the past year and then I thought he was trying to get my attention on a particular social media platform. I re-initiated contact, he seemed very eager to talk to me. He even asked me to meet up. And then all of a sudden he stopped responding, when we had a good conversation flowing and were even planning to meet. I feel like I've been rejected  a second time, nearly a year down the road.

If anyone decides to respond, please don't tell me to ""move on"" or that I deserve better. I know this already, but I basically need to be coddled right now. Just tell me to take it one day at a time and it's okay to still relapse after this recent contact we made...

However, recent events have caused this question to cycle back through and I figured that I would ask for others input.

Backstory: I  am diagnosed with borderline personality and have an extensive trauma history. I've been in therapy since I was fifteen and I'm about to be twenty nine. When I was eighteen, I was on wait list for state hospital. However, for the most part, I managed to really pull myself together and with hard work made great strides. 

I graduated with my bachelor's in psychology in 2012 and have been working in the field ever since (although occasionally intermittently due to my graduate studies). I historically have done mobile drug and alcohol assessments in jails as well as student assistance program assessments in middle and high schools. For the past 2 years, I  have been working as a crisis clinician predominantly in the emergency room. 

I recently returned to school for my doctorate in clinical psychology. However, I've also recently taken quite a backslide in my own recovery. In January 2017, I was raped and subsequently I relapsed on my eating disorder in April 2017. I've managed to get that mostly under control (episodes occurring no more than twice a month) since. I have though been self injuring much more frequently (four times total this year, needing sutures every time when previously I had gotten it to about once every 2-3 years). 

As I sit here now, with 29 sutures in my arm drinking coffee before heading to my internship with high school students in an alternate education program, I am wondering what the f\*ck I am doing with my life. 

I excel in school academically. I have always gotten positive reviews at my job. I do believe that I am a good clinician. I am extremely mindful of any self disclosure (and generally speaking, I do not disclose). However, I can't help but feel like a fraud and while I know that this feeling is common, the details behind mine I perceive are not. Even if I took the ""time off"" of school or work, I'm unsure what I would do with said time beyond what I'm already doing (extensive therapy). I'm in therapy twice a week, I am in group therapy once a week, and I have a psychiatrist. 

Does anybody have any input or advice?

9hdyfm,6,2018-09-20,Client won't pay me for a fortnight's work on freelancer.com and the site won't help me. Anyone been here? Absolutely distraught...,Naive19,freelance,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/9hdyfm/client_wont_pay_me_for_a_fortnights_work_on/,"Hi fellow freelancers (or maybe I shouldn't say *fellow* because I'm obviously bad at this),   


Long story short, I always wanted to be a successful creative writer so I took an undergrad in Professional and Creative writing fresh out of high-school. However, as I became less of a teenager and more of an adult I realised that my stuff really isn't that great and I've poured a lot of time into a... very ambitious and unrealistic dream.   


Instead of beating myself up, I decided that I'd try and make it as a freelance writer. That way, I could have flexible work hours and potentially even travel and work! I started getting really excited about an endeavour like that. Took an internship at a newspaper (unpaid) so I felt more than capable and qualified.   


So after graduating, I tried to get onto Upwork but they're 'not taking anybody new'. I wound up on [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com), and I'm a moron for not putting much research into it, but it all seemed above board.   


I got a couple of jobs- first was $10 for 1,000 word articles. I know this isn't an ideal pay-rate, but I thought that if a) they gave me a good review on the site and b) it was something I could put in my portfolio it would all be worth it. After a few more shitty, low paying jobs somebody contacted me about a project that sounded really promising! They were going to give me a fortnight to proof-read and edit a book they'd written, 70 pages in total, and they were going to give me $300 US for it. Some of you might be thinking that's still low or standard but to me, that was heaps of money and I was chuffed. I thought something was finally going to work out for me...   


So I spend two weeks going through this book so, *so* thoroughly to the point where I could recite whole paragraphs because I'd read them a million times. I was actually really proud of the final product, and I was excited to send it through to the employer (and most of all, excited to get paid as my savings are practically nil now that I'm not a student and don't have government assistance).   


I send it through a full 24 hours before deadline, they 'see' that I sent the document (it's kind of like facebook, in that you know when someone's viewed your message). I say something along the lines of 'tell me what you think when you get a chance and, if you have any issues let me know and I'd be happy to make some changes'! Nothing. At first I was thinking, 'well it is a whole 70 pages I shouldn't expect that they'll read it immediately' but after three days I started to panic. I kept sending them follow up messages which were ignored (even though I could see that they were 'online'). After a week (which was this morning) I decided to file an official complaint. After hours and hours of communicating with this random support person, it's basically come down to 'we want you to work it out with your employer, since there was no milestone set we can't do anything, it's your responsibility to address the issue in a professional manner with your client'. That's it.   


Yeah, there was no 'milestone payment' set but I was **officially** awarded the project to the **officially stated amount** of $300 US. How... how are they not able to do anything? I *pay* to be on this god damn site. Hell, I paid the site $30 to accept the project! Not only do I not have the $300 that I rightfully deserve... I am DOWN $30 for working for fourteen days! Thirty bucks might not be much to some people but, for a new graduate that rents a room, that's literally food for at least four days. Since I didn't take any other jobs in that time, I'm pretty screwed. I really needed this- maybe I shouldn't have relied on the money to the extent that I did. Oh boy. 


Has anyone been here before? Does anybody know more about this specific site and the way it works. Is there any way at all that I can try and get this money, or was I just a naive baby that did this to myself? My extremely negative mother told me that this career path was stupid, and now I feel stupid for trying... Maybe I should give up. I feel like this is a sign from the heavens that I should. Ugh, I'm still in shock.

9he9ft,12,2018-09-20,"Advice needed: Client is ignoring me on freelancer.com, will not pay me. Anyone been in my position?",Naive19,freelanceWriters,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/9he9ft/advice_needed_client_is_ignoring_me_on/,"Hi fellow freelancers (or maybe I shouldn't say fellow because I'm obviously bad at this),

Long story short, I always wanted to be a successful creative writer so I took an undergrad in Professional and Creative writing fresh out of high-school. However, as I became less of a teenager and more of an adult I realised that my stuff really isn't that great and I've poured a lot of time into a... very ambitious and unrealistic dream.

Instead of beating myself up, I decided that I'd try and make it as a freelance writer. That way, I could have flexible work hours and potentially even travel and work! I started getting really excited about an endeavour like that. Took an internship at a newspaper (unpaid) so I felt more than capable and qualified.

So after graduating, I tried to get onto Upwork but they're 'not taking anybody new'. I wound up on freelancer.com, and I'm a moron for not putting much research into it, but it all seemed above board.

I got a couple of jobs- first was $10 for 1,000 word articles. I know this isn't an ideal pay-rate, but I thought that if a) they gave me a good review on the site and b) it was something I could put in my portfolio it would all be worth it. After a few more shitty, low paying jobs somebody contacted me about a project that sounded really promising! They were going to give me a fortnight to proof-read and edit a book they'd written, 70 pages in total, and they were going to give me $300 US for it. Some of you might be thinking that's still low or standard but to me, that was heaps of money and I was chuffed. I thought something was finally going to work out for me...

So I spend two weeks going through this book so, so thoroughly to the point where I could recite whole paragraphs because I'd read them a million times. I was actually really proud of the final product, and I was excited to send it through to the employer (and most of all, excited to get paid as my savings are practically nil now that I'm not a student and don't have government assistance).

I send it through a full 24 hours before deadline, they 'see' that I sent the document (it's kind of like facebook, in that you know when someone's viewed your message). I say something along the lines of 'tell me what you think when you get a chance and, if you have any issues let me know and I'd be happy to make some changes'! Nothing. At first I was thinking, 'well it is a whole 70 pages I shouldn't expect that they'll read it immediately' but after three days I started to panic. I kept sending them follow up messages which were ignored (even though I could see that they were 'online'). After a week (which was this morning) I decided to file an official complaint. After hours and hours of communicating with this random support person, it's basically come down to 'we want you to work it out with your employer, since there was no milestone set we can't do anything, it's your responsibility to address the issue in a professional manner with your client'. That's it.

Yeah, there was no 'milestone payment' set but I was officially awarded the project to the officially stated amount of $300 US. How... how are they not able to do anything? I pay to be on this god damn site. Hell, I paid the site $30 to accept the project! Not only do I not have the $300 that I rightfully deserve... I am DOWN $30 for working for fourteen days! Thirty bucks might not be much to some people but, for a new graduate that rents a room, that's literally food for at least four days. Since I didn't take any other jobs in that time, I'm pretty screwed. I really needed this- maybe I shouldn't have relied on the money to the extent that I did. Oh boy.

Has anyone been here before? Does anybody know more about this specific site and the way it works. Is there any way at all that I can try and get this money, or was I just a naive baby that did this to myself? My extremely negative mother told me that this career path was stupid, and now I feel stupid for trying... Maybe I should give up. I feel like this is a sign from the heavens that I should. Ugh, I'm still in shock.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If you got this far, thank you."
9hf54v,13,2018-09-20,My (23F) friend (24F) is incapable of being there for me,CrackPipeQueen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9hf54v/my_23f_friend_24f_is_incapable_of_being_there_for/,"This requires a lot of background, but I'm gonna TRY to give the TLDR version. This friend and I had a major falling out with a group of girls after freshman year of college 3 years ago. First they turned on me, then they turned on her. As a result, her and I became extremely close. Unfortunately, because of the stress that whole event caused, my friend decided to move back to her home town even though it meant she'd have to take an extra semester of college in order to graduate. You get the picture, she runs any time problems occur. All of this occurred 3 years ago, and we stayed in touch ever since. When she left town she pretty much broke her lease, lost her deposit, and left ALL of her furniture behind. She asked me to try to get rid of all of her furniture in any means possible, to which I agreed without knowing how much stuff I'd be dealing with. While it was a pain, we managed to get rid of all of it. My friend also struggles with depression, anxiety, and POTS syndrome.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my problem. I recently got engaged to the love my life and I asked my best friend to be my Maid of Honor. She said 'yes' a million times and promised to be the ""best maid of honor ever"". A few months later I tried to get into contact with her about wedding details, such as her dress color and type, and she never got back to me. Fast forward a month later and she hasn't replied to any of my texts or snapchats. Whatever, no big deal. But, I have some important things to talk to her about and she's been posting snapchat stories of her and her BF all month, so I know she's alive. The final straw for me was when I attempted to contact her about my wedding dress, looking for a second opinion from my best friend. I texted her and snap chatted her, but she failed to reply again. I was starting to get fed up. I have a lot a lot of patience for this girl, but she promised she'd be my maid of honor and the job entails at least replying, right?

&amp;#x200B;

She finally gets back to me, automatically apologizing and promising to be better. Literally sending me multiple paragraphs without me having to even tell her I was mad. She does this a lot, ignores me for weeks then sends massive paragraphs. Sometimes it's very frustrating because conversations would go like this:

Me: Hey, quick question, when did you start your internship? Before or after the semester starts?

Her: (Doesn't reply for weeks)

Her: Hey man, I'm sorry I haven't replied in so long. How are you? How's school? I know you asked me a question, and I'll get back to that question as soon as possible, dude, I promise. I've just been so stressed out and I hope you're doing well and I miss you and I regret leaving town and.......... (and it goes on and on and on)

&amp;#x200B;

This is how almost every interaction goes with her. I sometimes can get a genuine conversation out of her, but most of the time she spews fluff at me without actually replying to what I said. After she apologized for ignoring me for so long, I broke it to her that I should probably try to go with another maid of honor (she even suggested it in her apology text). She seemed to accept it and I told her I still wanted her to come to the wedding and I loved her. Days later she suddenly begins BLOWING up my phone apologizing to me for being a ""bad friend"" despite me making it clear that I forgave her. Calling me multiple times and texting me paragraph after paragraph. Unfortunately, I was dealing with a family-related issue and it was an extremely bad time, so I got very angry. Still, I kept my cool and managed to calm her down... but I couldn't help but admit to her that she did hurt my feelings and let me down. I'll admit, the text wasn't nice but it certainly wasn't mean. After this, she became defensive and says to me ""I just wish you would've told me I was hurting you so much"".

&amp;#x200B;

While at first I was angry at her defensiveness, I took a couple days to simmer down then replied telling her that I still loved her and even if she couldn't make it to the wedding I understand. She has major anxiety, so even pressure to attend a wedding can really stress her out. Fast forward to today, 2-3 weeks later, and she still hasn't replied to me. She went as far as to create an entirely new snapchat account and didn't add me. She doesn't have any other kind of social media, except for regular text messaging. I'm so angry at her, I'm fuming. I understand anxiety, one of the things we really related on, but I DO NOT understand treating your best friend like this. It's been 3 years since our falling out with those girls and she has been falling in and out of depression ever since. She's admitted to me that she feels like she's pushing everyone away, and I can't help but agree with her. I have tried so hard to be there for her but now I literally feel like I can't even talk to her. I don't even know if we're friends anymore. My fiancé has told me to give up on her and my mom has told me to give her space. When I send my wedding invites, I don't know if I'll even be able to get her address. She's made me feel like one of those girls who were mean and manipulative, but all I asked from her was to be there for me during a really important time in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to make of all this, and I don't know if I need a solution because I don't think I can 'solve' this problem between us. If she doesn't want to talk to me anymore, fine. I just don't really know what I did wrong."
9hfa4l,16,2018-09-20,Looking for feedback on my plan to prepare for the next 1.5 to 2 years for an intermediate/advanced level marathon training cycle,WildCantBeBroken,AdvancedRunning,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/9hfa4l/looking_for_feedback_on_my_plan_to_prepare_for/,"**TL;DR: As a runner with years of experience at a novice/beginner training level, what can I do with 1.5 years starting in October to prepare for a 60-70+mpw marathon training cycle? I want to race marathons now that I’ve done the first step of finishing one.**


##About Me

Age: 25

Sex: Female

Height: 5’0”

Weight: 100 lbs

Current mileage: 35 mpw


##Running Experience
Started running: age 13 (middle school cross country team).

I kept running competitively in **high school** on both the varsity cross country and track teams. My best cross country 5k races hovered around 23:00 during high school, and I was always at the slower end of the pack compared to the rest of my teammates, even through senior year. I was running up to 20-25 miles per week during cross country season every year. It’s possibly worth noting that I weighed closer to 120 lbs throughout this time.

In **college** I became a daily/casual runner for fitness purposes and to keep my weight in check with all the drinking and eating chipotle/froyo I did in order to keep up with my roommates’ lifestyle (for the record it didn’t quite work… I approached 130 lbs at one point). In 2014 (as a junior) I trained recreationally for a fall marathon and completed it in 4:16:01. I had followed a Higdon plan but loosely. I only had a vague idea of my distances since I didn’t wear a watch or carry my phone with me. I did up to a 14 mile long run. After that race the stress of intense coursework and two part time internships put me on a break from running for about a year and a half, after which I got back into running inconsistently at 15-20 miles per week. I also did a few half marathons between 2012 and 2014 with around a 1:53 average result in varying race conditions.

##Current Training
**Spring 2017** 

Fast forward to this year, I’ve been out of college two years and running 20 miles per week for all of spring 2017. The consistent running this spring got me faster than I originally had been in high school at the 5k. I ran a local 5k in 22:40 in late spring. (Dropping 20 lbs of fat via careful calorie counting also may have helped). That’s when something clicked. I thought to myself, 20 mpw hasn’t really been that hard to keep up with even though it seemed like a ton when I was in high school. What if I tried harder? I don’t always have to be at the low end of the middle of the pack.

**Summer 2017**

I lurked in r/advancedrunning all summer and realized how if I trained hard and put in real work I could shake that career-long thought that I’d always be a mid-low pack runner based on my high school experience 10 years ago. I spent the summer building a 35 mpw base with mostly easy miles and tons of hills.

**Now**

I run 6 days a week averaging between 30 and 35 mpw, one of which is a long run anywhere between 8 and 12 miles depending on my overall goal mileage for the week. My pacing is generally 10:15-10:30 per mile on easy runs and long runs. I don’t do any purposeful speed workouts yet, just days where I purposefully hit more hills. I’m incorporating heavy lifting into my routine, with three full body workouts a week on top of the 30-35 mpw. 

In the gym I’m rotating between a 3x5 OHP/Pullup/Deadlift workout and a 3x5 Bench/Row/Squat workout. My goal is to harden myself against the stresses of advanced long distance training (and aging) as well as improve muscle recruitment abilities. I’ve been lifting for a month, and intend to keep it up as part of my routine forever in one form or another.


##My goals and questions for r/AdvancedRunning
Firstly I want to thank you for reading my post because I’ve learned so much from this community over the past summer. I’m humbled by the work everyone puts in towards running and am happy to have found this community.

My ultimate goal is to do my first 60-70+ mpw training cycle for a marathon starting in 1.5 or 2 years. I want to RACE marathons throughout my late 20s and 30s by purposefully training now that I know I can at least finish one in suboptimal training conditions. I have a fall marathon in mind for 2020 and a spring marathon in mind for 2021.

My question is, what do I need to do in the meantime to prepare? I know I need to learn how to incorporate speed workouts as well as do a few base building cycles to work up to at least 60 mpw before I start an intermediate/advanced marathon training program in the summer or fall of 2020. I did speed workouts in high school but haven’t incorporated them into my training since then.

My idea was to alternate between half marathon training cycles, maintenance cycles where I just maintain the mileage of the previous training cycle to recover, and base building cycles where I make the next progressions in weekly mileage. I’m not sure how many of these cycles I should try to fit into the next 1.5 or 2 years, or especially how much I should increase my baseline mileage each base building cycle.

Any feedback or constructive criticism you have would be sincerely appreciated!

But I haven't found a balance between work, friends, classes, and clubs on campus. I don't have much free time. I have 5 classes, an internship, and 2 jobs. Its overwhelming and its making my depression worse. I'm starting to feel stuck. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. I stopped talking to my best friend for a while because he was acting controlling. It sucks not talking to him, but I don't have the motivation to start a conversation with him again. It feels tiring to reach out. There is only a few people I trust. The rest of them are busy with their lives, so I can't talk to them very often about my problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my nparents about my depression and how its affecting my friendships with others. I feel like I don't have anyone else to talk to. I haven't told them about my jobs because I don't want them to know that I'm saving money. My nparents told me that I don't need friends, they said I'm in college for my education and that should be my main priority. My nfather was acting nice and told me that he will pay for my bus ticket to visit them on the weekends. He said that I need to be around and comforted by family.  But my nparents are the reason my depression started in the first place.  I don't trust my nfather, especially in my vulnerable state of mind. If I go back to visit I believe that my suicidal thoughts will come back even stronger."

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

I’m John James, I’m currently the CEO of [Engine, a new cloud hosted ecommerce platform](https://www.enginecommerce.com/).  

In this interview, however, I’m sharing the story of how I started my previous business, Acumen Brands.  

I’ll share how we started, how we acquired a nine million Facebook fans in 90 days for one of our brands, how we leveraged that success to raise $100 million in venture capital in middle-of-nowhere Arkansas, and how the business ultimately failed spectacularly after being acquired.

I’m excited to share the story about how an ex-physician (me) and an ex-lawyer built a automated robotic warehouse to support a few dozen online stores, and how one of the stores (Country Outfitter) exploded into a hundred million dollar retailer of cowboy boots in less than six months, despite the fact that neither of the founders owned a single a pair of cowboy boots.

### What's your backstory and how did you get into ecommerce?

Acumen Brands was founded on January 1, 2009, at the height of the financial crisis.

**From doctor to entrepreneur**

At that time, I already had well over decade of ecommerce experience.  I founded my first ecommerce business from my college dorm room in 1995, and the proceeds from selling quiz bowl questions and study aids on the early internet financed my medical school education.

In 2001, while working 100 hour weeks during the intern year of my Family Practice residency, I started my second business one night when I was on call in the hospital.  It was perhaps the only slow night of call in my three years of residency, and I took advantage of the quiet time to build [Grillstuff.com](https://www.grillstuff.com/).

My brother and I were partners in that business, and we hoped to hit $30,000 in revenue in 2002.  If memory serves, we beat our 2002 forecast by nearly 100x, and we even had a $30,000 DAY at the end of that year!

**Taking advantage of Google**

The arbitrage of the nascent Google Adwords keyword platform was pretty incredible in the early days. At that time, you could achieve first position in the search results for a few pennies or a nickel on super competitive keywords.  

We dominated search for grilling related keywords, allowing us to scale quite quickly.  The unbelievably cheap marketing allowed us to bootstrap that business to eight figures of revenue without taking investment capital.  Excluding the $49 “investment” we made into building a Yahoo Store, we were profitable from day one.

**The advent of Acumen Brands**

I sold that business in 2008, and almost immediately started Acumen Brands.

I started Acumen after reading an article in Harvard Business Review stating that in times of recession / depression / financial crisis, businesses that double down on their marketing spend gain a disproportionate amount of market share.  Paradoxically, starting my second business right after 9/11 and my third during the 2009 crisis was quite fortuitous.

With Acumen Brands, we set out to build several dozen online stores in several different verticals.  We built our own ecommerce software platform, and launched a couple dozen stores in different niches including medical scrubs, workwear, outdoor gear, dance wear, cowboy boots, and several others.

We didn’t know it at the time, but as I’ll explain, one of our stores, [Country Outfitter](https://www.countryoutfitter.com/), would grow an order of magnitude larger than the other stores and change our lives in the process.

### Describe the process of launching these online stores and running this while operation.

At the time, I described our business as “a marketing plan in search of products to sell.”

We had a cutting edge ecommerce platform that plugged into Google (and eventually Facebook and email marketing) quite well, and we had an SEO and SEM expertise that was light years ahead of many of our eventual competitors.

We were agnostic to industry, and find our target markets, we started with a data driven approach to keyword research.

We were looking for mid to high volume search terms with a good deal of purchase intent.  Once we found those keywords, we further narrowed our scope to industries that didn’t have an established online category killer brand - we didn’t want to sell books against Amazon, electronics against Best Buy, or even fishing supplies against Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s.

Additionally, we were looking for items that could be shipped easily, that had big gross margins, and weren’t sold online directly by their manufacturers.

We found a few dozen candidates, and we started building stores.

After building the first two, a medical scrubs brand and a workwear brand, we raised $3.75 million of venture capital -- the first round of VC in Arkansas in over a decade.

With that capital we installed a [Kiva robotic fulfilment system](https://www.supplychain247.com/company/kiva_systems), and launched a new store every couple weeks, growing to around 20 stores very quickly.

**Building our own software**

Before we could open our first store, we needed software.  We spent about 6 months building the first version of our custom ecommerce platform, and spent the next 6 years improving the product.

The learnings from managing a few dozen of our own stores on our own platform eventually led to Engine, the ecommerce platform we’re building today.  My old CTO (and great friend) Jim Kane was Engine’s co-founder, and we’ve hired several of the best engineers from our old team.

**Building a fulfillment center**

In addition to software, we also needed a world-class fulfillment center to pick, pack, and ship our orders. With the help of Kiva Systems and their robots, we designed and built one of the world’s most efficient split case fulfilment centers in a very short period of time - 96 days from start to finish, Kiva’s quickest install by nearly a year.



[Here’s a picture of the robots in our old warehouse](https://res.cloudinary.com/starter-story/image/upload/v1537312454/e92zrn11sdn1vjxcecpu.png)

### How did you attract and retain customers?

We scaled from $3 million to $5 million to $9 million in revenue in our first three years, largely on the back of our “harvest demand” strategy driven by Google keyword marketing.  We would open a new store, adding new keywords to the mix, and revenue would follow albeit slower than we wanted.

Unlike the business I started in 2001 where clicks were super cheap, in 2009 Google Adwords was just beginning to get cost prohibitive for a startup. If we were going to scale quicker, we needed another nascent ad platform to arbitrage.

**Taking advantage of Facebook**

By arbitraging Facebook’s nascent ad platform, we were able to grow on of our stores, Country Outfitter, a retailer of cowboy boots, beyond our wildest expectations.

The opportunity was enormous. Whereas there were only 135,000 searches each month for cowboy boots on Google, we could reach 18.2 million potential cowboy boot wearers on Facebook by targeting people who liked country music, horses, and rodeo on Facebook.

The majority of those 18.2 million women owned a pair of cowboy boots, and we knew many of those would buy another pair in the near future.

We tried dozens of tactics, but the strategies we used on Google simply didn’t work on Facebook. Unlike Google where retailers could harvest pre-existing demand exposed by keyword searches, Facebook users weren’t in the buying mood.  Rather than “harvesting” demand, we had to “create” demand.

Harvesting demand is relatively easy and logical.  We’d first acquire a click from one of 135,000 searches a month for cowboy boots, then we’d land the shopper on a page containing all our cowboy boots, and sales followed linearly.

**A different strategy with Facebook**

The strategy we used to crack the Facebook code was counterintuitive.

Rather than sell boots directly on the first visit, we changed our goal to get multiple visits from the same visitor, and make the first sale over time.  

The goal of the first visit was simply to establish a relationship with the customer.  To ensure multiple visits without having to pay Facebook multiple times, we required the visitor to “join” the site by subscribing to our email list and becoming our fan on Facebook.

**Giveaways and a viral loop**

We enticed the visitor to subscribe to our email by entering them into a giveaway to win a $500 pair of cowboy boots.

After they entered their email address, we asked them to become our Facebook fan, and share the giveaway with their friends.  After completing that 1-2-3 step process, they unlocked a 20% discount.  

While more than half the people declined our invitation to “join,” the visitors who did would come back an inordinate amount of times.  They’d come back every week to enter our next weekly giveaway, and eventually they’d purchase a pair of boots.

Each weekly giveaway had over a million entrants, and Country Outfitter would routinely have 10 million site visits a month.

Due to the viral loops described above, Country Outfitter became ubiquitous on Facebook.  We held our first giveaway on Labor Day 2012, and by the end of that year

we had acquired 9 million fans and 11 million email subscribers.

Amazingly, 8% of those 11 million giveaway entrants eventually purchased a pair of cowboy boots from us, leading to a $100 million annual revenue run rate.  Through the process, Country Outfitter’s revenue grew from just $100,000 / month to a $14.5 million month just six months later.

Converting 8% of 11 million giveaway entrants into paying customers was an exhilarating challenge.

**Email marketing flows**

With 11 million email subscribers, we had to immediately shift away from a “batch and blast” email marketing strategy, quickly migrating to a much more efficient system of “event driven” marketing flows.  

Rather than flood our customer’s inboxes with unsolicited spam, we constructed dozens of automated marketing cascades that were tailored to the activity and interest of individual shoppers.  If USER X does EVENT Y then they receive MARKETING FLOW Z customized to their known interests.

These automated cascades increased our ecommerce email CPM by 1000%.  Updated learnings and processes gleaned from optimizing these flows are my favorite feature of Engine’s new ecommerce platform.

### What caused the company to fail?

To get to today, you have to run through several failures, and a couple great successes.

While we succeeded in generating a fantastic return for our Seed, Series A, and Series B investors and achieved a life-changing partial exit for the founding team, we fell far short of our goal of building a publicly traded company.  The cause of “failure” was multifactorial.

**Stepping down as CEO**

18 months after selling a majority of Acumen Brands, I stepped down as CEO.  The company had morphed from a retail marketing technology company to a retailer of cowboy boots that was attempting to become a manufacturer as well.  I was over my head, and out of my sweet spot, so I left.  After I left, the company lost their CTO and vital growth marketing talent as well.

**Competition**

The company failed spectacularly after losing that talent, but the writing was already on the wall when we left:  Amazon (and Zappos) started moving heavily into our space, the brands we sold started their own websites and started selling direct, our [biggest competitor went public](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/western-apparel-retailer-boot-barn-prices-ipo-at-16-the-high-end-of-the-range-cm408003), and most importantly Facebook’s organic reach algorithm changed dramatically and bid prices increased exponentially.

The fall from grace was nearly as swift as the ascension.

**Facebook Algorithm Changes**

With a series of algorithm changes, Facebook rendered our 9 million fans worthless. Whereas our organic reach initially hovered around 56%, it dropped quickly to well under 1%.  

Where over 5 million fans would see our posts for free in the beginning, after the algorithm changes, only 50,000 fans would see an average post.

**Switching from our custom built platform**

The death knell, however, was the new owner’s decision to switch off our powerful, custom-built ecommerce platform to Demandware.  The day of the platform switch, conversion rates dropped 38%, and never recovered.  

The business assets were eventually sold to our largest competitor for pennies on the dollar - a competitor we contemplated buying out just a couple years earlier.

**Changes in the ecommerce industry**

Through watching that decline, as well as watching the high profile implosions of similar high-flyers like [Gilt Groupe](https://www.gilt.com/) and [One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com/), I’ve realized that the future of ecommerce looks decidedly different than the beginnings.

As we found out on Country Outfitter, selling other manufacturers goods like a traditional retailer is largely a fool’s errand today -- Amazon’s already won that game, Wal-Mart is a clear second, and several great companies like Nordstrom are fighting for a distant third.

**Customer relationships and brand power**

The ecommerce companies that are winning today, and will win in the future, all have a direct relationship with their customer.  The majority of those will be high margin, vertically integrated direct-to-consumer companies.

While we did almost everything right, we found out the hard way that customer loyalty lies mainly with the brand they are purchasing, not the retailer.  In today’s post-Amazon world, retailers are largely “dumb pipes” - supply chains utilized by consumers to get the products from their chosen brands in the most efficient way possible.  

Customers are increasingly agnostic to where they buy their favorite brands, but remain highly brand loyal.

This brand loyalty, and the unprecedented ability to reach new customers online presents an exciting opportunity. Bonobos, Harry’s, Casper, Glossier, and others are the new breed.  These digitally native, vertically integrated brands sell directly to their customers, bypassing the costly wholesale distribution network of traditional retail.

Even mighty [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/) sees the writing on the walls, and is quickly moving away from a traditional wholesaler/retailer relationship by launching their own brands like [Birch Lane](https://www.birchlane.com/).

It starts with a beautiful content+commerce experience designed to be shoppable on today’s mobile devices, and it ends with the ability to directly communicate that content to customers in a highly relevant, customizable way that is not dependant on leveraging external platforms like Facebook and Google.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I learned humility, how to deal with failure, and most importantly how to place my faith and family first.

It was easy to get a big head when my picture was on the front page of local business publications every couple weeks, and speaking at [national conferences](https://pando.com/2014/06/10/how-john-james-plans-to-build-a-1b-e-commerce-company-in-arkansas/).  I became the face of startup success in Arkansas, and I must admit that the notoriety went to my head.  

Just a few months after selling the business, it started to unravel and we suffered through a round of layoffs.  I eventually [stepped down as CEO](https://www.enginecommerce.com/founder-to-step-aside-as-ceo-after-hollar-raises-35-million-at-200-million-valuation/) just 18 months after selling the majority of the business at a 9-figure valuation.  

These public failures knocked my ego down several pegs, and I hope that I’m a little easier to work with today than I was when I was younger.  I took success for granted, and this time around I’m savoring every small victory as a God-given blessing.

Most importantly, I learned how to be a better leader in my own family.  During my residency and up through building Acumen, I sacrificed both the health of my family and my own health to solely focus on building a great business.  

While I still think about business the vast majority of my waking hours, I’m 1000% more present with my family.  As an example, I have three children in athletics, and I haven’t missed a single game in the past three years - even the afternoon games that take place during office hours.  This was a conscious decision, and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made.

Along with that decision, I am diligent about taking care of my own health.  During the most stressful period of building Acumen, I contracted a rare stress-related illness known as Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.  I was incapacitated for an entire month, and nearly permanently lost my voice and ability to swallow.  

This brush with mortality served as a dramatic wake up call.  100 hour work weeks were the norm for me then, and now they are much less frequent though still occasionally necessary.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

At Acumen, we built all our own software to run our stores.  The learnings from this process were the genesis of Engine.

Funny enough, in my role as an investor running [an ecommerce startup studio](http://hayseedventures.com/), I recommended Shopify to dozens of entrepreneurs and even used it in a couple of our portfolio companies.  

While I still believe Shopify has an incredible product for ecommerce brands that are just starting out, my tune changed dramatically after watching several of our Hayseed Ventures portfolio companies and entrepreneurs I mentored struggle with scaling on their technology.  

They all ran into a ceiling at about a million dollars of annual revenue, and universally had the same challenges that simply couldn’t be eradicated on Shopify’s platform.

Closest to home, we watched the technology struggles of our first investment, Menguin.  They struggled mightily with their technology, and we decided to build Engine to solve many of the problems they encountered.

They eventually figured out their technology and sold for $25 million to the founder of Men’s Warehouse, but the lack of flexibility in off-the-shelf ecommerce platforms nearly cost them their business.  The story is pretty incredible - [read about how they did it here](https://www.enginecommerce.com/the-menguin-story/).

We had previously solved those problems in Acumen’s homegrown software, and we contemplated purchasing the old software as a basis for Engine, but (wisely) started from scratch.  Shopify and Magento were started in 2006, and we wanted a fresh new stack leveraging today’s mobile-first technology.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

Rework by Jason Fried is my all time favorite, it’s short, quick and impactful.  Measure What Matters by John Doerr is the best book I’ve read this year, we’ve adopted OKRs at Engine, and this book was quite influential in helping establish the process.

I love the [Masters of Scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) podcast by Reid Hoffman.

And I always start my day on [Google News](https://news.google.com/) then [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).  Then I breeze through [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) and [Venturebeat](https://venturebeat.com/), mainly to stay on top of the ecommerce industry.  I typically command click any story I want to read on those four site, and open a couple dozen tabs of stories that I want to read.

Despite the recommendations above I don’t read a ton of startup related content.  I read a book or so each week, but rarely are they the traditional fare of startup CEOs.  I only read non-fiction, and mainly consume a lot content from other fields.  Physics, blockchain, finance, genetics, astronomy, medical research, etc.

I’ve found through the years that learning the fundamentals of other disciplines is highly transferable to innovating in your chosen profession.  For instance, I first learned the concept of arbitrage from a finance book I picked up… I applied that external knowledge to the nascent ad platforms of Google and Facebook and did quite well arbitraging the pricing inefficiency.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Just Go.  Seriously, just start.  Today.

Ready, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim is not the best way to build a startup.  You have to abandon your fear, get outside your comfort zone, and not be afraid of failure.  I completely agree with [Reid Hoffman from over a decade ago](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-iterate-fast-and-release-often-philosophy-of-entrepreneurship-2009-11) - if you aren’t embarrassed by the beta version of your product, you didn’t launch it fast enough.

Run full steam ahead, create some chaos, then learn from the mistakes and iterate quickly.  

To be successful, you must have a few strokes of good luck.  Just staying in the game, and being in business long enough for that luck to take hold is a large part of outsized success. I will say, however, that luck seems to be distributed quite unevenly, and it seems to follow the most prepared individuals and companies more often than not.

I’ve made more mistakes than you can imagine, but as Mark Cuban said in 2005, in business, you only have to be right once.

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

Yes!  We are closing our next round of funding, and have 18 engineering positions and 12 sales / marketing positions open at the current time.

We are specifically looking for Ruby on Rails and JS developers.  We have offices in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Denver, Colorado - two of the five best places to live in the entire country according to [CNBC and US News &amp; World Report](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/us-news-world-report-the-10-best-places-to-live-in-the-us-in-2018.html).

9hhav0,2,2018-09-20,Does not having an internship affect my chances of obtaining a job at a public firm?,helpaccountingpls,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9hhav0/does_not_having_an_internship_affect_my_chances/,"Hello Reddit,

I'm an incoming fourth year student at a UC and I'm on track to graduate in June 2019. Unfortunately I wasn't able to obtain an internship this past summer because I underwent a procedure that required three months of recovery. I would say that my resume is solid, besides my GPA (3.06 Cumulative/ 3.18 Major GPA). I'm currently an active member of accounting society, and held two positions in my professional business: one on the executive board and the other on the judiciary board. Also, during the summer of my second year, I worked as an accounting office assistant at a private company. Although I am open to working in industry straight out of university, I would rather start at a public firm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, I consider myself to be a outgoing individual. I get along with most if not all people that I meet, and believe that my interview skills above average. I know that B4 is not an option at this point and I am completely fine with that. Many of my peers have just finished internships and received offer letters for B4 and when compared to them I feel as if I  am a failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those that have been in my situation:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do I put myself in the radar of recruiters?
2. Has starting in a private firm significantly affected your salary?

Any advice would be helpful!"
9hhotv,10,2018-09-20,F4M - Office Showers,Gullible_Individual,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9hhotv/f4m_office_showers/,"Since becoming a junior executive my work/life balance has become ever more challenging. With the long office hours, regular travelling and an on-duty phone I’m never truly switched off. All my past hobbies, friends and relationships, even sexual ones, have become a forgotten footnote of my personal history.

Time management has become a finely tuned art form. Instead of shopping for groceries they are delivered to my door at a scheduled time; instead of cleaning my own home, I’ve hired a maid; and instead of post office gym sessions I get my exercise cycling to and from work. This last sacrifice comes with a bonus at work shower, lest I stink out my meetings with clients.

Today my hectic schedule is no different with a client meeting at 8am. Yet before I’ve even reached the office, my entire schedule is blown like the rear tire of my $2,000 road bike. After a quick repair at the side of the road I manage to get work at 7:50. I slide my bike into the stand without securing the chain and quickly make my way to the staff showers.

To my dismay each of the private stalls are fully in use. I pace back and forwards for a few seconds waiting for one of the culprits to hurry out the shower. The clock on the locker room wall tells me its 7 minutes to the hour. This meeting was with our most important and least understanding client.

With the bold decisiveness which had elevated me to my lofty position I poked my head into the nearest of the stalls. A slender, young and firm derriere stared back at me. I traced the slightly fluffy cheeks upward, over a very slim waist and broad wide shoulders before recognizing the short hazelnut hair of the young office intern. Unwavering I dropped the hanging towel from around by person and stepped into the shower behind the young man.

His torso swivelled in surprise as I stepped close behind him in the shower. My hand against his boyish waist prevented him from fully turning. Instead he could only swivel his neck to see my face over his shoulder. Nothing more, nothing less.

“I’m running late for a very important meeting” I whispered in his ear. “I won’t be more than a few moments. You just keep facing towards the wall and I’ll be out before you know it.”

The aghast nod of assent was enough of an approval for me and I edged him closer to the wall so I could drench myself in the warm stream. Quickly I soaked my skin, washing the sweat and roadside dirt from my skin with the young man’s own shower gel.

Throughout my companion was deathly silent and frozen stiff. I whispered a thousand soft apologies into his ear to make him feel at ease. In an attempt to share the facet we were perilously close.

Continually his firm little buttocks pressed against my groin and my soft soapy breasts squished against his swimmers back. There was no doubt he could feel the sharp excitement within my nipples.

The longer I stayed the longer I considered the young man. His body was so young, so fresh. I was little past 30 myself yet I’d never been with someone so young, at least not since I was so myself. He was a perfect young specimen and I was curious just how experienced this man-boy was.

Time was getting away from me however and I sadly must go. A devilish idea came into my head just before retreating.

I slid my arm around the minuscule, yet iron waist of the youth and whispered one last time in his ear.

“Shall we say, 7:30 tomorrow?”

I asked before I licked the lobe of his ear and nibbled gently between my front teeth. I then stretched for his shower gel once more, pressing firmly against him as i did so, and then placed the bottle in his hand.

“Enjoy the rest of your shower! Take all the time you need.”

________________________________________

Hi all,

Please take the time to respond with a continuation of the prompt. First to finish is not an admirable quality for us girls. To help you along below are some ideas of how you could continue:

•	Write about you and your background. i.e. company and/or sexual.

•	Write this prompt so far from your perspective.

•	Write about the rest of your shower thinking of me.

•	Write about the remainder of the day in the office.

•	Write about the anticipation for tomorrow.

None of the above need to be followed and creativity is encouraged. Just trying to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

Hope to hear from you soon! xoxo

9hifsi,1,2018-09-20,Is it possible to make it without faking it?,19s19s19,u_19s19s19,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_19s19s19/comments/9hifsi/is_it_possible_to_make_it_without_faking_it/,"I was talking to myself, as I often do. I was going through a list of all the reasons why I currently am not in a place of loving myself, or loving my situation, or loving my life. I’m blessed to have parents who have worked very hard - so very accomplished they are. They can afford to send me on a one-year-exhaustively-expensive graduate degree in the heart of NYC. I worked for it - I did my part to get accepted. Did I know why I wanted to be here? Not really. I mean, I had a faint idea. I always wanted to go to graduate school, learn more practically and I wanted this to be somewhere ‘fancy’. It looks good on a resume, but mainly it would make me feel good looking at it. It would tell the younger failure that I once was (and probably still am) - ‘you made it’. Did I make it though? I don’t think so. I feel so dumb here. Everyone’s smart. They all have their shit together and they know what they want. Or at least, they can fake it to make it. They tell themselves: ‘yeah, I already have a job waiting for me in big law.’ ‘Big law’ basically means working as a lawyer in a large luxurious law firm. Basically reading contracts and stuff for big companies and investors as your clients - making sure you meet their needs and that if things go bad, you provide them with safeguards and a way out. At least, that’s as far as my simple understanding goes. That’s raw honesty - I could go ahead and Google specific tasks that lawyers do and jot it down, maybe take a look at the tasks I did as a legal intern in one of these big firms, acting like I know what I’m talking about. But I don’t care anymore. Because I’m trying this new thing - which really shouldn’t be new and should be something we naturally do in our day-to-day lives as humans: make it without faking it. We’re always told that - heck, I’ve given people that advice: to fake it and you’ll make it. For instance, let’s say it’s about being in awkward situations of meeting new people - I always tell myself to fake it, and act like an extrovert who is so comfortable going up to people and saying hello. I hate that. I don’t like meeting new people - because I know who I like and they’re in my life and I don’t know why I should go out there and fake it to make new friends because essentially I am being FAKE. But I do it anyway. We all do. But… what if we could live in a world where we didn’t have to fake it to make it. Where I could sit there awkwardly and anxiously say: ‘I’m an introvert. I don’t want to be here. In fact, I want to be alone in my room. But I also want you all to come talk to me and show interest, so that I don’t feel so lonely.’ Why can’t I say that? Why don’t I? It’s not accepted. Its not. We have to act a certain way, want a certain thing, convince ourselves of a life that ends up being so meaningless. It’s so sad! I don’t like it! 23 years and I am so over it. I want a break - but what’s a break? It’s escaping for a short period of time to somewhere you feel safe - but eventually, time runs out. You have to go back to reality - you have to go back to faking it if you want to make it! I’m tired and I am exhausted - I see more and more of you wearing your headphones, walking around alone and I know that is when you feel most real. You’re not faking it - you want to be alone, because it is exhausting to fake it. Earphones come off, mouth opens and the play at the world theatre has begun. We become actors - we are not ourselves. I’m not saying or suggesting that we should all live lonely lives, music blasting into our years, from one door to the next. We should be okay with starting conversations, but speaking about the truth. About how we really feel, about what we want and even if we don’t know what we want, we shouldn’t feel scared to share that. If we feel lost and confused, we should share that. But no-one does it. No-one does it because it’s embarrassing to be real these days. I’s less embarrassing to fake it. So that you can make it. Fuck. I can’t stand it anymore. I don’t want to fake it anymore, but I want to make it. So what am I going to do after this? I’m going to fake it. Will I ever be able to say I made it, without faking it? "

9hjb3c,6,2018-09-20,"I [25F] love my job more than anything, but I feel like an outsider, and I'm not sure what to do.",OddScallion,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9hjb3c/i_25f_love_my_job_more_than_anything_but_i_feel/,"I have been working for my company since summer 2017, when I was accepted for an internship. I continued working 2 days a week, until a full time job opened up, and I was hired.

I've been working in this role for five months now, and it has been really stressful settling in. It was a stark contrast from the department I worked in before. There is so much work to do, and I've been constantly consumed with getting everything done. Then a big project was announced. To make sure it was perfect for the due date, I stopped taking a lunch break, and worked more than the required 8 hours. It started to get to me. One day, after a meeting, my former deskmate, who knew me as an intern, stopped to chat. I asked about a comment made in the meeting, and he admitted he had never seen me so stressed. I closed the door and started to cry, and he told me I needed to take my lunch breaks, because I shouldn't be overworking myself.

After his comment, I reflected on things. I made a sincere effort to take breaks, I went on a medication, and things seemed to get better for me. The big project was presented, and I was thanked and recognized.

But with the project out of the way, I'm starting to feel that I may not be welcome here. I know that many of my coworkers interact in groups during the work day, and text or hang outside work as well. I do not do that. As time goes on, nothing has developed, and I've started to feel more and more awkward about this. The ""I'm new"" excuse is now almost completely worn out.

There is a group of people I have wanted to be closer to since I started in 2017, but I've been focused on my work and finishing my education. One of the people is the ring leader, and makes the plans and extends the invites to group coffee. Though I like her, and I think we get along, I am almost never invited to coffee, unless I accidentally overhear about it, and ask to join. None of the regulars tell me either, but I know they keep one another informed. A new girl started recently, who works in the same area as this girl. I ran into her one night and asked her to lunch, and when there, she mentioned she had gone for coffee with the group several times, because the ring leader walks around their area asking who wants to come. I, foolishly, confided in her that I never heard about invitations to coffee, which I suspected was because I started as an intern and now work in a dead area of the office, and asked if she could let me know when they went for coffee. That was last week, and we haven't really spoken since that lunch. 

I don't want to be a nag and keep asking ""please invite me!"", as I know that is subconsciously repulsive. I've thought maybe people are set in their ways, and I need to be the one to break the ice. Maybe they think I don't want to be part of the group. So I tried asking people to do things. While they accept and it feels like we have a nice time, things quickly go back to same old status quo.

I like my coworkers. They're all good people. Most of them are in their late 30s or older, with families, so it's hard to interact and relate with the majority of them. The group I mentioned above feel like the most relate-able individuals at the company. I don't need my coworkers to become my friends - I am perfectly content and would ideally like to keep work and social separate as much as possible - but I would like to be a part of the group. Especially since I am the office event planner.

Lastly, I want to mention, I don't want quitting to be the answer. I fucking love my job and what we do.

I think the reality is I'm just an awkward person. I was bullied in my childhood, and struggled a lot with my social skills growing up as well. I've come a long way, but I know I still have more work to do. Because of my past, I suspect my issues at work are due to something I'm saying or doing, maybe not outright, but through subconscious signals.

Can I improve this, or am I beyond hope? 

TL;DR: Single young intern becomes full-time employee at family-oriented company. Puts head down and works hard to prove she was worth hiring. Pulls head up to discover people think she's ok, but don't seem to want her around. Wants to improve relationships with co-workers so that she is wanted around, rather than having to ask to come, but unsure how to go about this. Efforts so far have stalled out. Suspects it may be her fault, but not sure how to find and fix the issue."

9hjdlu,6,2018-09-20,Switch from double major of CIS &amp; BDA to just SCM. Thoughts?,butwipe123,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/9hjdlu/switch_from_double_major_of_cis_bda_to_just_scm/,"So I posted this on /r/college but haven't really gotten a response so I'll go ahead and see what everyone thinks here. 

I'll just copy and past it:

Hello everyone, I just started my junior year at Arizona State University. I am currently a computer information systems and business data analytics major.

I’ve come to a dilemma. This semester is where my hard, major specific classes have started and I’m not exactly sure I like my courses. I am currently taking a java, database design class and my first data analytics class. Java really bores me, and I find it extremely difficult and frustrating, I am not good at it (I only did HTML and CSS in the past, but I really enjoy those even though they’re not all that similar as I have found out). We’ve been doing lots of ERD’s in my other classes and again, it bores me, and I find it hard. I think my GPA will drop if I continue in these majors from okay (3.19) to lower. If this is what I would be doing for my daily job, I think I would hate my life.

This semester I am taking my first supply chain management class, and I am really enjoying it. This sounds awful, but it is the only one of my business pre-requisites (my others that I have completed/in progress are finance, management, accounting, marketing, and business law) that I have enjoyed at all and like going to class and studying for.

My question is, if I switch, am I making a bad choice? Should I just stick it out and try and get internships in SCM? I have heard a number of times that CIS/SCM or CIS/BDA or even SCM/BDA are excellent degree combinations. FYI, I believe our CIS program is 18th in the nation, BDA is 10th, and SCM is 2nd.

In a way, I feel like I am taking an easy way out if I apply for SCM, as the work for my CIS classes is very hard and unenjoyable. If I transfer majors I am only losing a semester as the rest of my coursework covers my pre-reqs. I am also only one class away from getting the BDA certificate (which is why I applied for the BDA major as I liked the minor certificate) so I could always do SCM/BDA certificate.

Any thoughts or discussions would be very helpful, maybe I just need reassurance or something. Thanks!"

I expect it. I need to get this off my chest. I think part of me wants to be told I'm a horrible person, anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a woman in her early 20s. I have more-or-less always known I like girls. However there was this one guy that I've known online since I was an early teenager. Let's call him Oliver. We went through ups and downs, hiatuses of communication, etc. But in many ways we were best friends. We flirted a little and said that if we ever lived near each other we'd probably end up dating, never expecting it to actually happen. Low-and-behold, his dad happened to move very close to where I lived and offered Oliver a job at his workplace. He accepted it in a heartbeat and moved out here. We immediately planned to meet up, and while we had a rocky couple of first months (including me crying after the first time we had sex), we eventually clicked and made it official that we were dating in summer of last year. The honeymoon period begun, and I felt happier than I ever had in my entire life. I loved Oliver more deeply than I had ever loved anyone else before. But something wasn't quite right. If it weren't pertinent to the situation I wouldn't mention it as it seems like I am merely trying to earn pity points, but I was physically abused as a kid by my father. Very often when Oliver would touch me, it would feel like my father were touching me and I'd pull away involuntarily. It would be even worse if I were in a bad mood and we were in bed together. Oliver always said that he knew it wasn't personal, but I could tell he was hurt by it every time it happened. He was so patient with me anytime I would have anxiety over something relating to that. Part of me thought that this was the man I would want to grow old with. But something wasn't quite right. He, a guy in his 20s, was slender and had mostly a ""non-threatening"" build, I'll say. However, the thought of growing older with him and going to bed each night with a middle aged man made me uncomfortable beyond belief. I begun to feel extremely conflicted. Then Oliver introduced me to another one of his online friends, let's call her Jamie. Me and Jamie hated talking to each other at first, and ignored each other for a while. Though after a couple times we hit off. We shared a surprising amount of interests, and when we begun talking about the unfortunate similarities of our past, we became very good friends very quickly. She tried to shut me out from her husband, but when I saw that they were having relationship issues, me being the nosy one that I am, I tried to fix things. And for a while, it was working. Me and her husband, let's call him Joe, became friends as well. He ended up getting me an internship with the software company he works for and offered to let me stay at his place for the summer of this year. We had such grand plans for the future of the four of us eventually saving up for a big house to share together. For the time being though, Joe was in the process of buying a small house and the bank he was purchasing it from said it was going to take a couple weeks to process. It ended up taking months. By the time I flew across the country to begin settling in, the bank was still giving him trouble. So the three of us, since Oliver was still stuck back at home after a short visit at the beginning of the summer, were stuck in his parent's cramped apartment for about three weeks. I was grateful to them for allowing me to stay, but tensions were very high with how cramped it was. Me and Jamie found ways outside of the apartment to relieve stress. Joe always refused to come along with us, and it became very apparent very fast that none of their relationship issues had actually been resolved. It became very clear that Jamie had been very lonely in that cramped apartment for many years. But given the situation being an improvement from the situation she would be in with her own parents', she didn't complaint. Meeting me in person, though... it was as if someone had lifted a rock off of her chest. She opened up more than ever before online. We ended up having what I would essentially call our first date some Saturday after I arrived. We went to the New York botanical gardens. I nearly kissed her there, but was well aware of the bad taste involved in such an act. Finally, Joe got the small house from the bank and the three of us moved into it. The act of moving was also stressful, and by that time, mine and Joe's friendship had been a bit damaged from the tensions. Though we all tried to pull through. The majority of the summer was fairly standard, except increasingly I kept encroaching onto Jamie as less of a friend and more of a partner. We eventually started sleeping in the same bed since we found it much more comfortable and since Joe would sleep on the couch sometimes anyway. Neither Joe nor Oliver minded me and Jamie sleeping in the same bed, since both of them understood the comfort aspect involved. As you might imagine, sleeping together only made things more intense between us. I, supposedly, said ""I shouldn't say this, but I love you"" to her in my sleep one night. I have no memory of it, but I could see the glee on her face when she told me about it. Things kept progressing, and every time I would do something I felt awful for it because I never once forgot what I was doing. Yet, I kept doing it. It did eventually progress into sex. I think Joe knew about the sex, but felt hopeless that his marriage was over anyway, and, as he said repeatedly, he ""just wants her \[Jamie\] to be happy"". That ""you \[me\] make her happy"". The entire time I was doing things with Jamie, I genuinely did keep trying to repair their marriage. It was a fool's errand especially considering what I was doing on the side. Oliver visited near the end of the summer, and he could tell something just wasn't quite right. Me and him sleeping together was like our first nights together where I was especially hesitant to be close to him. It was as if we reset. By the end of his visit I felt somewhat comfortable again, but I think he knew at that point just from every hint that he got. The summer ended and I flew back to my home state. Back to Oliver. I felt really empty without Jamie to see in person, and Oliver could tell. I tried to fix it though. Never once did I ever stop loving Oliver. I always loved him very deeply. But I could not feel comfortable in bed with him. Not only did Jamie make me feel happier than I have ever felt in my life, distinctly happier than the honeymoon period with Oliver, she made me feel safe. She made me feel safe and secure to be with, and I can honestly say I've never genuinely trusted anyone before her. Coming to the end of this story, the obvious happened. Oliver found out. Joe told him. Oliver confronted me, and I did not deny a single thing. I knew the only thing I could do from that point on was be honest. He wanted to stay together, but I knew that could not happen. A few days later, I broke up with him. Not only was I well aware the trust between me and him had been damaged forever, I had complete confidence thanks to Jamie that I could not be with a man.

&amp;#x200B;

And I suppose that is the moral, if ever there was one in a story about infidelity. Despite what some people may tell you, love cannot change your orientation. I learnt this in quite possibly the most emotionally painful way. I almost cried multiple times while writing this. For the rest of my life I will probably be struck with guilt over my mistakes. I finish by reiterating my question, which I don't expect one answer or another for.

Can cheating ever be forgiven?

TL;DR I cheated on my childhood sweetheart with a married woman because I'm a filthy dyke."
9hkdbq,3,2018-09-20,Are others as fucked as me ....,A_Tosser_Account,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9hkdbq/are_others_as_fucked_as_me/,"First, let me say that unlike most on this sub, I’m older. 57 to be exact. I’ve been married for 19 years to a great woman. This is my second marriage.

I’ve never considered myself gay. And I still don’t. But I no doubt will get all kinds of shade if you read this entire post. If for no other reason then because I'm posting in this sub.

I don’t recall ever thinking of guys in any sort of amorous way I was much younger. I always liked girls. However, when I was nineteen, in the fall semester of my freshman year in college, I was——for reasons to this day I cannot fathom—-compelled to be with a man. One night I intentionally walked a strip where guys where known to cruise. I got picked up by some dude, went back to his apartment and basically topped from the bottom (a phrase I would not have known or used then but recognize now). I recall he had this cheesy mustache, which turned me off and repelled me when he tried to kiss me, but otherwise I was like, I want you fuck me in the ass RIGHT NOW!

Really, quite a first-time liaison with a guy, right? I mean, WTF? I don’t even think he sucked me; I gave him oral for a while, lubed up, and gave my ass away like a cheap crackhoe.

Here’s the best part: I played football in college. I’ve always been bigger. Athletic. Really into sports. I’m one of those types that if I don’t pay attention to my gait, I’m pretty sure I walk like a gorilla. (If you’re wondering, I’ve stayed in shape all these years … “yes, I lift, bro”)

Anyway, skip a few years ahead to my senior year in college. I did nothing man-wise in the intervening years, nor was I interested. In fact, I was busy trying to fuck every girl who had a heartbeat. Until I scoped out this guy who worked at the place I was doing my internship. I pursued him——again why, I have no idea—-ended up hooking up with him a few times. He was a top and wanted to fuck me, but I denied him. We stayed in touch over the years and about 10 or so years later during the time between my two marriages he and I got together and I was more than happy to let him plow me. But this experience came in the later years between my marriages.

I actually left my first wife because I was having an affair with a really wonderful guy. Our relationship was surprisingly provincial. In the year or so we dated, I fucked him a total of one time, and he fucked me a total of once——and only then after some urging by me. Maybe if he would have let me fuck him more, our relationship would have lasted longer. Regardless, I still think about him. After that, I had a couple of other minor flings with guys, but soon found myself back to pursuing women exclusively and leaving the gay thing behind, finally meeting the woman who is currently my wife.

Skip ahead fifteen years. Nary a sexual thought toward men had entered my melon-shaped head. Then about two or three years ago I start watching tranny porn. Eventually, it becomes almost the only porn I watch. (For whatever reason, gay porn does absolutely nothing for me.) Without going into a lot of gratuitous detail, I get so turned on by thick tranny cocks, men getting banged hard, sexy-hot shemales fucking and getting fucked….YUM! I love all of it. But, shamefully, this led me to fall off the wagon yet again when I hooked up with a couple of local pro trannys. I realize I’m a cad for my constant cheating. I have no answer for that.

So here we are now, and about a month or two ago I was having a conversation with my wife who suddenly asks me if I’ve ever been with a man. I don’t recall exactly how this conversation came about, but I’m sure it involved me saying things that probably came out rather suggestively. My affairs and liaisons with guys have always been my deep, dark secret. Like Dexter’s dark passenger. I’ve always—ALWAYS—been very careful to keep the two worlds completely separate. But finally, in this case, I came clean about my past sexual interludes with men (no mention of the tranny porn, however). Actually, telling my wife felt quite refreshing, definitely like a weight had been lifted off my back. BTW: she took my admission of homo-sex rather nonchalantly, so idk, maybe I don’t come across as manly as I sometimes think I do.

Since that conversation, I’ve been back to thinking about men. Not just thinking about cock, but more like …. holding a man. I get chills just thinking about kissing a man. Feeling a man’s strong, broad shoulders, thick chest, his stiff cock rubbing against my own while he’s laying on top of me shoving his tongue down my throat. I mean, what the fuck, right? That is totally fucking gay.

Worse still, I’ve come to realize I have an intense crush on a scorching hot married (i.e., straight) guy friend (yes, crushes still happen even when you’ve reached the age where you get mail regularly from AARP). I think about him Every. Fucking. Day. It's been like that for a long time, but maybe i just refused to recognize it for what it was. And I've compounded that issue by making the mistake of texting him after having had a few beers, and now I’m worried I’ve jeopardized our friendship because of some silly suggestions I made in our text conversations.

Honestly, this affliction of mine for same-sex is like locusts: It goes dormant for long periods of time, then it returns with a fucking vengeance that drives me insane.

So, you are now free to tell me what a major piece of shit I am."

So i'm 24(M) who's currently doing a paid full time internship with a federal government agency (not allowed to disclose which one). Its 33k tax free as it's through my university. I have about 5k in the bank and one more semester of uni left after this year. (july 2018 to july 2019)

My field is data analytics, ai and machine learning. Currently living with my parents. 

No real expenses except for phone, gym and food. 

Had a tumultuous past hence why i have had a hard time saving money even though ive been working. It's also why im 24 still at uni. Was homeless for a bit but pulled.my shit together.

This year is looking great though. My question is where too next?

Should i start saving for a house?
Invest in stocks or keep saving?

I have a partner who has been hinting at marriage in the next 3-4 years but i dont see how i can possibly afford a house, wedding and the rest in such a short timespan. 

Give me as much info as possible. Im a bit lost. Never had a financial role model before and i dont know whats the normal position to be in at this stage of my life. This sub has been an awesome resource so im keen to get some opinions.

As the while ambulance pulls up to the emergency entrance the body of Georg Friedrich is wheeled out, with medics and teams of doctors rushing to the aid the man that would be Kaiser. Minutes prior to the arrival of Georg Friedrich Chancellor Linder arrives in a emergency helicopter. A team of doctors are already ready to meet the Chancellor, he's body is rushed out from the helicopter and into a pre prepped operating room. The Chancellor's shirt and pants are but cut from his body, and a oxygen mask is placed over his mouth attached to a pump to ensure he's breathing. Nodes are attached to his chest, and the sound of a flat line rings out. 

Doctor, no heartbeat.

The Chest wound has penetrated the patients heart, and right lung; nurse any sign of brain activity?

Yes Doctor, but its faint, he isn't getting any oxygen. The heart has been destroyed by the impact and hasn't been able to pump oxygen since penetration.

Nurse, find out right now if there are any hearts in this hospital!!!

Yes Doctor.

The system says that there are no hearts in our hospital. 

We don't have time, if we don't get a new heart now, this man is going to die!!!

The Doctor slams his fist on a table, damn it damn it damn it!!!

Not now the doctor says, why now, why this man!!!??

Doctor, brain activity is failing, theres nothing we can do to save him!!

Damn it the doctor says!

6:15, Doctor all brain activity has ended, he's dead.

May god have mercy on Germany, and wiser heads prevail in this chaos. 


At 6:10 Georg Friedrich is wheeled into an operating room.

Doctor, penetration into the back the nurse says.

Get me a scan stat!

Looks like the bullet penetrated the right lung, theres blood filling it, we'll need to stop the bleeding.

The bullet passed through Doctor, lucky the bullet didn't fracture.

By 7:45 the red light goes out, and the doctor walks out of the operating room and says the Friedrichs wife and children, ""He's resting, he'll be fine in a few weeks. The bullet passed through his right lung, but we were able to stop the bleeding, and seal the wound. The lung will be 30% operational at best over the next few weeks so keep him in bed, and let him recover.""

Sophie bursts into tears, ""Oh thank god, oh thank god. He'll be alright, your father will be alright. 

--12:15 am--
Sophie sleeps in the chair next to her husband. Georg stris his vision blured. It slowly regains focus. The smell of chemicals and antiseptic fill his nose.""Ugh, where am I? Sophie, Sophie, what happened, did Linder live? ""The events of hours ago begin to flood back into his memory. The meeting, the handshake, the shooting... The pain and then darkness. Then Georg hears something, something out of place...
[Singing in the distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heil_dir_im_Siegerkranz)

""Trade and sciences

Improving with courage and strength

All for you!

|: Warriors' and heroes' deeds

May find their laurels of fame 

Faithfully preserved

Your throne! :|""  

The singing continues ""Forever to bloom..."" A tear rolls down Friedrich's cheek, and the feeling of shame rolls over him. Sophie, what of the Chancellor? I'm sorry my love, but he's... he's gone. A look of shame and failure take over his face. I I tried Sophie, but it was for not... Damn it! Its my duty as a Prussian, and as a Emperor to serve the people."" Georg, please for one night, please let go of this at least for the tonight my Kaiser she says with a smile and kiss's him on the forehead. ""Sophie, if I may, can I ask you to do me a favor? Anything my love she says with warmth and love. Can you help me to the window, I need to tell these good people to go home. Sophie gives Georg a look, ""I knew you were going to say that"".

As Sophie helps he husband out of bed, the medical equipment that monitor's Georg's health begin to restrain him. Sophie moves the wires and helps him to his feat. Lean on me my love, Georg hobbles over to the window and looks at the crowd, where hundreds, maybe even thousands have gathered outside the hospital some to see Linder, others to see Georg. Those singing stop, and Georg over looks the crowd. Though hos voice is weak, and knees are weak, Georg addresses the crowd. 

""Patriots, Germans, welcomed friends thank you for your support. But it is late, and I ask you to return to your homes. The tragedy of the Chancellor's death is a great one. I will forever live with the weight of failure to protect a fellow German, a failure that I hope can one day be forgiven. To those that support me, I say turn not to violence, but to the ballot box, people are trying to kill us so clearly we're challenging the established order. So I say, we must overcome this challenges that face us, and we must work together as Germans for Germans. God bless and good night!"" Georg turns to his wife, and see's she's been recording the whole speech. That was great my love, truly worthy of a great ruler.

-- 9:00, 3 hours earlier--

Von Bismarck can't believe the news, Christian is dead. He, he, had just seen him. He had set up the meeting with Friedrich. ""Augustus, Augustus are you with us?"" says President Kurr, she looks at the Minister of Defense. ""Augustus are you alright? I, I ha.. I just I have news... I before the news of the Chancellor's shooting was released I had a meeting, a meeting with the [Austrians](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/9hb1ea/event_just_a_night_at_the_opera/) its been confirmed that Protugal has given the Demoratic Defense atleast $350 million, which is quite a large sum. This is probably where the Democratic Defense got their sudden support from. It would further be enough to cause a stir within the European, and international community. The Berlin police have confirmed that gunman on Oli Gunterson, is a member of the Democratic Defense. So we have the motive for the past 10 years of diplomatic relations between the Portuguese our government. We have the paper trail for the money the Portuguese have sent the Democratic Defense and a member that part of the group. Its rather but and dry ma'am. We can say that Portugal paid to have the Chancellor assassinated, and attempted to kill Georg Friedrich, along with influencing our elections. 

--9:30 pm--
Marco is packing, packing for his life. Oli's ruined everything, everything that they worked for. Everything that they stood for. He's made it impossible for any progress to be made but worse than that. The fool painted a target on all our heads. I have to get home, I need to get back to Italy Marco thinks. Meanwhile, Sophia too is frantic, she's worried theres been threats that the AFD will break or atleast fire bomb the office. She's gotten some of the more passionate members to remain and protect the building but, that wont be enough and it sure won't stop the German police when they come to take us all away.

9hm3og,1,2018-09-21,How to get my parents off my back [21F],idkwut2d,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9hm3og/how_to_get_my_parents_off_my_back_21f/,"I understand why they're the way they are and I admit to my faults. But I'm almost 21 and I believe I should be able to live freely. 

There are times when I wanted my freedom and independence but my parents would brush that off, calling it just teenage bs. They also said that I would have plenty of opportunity to enjoy life alone without them after graduation, getting a job, and especially after they die. I wanted to do research at school over the summer last year not only because I actually wanted to but also I needed time to myself. My parents and I got into a huge fight about this. They then said that they're gonna come to my school and live with me over the summer. I ended up giving up because my mom broke down on the phone, saying that this and other family situations are stressing her out and that it would make life easier for me to just come back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year too I wanted to get an internship on my own but my parents forced me to apply to an internship of their choice, saying that there's a possibility I won't get anything. Also winter break I told them that I would apply to their place of choice ONLY as a last resort. But the deadline was like end of January and I didn't really get to contact other research labs yet because it seemed too early. When I refused to apply to the internship this year (they tried to make me do it last year as well), they threatened to cancel summer family plans. They said that thanks to me I would be ruining the vacation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was actually quite the studious child in high school and never got in trouble. I mainly stayed home and studied. While this did help me get into a prestigious college, it totally wrecked my social skills. Going to college made me experience so many things and I actually got to know about myself. Looking back I don't really think I had a personality or voice in high school, but having that freedom and being forced to look out after myself in college just completely changed who I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taking a gap semester right now. Was going to graduate early but ended up just taking a semester off. This too was a result of my parents. Obviously I wanted to stay in college all four years and really enjoy my time there. But, they were all like ""well what's the point of staying in college another year when you could technically just finish everything in one"" and ""you just want to stay another semester to waste money on not studying and just hanging around"". So they pretty much forced me to take a semester off by guilt tripping me. And whenever I bring this up they pull the ""well the choice was ultimately yours"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I downloaded tinder to meet with people, otherwise I felt like I was going to go crazy just staying at home and occasionally going to my part-time job. My mom insists on driving me around because I suck at driving. So okay she drives me to the place I agree to meet up with my tinder date. I lied to her, saying I was meeting up with like 3 other friends. So she drops me off and says she's going to go shopping. My original plan was to get dropped off at the place and then uber to where I'm actually supposed to meet my tinder date. So I just hang around the place for a few minutes and when I'm about to leave I notice my mom's car is parked on the other side of the street. I quickly cancel the uber and act like my friends are late. But obviously it's kind of sketchy because it's been like 20 minutes since I was supposed to meet my ""friends"" (7 pm) and not a single person showed up. My mom tells me that she decided to wait until at least one person showed up because it was an ""unfamiliar"" neighborhood and she's worried for my safety. I understand her concerns but..? I confess that I was supposed to go on a ""date"" but lied to her because she tends to nag when it comes to boys. She insists on staying there until he shows up. So I quickly text my date, asking him to come to where I am. He eventually arrives (7:50 pm) and she finally leaves. She then says she's gonna pick me up after an hour (9 pm). Pissed by my mom waiting for me (thankful but at the same time just no) and trying to force me to come home early I turn off my phone and ignore all messages. I got back home a little before midnight. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously upset by this situation she grounds me for the next couple of weeks. I'm almost 21 though and I think it's ridiculous that I still have to explain to her who exactly I'm meeting and what we'll be doing. The past couple of weeks though she has been kind of lenient by letting me stay over at a friends place twice and letting me meet up with people. And that was only possible because I had been pretending to meet up with the same friends over and over again when in reality I had been meeting up with friends and tinder dates (lol). We even signed a ""contract"" that says if I lie to her and aren't being clear about what I'm doing then she has the rights to enforce rules and I have to abide by them. Yes, I admit to breaking that rule and therefore I deserve to be punished. BUT I'M ALMOST 21. Whenever I complain about this lack of freedom as an adult, they pull the ""if you want to be independent, make your own money, pay for your own tuition"" and ""if you truly want to be independent what's the point of having parents"". And when I said fine, I'll leave, they said they're gonna contact my friends and go to their dorms and what not to find me.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to decide whether I should actually leave the house tomorrow. But if I do pull through with the plan I would have to find a place to stay (most friends live in university dorms and those who don't are tinder matches l o l) and disconnect from the family phone line. Oh yea they checked who I've been messaging recently because of the recent tinder fiasco and have been trying to figure out who I've been texting like crazy these days. 

Should I suck it up and stay at home? Like admit to my faults and deal with it until I go back to school? Or temporarily move out. See I just don't know if it would be worth moving out for the next three months. But my parents are driving me crazy right now. Help.

It's distracting and upsetting, especially when I know we can't see each other for a few days.

We've been dating 5 months now, and had a 3 month break in between because he left for the summer (but we still talked and had a quasi-relationship). We both go to school in the upper midwest, but he has an internship in the lower midwest (a 13 hour drive away).

I think about him so often. I feel like my mind always wanders to him when I'm bored. I stay up late thinking about him. We see each other almost every day, but we only hang out alone two or three times a week if I'm lucky. This is because we are both workaholic college students.

Sometimes, I feel anxious or depressed when he doesn't want to spend time together because he's busy. Especially when we've only spent one night together the whole week.

**TL;DR: I can definitely say I love him, and think about him many times every day. Am I being obsessive? Should I tell him? How do I stop thinking and worrying so much?**"

And also, I'm interested in studying in math but don't know if Courant or Tandon is a better fit for me(I'll apply one as my first choice and the other as second tho). I'll probably do a double major or a minor in Business/Finance or Computer Science(Not sure which I'm more interested in yet).

9hmxgh,7,2018-09-21,Creepy dudes I've experienced,libra_writer,LetsReadOfficial,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/9hmxgh/creepy_dudes_ive_experienced/,"1. The Pianist - When I was around 11, I joined the choir group at our local church. I was so excited yet shy to make friends but fortunately, the other kids were nice enough to make me feel welcomed. One night, as we finished singing the pianist approached me. He was mid 40s and had a big gut. He had that leering smile as well that always made me feel uneasy but I always just brushed it off. He told me, ""hey, put your name and number in our sign up sheet for the summer program"". I can't exactly remember what type of summer program it was but of course, I obliged right away - excited to spend more time with the people I'm getting to know a bit better as time went on. A few days later I received a text seemingly from him. It was totally innocent at first, just asked if I could make it to practice or the service and what not. Until one day, he started to get weird and ask questions like ""do you like going to the mall?"". I didn't want to be rude (I know, looking back I realized how that line always seem to get younger girls in trouble eh?) so I said, ""yes I do""  he then went on how he would love to bring me to the mall closest to us and would love to take me shopping. Again, I was 11 so what  the hell does a mid 40 year old man want from a kid? My mother soon found out about the texts because I showed her. I didn't really think much of it. I even laughed when I showed her and said ""look mom, this is guy is weird"" I thought it was just that. He was just weird. Boy was I wrong. She was furious and demanded to have the pianist fired. It was a big mess. A few days later I found out that this man would bring young girls to the mall, buy them whatever they wish to gain their trust and bring them to a dark movie house and of course, you guessed it - touch them inappropriately. I was shocked when I found out about this. Definitely dodged a bullet. Apparently he had been doing that for years and finally got caught. 
2. The Priest - I know, I know. Catholic priests don't have stellar reputations and it's true. Some are pure and some should definitely be behind bars. The same local church I was in, a few months after the incident one of the priests seem to be too touchy to all of us. Even young boys. He'd been one of the senior priests there. Sometimes he would just innocently pat us on our heads but most times he would caress our lower backs or our arms for few seconds while talking to us. It definitely made me super uneasy. I think it did to all of us. No one ever said anything. At least to my knowledge. Then one day, he started messaging me on facebook saying things like, ""Wow! You are so beautiful. Every angle is great!"" or stuff like ""Seeing you in church brightens my mood every time you are so beautiful"" Mind you, I was still 11 years old and I'm pretty sure with all his white hair and thin frail frame he was nearing his 60s. The touches advanced to him putting his hand on my thigh. On our thighs. I wasn't the only one. I told my mom again about this and she suggested that I just stop attending church altogether since creepy men seem to surround the place. I did and I don't know what became of that. I do wish young girls and boys are safe from him though. 
3. The Trainer - I had a time in my life where I was overweight and it definitely made me insecure. So my mom, being the ever supportive enrolled me to a gym. I was a teenager around this point and thought it was going well until one day, a trainer I didn't know approached me and asked for my number. He said it was so he can inform me about the classes or events the gym offers because they do it to all their members. Stupid teenager me of course obliged and gave him my number. Again like the pianist it was innocent at first. Just asking if I'm enjoying the gym and all that. He then suddenly asked if I'm dating. I was no, I'm too young. He then asked ""are you interested in dating older men?"" I didn't know what to think of that but still I answered ""uhh I guess, I don't know"". He said, ""I'm 32. Would you date me?"" Well needless to say, I quit the gym and blocked his number. 
4. The guitarist - Another supposed mentor of mine who took advantage. We signed up for musical lessons for extra curricular and I chose the guitar. The room for the lessons were small, just enough for a few equipments and 2 persons. To save space I guess. The place had a few rooms to cater to other students. I was still a teenager here too. At first, he was a nice dude. Probably mid 30s. Then the touching started to happen. It was only session 2 when he started caressing my shoulders. Seemingly encouraging me that I can do it, ""just keep practicing"" he said. Nervously, I said okay. I was nervous because I kid you not, he looked really creepy. He had long thin hair that was tied back, had a big gut as well and some facial hair that was unkempt. I don't want to sound judgemental but that was what I was thinking when I was a teenager. Next session, he suddenly put his hand on my thigh. At first while explaining our lessons that day, he just kept it there... like it was a normal thing to do. Then before we started he started to move it up and down. Well, guess who never showed up to the next sessions? I was too scared to go for the 3rd sessions and to even tell my mom. I just said I was feeling sick. I forgot the next events but all I know is I never went back. 
5. The chef and the old guest - By this point, I'm already 18. I did an internship abroad and got close to the chefs at the place I trained at. There was one particular chef though. He was really nice at first. (Aren't they all?) My shifts start really early. Like 4am early. Backstory, I open the place by myself until a chef arrives to help start setting up then a few other colleague comes. It was around 5am, it was just the two of us then. I was busy preparing. He greeted me like normal then suddenly he came up behind me and started massaging my shoulders. At first I laughed and nudged him a good morning. I thought he would stop there but then he literally pushed up his dick to my behind and breathed out onto my ear. ""Hmmmm. You work good la"" His english was broken, he's Chinese. I was so scared and just walked away after pushing him away. I pretended I forgot to do something elsewhere. I tried avoiding him since then. And I know I should've told my superiors but there was also an incident where I had an old guest who suddenly grabbed my shoulder and kissed my right cheek while taking a video of himself showing off the view of restaurant. I felt helpless then and when the chef incident happened, I thought no one would do anything like before anyway so why bother? My last encounter with the chef was during my last day. He caught me alone in the elevator, moved up close to me grabbed my shoulders and took a selfie on his phone. My smile was obviously awkward and forced. I was too shocked to say anything. He went out first and after a few seconds, I got my bearings and went back to my apartment.
6. Young adult - I'm used to catcalls and men who stare. Or even who obviously fakes accidentally brushing against me just to touch me. Or random guys who messages me. Facebook and Instagram can be a dangerous place too. One guy found out where I worked and dropped by and even left food for me. I only replied a few times to him just to be polite so leaving food and dropping by was definitely not normal. I've never even met him. Just had common friends. I blocked him and never heard from him again, thank god. Next there was also this guy who apparently saves all my pictures on his phone and has an album for me. He sent me a screen capture and would always message me about how ""beautiful"" I am. I deleted my facebook and have my instagram on private now. Ending with this, I hope young girls or even young boys have people around them to protect them against these type of people. The world is dangerous, be safe kids! "
9hmybd,1,2018-09-21,My girlfriend [both 18] is moving away,Best-TF-Russia,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9hmybd/my_girlfriend_both_18_is_moving_away/,"I found out recently that my girlfriend of almost 1 year is moving a few states away (90 mins by plane, 11 hour drive). I am crushed. She is going to leave after she finishes this year of cosmetology school. She asked me if I could go with her, saying that the property her and her mother are moving to has a house which is reserved for my girlfriend and I when we are moving in together.

I told her that moving away at this point in my life wouldn't be smart, as I have just started at a new school and am doing well. But she explained to me that I could go to a college near her new home that is undeniably better than the one I am in now, complete with much cheaper tuition.

I felt inside myself that I couldn't handle it, and I can't put my finger on why. I just feel like a kid. I just don't feel like I'm ready. And even if I was, my parents are expecting me to finish college and get my degree before I look into moving out. They would be heartbroken and angry to hear that I plan to leave so early, and they would not allow me.

I know as an 18 year old, I can leave if I want to, but I also need to finish college, and they could easily just refuse to pay for me to go to school near her house, so I am still dependent on them in that aspect.

The prospect of a long distance relationship until I finish college is something I presented to my girlfriend, complete with promises to visit her doing school breaks for weeks on end and whenever I could. But she expressed her feelings about LDRs: she thinks they don't work, and she would be miserable if she had to wait 2 or so years before we start seeing each other normally again.

At this point I tried to persuade her, saying that our strong commitment to each other (we plan on getting married) should supersede any circumstances that block our path. To that, she flipped it on me, saying that I ""could"" simply move in with her to prove my commitment and overcome the obstacle before us.

But as I explained, it's not really possible. So this is our dilemma: I can't move in with her and she doesn't want to do long distance for 2 years. But we both want to remain together.

At this point, I thought of a compromise. Paraphrasing, I told her: ""We love each other, we have a commitment to each other, we are willing to sacrifice a lot for each other"" - and she agreed.

So I proposed a plan where we both sacrifice something for the greater good of our commitment and future.

I would agree to move in with her at the END of sophomore year, about a year after she leaves. Until then, we maintain a long distance relationship. This is much more probable than right now to go down well with my parents, and here is why:

1. My parents would know that it's coming and have plenty of time to come to terms with it. This would hopefully mean they agree to allow me to transfer colleges and continue paying my way through.
2. It would appear less impulsive, which would be their #1 criticism if I left now. They'd say ""You're shaking up your entire life for a girl who, when she leaves, will only have been your girlfriend for a year and a half or so."" But, if we spend one year apart and prove our seriousness about our relationship, it will be much more than a spur of the moment decision with no logical basis behind it.
3. I would have time to come to terms with leaving and part with my surroundings. I will be older, slightly more mature, and definitely feel less ""like a kid"" as I do now.
4. With my girlfriend gone for an entire school year, I will be, put nicely, a little bored. All my good dudes from high school have moved to college, so I've been seeing my girlfriend 4 or 5 days a week. That boredom will allow me plenty of time to take on more work hours and build up a significant savings. I can also pursue internship opportunities and decide on a major, which I can then pick up with when I transfer colleges.

Obviously this is a loaded situation with a lot of facets that must be considered, but why I am dumping this on reddit? Simply put, I need to know if I'm being logical enough about this, and I'm not in over my head. I'm willing to do nearly anything possible to be with this girl, but I don't know if I can handle being responsible for ruining my relationship with my parents, if that's what happens. Would they have a right to cut me off? Even if I'm prepared for it and intent on furthering my education, will 19 and a half still be too unreasonably young for me to leave?

 \*\*TL;DR; : My girlfriend is moving away. We have a plan to continue our relationship but I would need to find a way to convince my parents of the merit of that plan. Am I in over my head, or should I be willing to take this on for someone I truly love?\*\*

Thanks for reading all of this. Please comment if you have any further questions or pm me.

I feel like organizing an AMA is difficult because you have to reach out and coordinate everything for every single AMA. Making it into a reoccurring event would only require initial effort setting it up, but after that it won't be much more work other than just starting a thread every time it's time for one.

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

I noticed that for the past three months, my dreams have drastically changed (I usually dream about a million different things : my hobbies /family/friends/things i like doing etc). I realized that since I started this internship, I haven't dreamed about anything else but job /job related stuff/things I do during work hours.

I never stopped a moment to think why but I think it's because once I get out of the job and get home, I just sit on the couch /cook dinner/watch shows/etc.
I never do anything productive NOT even when I have spare time to do so.

This makes me feel miserable and like Im throwing my life away and just going through the days fast and without purpose.

How do you change this? How do you motivate yourself to do stuff? How do you gather energy???

9hn6ty,2,2018-09-21,I Need to Quit my Awful Internship and I’m Terrified,httpyou,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9hn6ty/i_need_to_quit_my_awful_internship_and_im/,"I’ve had the same job for my whole college career and it’s my first job i’ve ever had, so I have never had to quit a job before in my life. 

I am currently in my last semester in school while also working at my part time job and two days a week i work 9-3 at my unpaid internship. 

Now this internship has been a roller coaster from the start and I could make a LIST of all the bad experiences I’ve had there and it’s getting to the point where thinking about going there gives me anxiety and I’m miserable there. 

Since it’s unpaid and I don’t technically need the internship to graduate (I just got it so it would look good on my resume and for experience) I feel like if I’m not enjoying my time there I’m wasting my time. Everyone in my life is telling me that on Monday when I go in I need to tell them that this is my last week... but I’m SO SCARED. 

I’ve never had to quit anything in my life and there’s been so much drama at this internship because of one individual who works there, and she’s going to be the one I have to tell i’m leaving. I know she doesn’t like me and thinks i’m weak and stupid and I’m so scared of what she’s going to say. She’s very judge-mental and talks about everyone behind their back.

I’m thinking of using the excuse that me only working four days a week at my paid job (because of school too) I need to pick up more hours if I’m going to be able to make my car payments and  pay bills i have. I’ve hinted at them before that I have a lot going on at home with my mom, but even though things are okay right now I could use that as an excuse as well. I’m just so scared to tell them the reason i’m leaving is because of how unprofessional they’ve been and how they treat me and I’m not a fan of the way they run things. They’re a small business and they try really hard to put on a big front that they have their shit together when in reality the place is a mess. 
I thought about writing a letter but they’re not a professional setting at all so I know that would just be more awkward. 

Thanks if you’ve read all this. I would love to hear if anyone else had any issues with quitting an awful job and any advice you have is welcome!"

As the title says, I go to well ranked liberal arts University in the USA, and I am majoring in Computer Science. I haven't been back since I was a kid and have been meaning for a long time but the opportunity has not arisen. I have been struggling to find internships and research opportunities in NZ during May-Jun because it's pretty unorthodox I guess. Any help with resources, links, or just looking at my resume and seeing if I'd fit anywhere would be greatly appreciated. For those interested, I want to go into Software Engineering and have worked on full stack projects, as well as a lot of Android Development. "
9ho7ee,61,2018-09-21,[P] A little library for data augmentation for Bounding Boxes for object detection tasks,ForgottenRhymes,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9ho7ee/p_a_little_library_for_data_augmentation_for/,"For the past 9 months or so, I've worked an internship that has extensively required me to work with Object Detection. While data augmentation can be leveraged for great gains, I quickly realised that most of the data augmentation libraries or code bases out there don't exactly support what you will call *bounding box transforms.*

What I mean is let's consider the `torchvision` package from the PyTorch  which supports rotating an image randomly. When it does so, the bounding box containing the objects will also change, and `torchvision` doesn't support changing the annotation/label for the image we are rotating. The only library I have found that supports such augmentations is `imageaug` which I realised only later. However, I anyway decided to go ahead the library, and decided to write detailed tutorials about the implementation so I could share what I learned.

Most of the open source implementations of object detectors I came across therefore implemented their own augmentations. Therefore, I decided to implement a tiny library on my own that currently supports bounding box augmentations for flipping, rotation, shearing, scaling, translation and resizing. I'm currently looking to add more augmentations, so would be greatly helpful if you could chip in with augmentations that work well for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the GitHub repo:

[https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection](https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection)

and the documentation can be found by opening the `docs/build/html/index.html` file.

If you want to know how I implemented it for pedagogical purposes, or you just feel like critiquing the design decisions, here's a tutorial series that covers the implementation from absolute scratch. This tutorial series cover the implementations in gory detail where I go over:

1. How to set up a uniform interface for defining an augmentation, so you could define your own.
2. What to do when a bounding box crosses the boundary of the image. Do we keep it, or do we drop it? Something in between?
3. How to combine multiple augmentations where each augmentation is applied in a stochastic manner.
4. How to incorporate these augmentations into your input pipelines. I cover this considering people use a lot of annotation tools and annotations come in different formats.

Feedback either over the code, or the quality of the articles would be highly appreciated."

I went to college for computer engineering, and got a job in the industry afterwards. In college, my internships, and my job, I've dealt with sexual harassment and I've had to get tough with people, telling them to stay the fuck away when I get the first whiff of sketchiness.

Every time I've gotten a creepy text or instant message from another student or co worker, I've screenshotted it and backed it up in google drive just in case it escalates. That's helped me a few times, when someone started to follow me around in college, and when someone took things so far at work that I decided to go to HR. I don't report most of the shit though, I don't want it to look bad like I'm always running to HR.

Last night, I got really drunk with my friend because I had a day off planned for today. I went home in a kinda bad mood because we'd been talking about how she was going through similar shit at work. I was in a ""fuck it all"" mood, and I uploaded my whole folder of screenshotted text messages to Facebook and Instagram, with the caption ""Phone &amp; Inbox of a female computer engineer."" And tagged all the men who had sent me messages, whose social media I could find.

Some of the highlights were...

A bunch of married men hitting on me, and me replying ""dude you're married"" or something along those lines.

Some guys asking me out and then taking rejection badly.

Some guys who would text me repeatedly even though I'd just replied ""Don't contact me, other than for work purposes""

Sexually explicit messages, or messages commenting on my appearance out of the blue.

Overall, just messages from people ignoring my wishes to be left alone.

This morning, I woke up to my phone blowing up. (I had planned to take a vacation day off work today). A lot of the guys I'd tagged in my social media posts had contacted me demanding or pleading that I remove the posts. Most everyone had untagged themselves.

The Facebook post had gotten some attention from my friends, but my two Instagram posts (I had to make 2 to fit all the photos) had blown up. I had a lot of new followers, a lot of strangers commenting on my post, mostly supportive.

I also had a email from HR at work asking me to meet with them first thing Monday morning. I replied to say that I would. I don't know what to expect there at all. I have not replied to any other messages about my posts.

I need some advice. Should I speak to the guys who texted me about the posts? Some are very angry with me because they are married and their wives found out. I'm thinking it's safest to not. Should I leave the posts up, or remove them? Or wait to see how things go with HR before I decide? Should I be worried for my safety? I feel a little nervous but I don't know if I'm overreacting.

TLDR - I posted an album on social media, a collection of creepy texts I have gotten from men in my field of study and work

------

Edit to explain something: 

Quite a few of these men were not under my current companny's control. Such as classmates and a TA from college, men I knew from summer internships at different companies, and a guy from a past job.

Out of the four people from my current job...

1) I reported him to HR actually.

2 &amp; 3 ) Married men who asked me out or hit on me outside of work hours. And did not present a problem at work. Thatdid not seem like HRs domain.

4) A guy who asked me out outside of work hours, and got mildly passive agressive over text when I rejected him. But did not bring his bullshit into the office"
9hr581,4,2018-09-21,"Nix, R, sessionInfo and which",Mrjegerjeg,NixOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/9hr581/nix_r_sessioninfo_and_which/,"I have started recently using Nix (not NixOs) with R. I am using R under a nix-shell and I came across with a problem that took me several hours to debug and solve. Basically, R tries to use the system command **which** and can't find it, so the **sessionInfo()** function fails:

&amp;#x200B;

    $ nix-shell -p R
    [nix-shell:~]$ R
    R version 3.3.3 (2017-03-06) -- ""Another Canoe""
    Copyright (C) 2017 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
    [..]
    &gt; sessionInfo()
    Error in system(paste(which, shQuote(names[i])), intern = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE) : 
      error in running command

So if I debug it:

    &gt; debug(Sys.which)
    &gt; sessionInfo()
    debugging in: Sys.which(""uname"")
    debug: {
        res &lt;- character(length(names))
        names(res) &lt;- names
        which &lt;- ""/nix/store/2656h5javasjcsm7lwbmf6j7w8bwxyys-which-2.21/bin/which""
     [..]

We can see that the path to the which command is hardcoded in the function definition. No idea why that path in particular, and no idea why is not using /usr/bin/which that comes with my OS (ubuntu). So the idea, is to include the which package into the environment definition with **nix-shell -p R which** :

    $ nix-shell -p R which
    [nix-shell:~]$ R
    [..]
    &gt; sessionInfo()
    R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)
    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
    Running under: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
    [..]
    &gt; 

So the question that arises now is: Is this a failed dependency or is it something I should have known from the beginning (and then, what else I don't know that I am missing)? and also, why that PATH to the Nix store that I don't have?

Interestingly enough, if I run again **nix-shell -p R** (no which), everything works like a charm. And the which command is there, although I didn't make it available this time. Everything is a little confusing, so any comments will be appreciated :)"
9hrg19,11,2018-09-21,Anyone else have a straight women fall in love with them for no reason?,gettotallygayaboutit,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9hrg19/anyone_else_have_a_straight_women_fall_in_love/,"I have had this happen before to me and right now I see it happening before my very eyes to this Gay Intern at work. We have a few interns and entry level employees where I work. They are all young... twenty-twenty-two-ish. Well there is one kid, we will call him ""Todd"" who sets my gaydar off like a Church Bell on Sunday morning. The kid is so obviously gay it's like he is floating on air when he walks. He has Lady Gaga and a movie poster for ""Mommy Dearest"" hanging in his cubical for God's Sakes!

Anyway, there is this girl who works there also we will call her Susan. Sort of shorter and Chubby and the amount of times she has her hair done and her nails and her wardrobe, you can tell she really doesn't have much of a self image and low self esteem.  She is single and really Really REALLY wants a relationship. You know the type. She thinks she is validated only when she gets into a relationship with a well-groomed, fit and good looking guy.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Susan has noticed Todd, a good looking younger guy who does NOT have a Girlfriend.  Most of the other Interns and Entry Level people are all in relationships. In some cases they are even dating each other and they all go hang out. Well Susan sees Todd as alone and friendly and obviously develops a crush on him. I guess in her mind she is thinking ""I can go after Todd and then Love happens and I am socially validated amongst my peers"" type of thoughts...not to get too Freudian....

So, she has been crushing on him hard... completely oblivious to the gay-ness of Todd..... and Todd was obviously completely Oblivious to the fact Susan is in love with him. He just thinks she is being nice I guess. Or is a big fag-hag or something.   So, I can see this train wreck coming from a mile away...

Long story short,  Susan was being extra cool to Todd. Bringing him special things for lunch, like s'mores.... but Todd refuses as he is ""careful about what he eats"" but Susan scarfs them down without a second thought.  There's several different things she has done to build a ""friendship"" with him.  But.... as we all know.... the friendship only goes so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, One day I can hear her on the phone talking to some friend and saying she was going out to a movie this weekend with ""Him"" ..... (Incidentally, the Movie? Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again!....Totally Gay) Anyway she says how excited she was and that HE actually SUGGESTED that movie so they have so much in common (Duh! Including attraction to other dudes!)

&amp;#x200B;

So, this ""friendship must have gone on for a few weeks of hanging out... But then something happened....

&amp;#x200B;

Susan has been outwardly rude to Todd. Todd seems awkward around the workplace now where as before he was always open and happy and bouncing off the walls with energy. Now he is subdued and quiet. Susan sees him walks past and she rolls her eyes with disgust.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say there is currently a tension in the office that was NOT there before.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is that Todd must have either pointed out he was not interest in her, or maybe came out to her. Either way, I saw it coming from a MILE AWAY and I just enjoyed watching it unfold in front of my eyes.  I mean most gays have been there. A woman, usually a chubbier one who is more average looking, pursues a guy who is single and well groomed. It turns out the guy is a closeted gay dude and the woman was clueless and lacks any sort of gaydar. Suddenly things turn awkward and uncomfortable for both.

&amp;#x200B;

I even heard Susan on the phone this morning talking to another friend. ""We haven't talked to each other. I'm ignoring him."" type of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I a terrible person for watching this and not saying anything?  Just watching it pan out for entertainment purposes. I KNOW Todd is gay.... How many 22 yr old straight guys listen to Demi Lavato and have a photo of Adam Rippon the figure skater as desktop wallpaper?  However, I did not feel saying anything was my place as he has never come out to me or anyone else in the office as far as I know.  So I never said anything. But I think I could have definitely made his life easier had I told him Susan was on the prowl for him and he better distance himself before she develops serious feelings for him. I could also have pointed out to Susan that Todd might be gay. But I didn't feel it was my business. 

So, Instead  watched it all happen for entertainment purposes. Now I feel a bit guilty about it.

I've determined that the simplest way to do this at this scale is to have linux boot from a flash drive and copy over an image to the internal storage. I considered clonezilla servers and PXE servers, but there are some specifics that I would have to get right for these boards and I don't know enough to do that properly in time.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan is to put a lightweight distro on a USB 3 flash drive and have it automatically erase the internal storage, copy over the image using dd, and then check that it has worked correctly, before saying ""success."" At this point the factory worker will remove power and unplug the device.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) which linux distro is best for this? I forgot what the term is, but I would want the distro to not make any changes to the contents of the flash drive at all, as in it would be read only. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is it alright if power is removed while the board is still on once the process is over? Or would I have to have it shut down?

Sorry if this isn't appropriate for this sub. I didnt want to post to cscareerquestions since this is more specific to Android but i'll post there if it's more suitable.

 I've been learning Android on and off for the last year, mainly due to not being sure about what field I wanted to get into and also because a lack of discipline. I've been investing my time more heavily into learning Android over the last month and was wondering how proficient I would have to become in order to become hireable as an entry level dev. I pretty much just have a few android projects from following youtube tutorials and following the Big Nerd Ranch. I've gone over Activity &amp; Fragments and their lifecycles, sharedpreference, networking, sqlite(very briefly), and some other basic stuff. I've started working on a project where I plan to use Retrofit, Picasso, and any other libraries that I find would be useful and also Firebase. Are there more things I should consider for an entry level position?

I'm also currently learning Spring and plan to learn MySql for my SWE class. Would these skills help me in the android dev market?

While it was incredibly painful to deal with, I am now happy she isn't around anymore. I realized she had been abusing me all along, and I'm glad I could find the strength to call her out on her shit.  This friendship taught me a lot. Now, I won't bend over backwards just to make people love me. I won't accept rude behaviour such as trash-talking about my ass in a foreign language right in front of me. I won't ever try to please people anymore. And I will never lose sight of who I am anymore.

Fast forward to this month. I enrolled into a school, though I felt it was a bad decision. I wanted to give it a chance, but after my bad intuition being confirmed during internship, I left. I didn't force myself to stay against my will. I tried, that's what counts. I stopped it as soon as I realized it wasn't good for me. 

I decided to look for a job and move out of my mom's home, and I made my CV. I sent my first ever cover letter. I've never felt so proud of myself. And when my mom came to pick me up to do some groceries, she told me that her universally disliked narcissistic coworker soon will be gone due to moving. It's insane how things can get better when you get that wake-up call. I'm feeling so happy right now. I'm excited for the future. I feel that what happened with my friend a long time ago acted as some sort of catalyst for where I am right now. And I look forward to new adventures in life."

9htfky,2,2018-09-21,[Futa4A] Introducing Krista,CfiIv_zfXcy_dgrj,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9htfky/futa4a_introducing_krista/,"[Kristina Alexandra Bevins](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6l0phidomqzrm2/the%20REAL%20Krista%20Bevins.jpg?dl=0) looks back on her life sometimes, and reflects on how in some ways it reminds her of a book she was told to read in high school. Her struggles are nowhere near as profound as that story's protagonist's, and her ambitions will lead her somewhere far higher than the protagonist ended up in. At least, she hopes that last bit will prove true, and that she can have a truly stable life. Most of her life, the only thing constant about it was the presence of her mother, Irene.  

Irene comes from Port Huron, and married a man from Morgantown, Alexander Bevins, she met after a drunken party at her job in Chesterfield outside of Detroit. He was floating through on his way to work at Selfridge. He didn't stay in Michigan long and eventually ended up in Germany alongside his new wife, where he knocked her up in a portapotty outside some baron's castle on the Rhine near Koblenz for their honeymoon. She gave birth in Okinawa to their first and only child, Krista. For the next twelve years Krista would be moving alongside her parents to different places and eventually different schools on and near US military bases, as her father was a contractor whose job took him worldwide. Much of the time, though, their moves were to and from just three countries: Japan, Germany, and America itself. 

Though Krista became accustomed to not making many friends, Irene was never happy with the traveling life, or with Alexander's long hours keeping him away from his wife and daughter, and these tensions exploded as their daughter approached puberty. In Missisippi they filed for divorce when Krista was eleven. Irene kept Krista but didn't have much money, and worked as a stripper and waitress for a year to get the cash she needed to return home to...Novi, Michigan, seventy-four miles southwest of her birthplace. She rented a house next door to some people who voted for Libertarians and Republicans, and put her daughter in school. 

For the first time in her life, Krista had a home that she wouldn't leave in six months- rather, it would be six years before she packed her bags again. But her new home was prowled by bullies who mocked her accent for sounding ""country"" and ""southern"" even though they used that variety in their own private conversations. [A girl she had once written off as a weirdo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dn0iuclkye6ee8q/sophie.jpg?dl=0) stood up for her, and the two became inseparable friends despite their differences. Krista was a serious Girl Scout who took the business of capitalism seriously, Sophie an art-loving, flippant free spirit and, in turns, anarcho-capitalist, communist and finally anarchist. Despite it, they bonded over food, porn and anime and eventually fucked each other just before leaving for college. 

Krista planned to go to Wayne State and stay in Metro Detroit until she had a degree, but Sophie's college results called her to Cleveland's Case Western Reserve, coincidentally home to her childhood friend [Drew Valentino](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tv2noos5vl363n7/I%20R%20O%20N%20I%20C%20A%20L%20L%20Y%20a%20good%20picture.jpg?dl=0). Unwilling to separate from the girl she was in love with, Krista left behind the Motor City for the Forest City. 

**Appearance and sexual preferences**

Krista is seventy-two inches (just 6 feet) tall. She is a *tiiiny* bit insecure that her penis is two inches shorter than Sophie's, but fifteen is still enough to make most girls scream in delight unless they've been visiting the Hyperdick Dimension, Sophie included. Her vagina is surrounded by two meaty inner labia which poke out of her labia majora and cling to anything that passes between them, helping those who penetrate her orgasm quicker. She wears an E-cup bra. Her physique is neither particularly slim nor overly curvy, though she can flaunt her behind and breasts to make them appear so.

Krista, like Drew, only shows sexual attraction to feminine-appearing individuals. At heart she is both driven to achieve whatever is set out in front of her with her own plans but also intensely devoted to those close to her; she uses sex as an outlet for whatever control issues she has in her life, as well as her prodigious loads of cum. In less words, she is a switch, with more of a tendency towards submission. Depending on her life's circumstances she may be more or less willing to indulge that; currently she outwardly behaves dominantly and enjoys getting rough in the bed, controlling and creampieing her flings, and penetrating their holes before they do the same to her. 

**Prompts** (Congratulations, you've read this far! Now keep going! ""Femmes"" just means, well, everyone who is as, if not more, feminine in appearance than a femboy) 

* The Newest Profession

Drew' father bought a Hooters for her to ""manage"". In reality, that means Drew now has a masturbation chamber that isn't either her father's house or Sophie's ghetto fixer-upper, tucked into the back of a restaurant. And it needs workers, in addition to management, to pay the rent on the land it sits on and the company it's a franchisee of. Staggering out of Drew's office with her ass aching from two hours straight of buttfucking, Krista, having appointed herself ""Deputy Executive Manager"", begins to plan for the recruitment of potential ~~prostitutes~~ employees. And one of the people who decides to respond to her online postings is you!

Females and futas only. 

* Sugar, Spice And Everything...Semitized?

Yep, that's right. While going through sorority recruitment Krista ends up meeting a girl from the Middle East. The two have similar ambitions and interests but their conceptualizations of relationships are somewhat different; this isn't any impediment to Krista developing a crush on her new friend. It will be an impediment to that crush going any further than just infatuation, though, seeing as Krista won't just be (dreaming of) fucking her Middle Eastern friend.

Femmes only. 

* Socializing the Social Sciences

Krista regrets taking sociology in her first semester. She finds it somewhat insightful but also very boring. Mostly because her professor is boring as fuck and, she suspects, a commie ~~like Sophie~~. I mean, the prof's office door is decorated with all sorts of stuff about Bernie, Occupy Wall Street, enviro-nutbaggery and Democrats, what else can a politically ignorant but slightly right-wing futa come up with? All she knows is that when her prof's not boring her she's making nasty little remarks about businessbeings. But she can't complain about that now, she's gotta see if there's some way to keep her grades from backsliding. 

All genders welcome. 

* A Titfuck In The Door

Despite becoming the self-appointed manager of a restaurant Krista wants to get her chops in better places. Like, say, local financial establishments. And thus she sets off to hunt down an internship in the Federal Reserve Bank downtown. Getting to be part of the workings of the national government is a daunting but hopefully profitable opportunity, and one that Krista will secure her grip on...provided she can convince the head of Human Resources to let her in. 

All genders welcome. 

* The Anarchist We've Been Looking For

One day Sophie declares her willingness to participate in a ""debate"" with the college's local band of Republicans on the merits of statism and anarchism, all the while proudly wearing her hair in almost the same shade as Krista's, with Krista at her side. She ends up forgetting about the event and a few weeks later some blonde ~~aspiring bimbo~~ Republican college student shows up at the door of Krista's apartment to tell her that it's time for the debate. The College Republicans mistook *her* for Sophie, and they're going to be in for a surprise as Krista casually agrees with them about the need for a strong state to protect laws, contracts, Christianity and the borders from regulations, immigrants, changing social norms and progressive income taxes. She'll soon get them agreeing to bang her. Well, the girl(s) at least, anyway.

All genders welcome. 

* Getting Semen Past The Inspector

The Cuyahoga County Board of Health is sending out an inspector to make the rounds of local restaurants as usual, including the one Krista and Sophie run on Drew's behalf. Normally they'd just have Drew be in class when they guess the inspection is likely to occur. This time, though, it's Saturday, and Drew is in her office with her Kendra Lust stroker shooting cream on the walls between assfucking the waitresses, whose asses drip with cum on the way out to the main floor. And the inspector is rather persistent, while Sophie is making art at home. It's up to Krista to keep this place from being condemned. 

All genders welcome. 

* In Mama's Hands

So, some years have passed. Krista and Sophie have both gotten bachelor's degrees, and Sophie is still happily unemployed while Drew is still happily fucking her waitresses in the back of Hooters. Krista, though, is now almost to the mid-levels of financial management and much of her appetite for sexual dominance has faded. So she turns to her steady lover, with the hope that she can make the stresses of ordering around idiots go away. 

Futas (Sophie Harper) only. 

**Adjunct**

I go to bed between 1 and 2 in the morning on most nights and live in the eastern United States, am a college student and ~~a wage slave~~ employed. That being said I will do my best to keep up with you, and even then, if you can only respond once or a few times a day (or week) that's fine with me.

[These are my kinks.](https://i.imgur.com/pj51VEb.png) There are no prompts which contradict them and involve Krista, which means that flouting them will, in all conditions, result in you getting blocked. **Your message title shall include the prompt you wish to play.** Send me your oranges!"

USC's Trojans FC student-run team is playing in the opening round of the US Open Cup this Sunday 9/23 at Lake Forest Sports Park vs. UPSL side Lionside FC.

Being the closest team geographically to LAFC, we would love to have anyone willing to come through and bring the noise! We are made up of lots of LAFC fans, and many Wings of Troy members play on the team including Wings of Troy President Noah, who is a defender starting in the game (and former LAFC intern before the club kicked off this season). I am the assistant coach and would love to have some of the best supporters in the country come out and cheer us on! As you may or may not know, USC doesn't have a D1 Men's team, so we are attempting to bridge the gap and do it in the biggest way possible. We are the only student-run, student-staffed mens team in the country to be doing this. 

We will be in the North End supporting vs. SJ and if one dose of supporters section action this weekend isn't enough for you when we win in the stands vs. Earthquakes, then please come out for a second helping on Sunday courtesy of Trojans FC!!!!

The game is at 7pm in Lake Forest @ Lake Forest Sports Park. We are on the road, but want to provide an atmosphere of  passion, energy, and unity like the 3252 does so well. 

Note: Please don't bring pyro/smoke as it is a public park, but WE WANT THE NOISE and the HYPE.

9hu0jw,2,2018-09-21,Coming from Android to iPhone XS/XS Max/XR upgrade concerns.,kiirodev,ios,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/9hu0jw/coming_from_android_to_iphone_xsxs_maxxr_upgrade/,"[X-post]
Hello,
I am looking for opinions. I am currently a Samsung Note 4 user looking to upgrade to one of the new iPhone releases in the next couple of months (after more reviews come out). The Note 4 is an excellent phone for the price, but it is showing its’ age in a few ways. Once I found out that the Note 4 does not support AR Core, I felt that it was time to start looking for an upgrade. 

 I am primarily interested in the developer aspect of the swap. Anything else like facial ID, hardened A12 processors against hacking, Slacker Time, ass-massager vibration features are just a nice bonus. I have never owned a recent Apple product – my last products were a Late 2009 MacBook, and a 1st or 2nd gen iPod Touch. Both still work just fine, although both are dated. 

I’m a computer science student who is extremely interested in using ARKit 2, and to play with the examples on github and start to learn how to make my own for personal use and learning. I am looking to ARKit 2 to help me become more educated in the field of AR and it’s applications, mobile capabilities, and generally expose myself to a fun new tool that makes programming so much fun. I have some experience with using Unity to develop for both the Oculus and Microsoft HoloLense (note: some) as part of a prior internship.

I am looking to use ARKit/ARK2 as an at-home way of getting relevant experience in a growing field, and to employ classroom concepts into a relevant app.

Concerns:
1)	At such a massive price for a student ($749 and above) I’m concerned about the lack of 5G integration – a purchase like this would have to last me 4-5 years, but being stuck on gigabit LTE advanced (XS and XS Max only, not XR compatible) might not be a smart idea. Some carriers claim to begin rolling out in select areas as soon as mid 2019

2) Would the XR actually be computationally more powerful because of the lower powered display, and lower pixel count? Is this concern even worth considering? At such a large price difference between the XS

3) From an AR development and end-user point of view, will the lack of the 2x zoom telescopic lens on the iPhone XR lower the overall quality of AR tracking, object detection, etc?

4) Will 4gb of ram (XS and XS Max only) impact the rendering and processing of AR apps?

5) Will my 2009 MacBook communicate well with the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max, and will the macbook run xcode/compile the programs/reupload to iphone for testing or is it too old

6)is iOS development the same as ARKit/ARK2 development? Or are they exclusive with two separate 

7) Screen real-estate: would the bigger screen on the XS Max benefit AR development in any meaningful way? 

I’m impressed by Apple’s continued support for phones. I’m impressed by their privacy statements. I’m impressed by their OS optimizations, in house development, face ID unlock, ARKIT/ARK2, Siri, seamless integration across products, and did I mention continued support for their phones?

9hu9dl,3,2018-09-21,Got dumped by first love after 4 years together at 22,Thamnosebleeed,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9hu9dl/got_dumped_by_first_love_after_4_years_together/,"I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong sub since my problem sounds quite tiny compared to some others, but I think I just really needed somewhere to say what can't leave my mind since I'm not used to talk about my problems to people. I usually keep every thing to myself, and try not to break until it's done. But I'm really feeling too deep about this one it needs to get out somehow.

Basically title, she came back from a 5 months internship overseas in Japan and I patiently waited, trying not to bother her too much since I know I'm quite over-loving and was just waiting for happy homecoming and I was so relieved she finally came back. But I got merely a smack in front of the bus and wasn't allowed to cuddle her at night because ""she wasn't feeling like it"". During the next 2 weeks she told me her feeling were diminished, she needed some time alone, but it would come back after some time, so I did let her some time. She then admitted that her feelings will not actually come back.

I don't have any hatred, and I probably never will, but I'm really feeling down and abandoned. I saw it coming of course but I didn't want it to happen. I'm glad she told me kinda quickly and didn't lie to me but that's still hard to handle.
When she sent me some messages afterwards to check if I was alright, it was like she was addressing to a stranger. Polite manners, full name... That really really hurts.
I'm now feeling lost in a university I merely walked in ""alone"", lost interest in my courses after 4 years of pure struggling (I had to do the first semester 3 times in order to stay in the same uni as her, it really is not easy), trying not to give up lessons and to keep my head forward.

My problem probably is not much of one, but I never dealt with that before and I think I'm a bit overly-sentimental. I also never had too much self-esteem, she raised it a lot during those years and I feel like I lost all those 4 years in literally 4 hours. I'm acting friendly and laughing with friends but if I'm let with myself I instantly have the urge to cry. 

Thanks for reading me if you did despite my poor English, and sorry for complaining. I think I feel a bit relieved to throw those feeling somewhere. "
9hue2b,1832,2018-09-21,My Worst Intern,jaqenjayz,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/9hue2b/my_worst_intern/,"I worked at a local government agency for a long time. Each summer, we would get a new crop of interns. Most were fine, some caused issues like when we caught two of them making out in the file room. Overall, they were just normal kids from high school or college trying to get some work experience.

&amp;nbsp;

In 2016 my department received an intern later than usual, right in the middle of the summer. Warner was a bit older than the usual crowd, around my age, maybe late 20s. We initially hit it off pretty well, and although I found him sort of strange, I didn’t mind since he was friendly and we had some common interests. He was the only person in my department who was even close to my age. The interns were all teenagers, and the regular staff averaged around 60, older than my mom. I was psyched to have a peer to chat with, so occasionally I would eat lunch with Warner or stop to talk at his cubicle. His strange-ness was mostly an outsized personality, a mix of over the top enthusiasm with a bit of social awkwardness. I got zero bad vibes from the guy.
 
&amp;nbsp;

It wasn’t long before Warner started having major performance problems at work. He would produce little to no work on most days, no-show or arrive late without informing anyone, and generally acted unprofessionally. One day he showed up for work at 3:15 PM, when our workday ended at 4:30. The office manager was livid and told him to go home. His behavior bothered nearly everyone in my office, but I did not supervise him, and we had plenty of slacker interns in the past. While his antics were a bit of a spectacle, it wasn’t a big deal to me.

&amp;nbsp;

If you’re wondering why he wasn’t let go, two words: political favor. I found out from Warner himself that he was hired because his uncle donated to the campaign of our big boss. He wasn’t going anywhere.

&amp;nbsp;

Near the end of that summer, I put in my notice that I was leaving my job and relocating to a new state. Once Warner caught wind of this, he would constantly complain that it sucked I was leaving because we barely had time to become friends. I would always laugh lightly in response and give a sympathetic “yeah”. He would start to monopolize my time at work more and more, and it became disruptive to the people who sat near me. I found it slightly annoying, but I also was extremely happy to be leaving that job for reasons unrelated to Warner, and I spent my last month there not caring much about what my co-workers thought. I tolerated him lingering by my desk.

&amp;nbsp;

One day he caught me leaving work and offered me a ride home. I usually took the bus, and occasionally other coworkers would offer me rides home if they were going my way, so this didn’t seem odd to me. I accepted, and walked to his car with him. It smelled awful and was full of garbage. He hastily cleared off the passenger seat and apologized. We got on our way, but once we were on the main road, he started begging me to stop and get dinner with him. I laughed and said he didn’t need to ask me that insistently, and said we could stop at a diner on the way. We had a nice meal, with pleasant conversation. He was intelligent and had a variety of interests, our political positions aligned, and we shared disdain for our cranky old coworkers. I had a good time. I expressed that he didn’t need to drive me all the way home now that it was late, but he kept insisting, so I relented.

&amp;nbsp;

As I directed him toward my house, he started in again with the whining about how our developing friendship was cut short because I was moving. At this point, I was tired of hearing this -- the decision to leave my job and move away from home was extremely difficult to make, and I was proud of how bold I was being. I stopped responding/laughing, and his whining faded out. We came up to the turn to get onto my street, and when I pointed it out he accelerated and drove right past it, laughing. I laughed in a “OMG WTF” way, thinking he was joking around. When I began giving instructions about how to turn around and get back, he started begging me to keep hanging out with him because he was lonely. This immediately set me on high alert. It suddenly hit me that I’m in a man’s car, someone I don’t know that well, who doesn’t exercise proper behavior at work which is the only context I know him. And now he's displaying weird behavior outside of work as well.

&amp;nbsp;

My instinct was to not insist I be let out of his car. I felt as if this would escalate the situation into something bad, and in hindsight it may have been the right thing to do when I think about the type of person he turned out to be.

&amp;nbsp;

I told him we could hang out at the park near my house if he wanted to talk. He seemed to like that idea, and we parked and walked over. The pleasant conversations resumed. Besides the weird clinginess, he was perfectly fine to talk to… until he DUMPED his entire life story on me, including his prior arrest for theft, his heroin addiction, and related struggles with depression. I tried to be sympathetic, but I was very put off by this. It was a lot of highly personal information all at once, and I was still on alert because of his prior behavior. I tried changing the subject by showing him pics of my dog. I scrolled one pic too far and the next one was a photo of me wearing makeup and posing cutely (way different than the slob I was at work, haha). He grabbed the phone and went “wow, you are very photogenic”. I felt awkward, and didn’t say anything. There was a long silence, then he launched into a weird tangent about how compatible we are, and that we have similar interests etc etc and that he wishes I wasn’t moving so we could try hanging out again, but on a date. I didn’t say anything, and he broke the silence with “Sorry I’m saying all of this stuff, I’m actually high right now. That’s why I know where Riverside (bad neighborhood that had previously come up in conversation) is, I went there yesterday [to buy]. Otherwise I wouldn’t have said it. I’m really sorry.”

&amp;nbsp;

Internally, I freaked out. He had definitely put his drug addiction in the past tense, and I assumed it was something he was recovering from, not currently using. I also realized I had been in a car he was operating, while he was under the influence. I don’t know anything about heroin, so I was clueless. I felt very, very stupid. 

&amp;nbsp;

He immediately started whining and begging me to not judge him or hate him, and kept saying over and over again how nice I am and how understanding I am, that I’m pretty and smart, all of these weird compliments interspersed with talking down about himself. I didn’t know what to do, so I smiled reassuringly and told him not to worry, but that I was tired and wanted to go home. That’s when he started CRYING. He had this weird, wheezy sob, but no tears were coming out. I sat there silently while he did this, trying to come up with some sort of graceful escape plan. My patience was wearing thin, and my anxiety was through the roof. It’s a weird feeling to be annoyed and panicky at the same time. I stood up and apologized, said the park was close to my house so I’ll walk, and started to leave when I remembered I left my stuff in his car.

&amp;nbsp;

Trying a new approach, I casually mentioned I forgot my stuff in his car, and joked that if he wanted my dirty lunch containers he could keep them. He ceased his bizarre crying, stood up and ran over to his car to unlock it, and I grabbed my stuff out of his backseat. His demeanor changed drastically as he calmly apologized for making things weird, and asked if he could drop me off at home so I didn’t have to walk alone at night. I said yes, but made him drop me off a block over from my little side street so he wouldn’t see which house was mine.

&amp;nbsp;

I could end it there, but what bothered me the most about this guy happened after this encounter. I’ll make this part short.

&amp;nbsp;

A week or two after that weird evening, end of August by this point, I had my last day at the job and moved 1000 miles across the country. Warner would sometimes text me long ramblings detailing his feelings about himself and about our missed opportunity. I didn’t respond to these messages. Now that I wasn’t near him, I didn’t feel the need to placate. The texts stopped after a few weeks, and I forgot about him.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to February and I get a text from a former co-worker. Her message said “Sorry you had to hear about it this way…” and her next msg was a link to a local news article titled “Man dies from wounds in Riverside stabbing Wednesday”. Because of the way she worded it, I thought Warner was the victim but when I read the article, it included his mugshot and the charges. He was the attacker. He murdered someone. I felt so shocked and disgusted. I couldn’t believe I knew someone who killed another human.

&amp;nbsp;

Later on, I called an old work friend for some details. Apparently, shortly after I left the job, he was fired for trashing the men’s bathroom. Like, just threw around anything he could lift and poured all the soap out and smeared it all over the place. He then lost his apartment (presumably -- some of the articles about the stabbing describe Warner as “homeless man”). I have to assume that’s how he ended up in the aforementioned Riverside, there are a lot of homeless drug addicts who squat in abandoned houses.

&amp;nbsp;

I wondered if the man he stabbed had refused to give him something that he wanted, and that is how he reacted to a hard “NO”. I don’t think I made all of the wisest decisions during my interactions with Warner, but I’m glad I was able to avoid setting him off, since he was clearly not stable. Hands down the worst intern I've ever encountered."

A Fortune 500 Company. Multiple covers on Times magazine. A spate of chat show appearances. You're one of the most successful and well recognised businessmen in the country. And all that before you've turned 40. 

Yet you never forgot your roots. Coming from a poor single-parent family, you know it took a lot of graft, and even more luck, to get to where you are today. And you don't want to be one of those businessmen who pull up the ladder behind you. Instead, you've decided to run an outreach programme, allowing one lucky young man from a similar background to you to experience a few months alongside you. You'll allow them to experience the world of big business, giving them an internship in one of your companies, as well as personally giving them lessons on the dos and don'ts of the professional world. And as an added bonus, you'll let them live in your multi-million dollar mansion!

But regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, there's a deeper reasoning behind your decision. Years of toil on your businesses has resulted in you neglecting your social life. You haven't had a stable relationship with a woman in years, let alone brought any children into the world. And sitting at night in your empty mansion, you feel overwhelmingly alone. You could get almost any woman in the world, of course, but most of them are just after your money, not after you. What you want is protégé, a companion, someone who cares about *who* you are, not *what* you have. And that's the real reason behind this programme. 

I'm your average 18 year old guy. I play video games, I go out with my friends, I refuse to clean my room. When I left High School, I thought the world would open up for me. But after rejection after rejection, I could see my future closing up. When I applied to your programme, it was one last throw of the dice, one futile hope at a future beyond blue-collar boredom. And to my surprise, my amazement, I actually got in!

However, when you finally meet me, seeing my surprisingly big eyes, lithe body and firm ass, you start getting different ideas, taboo ideas, ideas which you desperately try to suppress but fail to. In this young man you don't see a man, you see a woman, you see a daughter, you see a lover. And using your influence, you're going to try you best to bring this woman out into the open.

Hi there! As the prompt suggests, I'm looking for a feminisation prompt based around a CEO turning me into their slutty new daughter. I will play a young man (18+) who has won the opportunity to be your intern for the summer. You will play a CEO, either male or female (but preferably the former), who takes me on as an intern, but increasingly views me as a substitute slutty daughter. 

I would like this prompt to focus on our thoughts, feeling and emotions. For me, I want to be torn between my male identity, and the desire to be a wanted, loved and desired daughter. For you, you will struggle between wanting to give this young man a constructive and educative summer, and wanting to cave into your more carnal desires by turning him into your new slutty daughter. Of course the sex will come, but I'd also like there to be lots of character development and sexual tension. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates). In your response, I'd like you to include a little bit about your character, your kinks, and how you imagine this RP developing. I usually leave prompts up a little while before replying, so don't feel the need to rush your response. I'll try and reply to everyone, but one line messages probably won't get a response."

For the past 6 months as a minimum my sleep schedule has been pretty much normal for anyone my age, wake up at ~2pm and go to bed at 6 am or something along the lines.

My degree requires me to do an internship for 14 weeks, and that requires getting up at around 8 am. I read into segmented sleep, but it seems like thats always a case of going to bed at normal times, wakin up during the night, staying up for an hour or two, and getting back to bed to have the 7-8 recommended hours.

In the time period of these last 6 months, ive found that i enjoy the ""night life"", a few times when ive had to take breaks and get up at normal people times (for a few days at a time) i have no energy for most of the day, and, sure, it might be due to switching sleep schedules quickly, and lacking sleep, but i doubt it, as I don't really feel weak or anything, just ""meh"" to do anything

Go to bed at 4 am, wake up at 8 am, get ready for work, get to work, come back at 5pm, random shit for like, an hour, sleep till 10 pm, and stay up till 4 am, and repeat.

Is there a name for such a sleep schedule, is it the same segmented sleep just with very odd segments?

Thanks in advance :)"

I have to reach 100 hours of interning in order to pass. This class is a requirement for me to graduate.  My stomach feels bloated. I go to bed and wake up with anxiety. I have diarrhea in the morning that stops me from eating until past noon.

My internship is at a political campaign. I have until Nov 6 to get 100 hours. And I’m worried about making sure I hit that number. I have to take a 40 min bus ride everyday except Fridays to go the campaign office. I already planned out doing 30 hours of interning next week so I can have a good start.

I have to do canvassing, phone banking, and other interactions with people. My body doesn’t agree with my mind. I say to myself “don’t worry about it” or “no big deal”. But anxiety runs through me. My armpits sweat big time, my voice trembles. I’m a nervous wreck. I just started taking buspar on Monday. 

I just hope I can pull myself through no matter how hard my body gives it to me. I can never do something I’m not not familiar with without being anxious. I can’t be a nervous wreck in the political field. Maybe I’m overthinking this and that a couple of days of learning the ropes, I’ll get used to it. But my body is always gonna give me that worry I can feel in the background.

It’s like once I start having compulsive thinking, it activates it. 

How can I not worry about reaching 100 hours? If I fail, I won’t be able to graduate. 

This is gonna be one of the toughest challenges for me to face. "
9hxzb5,2,2018-09-22,[21] [A4A] [Kik] [Serious] [NSFW] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,FurryKikPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/FurryKikPals/comments/9hxzb5/21_a4a_kik_serious_nsfw_literate_m_x_m_fandom/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible.

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

I'm a computer science senior, and this past year I interned at one of the largest tech companies. It was truly an awesome experience and I got a really good full time return offer for after college, but I felt pretty home sick as I was across the country for the duration (3 months) of the internship.

I'm now considering some options closer to home, but of course I live in the midwest where there's not a whole lot of a tech scene. I just don't know what I should do. I know having this company on my resume would do some really good things for the future, and the offer itself is very nice, but I also love my friends and family here, as well as just my city in general and I've lived here my whole life.

What do you guys think?"

They are essentially just characters that would need to be built into scenes. I tend to skew more submissive so please keep that in mind. I have very few limits, most importantly all scenes are **18+** (kinklist below) I like to keep things realistic and i love to have long build ups to build sexual tension or to help develop the characters' personalities further. I like it when things end up a bit rough, kinky and nasty. Use subject line Sub in your reply so I know you read this. I am open to other ideas and encourage you to share them. Please discuss your thoughts on whatever scene (or scenes) you like best in your initial message.

Lastly, and most importantly my preference is to play on KIK messenger.

Kinklist: http://i.imgur.com/oAWR8tN.png

**Festival** We're at a summer music festival, (the type of music is negotiable) but what should be the case is that i'm a bit of a novice at festivals and i'm not a hardcore fan of any of the bands and I'm just here to have fun. We both are going with a large group of friends and friends of friends. I'm here with my boyfriend who is really into some of the more obscure and underground bands while everyone else is interested in the big acts. I want you to play a bit of an alpha male who is part of the friend group who has his eyes set on me. You get to show me the ropes of how partying at a festival works.

**Hiking** An experienced hiker, grew up camping with her family and doing long treks. Now out of University for a few years has a boyfriend who she wants to share this interest with. He's not the most outdoorsy though. He won't be having a great time, but it will be a group hike so there might be some other men to catch her interest. (the guide, brother (who brought his new miserable wife, another hiker, a bushman?) all possibilities.

**Conservative** I am a small town midwestern girl, I've grown up in a well off republican family. The night Trump won we celebrated like it was the best night of our lives. I've lived my entire life in this rich conservative bubble. I went to a rich college and graduated, although continued to live a fairly sheltered life. Now that I'm graduated I'm traveling outside that bubble and I'm in for a reality check. (this one is open to interpretation and I'd like to discuss it more fully)

**Walk of Shame** I'm about to start my sophomore year of college. I moved into a big old house with 4 other girls in the student ghetto of our medium sized college town. It's still the summer but most of us stayed to have a fun summer before school starts again in September. You are our neighbour. You live there with your wife and young daughter. You're in your mid to late 30s, you've been a good neighbour and have never complained if we make too much noise. We did host one party a few weeks back and it got noisy but you appreciated that my roommate stacey warned you about the noise beforehand and we chipped in and bought you and your wife a bottle of wine. We've become friendly over the last little while and always wave when we see each other. In addition to watching us sunbathe you also get excited for every Saturday and Sunday morning when at least one of us is returning from our night out usually looking a little worse for wear. More often then not it's me doing the walk of shame.

**Vacation** Rose is in her senior year of college, her parents said that they wouldn't pay for her to go on a spring break trip with her friends but they would pay if she went with them and her younger brother. She was so annoyed but reluctantly agreed as long as she got her own room and they left her alone for the most part. She just finished an internship as part of her degree with a law firm, it's her hope that upon graduation she'll end up with a job there as she completes her law degree. For now she's not going to worry about work and school she's in the caribbean and she's going to relax by the pool, read a book and get her tan on. Her younger brother and parents tried to convince her to go on a hike but she had no interest. While lounging by the pool she is approached by a much older man, it took her a couple seconds but she realizes that it's one of the senior partners at the law firm.

**Son's Friend** My son has just finished his first year of college. Things have been going well for him and he fits in a bit more at college then he did in high school. He was paired with you as a roommate and now you are both moving into a house together off campus with a few other friends. He seems to have a bit more confidence and has started working out and even has a girlfriend, all of this I put down to your influence. You are an attractive young black man from out of state, you're at school on a scholarship. Because you have moved so far from home you've spent a few school breaks at my house so i've gotten to know you. My marriage has not been going well and my sex life has dried up a bit so i'm a bit sexually frustrated. Lately I've been fantasizing about you, and I'm getting more and more curious about being with a black man.

**Babysitter** A classic that's always fun. I'll play a young naive innocent babysitter (18+) and you will play the father of the kids. There are many options for this, we could do it that you're my neighbour down the street, I could be an ""au pair"", I could be asked to go on vacation with you or spend some time with your family at the cottage. Let's talk about this one if it interests you.

Additionally, i don't really have a scene in mind but i'm open to some raceplay scenes so feel free to propose those or any other scenes that you think I may be interested in. Hope to see those nice envelopes soon!

Some other setting ideas that I enjoy include: - school ski trip - Olympic Village - Holiday Party - Tropical Vacation - Wedding (cheating) - Family - snow day - fat or old guy

It is one of the four hundred thirty interstellar human governments in existence by 0 CY within the galaxy. Comprising 36,583 planets spread over 10,000 lightyears and hosting a population of 17.5 billion humans, the Empire is a relatively small interstellar polity in population but has high potential. Its’ capital is on the planet Alpha World, in the city of Benx City.
&gt; 
&gt; The Empire was founded in 3438 BC by the legendary First Emperor Arktus I on the Plains of Benx in eastern Benxland, succeeding the Shanthic Confederation which predates it by another four centuries, and embarked on a 1,500-year-long crusade to conquer the planet, complete by 1938 BC. It endured multiple environmental catastrophes and two world-spanning civil wars in which nuclear weapons were used to begin colonizing the Benxboro system in 1790 BC under Emperor Wráed (Brêd) I the Reunificator, discovering faster-than-light travel via the dark energy drive in 1688 BC. 
&gt; 
&gt; The early interstellar Empire was marred by a long civil war against the Frontier People’s Army in the interstellar colonies from 1180-1130 BC, after which the Second Golden Age began, only to end in 509 BC with the coup of Supreme Inquisitor Roxas Luxen, ending the long-ruling Arktus dynasty and starting the Luxen Period, which saw the Empire ruled as a theocracy by Luxen and his descendants. In 148 BC, Earl Rahis Blissen rebelled against the Luxens and overthrew them in 140 BC, beginning the modern Blissen dynasty. From 75 BC the Empire has been in constant conflict- first against the liberal Freethinkers and the Benxborian Republic from 75 BC, then against the alien Darsich from 59-9 BC, and the United Sykren Nations from 9 BC. These three conflicts incited cultural divisions in the Empire and caused economic and demographic collapses, the Darsich invasion especially. 
&gt; 
&gt; In 0 CY a new civil war, indirectly incited by the Vespalian Space Command, began as High Inquisitor Dester Bak challenged the authority of Emperor Desar XVI Blissen. Blissen was assassinated by Bak in the wake of the Vespalian invasion of Benxboro, took over most of the Empire and established it as a rival successor government with Imperial Major General Desar Messik. Blissen’s successor, Colonel Arktus Fech, allied with the VSC against Bak and the continuing threat of the USN. Under his leadership, the Empire has officially democratized for the first time in its’ history, establishing the Congress of All Planets and a new, more secular Imperial Constitution in 4 AC. It continues to be rocked by criminal syndicate violence, social liberalization, demographic transition, and the perpetuation of the Imperial Civil War by the Benxborian Republic after the 18 AC fall of the last anti-Fech Imperial factions. The VSC’s parent government, the Vespalian Federation, claims the whole of the Empire as its’ own territory, designated the **Benxboro Special Administrative Region**. It is legally under military occupation. 
&gt; 
&gt; 

That stuff above is just here to remind you of what this boring world is. [But lest you forget, here it is in detail.](https://www.reddit.com/user/CfiIv_zfXcy_dgrj/comments/9hwimp/scifi_a_boring_world_where_the_concept_of/)

And these are my characters in it. Like the [original trilogy](https://www.reddit.com/user/CfiIv_zfXcy_dgrj/comments/9e9k0u/introducing_the_futa_trilogy_or_quadrilogy/), they are endowed with penises as long as your arm! Well, mostly anyway. Two of the characters I've conceived at the time of writing this have genetic defects that render them appearing to some extent non-hermaphroditic. They comprise, like all hermaphrodites do irl, a minority of the human population. 

**The backstory**

* Anya 

Anya is the eldest daughter of the 95th Earl of Sherr, Dannus Sherr, and until recently lived a relatively comfortable life for most of her 22 years. That is, until the ~~suspiciously human demons~~ Vespalians invaded the Imperial capital and her family's home was burned down as collateral damage. 

Before that, her family had enough struggles of its' own. Her father returned home from imprisonment by the heretical Republic on the Bresha Penal Colony shortly before her birth and married her mother, Nali, before becoming a high-ranking logistics officer of the Imperial Army and helping to supply shells to the armies fighting the Darsich horde. After the war, he fell ill with a persistent, debilitating form of Darsich plague. Anya and her mother have since had to cooperate to raise most of her younger sisters. 

The House of Sherr took a leading role in fighting the demons as a whole, even donating their wealth to the Emperor to help fund the war, and for it was rewarded with demon-polluted lands and a lot of debts. To pay for them all, Anya has been engaged thrice to old rich noblemen, who rejected her because she was too young- even Benxborians don't like it when you whore out seven-year-old girls- and now works as a courtesan alongside her friends Masha and Junya, which she has been doing for the past four years. 

In reality, part of her lifestory as she's been told it is a lie made up to boost her father's reputation and protect her own. She is the granddaughter of the last Heretic president, Aln Trodar, and the daughter of his eldest child, Torya Trodar, Supreme Commander of the Republic Navy and warden of Bresha Penal Colony at the time of Anya's conception. Dannus pressed Nali to marry him so that the baby he escaped from Bresha with wouldn't be suspected of being illegitimate. 

But that's none of our business.

* [Misha](https://www.reddit.com/user/CfiIv_zfXcy_dgrj/comments/9k9t3o/introducing_misha_%CA%99%E1%B4%87%C9%B4x/)

Misha comes from far humbler origins. She is the daughter of war refugees, one of whom died protecting her pregnant mother as they fled their Outer Colony homeworld from the Darsich, 28 years before the Vespalian invasion. Growing up in the sprawling refugee settlements on Alpha World, she was raised as a girl by her mom and her paternal uncle/stepdad, owing to the appearance of her genitals, until Sole Church health inspectors found out that she had high levels of hormones only found in vyde within her blood, leading to her official reclassification as a hermaphrodite.  

She studied well in school but focused especially on medicine, wondering why she, unlike all the other vyde, didn't have a dick. And she had a lot of sex along the way, illicit birth control keeping her from becoming a teen mom. Her grades were high enough to qualify her for the Nichea Seminary and its' Department of Health Sciences; she gratefully took the invitation. 

Misha's stepfather, though, was drafted into the Imperial military during the final stages of the war with the Darsich as his niece entered the seminary, only to die fighting the Heretics. His death left his family at risk of being exploited by the outside world. Misha took up the responsibility of head of household and offered to work in deviant clinics and medical centers as a paid intern, eventually becoming inspectrix of a clinic which attends to vyde's health issues and sexual deviations (namely, to pedo vyde). Though her odds of getting a dick are long, she's not given up hope, and indeed with the Vespalian invasion and their advanced medical technology, there is a possibility that they can surgically construct girlcocks for anyone, for *free!* ^^^And ^^^they ^^^do

* Victoria

*Victoria* is, in Benxboro, an alternate spelling of the name of the Holy Saint Vectaria, patroness of warriors, especially those who are defending the Faith and their homes, and mothers. It is generally acknowledged to mean ""leader"". However, noone would take Victoria Bexar for a leader in anything. Like Misha's, her genes are an imperfect example of what the Darsich plagues have done to the human genome in Benxboro, only in her case she has a fully functional male-type reproductive system, but an incomplete female one. Her uterus empties into the cervix, which leads to...a blind pouch. Luckily for her, it doesn't menstruate, probably due to some hormonal deficiency, otherwise she'd end up needing to get it removed. Her family is a new arrival to the distant, mostly undeveloped and relatively safe Imperial colony world of Blakely and live in the suburbs of its' largest city and capital. 

Naturally, her parents raised her, in defiance of health inspectors' reports and recommendations, as a man named Dal.  From a young age she disliked this and proved to be a rebellious child, the oldest of her parents' three kids, though puberty brought a new apogee to her insurrection. They accused their ""son"" of taking hormones when her breasts grew in and tried to get her arrested by the police when she was fourteen; instead, a detective helped her escape to the city of Oslen, which was once Blakely's capital until the Empire abandoned it to the Republic in the wake of a Darsich onslaught decades ago and now thrives in a mountain valley far from Blakely City as a hub for Heretic activity on the planet. Surviving the rugged borderlands between Imperial and Republic territories, she took on her name in honor of her favorite musician, Anya's birth mother Torya Trodar, the ""Lost Princess"", and vowed to carve out a new life for herself in the big, chaotic, dusty world of Oslen. 

She has mostly succeeded as her eighteenth birthday draws near. Victoria, or just Torya, works as a janitor in the apartment complex of a former elite Republic Army sniper and her current landlord, Mat Honras, when she's not in the kitchen of a bar also owned by her landlord. But that ache in her stomach isn't hunger or uterine cancer. It's the desire to become a better mother than hers was. And it's getting stronger. 

**The sex stuff**

* Anya

Anya is, as a courtesan, more at home with sex than she might otherwise be. Yet there are some deficiencies in her embrace of her sexuality. For one, she divorces it almost completely from the relationships it might otherwise help form, preferring to maintain only as much warmth as is required to ease her customers into getting off; she is a fastidious purifier of anything sullied by sex; and she doesn't spend any time sleeping with whom she'd rather be with, which is other vyde and women. Instead she blows old veterans for their money. As a result, her personality outside of her job is that of a virginal, somewhat introverted neophyte to romance, and one who is sexually submissive to boot due to her upbringing that emphasized more focus on enhancing her feminine appeal. However, this ""other"" Anya still retains the extensive knowledge expected of a sex worker of how to make people cum and harbors a nearly inexhaustible libido, one which often requires force of will to be brought to heel.  

* Misha

Misha is, here in her original milieu, a vyda-obsessed gynephile who almost exclusively sleeps with other vyde. She measures her partners' pricks in various states of arousal and rates them before carefully, almost scientifically, sucking them off in most encounters before proceeding into a wild romp. While she does have the ferocious sexual appetite of most Benxborian vyde, this is countered by her force of will, honed and sharpened by her learnings in the Imperial seminaries, and shaped by her desire to get a penis to more fully enjoy that appetite lest she end up being mastered on the streets. And of course, as a sizequeen, she will mock and demean those who fall below her high standards of being at least 8 inches in length.  

* Torya

Victoria is, unlike her namesake and the other vyde here, entirely bereft of sexual experience. The struggle to establish herself in Oslen and keep her apartment left her with little time for anything like that, despite her body's mounting demands for sex. She instead makes do with fapping to the frequently sold (and pirated) Oslen amateur pornography industry's wares and has even bought a few sex toys to help in that. An abiding fantasy of hers is acquiring a vagina and being impregnated. But she doesn't have one^^^YET, so she's made do with turning her ass into a buttpussy. She has little in the way of a clear preference for sexual partners and is somewhat submissive, but also largely vanilla when it comes to her fetishes.

9i0aih,1,2018-09-22,Auditing internship before taking an Auditing class?,holymanrocket,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9i0aih/auditing_internship_before_taking_an_auditing/,"My quick background is:
-graduated in 2015 with a Marketing degree
-worked as a Data Analyst for 2 years at a respected global company
-left that job and I’ve owned two businesses in the time since 

I realized that I love accounting so I’m going back to school to pursue a Masters of Accounting. I need to take 8 undergrad classes (4 this semester, 4 next semester) before I can officially apply to the Master’s program. 

Yesterday was my schools career fair and I met with a bunch of accounting firms, ranging from smaller firms to the Big 4. Everyone I met was super impressed with my diverse resume compared to my undergrad peers. Now it’s time to start applying for internships. 

My dilemma is that I know that I would prefer an Audit internship over Tax, but I haven’t taken an auditing class yet. 

My question is, will this hinder my chances in interviews? "
9i0bsy,0,2018-09-22,Career Help/Just Got Accepted Into Navy,career_help_9823,newtothenavy,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/9i0bsy/career_helpjust_got_accepted_into_navy/,"I am 26. I am looking to get position in IT/Accounting like supply chain, IT Auditor, audit analyst or maybe software engineer. I am working on that CPA I am going to be doing GA Tech Online Masters Computer Science starting January 2019. I am applying to positions at my most recent internship employer. I currently work as a full time school bus driver and I screwed up and bottomed out the bus.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten like 6-7 phone / hirevue interviews since June. I'm trying to get video interviews set up because a lot of the opportunities are away from where I am. I haven't made any substantial progress on the interview processes. I've been applying like crazy. I have like 400 ""thank you for applying emails"". I went to my schools engineering and business career fair (two different ones) trying to find a new position.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to be a Navy Supply Officer (because I really needed a job) and got accepted but I'm not sure if I'm going to do it. I really wanted to do it at one point but over time I've been challenging myself. I would rather try to find a job and try to get into law enforcement like local, state, or federal. I don't want to become a Navy Officer just to bridge the gap towards what I really want. If i'm going to do something with intense training, I want it to be something that I really want. I do need some more experience to apply to law enforcement.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

. Any advice on what I should do?

9i10hm,2,2018-09-22,$1500 Graduate Architecture Student Build help,gawag,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/9i10hm/1500_graduate_architecture_student_build_help/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Lots of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well as 3d modeling in Sketchup and Rhino and rendering in Vray or Lumion. I also do some light gaming, mostly platformers and Bethesda-style RPGs (although this might be just due to the limitations of my old laptop). If it's relevant, which I doubt it is from a hardware standpoint, there will also be a lot of document viewing and Magic Online.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* $1500. Would consider $2000, see below.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* At the earliest ASAP, at the latest before the end of 2018. 

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* I'll definitely need the tower and a keyboard. As for the OS, I believe I can get that from my University but I'll need to look into that more. Beyond that, my intention is to have my computer in studio, so I'll need a lock. Furthermore I'd like to have some sort of tablet or netbook that I could use for taking notes in class, or if I need to write a paper or something at home. I'm not sure if that's something that would technically be included in the build, so that's why I had the price set at 1500, so I could find that on my own. On the other hand, maybe it serves as the secondary monitor somehow? With the netbook/tablet included, or if you convince me I don't need it, the full budget is $2000. Willing to hear your ideas on this end.

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* Cincinnati, OH, USA. There's a Microcenter in the area as well as an Amazon pickup store.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* The only thing I really have is a mouse (Razer Naga). I technically have an old shitty monitor by Acer that I could use as a secondary for the time being, if a proper secondary isn't within the budget.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I don't know anything about overclocking, so I don't have an answer.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* I'd expect to need a good amount of storage, but the only other particulars I could think of are detailed under the ""what should be included"" section.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I'd prefer something on the subtle end stylistically, but I could see the use for a window. Black or muted colors. Not really a fan of LED lighting. I will be keeping it in the studio during semesters when I have class, and at home when I'm doing internships, so I will need some degree of portability.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* I believe I will be able to get one from my University. 

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**"

9i2thv,1,2018-09-22,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance Roleplays,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9i2thv/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance_roleplays/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

9i4zwq,171,2018-09-22,I'm almost free...,MILhasnochill,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9i4zwq/im_almost_free/,"My hubs and I have been together for almost 15 years. I would like to think that when we first started dating MIL was ok with us dating, but thinking about it now I'm not so sure. This is gonna get long....things she's said and done over the last 15 years:


Little comments she made to my hubs while we were dating about how I ""like to show off the boobs"" (I can't help I have double D's).


The fact that she wouldn't let us be alone in his room (he lived in her home at the time) with the door closed...we were in our early 20's. 


Said all kinds of discouraging things when he moved in with me.


Asked to borrow money all the time, didn't pay us back and wouldn't let us borrow from her when we needed to.


When I offer to help with holiday dinner prep, she  gave me a tasks that separated me from everyone (ie: they would be in the kitchen, she would send me to the dinning room table to pick apart a chicken).


Didn't want to be involved with the wedding much after she found out I didn't want to get married at their church. Insisted on having the rehearsal there, got her church group to supply all the food and then set a place for my maid of honor after I told her I didn't have one which forced me to pick one so no one was embarrassed.


Convinced us to move into their house when her and FIL moved away for a few years. We still had to pay them rent and after a few months sent BIL back and forced us to house and feed him. Apparently, she thought $200 a month off the rent was sufficient enough to house and feed a 20 something, unemployed pothead (no issues with pot but he was smoking so much that if he went without for ONE DAY he would go through withdrawals). The only thing that made up for this was when I was in school full time and on my internship, we didn't have to pay rent for those three months. 


Never invites us out to dinner, only him. If he insists on me coming she won't pay...even if she agreed earlier.


A few years ago FIL had multiple strokes while she and BIL were in another state for a work thing for her job. My hubs took FIL to the ER and let her know. She refused to come home two days early even though her work thing was over.


Constantly uses familial obligation and guilt manipulation to get him to drive almost an hour to where they live to help with their yard or house.


The worst is when hubs began have severe nerve issues. It's been six years and we still have no definitive diagnosis. He's barely able to feel his feet, hands and as a result cannot work more than 15-20 hrs a week. FIL and MIL have: 


1. Accused him of faking or said it's psychosomatic.


2. Told him he was to blame for his condition because he doesn't eat and exercise the way she thinks he should (Dr told her to her face this is not the case..she still insists she's right about his diet).


3. Tells him she's gonna buy him all the food he NEEDS...he comes home with enough for 2 dinners and 2 snacks.


4. Threatened to track him down to test his blood pressure (FIL has a bp machine) and his blood sugar (they have a dog with diabetes). He has blood drawn on a monthly basis.


5. FIL has gone to hub's job to tell his boss that hubs is being lazy by not coming into work (Bosses are super bros and know FIL is insane).


6. FIL has shown up at our house banging on our door. Hubs had to call MIL and threaten to call the police if he didn't leave.


Hubs has slowly come out of the FOG and realized that his parents treatment of him isn't normal. I have been advocating to leave the state we live in for the last ten years. I am finally getting my wish!!!! Hubs and I had a talk and he basically said he didn't feel like he belonged here anymore...you don't have to tell me twice! I got a job in a state 10hrs away (new job has bomb ass health insurance and if all fails, legal medicinal marijuana y'all!) and we leave in 3 weeks. MIL knows (FIL is going to lose his mind so we're waiting until the last minute to tell him) and has told him she hopes he ""isn't making a mistake"" and accused him of taking advantage of his Grandfather (his cancer has resurfaced and hubs is gonna stay with him thru the new year to help and spend some time with him before moving so far away) and just been very negative and unhelpful. I don't know what's worse: my MIL's behavior or my own mother completely ignoring the situation lol. Either way, I have been VLC all involved and will continue to do so. Wish me luck! "

I finally feel ready to move on with my life, things are falling into place:  I quit caffeine, I'm about to graduate in December with my master's degree, I got my dream internship at a local company, I just got a tattoo, and I even started sleeping at night again.  I have everything lined up to start eating right and start exercising to lose weight (I'm obese and don't want to die of early health complications).  But the mess is just overwhelming.

9i658z,26,2018-09-23,Developer documentation? Videos? Educational materials? How does a dev learn the source code and get involved?,liquidify,btc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9i658z/developer_documentation_videos_educational/,"Back in 2012 when I first learned about bitcoin, it inspired me to get into code and step into a different world than I lived in.  Now I am almost finished with my graduate degree in computer science, I am still interested, but there are many barriers which are keeping me from becoming involved.

At several points during my learning process, I have wondered about dev notes and educational materials relating to the source code.  Where are these? 

My thoughts are that if bitcoin cash or whatever serious attempt at a crypto currency that comes up wants to be for real and be a serious player in the world, they must provide deep and excellent educational materials to the masses.  Claiming that the code is all that is needed to understand things is not enough.  People who are not capable of grokking the entirety of the code form the source alone are still valuable, both as coders and as sources of ideas.  The more people who are capable of understanding either portions or the whole of the code base means the more eyes that may be capable of finding bugs like the recent one.  

So where are these educational programs which detail the architecture and help people though the massive source that BTC and BCH has become?

When I took my first internship, it was horrible because the documentation was difficult and incomplete, and they only let me touch the surface of the codebase.  But I found my way because I had good teachers.  

Education and resources are what we need as a community.  Not as a layer of bureaucracy that people can hide behind, but as a shining layer of clarity when people have questions.  If we want true success in the long run, understanding the source code should be as simple as understanding how to deal with a banker.  Every aspect should be taught clearly by someone who speaks as plainly as your reflection in the mirror.  That means that it should be taught in many languages, and from many perspectives.  Code  architecture is something that can be learned in many different ways, which all lead to the same fundamental understanding.  

They should exist, and we as a community should consider these materials as important as the code itself.  They are the key to mass adoption of not just the currency, but the mass security that comes from a million understanding eyes."

9i6kvy,4,2018-09-23,Cautiously Entering Job Market-Need Advice,Oddtimes39,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/9i6kvy/cautiously_entering_job_marketneed_advice/,"Hi, All. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I feel it's necessary to provide all of the details.  I'm in the final year of my PhD program in a practicing field, which means I am currently on internship (residency). My internship had a late start date compared to many other positions, which means it is also ending later (very late August 2019). Unfortunately, this means my degree won't confer until December 2019. I knew this could cause some problems when applying to post-docs, but I saw that many positions are willing to accept a letter from the Dept. Head stating that all of one's degree requirements will have been met by the post-doc start date. However, I am now learning that many places do this with the understanding that the degree will be conferred soon after, as in a month or two later, at most. Further complicating this is the fact that many post doc positions start just before my internship ends.
 
I am allowed to miss no more than ten days during internship. This includes days for interviewing, or days I want to save so that I'll have time to relocate if a position starts right at the time or before my internship is ending. I want to get my ""practitioners"" license after I graduate, which I had hoped to do during a post doc, but I'm unable to start earning hours until December 2019. Getting licensed requires one to work full-time (2000 hours) under supervision for one year or part-time for two years.
 
I have always intended to go into academia, preferably in smaller, teaching-focused college, but I want the option to practice on the side. I also think that being licensed will benefit me if I end up applying to institutions that have master's level practitioner programs because I will then be qualified to provide required supervision to students. Currently, I have not published, but I have a number of manuscripts in the works that I think will eventually get accepted. I have done 8-10 conference presentations. I have quite a bit of ""service"" on my CV. I have taught three undergrad courses, have taken classes outside of my major that are related to curriculum and teaching, and have a certification for an online teaching platform. As it is, these are the options I am weighing:

Apply to one-year visiting and lecture-type positions, work for 9 months and apply to post docs for the following year (2020) while do so. This would also give me time to publish. Then I would apply to tenure-track jobs after the post-doc. So, I'd really be drawing things out this way.

Apply to tenure-track positions and worry about licensure once I'm settled. This would mean that eventually I will have to work an additional 16 hours a week for two years on top of full-time professor work.

Apply to two-year visiting and lecture-type positions, hopefully publish and work part-time (16 hours a week) toward licensure while working as a full-time lecturer.

Enter the practicing job market in December as an informal post doc, work for a year earning my license, publish, and then apply to tenure-track positions. I worry that just working and not doing an actual post doc will make me less competitive for academia, almost like I took a year off or something.

What is the best option here? Again, keep in mind that I get 10 days off this year. I have to be judicious in choosing where to apply because I can't go to a ton of interviews. Realistically, I think I can use five days to interview, the other five I have to save so I can get the last week of August off to transfer to a new location (if that's the route I take). Most academic jobs start the last week of August. I don't want to apply to a bunch of jobs and then not be able to accept the interviews.
Additional questions:

Would it be wrong to teach somewhere for only a year if they are offering a three-year renewable contract?
Should I apply to one or two jobs at a time, so I don't get more interviews than I can attend?
Is it ever appropriate to request a Skype interview for an academic job?


Thank you so much if you read all of this!! Most of the people in my life have no frame of reference to offer good advice on this stuff, so thank you in advance.

9i7a9x,1,2018-09-23,I'm [21F] getting sick of my boyfriend [21M],evertolevel999,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9i7a9x/im_21f_getting_sick_of_my_boyfriend_21m/," 

My  boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, we meet in an  international school and bonded over overwatch, we spend hours talking  outside (with him doing most of the talking) and just recently we  started a 12 month internship abroad together.

At  the end of August this year we both arrived in the US for an internship  in the same hotel, we share a 2 bedroom apartment together with a 3rd  roommate, and I just don't know if I'm being too sensitive about things  or not, because I know that I also have some attitude issues when it  comes to him. 

He  often goes out without telling me where he's going or when he's coming  back and when he does return and I ask he tells me he went out to  drink/eat with some locals he met (would be nice to be asked if I wanted to go). 

He  always complains about our 3rd roommate and me not cleaning up after  ourselves, but he is arguably the messiest one out of all of us, leaving  beer bottles everywhere, not wiping the stove, leaving his clothing all  over the floor, falling asleep with food on the bed, leaving crumbs all over the floor without picking them up........

Our  first week here I proposed that we all put aside some grocery money,  that way we would always have a stocked fridge, he agreed to it, we  bought 10 pieces of meat and some veggies, paid 1/2 each and he told me  he would have some dinner waiting for me when I come back from work. I  came back to a pan of cold, dried up onions, red peppers and a few  pieces of meat. I admit, I was very grumpy that night, because I felt  like he could have at least put a lid on there or something, I felt like I was given leftovers.

We  had to shop again the next day, again paid 1/2 each, came back home to  find 8 out of 10 pieces gone, I told him that I wasn't going to pay 1/2  of the groceries anymore because he eats like a bear and I don't feel  it's fair, he got grumpy after that but agreed.

I later on  started a twitch stream for fun, he came home, I told him I was  streaming in the living room and if he could go to our bedroom, he said  ""\*\*\*\* no, I'm going to make myself dinner"", I told him okay, moved  everything to the bedroom and he tells me in that condescending tone of  his ""you do know that I'm going to go there in 15 minutes, right"", so I  wait for him to make dinner and then move back to the living room when  he's done. He comes out 5 minutes later, with his bluetooth speakers,  puts on music and sits behind my computer blasting it, eating his  dinner. I ask him if he can turn it down and he tells me no. So I just  continue the stream, somehow we got it to work, the viewers didn't mind  so I didn't mind, but then he stared spamming his soundboard with ""edgy""  ""dark humor"" meme lines at top volume and I just told him to \*\*\*\* off  with that, again he got offended and left the apartment. He came back  later apologising that he's had a bad day at work, yada yada, I understand that he is irritated from work, I get irritated at work when it doesn't go well, but I don't start annoying him on purpose because of that.

His shifts start in the morning so he has to wake up at 8AM every day. We only have 1 car so  I have to wake up at 8AM even though I start work at 4PM. Since I like  to play  games and catch up with my sister, who is 9 hours ahead of US  time, I often use the computer after he wants to go sleep, I have  headphones on, I lower my brightness to its lowest setting and yet it  was still too bright for him (facing the wall, with his eyes closed), he  told me if I wanted to play I should do it in the living room, which I  did for some time.

But twice now I've come home to find him asleep with all the lights in the house on, that didn't seem to be  too bright for him.....and it just pisses me off that he sends me out  of the room claiming it's too bright while he pulls shit like that. So I  moved my laptop back into the room one evening and watched Bojack,  he asked me to turn down the brightness, I did, he told me it was still  too bright and if I could go out, I told him I can't keep moving it  around every time he says it. So he grabbed his mattress and dragged it  out to the living room, it felt like I'm dealing with a toddler and I'm  embarrassed because our roommate sees him behaving like this. 

He  owns a pair of wireless headphones which he always has on, but for some  reason he keeps blaring music (that only he listens to) on his iPad in the morning or in the evening when he's getting ready for bed. 

I  came back from work today, undressed to get into the shower when he  started to talk to me about some politician from his country that  they're trying to impeach, I talked with him because it's the first real  convo we've had in almost a week. After he was done  I went to take my shower with music playing on my phone, after 2 songs I  got out and started dressing when I get a phone call from him, I  cancelled it and went out, he's lying on the bed asking me to move my  laptop again, I did, went to the living room with my music still playing  and he asks me to turn it down, which I was planning on doing anyway.  I'm just amazed that he couldn't move 2 steps to knock on the door and  ask to turn down the music or wait it out (LIKE I HAVE TO EVERY TIME HE  GOES TO SHOWER OR COOK OR DO ANYTHING).

TL:DR:  My bf and I started an internship abroad in the same hotel and we share  an apartment. I become highly irritable around him and can't tell if  I'm overreacting because so many little things are piling up to  bother me, or if the things he does are genuinely him just disregarding me.

We already had a talk about what makes us uncomfortable a year ago, and it got better after that, but now I feel like he's gone back to not caring and it makes me not care either. Should I try talking to him again? I was ready to take the next step in out relationship, I got pills and everything but I don't want to be a woman who lets her BF act however he wants and get away with it, but I also don't want to make things awkward at work. 

Any advice???"

And it pretty much is. Not to mention kinda weird and out of place since you are specifically sent to help out Y village so its expected that you already know your shit. So before going to the structure of the tutorial, some headcanon background lore.

ON HUNTERS

HUNTERS ARE VOLUNTEERS RECRUITED FROM THE RACES OF MINEGARDE. 

HUNTERS ARE HEADED AND GOVERNED BY THE HUNTER'S GUILD

HUNTER TRAINING, COLLOQUIALLY CALLED ""THE FORGE"" IS A 9 MONTH PERIOD OF BRUTAL PHYSICAL AND INTENSIVE MENTAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING. THIS TRAINING IS CONDUCTED IN MULTIPLE TRAINING CENTERS AROUND THE OLD WORLD. 

THE FORGE IS SEPARATED INTO 3 THREE MONTH PHASES, JOKINGLY CALLED ""TRIMESTERS"" BY HUNTERS AND STAFF.
&gt; THE 1ST PHASE IS CALLED ""FORGING"". BREAKING DOWN AND BUILDING UP THE RECRUITS. FURTHER SEPARATED INTO FIVE SEGMENTS, WHICH EACH SEGMENT TAKING TWO AND A HALF HOURS EVERYDAY, IN SUCCESSION.

&gt; &gt; HUNTER PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENT TRAINING. INTENSE PHYSICAL TRAINING TO BUILD UP THE RECRUITS' BODIES TO THEIR LIMITS. THE SEGMENT WITH THE MOST DROPOUTS AND EXPULSIONS.

&gt; &gt; BASIC SURVIVAL TRAINING. WHICH TRAINS THE RECRUITS TO BE ABLE TO LIVE OFF THE LAND WITH MINIMAL PRESET SUPPLIES. SECOND SEGMENT WITH THE MOST FAILURES.

&gt; &gt; BASIC RECONNAISANCE TRAINING. WHICH TRAINS THE RECRUITS TO BE ABLE TO SCOUT OUT THE AREA QUICKLY AND STEALTHILY. THIRD WITH THE MOST FAILURES

&gt; &gt; BASIC EQUIPMENT TRAINING. WHICH FAMILIARIZES RECRUITS WITH SLIGHTLY SCALED DOWN AND LIGHTER VERSIONS OF THE WEAPONS AND ARMOR THAT THEY WILL USE IN THE FUTURE, AS WELL AS THE PROPER USAGE, MAINTENANCE AND CARE OF EQUIPMENT.

&gt; &gt; BASIC GUILD TECHNICAL WRITING TRAINING. TEACHES THE RECRUITS HOW TO WRITE UP REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THE GUILD.

&gt; &gt; DURING THE LAST WEEK OF THE THIRD MONTH, THE RECRUITS ARE TESTED. THE TEST, CALLED ""THE HAMMER"", WILL TEST EVERYTHING THE RECRUITS HAVE LEARNED WITH SEVEN DAYS OF NO CLOTHING, NO FOOD, NO WATER, NO SUPPLIES, AND NO WEAPONS IN THE MIDDLE OF LARGE TRAINING GROUNDS CALLED ""ANVILS"" WHICH CONDITIONS AND TERRAIN ARE DETERMINED BY THE TRAINING CENTER'S LOCATION. RECRUITS ARE SEPARATED INTO TEAMS OF FOUR. TO PASS THE HAMMER, ALL TEAMS MUST SURVIVE THE WHOLE WEEK WITH NO CASUALTIES. ANYTHING LESS IS DEEMED FAILURE. RECRUITS THAT FAILED CAN ALWAYS RETRY AFTER THREE MONTHS, DEPENDING ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE GUILD.

&gt; AFTER PASSING THE HAMMER, THE RECRUITS ARE PUSHED INTO THE SECOND PHASE, THE 2ND TRIMESTER. CALLED ""QUENCHING"" WHICH INVOLVES TWO SEGMENTS.

&gt; &gt; ADMINISTERING OF THE HUNTER'S POTION. THIS PROCESS CAN TAKE A WEEK TO A MONTH. IT IS EXTREMELY EXCRUCIATING. PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY TAXING ON THE RECRUIT'S BODY.  IT WILL TRANSFORM THE RECRUITS BODIES. MAKING THEM TOUGHER, STRONGER, FASTER, AND MORE RESILIENT.

&gt; &gt; RE-FAMILIARIZATION AND SUSTAINMENT TRAINING. AS THE NAME SUGGEST, ONCE THE RECUITS HAVE BEEN DEEMED ABLE ENOUGH AFTER THE HUNTER'S POTION ADMINISTRATION, THE RECRUITS ARE TO BE RE-FAMILIARIZED WITH THEIR NEW BODIES AND CONTINUE WITH PHYSICAL, SURVIVAL, RECONNAISANCE, EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNICAL WRITING TRAINING.

&gt; &gt; A SECOND TEST AT THE LAST DAY OF THE SIXTH MONTH, CALLED ""THE BLOOD TRIAL"", WHICH WILL PIT A RECRUIT AGAINST A SMALL PREDATORY MONSTER, ARMED ONLY WITH A STANDARD ISSUE HUNTING KNIFE. TO PASS THE BLOOD TRIAL, THE HUNTER MUST KILL THE MONSTER WITH MINIMAL INJURIES TO HIM OR HER SELF. IF SEVERELY WOUNDED, THE RECRUIT IS FAILED AND VETERAN GUNNER HUNTERS WILL IMMEDIATELY DISPATCH THE MONSTER WHILE MEDICAL STAFF WILL EVACUATE AND CARE FOR THE RECRUIT. RECRUITS CAN RETRY AFTER THREE MONTHS, BUT ARE USUALLY DISCOURAGED FROM DOING SO IF INJURIES ARE TOO SEVERE.

&gt; UPON PASSING THE BLOOD TRIAL, THE RECRUITS ARE GIVEN A WEEK LONG BREAK BEFORE THE THIRD AND LAST PHASE, CALLED ""TEMPERING"", IS BEGUN. THERE ARE TWO PHASES.

&gt; &gt; ACTUAL EQUIPMENT TRAINING IS JUST THAT. RECRUITS ARE DRILLED INTO THE FUNDAMENTAL AND BASIC TECHNIQUES OF THE AVAILABLE WEAPON TYPES THAT THE HUNTER'S GUILD USES 8 HOURS EACH DAY. THE WEAPONS AND ARMOR ARE THE REAL DEAL. 

&gt; &gt; GUILD OUTPOST INTERNSHIP. WHICH FAMILIARIZES THE RECRUITS TO THE DAY TO DAY OPERATION OF VARIOUS SURROUNDING VILLAGES AND GUILD OUPOSTS IN A FIVE-DAY CYCLE. EACH DAY HAVING 3 HOURS OF MAINLY WRITING REPORTS, ORGANIZING DOCUMENTS, AND MAINTAINING VILLAGE AND GUILD OUTPOST FACILITIES.

&gt; &gt; ON THE LAST WEEK OF THE 9TH MONTH, THE FINAL TEST IS GIVEN. THE RECRUIT IS TO TAKE AN OFFICIAL QUEST FROM THE GUILD AS REQUESTED BY ONE OF THE NEARBY VILLAGES. HUNT A LARGE MONSTER. USUALLY AN ALPHA OF A PREDATORY PACK MONSTER SPECIES. AFTER COMPLETING THE QUEST, THE RECRUIT IS TO REPORT TO THE NEAREST GUILD OUTPOST AND GUILD MASTER TO SUBMIT A REPORT, BEFORE BEING REGISTERED AS A HUNTER OF THE GUILD.

Now that that wall of text is out of the way, the structure.

After creating our character, we're introduced to the proper gameplay of MH through a training montage. All of the instructions being voiced and a brief highlights bar always present on the upper left side of the screen.

The first part of the Forging phase teaches basic movement controls, gathering and combining, map traversal and tracking, item usage, and the menu and its options and settings. The second part is a short testing culmination of the above mechanics ending with instructing the player to end the test the same way we abandon a quest.

The Quenching phase is mainly a lore exposition. Going into detail and showing how the world works. With the end being a kill quest in an arena with the objective of killing a buffed small bird wyvern using the hunting knife.

The first part of the Tempering phase puts the player in a training room like in World. Letting them pick and test out the weapon types and equipping armor and giving them a run down on how skills work, after which the game alerts them that they can finish training by exiting via the exit gate or through the menu screen. The second part is a short introduction to the mechanics of choosing quests and setting up rooms and joining quests in the gathering hall for multiplayer.

Then the last part of the Tempering phase and of the entire tutorial is an urgent quest. In classic MH fashion, hunt a large bird wyvern within 50 minutes. Failure conditions are time running out and getting knocked unconscious three times.

This is targetted more towards new players. Anyone that wants to skip can just choose the ""NO"" option of ""Are you new to MH"" at the end of every character creation screen in every MH game IIRC (which does practically nothing unfortunately). Dropping you straight into the village with an urgent quest already available."

Sorry this might be long, I want to explain the situation well as the problem is financial on the surface but is also related to underlying communication issues. My fiance (let's call him Andrew) and I have been engaged about 1 year and together for a total of 3 years. We are planning to actually get married in two more years after a long engagement. 

I graduated college and have a well-paying job as a programmer. Prior to that, I worked full time between semesters and some part time during the semester in engineering internships and some service industry jobs. I spent money earned from these jobs on tuition, housing, a small personal savings account, and most of my bills. My parents and scholarships helped pay for my phone bill and some of my tuition, but I have several thousand dollars of college debt still. 

Andrew on the other hand is still in college finishing his fifth year and has very little work experience - he worked part time at a small grocery chain for two months two years ago, then last summer worked a full time consulting internship. He spent all money earned from this on a new, multi-thousand dollar gaming PC as he has a trust fund and wealthy grandparents that have agreed to pay for all of his out-of-state tuition, car, bills, etc.

Andrew very much enjoys showing this and the things his family buys him off to people. When friends come over he takes them on a tour of the house to show them how much bigger our duplex is than the dorms they stay in, the huge tricked out computer, all his 'fancy' kitchen appliances, the expensive bass guitar, amps, electronic drum kit, speakers, his booze cabinet, and so on. It feels a bit embarrassing to watch, as guests ooh and aah over things that his parents bought for him.

Despite this, Andrew is exhaustingly petty regarding money in private. For example, when we go on dates and split the check, on rare occasions the waiter will accidentally split the bill 50/50 instead of what we each got; recently I bought something more expensive so he had to pay an extra $3.50 more that he would have otherwise. He started to get upset and wanted to make the waiter come back to redo it. I told him it wasn't a big deal and gave him a $5 later that night so he wouldn't make a scene. That placated him. 

Another example is for our anniversary. I took him out for a nice dinner (about $70 bill total in our region) and a nice wine tasting ($17) for him and bought him flowers ($5). He did absolutely nothing in return, couldn't even make something or get a simple card.

A final example is that yesterday I was about to take a bottle of water (50 cents) that he got to stock up for the hurricane. We didn't end up needing it, so now we have several cases of water sitting out in the living room. I intended to take one so that I could take medication while we were out driving that night. He got angry when he saw me taking it and yelled that it was for emergencies. He pushed me away onto a chair and said that I couldn't have it because he bought it. All this over a 50 cent water bottle, after I had just paid for part of his concert ticket and gotten him dinner that same night.

He does have a past of getting very angry when anything doesn't go as planned. For example, when I broke my windshield wiper and asked if he would be available to give me a ride to work if it rained in the few days before I could get it fixed, he legitimately shouted at me that I was 'f***ing up his week' and stormed off. He apologized a few hours later and said it was because he was stressed, but it is typically rare for him to apologize for angry outbursts.

On several occasions while we have been getting intimate, he would stop in the middle and get angry that I didn't look into it enough, typically after he has refused to change positions or move so that I could be more comfortable. I typically try to make more sound and have careful control over my face so he doesn't feel this way. He storms off in the middle of it, I assume to finish himself off elsewhere, leaving me feeling humiliated and confused about what I did wrong. 

When I try to ask him about issues or his reactions, he becomes angry again and says that I'm trying to make him the 'bad guy'. Or sometimes he brushes it off and says that we will talk about it later, because he 'just doesn't want to'). It is incredibly frustrating to talk to him about this kind of thing because I feel nervous when he gets angry and hate having to get the anger twice. Each time it happens, I feel more resentful towards him but don't know how to resolve it. I find it harder to try to have those talks with him without getting angry myself.

If anyone has advice for how to approach him about finances (and honestly any issue that we will face in the future) I would appreciate it! I have been very careful about my words and timing to try and approach issues as a team, like using 'I feel __ when you do this, can we please work together to find a solution' rather than 'you suck for doing this, stop now', but he still gets defensive and angry and verbalizes that I'm trying to make him look bad (even though we are the only people around when we have these talks). So any other communication tips would be really great, thanks in advance!


TL;DR - I need advice on dealing with finances and general communication issues before my fiance and I get married."

I somehow managed to do it. And I've absolutely hated it here. Nonetheless, I worked really hard to get internships so I could have a good resume for once I graduated.
I did everyone you're ""supposed"" to do in high school and college. Now I'm a senior in college, already signed away for a job paying more than I ever imagined once I graduate, and I still feel like shit.

I don't know anyone. Everyone here is so rich and different from me or too busy. 

I ruined my one long term relationship in the process of trying to succeed here. I just feel like shit. All. The. Time.

I don't know how I'm going to finish this year, risking all that I worked for going down the shitter. How am I supposed to get my work done when I just feel like utter garbage all the time? Caffeine doesn't even help anymore

I struggle talking to people, I want a relationship but don't know if I am capable of feeling love. Let alone capable of figuring out how to talk to someone. I never learned how to socialize.

So, now I need to drag my depressed ass through this last year so I can move to a new city where I don't know anyone and try to find happiness again, with even fewer people to support me.

Fuck this. I want out

I feel like organizing an AMA is difficult because you have to reach out and coordinate everything for every single AMA. Making it into a reoccurring event would only require initial effort setting it up, but after that it won't be much more work other than just starting a thread every time it's time for one.

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

*There is no place on the earth which is unseen by humans. Google maps a revolutionary technology proves that every part on the earth will be mapped and monitored using satellites. Today there are many organizations providing mapping services and all of these are centralized. They have control over the maps and location services. Today most of the applications require location details to function and to provide better services. And the centralized mapping service providers collect most amount of data from our personal devices and this is a serious concern.*

*The monopoly in the mapping service needs to end. And this can be achieved by decentralization of mapping data. The maps that we use today are less detailed and having low quality images. The quality can be improved by using drones. Drones fly over different heights and can provide more accurate and detailed maps of areas. Drones are capable to provide high quality still images, video and arterial maps. Thus the maps that can be derived from high quality drone contents are more detailed and useful. So that the drone operators can contribute in the creation of decentralized mapping service by providing the contents captured using their drones. They also can monetize the maps they provided and intern they will earn from it.*"

So as my title states I am currently in the market for a new pack to lug around all my shit everyday. I currently use a L.L. Bean Continental Rucksack which I really do like, it's just a bit too large and bulky for EDC. Therefore, I want a new pack that's smaller, easier to carry around, has a professional but rugged look (examples below), and has some method of internal organization. Here is a list I've thrown together of my everyday items that the new pack would need to hold.

* Nalgene 1L Wide Mouth

* A modestly-sized textbook

* Novel

* B5 Notebook

* Couple of folders

* 13"" Laptop

* Self-storing rain jacket

* Graphing Calc.

* Misc items like lip balm, cell charger, pencil case, etc.

I want the pack to be just big enough to hold the above items and that's all.

In terms of looks I LOVE the way Fall River and Fjallraven packs look:

https://www.fjallraven.com/shop/fjallraven-rucksack-no21-medium-F24205-black/?sku=7392158903016

https://www.frostriver.com/itinerant-daypack/

Above are a couple examples. I may be getting an internship that would be in a suit-and-tie environment this Summer, so I need the pack to look somewhat professional. Basically anything made out of waxed canvas and leather will be perfect.

I need this thing to last (thus /r/BIFL), so I am treating it like an investment. That said I am but a poor student, so my budget isn't crazy. Anything comfortably under $200 should be alright.

TLDR: Looking for a traditional looking pack to carry typical student crap that's not too big and won't shit the bed in a year. &lt;$200

Thanks!"

&amp;#x200B;

but I just don't see it.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep thinking about suicide but I don't want to leave a world behind, a world that may be a large pile of shit but where there are some people who genuinely like me for who I am and what I do.

&amp;#x200B;

but, just, I can't see any future for me. I'm applying to some program to help me fit the mold and find a job, hoping I can finally be in a stable situation and not have to squat places. but even then, none of the possibilities seem appealing. I also keep thinking that this will go nowhere in one way or another. I have gotten used to having my requests refused for no reason at all, so I wouldn't be surprised if that happened there, ie if I wasn't accepted into the program, or if I failed to find internships (which are part of the program) or to land a job afterwards. and even if I managed it, it'll be some shitty job like working for Big Data or modern web shit or shitty mobile apps made to make money.

&amp;#x200B;

but I don't see what else I can do at this point. I need money for transition related things, and fundraising isn't going to be an option. neither is my side project that is basically just dying as I can't get any motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see why I should continue with transition shito, but I guess the cost of stopping would be bigger, so... same shit. keep sailing, hoping to someday see light, even though I know I will never pass or be anything remotely girl. my life is a wasteland of dead dreams and unfulfilled fantasy.

&amp;#x200B;

how do I get out of this shithole though? I'm getting sick of depression, constantly breaking down and bursting into tears and basically draining my friends' energy with emotional blackhole shit.

9ichuo,3,2018-09-23,Diagnose my brother: severe mental illness,mattressmoney,DiagnoseMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/9ichuo/diagnose_my_brother_severe_mental_illness/,"My brother's experienced fairly consistent and severe mental illness over the years. He was diagnosed with ADD and anxiety at a young age, but seemed to have something far worse. As a kid, it didn't seem too bad, but it only ever got worse. Exposing himself to friends and family was a frequent occurrence. He graduated high school because my parents would practically do all of his homework, since he had so much difficulty focusing. He went from being able to converse with me and play video games to not being able to hold a normal conversation or do anything outside of messaging people on social media (which frequently included creeping on girls) and get killed constantly while playing video games because he was more focused on talking to people online who'd often make fun of him and remove him from their parties. Before his 20's though, it really wasn't the worst, as he was able to start attending community college (only really because my mom put him into it, and continued to do a lot of his homework). He was put back on another drug for ADD, and seemed to be doing alright though, and was even making friends as he'd done during previous times when he was actually being medicated. Keep in mind, though, that my sister, cousins and I always perceived him as degenerating over time, as this might be important for you to know. Everything began to change for the worse roughly when he was medicated with an SSRI for his anxiety roughly over a year ago.

Before starting the pill, he certainly had difficulty staying on task - including holding conversations - but it was nothing which prevented him from at least being decently functional and self-sufficient (homework aside). Interestingly, he began to seemingly study on all his own, reading his textbooks for hours and scribbling notes. He was never very intellectual, so I'm not sure if he were actually retaining anything. However, my sister and I began to notice strange ticks while he was on it, like that he'd stare off into space, and would practically enter a catatonic state during the night. He'd sometimes stick his arm up and stare at it, being unresponsive to our questioning his well being. He also regresses severely, socially, and begins to lose the ability to really hold any sort of meaningful conversation at this point. My sister and I tell my mother, but she ignores us and says that he must just keep taking the medicine. During a family event at my house, two of my cousins approach me privately and say that he's much worse than they remember, proving to me that my sister and I weren't delusional. 

Time goes by, and by around winter break, my mother finally decides to stop the treatment. Of course, this had nothing to do with the suggestions my sister and I had been making - our opinions about our own brother are never relevant, and when they're proven correct, she imagines that we'd never held them and that she were saying them, initially. However, against both common sense and of course the psychiatrist's actual orders to her, she immediately discontinues the treatment. The next time I see my family during spring break, I'm greeted by a pretty bizarre and grizzly sight. My brother is pale, thin and has been plucking out his eyebrows and hair. He paces around the house angrily speaking about people he'd known about during highschool, repeating stories about them doing outrageous things that didn't happen, or which were mind-numbingly trivial and yet held some sort of nearly religious importance to him and his own universe. None of this is directed to anyone, but he cycles through the stories constantly. I remember the first time he violently attacked me vividly. He'd mentioned that one of my close friends used to ""smoke crack in a weed pipe"". I laughed and said, ""him? No"". Then he stared at me for a second. Then he started yelling about how he did, and then went off to yell at me about random other stories about how some other kid would smoke cigerettes outside of the local gas station, and how I didn't even know this underage girl he was obsessed with. I don't respond at all, and then he almost hypes himself up to then attack me, throwing punches and trying to scratch and choke me. Fortunately I'm taller and stronger than him, so I put him into a headlock as he screams. Of course, this happens many times during that break, including one time when he attempted to attack my mother, so I had to keep him in a full Nelson while my father grabbed his feet. There was also a day when he'd get mad and start pacing down the street barefoot and yelling to himself, waving his arms around. This was prefaced by us visibly being worried that he'd unknowingly walked down to the street's bus stop talking to himself. 

I leave for school again, and I next see my brother when my mom brings him to help move my stuff out of school for the year. He doesn't seem to talk very loudly anymore, and was able to take orders and help with moving things. I'm not sure if this were a minor lull, or if the overwhelming anxiety of being at my college snapped some sense into him, but any sense of being lucid and coherent evaporated as soon as we got back home. By now, he seems severely shot. He'll talk to himself, but usually quietly. He'll get violent still, but the attacks are less viscous and energized. I've realized that it's not worth it for me to attempt to communicate to him, as anything I could say could trigger him, as he seems to hate me and or view me as a male competitor. The only time he seems to be able to communicate to me is if I give him an order and he follows it reluctantly or if I mention something that peeks his very narrow and bizarre interest - e.g. I mention a friend, and his eyebrows raise, causing a question, a response from me, and then a continued stream of consciousness from my brother. 

I go back to my college's city for an internship, and by now don't expect to see any improvement from my brother despite my mother's delusional texts saying how he'd improved and that he'll be cured anytime soon. I return for the end of summer and for vacation, and he really hasn't changed, as my sister had warned me. We go on vacation, and it's a nightmare. My parents would often walk far behind us, or at least ahead of our brother, but he'd be talking to himself with his arms in extremely rigid positions and with his hands down either the front or back of his pants. Often times his bare ass would be exposed. We'd have to hound our parents to watch after him. They'd act surprised every time and simply tell him to stop, as if he were healthy and were capable of making reasonable decisions. He also started to get violent again toward the end of the trip. We had to leave the hotel room, so I tried to pull his hands out of the front of his pants (it was very bad, as his pubic hair and groin were exposed but my parents didn't seem to care) and he shoved my head against a lamp behind me. Fortunately he didn't break the lamp, but he did bolt out of the room yelling to himself. On another night, he got mad at someone while I was in the bathroom, and tried to attack my mom, before trying to pull open the door my dad held shut, breaking the lock. Later, in the car on our return trip, he got mad that I asked what town he'd mentioned and grabbed my genitalia very, very strongly and pulled hard, seeming to try to rip them off. Once again, I was lucky to be stronger than him. I twisted his arm to inflict pain without causing any damage and get him to stop pulling - which he did - but he showed no signs of pain. He just kept blabbering and laughing to himself as I turned his wrist as far as I could into a very painful position. My parents berated him as if they could reason with him. He got mad from this and punched my face, and then tried to open the car door. Fortunately my parents were smart enough to accept that they had to child lock the door. I figured this sort of thing would happen, and chose to sit next to him so that my sister didn't have to. The strangest part, in my opinion, was my mother being surprised that I didn't beat my brother up, as if that were a rational course of action. She doesn't seem to conceptually grasp that my brother is not autonomous, and that these action aren't necessarily his fault.

Not much has seemed to change yet, though my mom always claims he's better or will improve. My sister said that he was slightly more lucid, but I'm assuming that's his brain's plasticity just at work, making minor adaptations. Currently, my sister has been getting upset because he continues to expose himself, and will make creepy remarks to her, like that he'd want her to drink his urine or to kill her. He's lost the ability to properly use utensils, and without being physically forced, he won't brush his teeth, wash his hands or take showers. He wanders around our house in a nightmarish limbo in which he does nothing but eat, sleep and talk to himself, starting at 3am. 

One hypothesis that I had was that his current condition isn't too related to his historical ones, and that the SSRI dosage was too high, resulting in him practically ""tripping"" while on it. To compensate, his body destroyed a lot of its serotonin receptors, and so, like long-term LSD users, he can't function properly without continued treatment of the original drug. Another one is that he's schizophrenic, and the onset of the disease just happened to overlap with his being prescribed an SSRI. Other ones include that he has PANS, or some other disorder that resulted in long term neurological degeneration, with the SSRI treatment possibly being some sort of trigger, or just happening, coincidentally, around a disease milestone. My parents are of the persuasion that he ""had a bad reaction"" to the drug, and will simply recover in due time, but I think that's unlikely. If anyone's heard of similar problems, including his earlier symptoms, please share your thoughts.

**Cody-** I was watching a 2 minute video recently, but it was too long. Halfway through, I got hungry so I left it playing and went downstairs to make a sandwich. But I was out of bread so I went to the store. There, I saw the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. But I'm shy so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was friendly, but she has a boyfriend. I’m mature though. I want the best for her, so I left it. But we kept in touch and became friends. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol , I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I made with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I got over the breakup. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night at my place. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: I slept on the couch. But on the couch, something was urging me. So I tossed and turned for about an hour, then I finally gave up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I went to the bed, gently sat on and tried to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get myself a sandwich then went to the store to get some bread then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video and she mentioned a sound from the drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and the video still has 44 seconds of play time on it.  
  
**Devin-** It’s very strange because to myself I almost seem like a villain. I’ve built these relationships with everyone and if I do make it far enough I’m gonna have to break them. I almost see myself as how Wing played last season. Wing played a ruthless game and he almost shushed people when they wanted to do something that wasn’t what he wanted to do. I came in and said I didn’t want to play like that. I wanted to give everyone a shot to shine and I feel like I’m too in control of some people’s game. It saddens me somewhat because it’s not the way I want to come off. But, I still gotta play.  
  
**Blaineley-** So um, this is where we do that right? Not fit for a celebrity like me but this will do, an idol is worth it.  
  
From where should I start... Oh from my team of course. We've swapped a lot during our stay here but this has to bs the 'wackiest' team I was put on.  
  
First we have Katie and Sadie, both dumb like rocks, honestly even rocks are more intelligent than them. Then we have Samey who is more boring than watching that shameful All Stars season that didn't put me on it... I'm still going to be cast one day.  
  
Dwayne is just a useless old man, he can barely do anything, Noah is intelligent but dealing with him is more trouble than it's worth, Heather is a snake so I should be careful with her, I'm sure she managed to get the dumb blonde Lindsay on her side again... At least her clothes are going to help us WIN this challenge.  
  
Then we have Justin who has a brain of the size of a mustard seed, probably even smaller. At last we have the wacko Izzy who can end up being apprehend at any time! Oh and I almost forgot about Zoey, she's forgettable anyway.  
  
Ugh... I hope a teamswap happens soon, dealing with those idiots is harder than it looks! Well, I have my ways of making that happen, I just have to get the help of an intern or two... Don't tell this to anyone.  
  
*Blaineley would put some make-up on tje camera's lens, before leaving the confessional with a diabolical laugh, her reign of terror would start…*
  
**Owen-** Sorry I haven't done many of these lately. I've been trying to figure out Leonard's next move. I'm hot on your trail, Leonard. You're going down!  
  
**Zoey-** Josh is cool  
  
**Katie-** So after last round, Ella got sent home for being a fake bitch who uses auto tune to attract animals, and the only thing that was sounding good was the sound of her leaving. Everything was peaceful during our regular 2 hour conversation of saying Satie and Kadie in different ways. The way that Satie sounds when you say it really slow and pronounce it ""Sa-ou-tee"" was one of our favorites, and that's how I've been calling her ever since.  

Sa-ou-tee says that we are in a great spot at the moment even though the rest of our team is very weird (As I talk about in my last confessional). A few updates are that Zoey found out that if she reaches her hand into Mike's sleeve, she can get away with more sexual acts without having to hide in an alley. In addition, Noah has now made 5 Drama-Chats just to get as many pictures of Kitty out of her as possible for his night time ""walks"" in the bottom of the ship where he doesn't realize that Owen records him for later.  
  
After last challenge of dying in a random Russian forest, the witch reje... I mean Blaineley decided that she was the best person to do our challenge, so if we lose this, the only witch reject she is gonna look like is the one that's burned at the stake. Everyone else has basically been doing nothing to help the challenge, while Sa-ou-tee and I were being very productive in trying to find out different names we can call each other to change things up (we were told saying Satie and Kadie was annoying, so pronouncing it differently will work).  
  
That's about all for now, I would love to write more, except Sa-ou-tee said that we need to go back to Ja-ust-een watching since we need more pictures of him to hang up in our room. I really hope Li-and-see doesn't do the same with Key-tee to try and one-up my connection with Sa-ou-tee, because I'd hate to be kicked off for poisoning their lipstick.  
  
**Devin-** I think that a lot of people underestimate me and because I’m nice I’m a terrible player. That’s definitely not true, a lot of people forget that I won a season because of my niceness so I’d watch out if I were them because if niceness can make me win once, niceness can win me a second trophy.  
  
*Katie found an idol*  
  
**Owen-** So I'm in two alliances now. One with Devin, the team leader - it's always good to have the leader on your side - and a big alliance with Brick and a few of the others who weren't originally on the Stars. I think I have a decent chance of making it to the final 10 at least. I'm in it to win this and I'm going to give it my all for the Stars. Here we go, final 10!  
  
**Katie-** So while Zoe-e was busy being a slut with M-ike, I decided to ask her multiple questions such as how often she has sex, her credit card number, and why the ocean goes to rocks in votes. What she didn't realize was that she gave me the answer to get another idol, and I told her that I still didn't get it.  
  
I promised her that she was going to get an idol should I get the code, but she will never even get to see it since I don't trust her. I'm sitting on 3 beautiful idols now, and I plan on using them to take out every slut in this game.  
  
**EPISODE 9**  
  
**Sadie-** Fuck you Josh. You and your ugly tie can go fuck yourselfs because you should have been on season 2 and you shouldn’t have been on season 3 gosh does anyone know how to christian anymore. Well on the bright side, Kadie snuck me off the cruise so I could go to church. In prayer group we put crosses in our bodies to fend off the evil. K I’m going to do the challenge and place all points on one person here we go.

**Izzy-** Izzerella here and she just has to say it's great to have a team that has won every challenge so far also that devin creep needs to back off Satie for reals speaking of her she is so fun to be around and i love it.  
  
**Samey-** My team's got this. I kinda feel bad for the other team, because the suck so much. Then again, they have my Cunt ass bitchy sister so I don't. I think I'm gonna leave Leonard, it just isn't as special as it was a week ago. I wonder how I can tell him? But you know who I want inside me now? Gwen. Her gothy appearance and mood swings are just to much for me to handle, and - AH! FUCK!  
  
**Devin-** Happy Birthday to Chris!  
  
Happy Birthday to Chris!  
  
Happy Birthday Dear Christopher!  
  
Happy Birthday to You!  
  
**Katie-** I'M SORRY FOR SHOUTING, BUT I'VE JUST BEEN SO HAPPY EVER SINCE I CONVINCED THE SLUT ZOE-E TO HELP ME FIND THE IDOL!!!!! SA-OU-TEE AND I HAVE THROWN A PARTY TO REWATCH ALL OUR FOOTAGE OF JA-OUS-TEEN THAT WE HAD NA-O-AH RECORD FOR US SINCE THE 3 OF US ALL ENJOY IT!!!!  
  
THIS CHALLENGE WAS REALLY SIMPLE FOR US SINCE WE JUST HAD ZOE-E INSTRUCT ALL OF US HOW TO PULL EFFECTIVELY ON THE ROPES TO GET THE MOST POWER ON EACH ROPE (I THINK WE ALL KNOW SHE HAS BEEN PRACTICING WITH M-IKE TO FIND THAT OUT). A FEW OF OUR TEAMMATES SUCH AS LI-AND-SEE AND KEY-TEE HAVE BEEN FREELOADING, SO THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING IF WE LOSE, BUT WE WON'T LOSE SINCE WE HAVE THE HOST JA-OUS-TEEN AND SA-OU-TEE!!!!  
  
I REALLY HOPE I GET ANOTHER CHANCE TO GO TO IDOL ISLAND SINCE THIS CRUISE SHIP IS SLOWLY STARTING TO SINK DUE TO THE FAT ASS O-WEEN EATING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT. I'M TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY TO DROWN IN THE O-SEAN, SO PLEASE SAVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
  
**Katie-** OMG, MY PHONE DIED MID-TEXT, AND I'M FREAKING OUT! I BORROWED SA-OU-TEE'S PHONE SO I CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT STUFF. TINDER BOY D-EVE-IN IS STILL FLIRTING WITH ALL THE GIRLS TRYING TO BE WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE CAN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S TOO BUSY WANTING TO HOOK UP WITH TYLER. HE CAN TAKE HIS SCREENSHOTS OF ANYONE WHO MESSAGES HIM AND JUMP IN THE OCEAN AND USE O-WEEN AS A LIFE RAFT SINCE HE'S A FATTY.  
  
**Devin-** I don’t even know what to say at this point. People didn’t submit how they said they were going to so we lost. I can’t even fathom us winning now because that was our challenge to win. I might as well go cry myself to sleep now.  
  
**Sadie-** Why are we landing in the middle of the ocean. Oh no we are not...wait we are on a cruise ship how would we even land, and take off from an ocean. Also fuck kitty titty and depulicatilny  
  
**Owen-** Well, that's like 8 losses in a row for me. I think Josh and Leonard decided to rig the past few challenges to keep me off Leonard's scent. If you're watching this, Leonard, you're not going to get away with this!  
  
**Cody-** You know, so far this seasons actually going alright. As long as I can make the merge, I can be happy!  
  
**Brick-** Losing an alliance member is sad and I loved that Tyler guy☹️ I’m not even sure how it happened 🤔seeing how one of the old stars must have changed their vote from what they told me they were voting for. Dawn, which me and my alliance voted for seems weak enough to be willing to accept an alliance agreement. Let's hope she does so the new stars stay strong  
  
**Sadie** I was kicked off fuck  
  
**EPISODE 10**  
  
**Devin-** So. Tyler was voted Out good. However his friend Brick apparently made an alliance of Himself/Owen/Amy and now Dawn. He wants Cody out however I don’t like that plan so... I think I might pull Me/Cody/Gwen/Tom Together so that we can vote out Brick. The trouble is we just need to get at least one person to flip without blabbing it to Brick. But obviously we all hope we don’t lose again.  
  
**SATIE FOUND THE IDOL**  
  
**Owen-** WOO! TOP 20!  
  
Also, we finally won a challenge! That was the quickest challenge we've had so far, too. Seems like things are finally starting to turn around - for now, anyway. It'll be good to see the Kahunas send someone home, but this one loss won't be enough to soften the edge they have on us.  
  
In other news, it would seem the ""other"" members of the Stars have formed a bit of an alliance and voted off one of the members in mine and Brick's alliance. We also had a member leave the alliance, so I guess it's just me and Brick. This turn of events could be bad for me and Brick down the road, but luckily I have Devin on my side as well (for now). Either way, I made it to the top 20 and hopefully I'll be seeing the top 10 soon.  
  
**Brick-** I now know how Tyler was eliminated, Amy betrayed the new stars alliance. Man, loseing 2 members out of 4 in one day is rough haha. But seeing how Owen is def my ally in this competition at least I have him, we will just have to rely on winning for now. *looks down in worry*   
  
**Owen-** Izzy is in for it now. No more Mr. Nice Guy! I bet she's in cahoots with that rat Leonard.

**Owen-** It can be pretty frustrating when you're constantly losing challenges. For a while there, I was even considering dropping out of the season because it felt like I wasn't doing a good enough job for my team. Now that things are turning around a bit, I'm glad I'm still in this. It would be so cool to win as a rookie!  
  
**Katie-** Oh? Confessional Time? Let me grab some hot tea because this is gonna be a long one.

So Tie-lear being eliminated on the other team last elim is great for me, since Li-and-see lost her boy candy, so she is stuck looking at pictures of him in her cabin room, which is great. Now she really can't match Sa-ou-tee and I since we still have Ja-ous-teen to stare at all day. Besides that, B-lane-elly and I couldn't win the challenge for us, and that's all because of **Zoe-e** wanting to be a thot with Me-ike and throw the challenges.

My plan is simple, **Make everyone waste their idols.** If I'm not allowed to hold on the ones I found, then **NOBODY IS GOING TO FUCKING HAVE ONE.** EVERYONE IS VOTING FOR HEAT-ER SO I DECIDED TO IDOL HEAT-ER AND VOTE FOR ZOE-E, WHILE TELLING EVERYONE ELSE THAT ZOE-E WAS IDOLING HEAT-ER AND VOTING FOR THEM. I MESSAGED THAT TO EVERYONE AND TOLD THEM TO IDOL, SO HOPEFULLY MANY IDOLS ARE WASTED.

FUCK YOU ZOE-E, AND DON'T BE A THOT TO SEE HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN GET ME-IKE OFF IN A DAY! THE ONLY PLACE FOR YOU IS ROD-KNEE'S DUNGEON WHERE HE KIDNAPS HIS DATES AND RENTS IT OUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME-IKE TO USE.
  
**Sadie-** 6 appeal my Clint bitch. My friend Zoey was attacked by eight people this is not good. She may have made me wear a romper that was a hate crime...but she didn’t deserve what she supported...oh wait she had this coming. This is what she gets for wearing gay!  
  
**Devin-** Excuse my language but what the flipping heck was that? 8/12 were Immune. Honestly I elect them to go to Elimination every vote. But, in other words Brick apparently thinks I’m throwing challenges, so I think now there is a team of Me, Jay, Canu, DRH &amp; Dawn to Blindside his snake butt.  
  
**Sadie-** Everyone is assaulting us so I’m pronouncing Kadie as Ka-eh-die now. I’m literally going to sue everyone after this show. Especially Devin and his blonde bimbo Carrie.  
  
**Owen-** Not sure what's going on here, but looks like Zoey went off the deep end of the cruise ship when she got voted out. I noticed she mentioned a ""god idol"" in her letter. This could be real bad news for me. I'm going to have to do some snooping to find out more about this god idol and what exactly it does.  
  
**Owen-** With Leonard out of hiding and talk of this mythical god idol in Creeper's possession, things are really heating up. I feel like I'm playing a completely different game than the one I joined a few weeks ago. No matter - I still have a special idol of my own. I think I'm going to have to start playing my moves in advance if I'm going to win this season. Maybe a mole infiltrating the other Stars alliance will help my chances of making it further.  
  
**Owen-** The plot thickens. Thanks to some of my inside Intel, I found out that creeper, from Zoey's letter, is none other than... Samey. That shy little vixen could potentially be holding immeasurable power with the god idol. The real concerning bit is this: Samey almost always takes up for Leonard. I'm sure one's better judgement would say it's just Samey's nature to take up for people, but she has been known to lash out, particularly at Josh. This leads me to believe Leonard and Samey are in cahoots. Samey lashing out at Josh could mean one of two things: it's just a cover to make people think she's not working together with Josh and Leonard, or Leonard is playing Samey and Josh like a pair of thrift shop fiddles and neither one is aware of it. Judging from Leonard's strength, he could possibly have the poor girl brainwashed or under some type of spell. Regardless, I need to keep an eye on Samey, Josh, and Leonard for the time being. I can't let that god idol cause the premature end of my rookie season.  
  
**Samey-** I was gonna take you out sometime down the road anyways. Bye, Zoey. This also leaves many others open for extermination, and next on my list is, Katie &amp; Sadie. Both of you will fall, whether you like it or not. HAHAHAHAHAHA!  
  
**Owen-** I guess you could say I'm making moves in this game. I've proposed an alliance with Heather so I can hopefully get some inside information on the Kahunas. If they're not unified, we could wreck them from within.  
  
**Owen-** I just formed an alliance with Heather, on the Kahunas. I think it will be good to have an insider letting me know what's going on behind the curtain with the other team.  
  
**Owen-** I don't mean to brag, but I'm playing this game like a pro. I have connections with Devin, Brick, Heather, and potentially Dawn. Nothing is going to stop me from winning this season. Nothing.  
  
**EPISODE 11**  
  
**Tom-** I vote for dawn. Also this is my first time so here I go. I think I made some good friends while I’ve been here and I feel like I’ve helped my last teams pretty well. So whatever team I get on next I’ll put in 100% effort for. But I hope I’m on a team with a friend.  
  
**Noah-** I've been inactive this whole fucking time but I'm glad to get off that fucking team, I can't talking fucking strategy when we all win. How am I supposed to make #BigMoves if my team is so fucking good? Huh? How, what the actual fuck.  
   
Blaineley is fucking good I guess?  
  
Who the fuck is even Dwayne why didn't we vote that fucker out he hasn't done anything at all.  
  
Heather is ???? Who??? WHO THE FUCK????  
  
Izzy is my pride and joy. I love you firebid &lt;3  
  
Yo Justin Jawababy. Don't know him. Probably won't after this tribe swap.  
  
Kadie is my best friend  
  
Kitty, what kind of name is TacoBear28? Tabobear? Taforsaf?  
  
Lindsasy is a alright I guesssssssssssss  
  
FUCK NOAH HONESTLY FUCK HIM WE SHOULD HAVE VOTED HIM OUT OVER ZOEY WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK  
  
Satie is pretty cool  
  
Samey is pretty cool  
  
Th-that-that's all folks.  
  
Will I get more points if I put a Brock Hampton song in here?  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ZRRlVDVa8  
  
There you go.  
  
I forgot to do Zoey: FUCK YOU FOR BEING A STUPID FUCKING PRICK THAT MADE THAT VOTE SO FUCKING COMPLICATED YOU FUCKING SUCK CUCK I HATE YOU SO MUCH  
  
I'll do the other team too because why not? WHY FUCKING NOT? FUCK YOU JT FUCK YOU THIS CHALLENGE SUCKS  
  
Amy got third last season. That's all.  
  
Brick is new this season. That's all.  
  
Cody is Jamie. Jamie is pretty good.  
  
DRHGMRTD  
  
Devin is Dylan, he's an alright player. Don't think he deserved the win but ya know that's how it is when he lets all the good players do the work and then goes to the end with Jpeg.  
  
Gwen is Canu333333333333333333333  
  
Owen is new I think  
  
TOMOxWATER is a pretty good username. Don't remember his character's name.  
  
I'D GIVE A GOOD FUCKING CONFESSIONAL ABOUT STRATEGY IF I FUCKING COULD BUT I'VE HAD NO STRATEGY BECAUSE MY ALLIANCE IS SO BIG WE JUST FUCKING VOTE ANYONE WHO ISN'T US WHAT THE FUCK. THERE IS NO STRATEGY INVOLVED THERE, THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING I CAN DO TO DO STRATEGY BECAUSE I CAN'T TURN ON THE ALLIANCE BECAUSE THERE IS SO FUCKING MANY OF THEM, JUST LOOK AT JPEG HE TRIED TO TURN ON THE ALLIANCE AND HE GOT FUCKED IN THE ASS. THIS SEASON SUCKS, LAST SEASON SUCKS, IDOL ISLAND FUCKING SUCKS.  
  
I miss Teacher.  
  
**Owen-** Another team swap? I've had it with Leonard's tricks. He may be out of the game, but there's no question he's influencing the outcome of this season. I guess I'll have to make the best of it and see where I end up. Hopefully I get on a team with some of the people I've been networking with - that would make my hard work pay off. Then again, it wouldn't surprise me if Leonard was the one picking the ""best"" confessionals and just assigning us to teams based on his agenda.  
  
**Amy-** Oh hell no I was in a great position and now you fucked it up. This is worst than the time my sister kissed and dated the boy that I liked. (I still hooked up with him... you can't deny this)    
  
**Sadie-** Hey y’all. I have some shit to say. I just woke up and I’m about to go outside to see what’s going on. Last night Ka-eh-die told me to kill myself for not updating you lovely people on what’s going on behind the scenes; so I guess that’s starting today, I will keep y’all updated!  
  
**Sadie-** Oh sweet baby jesus everything went to shit. Right when I opened the bedroom door, Leonard’s dead body was right there at the foot of the door! Apparently Ka-eh-die felt that Leonard’s hate speech was a crime and she couldn’t take it anymore, so she had Izzy hire a hit man to assassinate Leonard! The bitch is finally gone for good!  
  
In other noose, Blaineley was denying the fact that she is an evil whore! She’s been flirting with the cameramen and being a bitch behind the scenes. She will deny it and say that’s not true...but that’s the same thing she said when she was pregnant!  
  
Kitty and Samey are being fucking F A KE. I FUCKING HATE THOSE HOES BECAUSE THEY WONT FESS UP TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SATAN! So as y’all know, I will cut a bitch if you test my phat ass. I’m not joking bitch...I LITERALLY CUT SAMEY’S FAKE ASS TITTIES OFF OF HER STICK FIGURE BODY AND CUT KITTY WITH MY SAFETY SCISSORS CAUSE THEY ARENT REAL!  
  
Now I’m on probation because I assaulted someone. I’m not allowed to leave my room. Ka-eh-die keeps telling me that I’m a dumb ass bitch because I should have shot the bitches in toms closet. She claims that she has seen skeletons in there, so no one would know the difference.  
  
Also can we talk about Tom? He is one gay twink. That bitch denies it but when I speak in tongues to jesus, Jesus tells me that bitch is gay and to spill the tea, so I did. Im going to crucify the bitch if he keeps denying the t. He is about as straight as a used condom.  
  
Also Gwen is a fucking vampire apparently, she literally sucked the color out of the gay ass rainbow romper that Zoey is wearing.  
   
Oh did y’all know I caged up Zoey on the ship inside a cage inside a breeding pen inside a butt plug? Yeah who knew she was so flexible. Apparently Mike likes to see Zoey in many.....positions...so she’s about as elastic as a damn rubber band.  
  
Oh fuck...Ka-eh-die is starting a mass exodus again. I have to go back in the bunker in our room! I gotta go y’all! The point of this confessional was: I’m about to gouge out everyone’s eyes with fucking rosaries if they cucks don’t get a grip and obey jesus.  
  
K bye y’all!  
  
**Devin-** Today I’m gonna tell you a story. A story about JT and his spreadsheets. It is a turbulent one so buckle up.  
  
Every night JT made love to his spreadsheet by filling the little spreadsheet with all sorts of information and statistics. When they had their passionate alone time together JT would touch the spreadsheet everywhere. I mean everywhere from A1 to Z500 and everywhere in between. The spreadsheet liked it when JT would *italicize* and **bold** information. There relationship was great but one day JT noticed something somebody else was looking at his precious little spreadsheet. He became furious. It was Chris! Chris, JT’s very Best Friend he couldn’t believe his eyes. Chris doesn’t even like spreadsheets he thought. JT asked the spreadsheet “CAN HE EVEN EDIT YOU LIKE I CAN?”. JT had been fooled, the spreadsheet was a little gold digger that only wanted JT for his ability to freeze columns to give her a youthful look. Chris kicked JT out of his own spreadsheet and JT would not live happily ever after with his spreadsheet.  
  
**Dwayne-** Wow, a lot has happened since my last confessional and I've been saving it for next time I was eligible for Idol Island. So here we are! Well first off, we actually lost a challenge, which sucks. So it started off with Kitty asking me who we should vote for, which is great because it showed me that she trusts me after our little mini ""strategy talk"" a few challenges prior, at least I think so. So I said Zoey because let's be honest, although she sometimes does well in challenges she does nothing to communicate with the team. But then... Samey. I presented Samey with the idea to vote Zoey and she told me the plan was to vote Heather. Honestly, that's fine too since she does nothing as well, and although I was unsure of the idea, I was cool with it and told Kitty, who thankfully understood my plight. I just hope this alliance does not turn into a dictatorship because it's really the only thing keeping me safe... Anyways, Samey tells me 'I'm a target for elimination' and to play my idol. Because I forgot to participate in the last challenge, I naturally get a little paranoid and decide to do it. That was a big mistake. The elimination comes, like 8 PEOPLE play an idol including me AND INCLUDING HEATHER. No-one votes for me, and since Heather played her idol, Zoey ended up getting the boot. So now I'm kind of pissed because I ended up wasting my idol completely and we didn't even take out Heather. After the elimination I had a short conversation with Brick, in which he shared some valuable info with me. Apparently the Stars have a 5 man alliance of Amy, Gwen, Devin, Dawn, and ""the other person"" who I assume is Tom because he said he, Owen, and Cody weren't a part of it. There's a big silver lining from this, though. The confessional is for the (second) team swap challenge. IF I get separated from Samey, and pair up with Brick, Kitty, and possibly Owen if he's still on Brick's side, we could start to run the game. However, that is a big IF, this stuff could go any way. Really, I just have to hope the people I NEED on my side make good confessionals because if I get stuck on a team with a bunch of people who are probably in an alliance, I'm shit out of luck. Anyways that was pretty long, sorry, I just had to get this all off my chest.  
  
**Brick-** Another team switch, thank God! The stars were looking bad for me, Owen, and Cody if are team was to lose anymore challenges. I still have my idol which a lot of people from the kahunas don't. Whichever team I get put on I need to make sure I get involved in the major alliance. And don't allow any backstabbers like Amy in my alliances. man I still miss that Tyler guy😔. If she is on my team that's who I'm convincing everyone to turn against. I don't think I've made any enemies during the cruise so I'm hoping being the nice guy I am will help me get aligned more easy.  
  
**Justin-** A team switch is interesting. At first, I liked my team however after that last fiasco I'm willing to part with them. I mean, seriously? 8 people played idols? Anyway, I only hope I'm not on a team with Devin and his communist ways.  
  
**Kitty-** After that huge idol play I don't really know what's going on. Right now my main allies are Samey, Dwayne, Lindsay, and I'm somewhat allied with Izzy. I'm surprised I was able to take the target of Lindsay's back and put it onto Heather instead. At the moment I'm trying to lay low because I could've easily went home in the idol play as I was one of the four people not immune.  
  
**Izzy-** Hello Izzy is back and I have no idea what the heck was going on because my silly personality disorder get me I think the only cure was me kissing samey now i have to apologize to Owen for being such a beep.  
  
**Samey-** Damn you, Leonard! DAMN YOU! I spent all this time covering up your little slave labour and fidget spinner cartel, not to mention your sex slaves! And you just go and reveal that shit to Dwayne? DWAYNE? The fuck? You didn't even tell me until you kidnapped me! We are SO through!  
  
**Gwen-** PLEASE LET ME BE WITH DEVIN  
PLEASE LET ME BE WITH DEVIN  
PLEASE LET ME BE WITH DEVIN  
PLEASE LET ME BE WITH DEVIN  
PLEASE LET ME BE WITH DEVIN  
  
**Lindsay-** Lindsay: *walks into confessional*  
  
*in British accent* Ahhhh. I can no longer mask this charade. *pulls out book from her...shirt* Oh Shakespeare, you are the being keeping me from going mad in this superficial cash in. Why must submit myself to the agony of portraying one of those “Big Breasted Bimbos from California” when my real genius is bounds ahead above the commoners around me. Yet the fools buy into it the scam. They don’t suspect a thing from my master plan. Soon it shall be I who the winner. Me, not Heather, ME! MADAM LINDSAY Q ZINGLEVBOSSEM THE THIRD! AND THEY IS NOBODY HERE THAT CAN NOR WILL STOP ME! *evil laugh*  
  
*knock knock*
  
*faint voice from outside*; Hey Lindsay, you ok in there?  
  
Lindsay: *clears throat back in her “regular voice”* Uh yeah, I’m fine. I’m just trying to find the little camera guy in here. He must be soooo tiny cause I can’t find him anywhere. *winks to the camera*  
  
**Blaineley-** Another teamswap? Relying on confessionals? Ugh, couldn't be more forceful right Josh?  
  
Well there hasn't been happening much with me despite what I said last time but this swap might end up being more beneficial than I thought!  
  
Since the start of the game I've been quite inactive to say at least, helping with challenges here and there, talking with a person or two, but I never tried to make any meaningful connections with others.  
  
This ended up leading to a serious problem... My team was already with various alliances and whenever I tried to talk to one of them, I felt like an outsider, before I noticed... Blaineley Stacey Olsen was left alone.  
  
Now some may think that this was good since they wouldn't be focusing me that but for my plan to work, I need some allies, more specifically, sacrifice pieces.  
  
And look at what happened this swap might end up ruining everyone's else plans! That way, I can finally forge some good alliances and start making a turmoil on the teams to get rid of the people I want!  
  
Although that won't be easy, I'm fully prepared for what is to come. I'm expecting to be placed on the middle team or maybe the worst team but that doesn't matter, the only thing I need is manage to get to the merge, then... Let's see what happens.  
  
**Cody-** Before this challenge was posted, I was watching Pixar’s Cars, and it made me think of some interesting questions about it, so I’m going to share them with you. Firstly, why are they cars? How do them being cars serve as the story? What are the car rules? They lock themselves? Why? What are they locking? Can cars open each other and steal things? What do they steal? Do they steal organs.....do they have organs? Why are little bugs cars? Are cars born? Do they come from a factory? Do they mate?!? (The film implies they mate...). If that is the case, what does a pregnant car look like? Is it an egg-sac sort of situation? These were the questions that came up whilst I watched Cars. I have no answers.......Cars has no answers.......  
  
**Sadie-** FUCK KA-EH-DIE. SHE CRUCIFIED HALF THE SHIP YESTERDAY. And now SHES ON HER PERIOD SO SHES PURPOSEFULLY TAKING FOR EVER ON THE FUCKING CHALLENGE. BITCH FUCK YOU AND HURRY UP OR I WILL BITE OFF YOUR NIPPLES YOU TRICK ASS BITCH.  
  
**Dwayne-** Fucking great. I'm on a team with Kadie and Satie, and I don't even have any of my alliance members with me. On top of that, I was SECOND best confessional which unfortunately doesn't net me any ""Idol Island brownie points"". I still have Blaineley and Lindsay on my team, maybe I can convince them to join up with me? Not sure. Hopefully our already kind of strong team can manage to dodge elimination because if not, I am FUCKED.  
  
**Devin-** Bow is a Liar, L-I-A-R (x2)  
  
Bow is a Liar, L-I-A-R (x2)  
  
I hope that time spent in the school play in the 5th Grade paid off.  
  
**Izzy-** Hello viewers i love my new team and it's amazing i'm not on a team with Sadie thank gosh good luck girl.  
   
**Brick-** The New stars alliance lives on! This team swap could have not gone better.Owen, Cody, and I all stayed together Which we're the only surviving members of the new stars from are last team #riptyler #fuckamy. And seeing how us 3 are half the team we can easily assure a ride into the merge. Even tho I doubt we will lose challenges. The team below us is full of basically afk players.

""Comrades, this is your supervisor. It is an honor to speak to you today, and I am honored to be riding with you on the maiden voyage of our agency's most recent achievement. Once more, we play our dangerous game, a game of chess against our old adversary — the skilled nursing facilities. For forty years, your fathers before you and your older brothers played this game and played it well. But today the game is different. We have the advantage. It reminds me of the heady days of LP5s and air horns when the world trembled at the sound of our emergency signals. Well, they will tremble again — at the sight of how high speed/low drag we are. The order is: engage Paramedic mode.


Comrades, our own management doesn't know our full potential. They will do everything possible to test us; but they will only test their own embarassment. We will leave our agency behind, we will pass skilled nursing facilities, past the gomers that GO TO GROUND, and lay off their dispatch center, and listen to their radio traffic... while we conduct proper trauma drills. And when we are finished, the only sound they will hear is our laughter, as we sail to a rural EMS, where the sun is warm, and so is the comradeship. A great day, comrades. We ride into history!""

~~~


AMR Assistant to the Manager, talking to the county administrator: ""It seems that the initial reports that one of our ambulances was missing were not completely accurate. The ambulance in question... is commanded by Supervisor Marko Ramius. Apparently he's suffered a kind of mental or nervous break down. Just before he dispatched himself, he posted a letter to his superiors, in which he announced his intention to... to practice out of scope measures outside his area of operation: county EMS.""


~~~


County Hall:

Paramedic Ryan: Where are we going, anyway?  
Supervisor Greer: Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt, the county administrator. Most of the county council will be there, along with a few other people.  
Ryan: Who's giving the briefing?  
Greer: You are.  

After heated debate about Ramius' motivation:  
Ryan: ""Well, Sir, I was just thinking that perhaps there's another possibility we might consider. Ramius might be trying to defect.""  
Administrator: ""I'll give you three hours to prove your theory correct. After that... we'll have the sheriff's office track him down. ""  


Ryan: ""[imitating the Sheriff] ""The average city paramedic, son, don't take a dump without his SOPs. And senior paramedics don't start something this dangerous without having thought the matter through."" Wait a minute. We don't have to figure out how to get the crew off the ambulance. He's already done that, he would have had to. All we gotta do is figure out what he's gonna do. So how's he gonna get the crew off the ambulance? How do you get the crew off a 4,5 ton, meds equipped box truck carrying lot's of ... explosive ... pressure stored ... oxygen...""


~~~


Paramedic Borodin: ""I will also move out of the city. And I will partner up with a cute county Paramedic woman and sleep during night shifts, and we will smoke cigarettes at the hospital ambulance bay when the sun dawns. And I will have a properly stocked ambulance... maybe even a ""fly car"" And drive from call to call without needing to transport. Do they let you do that?""  
Supervisor Ramius: ""Oh, yes.""  
Borodin: ""No transports?""  
Ramius: ""No transports, call to call.""  
Borodin: ""Well then, during day shifts I will staff a fly car.""  


~~~


Ryan and a spare ALS crew are sent out to find Ramius. They detect him in a backroads supermarket parking place.  
EMT-B: ""So you don't like ridin' backwards, huh? This is nothin'! You shoulda been with us five, six months ago! Whoa, talk about puke! The main road to the hospital? Cobblestone, also completly covered by potholes. Every patient and intern was retchin' his guts out! One intern shot his lunch all over the windshield, another one barfed on the radio - knocked it out completely! It wasn't that lightweight stuff, either; it was that chunky, industrial-weight puke because they all eat the unhealthiest shit availabe! [proferring an apple] Here, ya wanna bite?""

Medic Mancuso: ""There is your AMR unit. My analogue radio skills are so dated I could datalink him the measures of the winner of ""Nurse of the Week"". morses ""ACTIVATE WAILER ONCE WHEN TRYING TO DEFECT"" via high beams  
Ramius: wakes up from nap ""Give me one short wail Vasily, one wail only, please.""  

~~~

Mancuso and Ryan walk over to the AMR Ambulance. Ramius sees them, chucles.  
Mancuso: What's so funny?  
Ryan: Ah, Supervisor Ramius seems to think you rural paramedics are some kind of... cowboy or lumberjack.  
Ramius: You understand urban medics?  
Ryan: A little. It is wise to study the ways of one's adversary. Don't you think?  

~~~

The Assistant to the Manager shows up in another ambulance. Sirens blaring.  
EMT-B: Hey I think someone just showed up at the parking lot with his sirens blaring!  
Paramedic Mancuso: No shit, Buckwheat, now get the hell out of here!  
EMT-B: Where am I supp... [Mancuso slams the ambulance driver's door shut]  

~~~

Ramius takes off with his AMR ambulance, with the Assistant to the Manager in pursuit. He overestimates his driving abilities and looses his grip of the steering wheel. The pursuing ambulance crashes and explodes.


Covered by the county ambulance and an arriving Sheriff unit, Ramius makes a beeline to the nearest county EMS station.


~~~


At dawn, Ryan and Ramius stand in the backyard of the station to drink good coffee and smoke.  
Ramius: There's one thing you haven't yet asked me: why?  
Ryan: Well, I figured you would tell me when you felt ready.  
Ramius: Well, there are those who believe that we should work 70 hours a week, plus unpaid overtime. Or that we have to clear for calls without proper desinfection and restocking. This unit was build for that purpose. [Points at AMR ambulance].  
Ryan nods. ""Welcome to our County EMS, Mr. Ramius!""

I feel like organizing an AMA is difficult because you have to reach out and coordinate everything for every single AMA. Making it into a reoccurring event would only require initial effort setting it up, but after that it won't be much more work other than just starting a thread every time it's time for one.

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

9idot4,5,2018-09-23,Navient put my private loans in repayment while still in grad school and refuses to honor in-school deferment on these loans and says I'm out of forbearance/deferments,SayVandalay,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/9idot4/navient_put_my_private_loans_in_repayment_while/,"So this time last year Navient decided to put my signature student private loans in repayment while I was still in the middle of my doctoral program. I called to explain this and they gave some line about ""oh we changed those loans after 2008 so you only get 48 months max in school deferment after you graduate."" 

I informed them that the loans in question were all 2007 and earlier (I had gone to undergrad then masters, then time off when I did make some payments/use forbearance then back into grad school for a doctorate). 

I pointed out that one I graduated my undergrad about 10 years prior (so that's more than 48 months) and my masters more than 4 years prior to this phone call. So neither time line matched their 48 month ""claim"" and it seems like they suddenly just changed to terms. 

They refused to place them back into deferment and said this ""48 month maximum"" was in my loan documents. I requested both copies of their ""after 2008 loan applications"" and my original loan applications (2002-2007). The 2008 vaguely states this 48 month rule (which makes no sense for students going for doctoral studies including medicine) but all my loan docs are missing this statement. 

I asked them in writing to clarify where in the loans this statement was, they gave me the section and backpedaled stating that ""oh it's 4 years max AFTER you go back to school AFTER more than a 6 month gap in school"": and it's no where on my loans. I wasn't able to get into a doctoral program right after my Masters so was out of school for about a year, I asked if I had just gone right from masters to doctorate with no gap would this apply, they said no. (so basically I'm getting docked for not staying in school continuously which tells me if one wants to never pay them back, just never drop below half time enrollment in school lol)  I pointed this out and their response was ""well we can't do anything about that because now your loans are in repayment in our system.""

Fortunately I was on internship (which for my degree is still considered full time student) and did an internship/residency deferement for 1 year.

Fast forward to this year and they now are asking for money again and put them in repayment. I again noted that I am STILL in school due to dissertation coursework/completion credits (and per federal student certification standards am STILL classified as full time) with an expected graduation date of Dec 2018.

They then informed me I had one month of forberance left ""forever"" and forced me to pay $150 to use it. Now the next due date is coming up...I do have some work lined up potentially but wouldn't start in time to have money to pay the massive amount they want. I explained multiple times that it's a little hard for someone to make full payments WHILE still in school and without the degree in hand and that in a few months I'd likely be financially able to make at least interest only payments.

They continue to stonewall and insist they ""have no other deferment options at this time"" for ""these signature loans.""

I need to call them this week ahead of the next due date, any tips on how to get this escalated to a higher level manager or something? Or do I really need to consider legal action?

 I mean what am I supposed to do? Drop out of doctoral studies with like 3 months left to get a job that actually pays enough to pay them min payments? I get that it isn't their ""problem"" that I went on for more schooling but in my field you need advanced graduate degrees to actually get licensed and get work so frankly seems a bit irresponsible on their part to suddenly pull the rug out from under people and cancel a valid federally recognized deferment status and potentially screw the person's chances of actually getting work that pays enough to pay them back anyways. 

Is there a reason they insist they can't just take their $150 for ""forbearance"" fee and then when I can pay more go from there? 

I need to call them this week ahead of the next due date, any tips on how to get this escalated to a higher level manager or something? From what I can tell so far they really seem to just refuse to work with people. Do I really need to consider legal action to get this resolved?

**TL;DR: Navient put some loans back in repayment citing some term that isn't in my loan docs, not finished school yet but they refuse so far to issue any form of deferment at this time, tips on what to do?**"

Am hoping this will get a bit more traction.

&amp;#x200B;

(This is gonna be an incredibly long post, sorry, and I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons). But recently (about a couple weeks ago) I started seeing this girl that I've had an on and off very complicated relationship (never official or whatever until now though) with for the last 4 years.

It started back in the summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college. I was in a different relationship at the time (very serious, was about a year and a half old), and I went to do an internship in a different state across the country. There were some other fundamental issues in that relationship, and basically me shipping off for 3-4 months led us to ""take a break"" or ""breakup"" (at this juncture I don't remember the specific terminology we used, and I feel like Ross shouting ""WE WERE ON A BREAK"" over and over) for that time.

I go to this internship and end up starting to sleep with a couple different people. (The morality of this is not what I'm calling into question, I know I was a total idiot for even doing so, but it happened.) I end up meeting and sleeping with this one girl (now SO - we'll call her Regan) and we really, really have a strong connection. Really, honestly haven't felt(feel - I love her very much now) that way ever about another human. It was(is) insane.

She ends up finding out that I was concurrently sleeping with other people, and we get into a whole fight (in which I lie - she caught it right away, I felt terrible about even attempting it...but I was being dumb. No excuses there) and stop talking for a brief period of time. (This is in fact what I want to get back to, as I the inciting incident was about one person specifically and the fact I had slept with another person may or may not have been brought up, I don't recall. We'll get more into this later.)

We end up talking again after attempting to sort through that stuff and basically decide continue our summer fling (with no real resolution to my actions). Again, I really, really like her. It's a bit overwhelming and also I'm completely disregarding the other messy relationship I was to go back home too. However, Regan lived across the country from where I did so as the summer ended, we came to the realization that we would never see each other again and that was that.

I go back home, and go back to the previous relationship. We try to make things work but it winds up not (shocker I know). Meanwhile me and Regan talk on and off. Some drunk calls, some casual conversation. At one point we do disclose that we do love each other, but again, the probability of me seeing her ever again is astronomically slim.

We both were in the same major (hence why we were at the same internship together) but she was a year above me. A couple years go by and in the fall/winter of my junior year of college (her senior year), she informs me that her advisor wanted her to apply to graduate school at my current university. Crazy shit.

She does, and ends up coming to interview. She figures out she can stay an extra day and does to hangout with me. We do, and it's an awesome time, our chemistry is obviously still there. Regan then decides that she's going to come to graduate school at my university, making her first year in grad school coincide with my senior year there. Again, I had come to grips with the idea I would never see her again, so I'm so excited.

Then the summer before that academic year comes. And she basically goes AWOL on me. We went from talking on the phone every night to hardly even texting. She had picked up a summer job that wound up being very intense and stressful, couple that with getting ready to move across the country to start graduate school, and I knew she was going through a lot mentally/emotionally. I figured I would give her space, and did so. However, she barely informed me of what her plans were in terms of moving. I had to pry that information out of her and it was clear there was some form of tension.

She eventually moves, and trying to see/talk to her is tough. When we hangout everything feels fine, but there is still a tension I can't quite describe. I try to talk about it and she won't. Eventually after a month or so of this, she does, and basically admits that she was feeling a pressure and anxiety about being in a relationship with me. She felt like on one hand it made sense because it was crazy that we were close in distance finally, but that she couldn't let go some of my actions from the summer we met. We part ways and I'm a little hurt, wishing we could've talked about it more.

Two years go by and that takes us to now. We start talking again (I've moved three hours away to start graduate school myself) and things are awesome. I have to go back and visit a couple times (for a friend's wedding, and my band had a show), so we hangout and it's awesome. And recently we decided to start having a real relationship.

This brings me to where I need advice. We had talked about this stuff a couple times before, and I want to be fully open and honest with her. I betrayed her honesty once already, and that's the source of this anxiety from her. One night during our conversations about this she made mention of ""yeah when you slept with x and whomever else you slept with down there"" (referring to the internship summer). The thing that is bothering me is I don't recall if I've ever directly mentioned who it was/if I did sleep with anyone else. I think I have, but we have had so many conversations about it and she's fixated on person x that I just don't remember. We had a really tough convo today about her feelings and in it I told her I'm trying to be as open and honest. And I am because I adore her so much and I want this...I need this...to work out.

But I'm not sure if it's worth it to drudge up that memory for the sake of a clarification, especially when we're so fragile at the moment. She seems to know based on vague comments like I mentioned before, but hasn't asked about it specifically, even when I've asked her ""is there anything you want clarification or want to talk about?"" So maybe she doesn't care/doesn't want to know at this juncture. I'm just not sure how to handle it.

TLDR; Have an old memory my SO seems to remember but she hasn't been specific about it. Not sure if I need to bring it up or if I should wait for her to come to me about it directly if she has questions about it."
9idwsh,13,2018-09-23,Question: Which skills should be emphasized by a student studying computer vision to get into industry?,ssnover95x,computervision,https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/9idwsh/question_which_skills_should_be_emphasized_by_a/,"Hello all,

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while and enjoying the informative discussions. I'm currently studying computer science as a graduate student and am taking my first computer vision course (topics like human visual system, colorspaces, edge detection, etc.). I'm looking to focus some of my time outside of class on learning more of the concepts not covered in the course and perhaps learning another framework, however I'm curious what tools are most common in industry to best target my time towards having a strong enough base to be hired as an intern and soon for full-time. I'll be studying plenty more than that minimum to be clear, just over a longer time scale!

&amp;#x200B;

The class I'm taking is taught primarily with MATLAB for demonstrations and for implementing concepts we've learned in class. I've taken some steps toward learning OpenCV, following tutorials on PyImageSearch, but I'm not sure if I should be hung up on whether I learn with C++ or Python (my background is in embedded systems so C++ is my preference, but the material out there is definitely more targeted at Python). Even taking a step back from that, I don't know if I should bother with OpenCV or if I should focus more on my own implementations at the expense of not necessarily getting to do as complicated of projects.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question essentially boils down to: what tools should I focus on as a student hoping to land a job in the industry in one or two years?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
9idx17,1,2018-09-23,I [23 M] have had multiple instances where I am consistently considered an afterthought with my friends [multiple M/F] whenever there is a get together. Scheduling something to do with them is always a nightmare. Is this something that I am doing wrong or should I say something?,anormalthrowaway1111,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9idx17/i_23_m_have_had_multiple_instances_where_i_am/,"Earlier today I got a Snapchat from my best friend's fiancee (she lives over 100 miles away) and a group of his friends that (excluding one that lives in the same city as me) live a few towns over. I initially thought that it was outside of my city. I then decided to look up the details of the event and realized that it was in my city, I initially felt deflated, and responded to his snapchat that I hope he was having fun at the event.

He then sent a text saying what specific street he was at. Since I missed out on nearly the entire event, inviting myself over at this point would have been awkward, desperate, which makes me felt like I was treated as an afterthought (not to mention, inviting yourself over is pretty rude). I have no idea why he didn't initially communicate with me that they were going to the event (even though I know the other people, i don't have their contact info since I've only met most of them once or twice, and I am fairly shy and quiet when meeting people for the first time.).

Something similar has happened in the past where they texted me that, after they declined my invite to go see my favorite baseball team (4th of july weekend, so I can't really blame them for declining), they snapchatted me the less than two weeks later the morning of (with no previous indication) that they were going to go see that team play and asked if I was going (when I had already made plans) and they asked if i was going to use my parent's (non-existent) baseball season tickets. They must have misunderstood me because I mentioned earlier that my parents had season tickets for the local college football team.

Getting them to make time for me at all this summer was difficult since my best friend was doing an extremely involved medical internship this summer and he was busy working a lot. They were living together nearly an hour away, and since I was invited over once or twice for a birthday or a friend get together (where I met up with people mentioned above although I was quiet since I didn't know anyone), I texted them every other week that I really wanted to meet up with them in the city but due to their work schedules and a vacation they planned, it was difficult but not impossible. We finally settled on a date, and planning what we were doing changed throughout the morning of the meetup (which left me very confused) to the point where I was waiting to see them until the late afternoon, my invite for them to meet up at my house was considered too far out of the way (since they wanted to bike at the trails on the north end of town and I'm at the south end), and I would have to meet them downtown. From what I could tell they both enjoyed their time, even though I had to decline the bike riding they did since i have medical issues. I felt a little frustrated initially, but happy.

My best friend, I think, is a go-between for information and any event planning with the friend group and the fiancee, and I just feel left out and lonely in everyone's lives. I REALLY don't want to sound self centered, but I am just sick of this flakey pattern I have had my entire life and I wish that I could have a cohesive friend group, something that I have NEVER had, and I'm not entirely sure if it's my own personality that conflicts or is theirs. I am lost and feel hopeless that I will never find anyone to be friends with in life (or hell, even get a girlfriend which is a stretch). I've never been strong on social skills and spent a majority of my time in elementary middle and high school very lonely and sad despite surrounding myself with people that said that they liked me.

 My best friend and I met at Uni and I graduated earlier than her, so I really am alone a lot. I was alone in college, too, when I had a narcissistic alcoholic roommate, having fraternity brothers as my next set of roommates that wanted nothing to do with me, and having cold, introverted people that never left their rooms as roommates for my final 2 years of Uni. I never found anyone to talk to except her and her two friends.

With this current group of friends, (excluding my best friend and her fiancee), none of them ever really ask me anything about my life, and I can never get a word in and ask something about theirs because they're always in a large group talking to people they've known for years. I have no friends where I'm currently living, and am living with my parents (which I am currently saving up for an apartment) while I work 8-5. I'm working on my own personal hobbies (photography, orchestra, working out, etc) so I'm trying to really branch out and meet new people, and I don't want any of this repeated in my life.

What can I do?

TL:DR: I am currently having multiple issues with my friend group and it's making me feel absolutely lonely and excluded."
9idym3,0,2018-09-23,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9idym3/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

I've been in college for 3 years and still hate it. I'm only here because it's the only way I'll potentially get a good job as a black man without struggling for years. I'm worried that my girlfriend and I may not work out. I can barely make enough money working to save for emergencies and gifts. I'm failing almost all of my goals to qualify for an internship and finish college asap.

I just feel like everything I'm doing is bound to fall apart and all I can do is fan the flames unintentionally. I'm at the point some days where I just want to drink until I cry and pass out.

 I don't want to ruin my relationship, but I'm worried about possibly cheating or doing anything that might hurt my girlfriend. 

I hate college, but I'm afraid that if I don't at least get an internship, I'll never get a good job,  since I have very little skill and experience in my field (computer science).

I can't stop working, because then I'll be completely reliant on my parents and won't be able to save money or afford food for long.

 I wish I could just sit in a corner alone, but that wouldn't be much different than the last few years of my life. "

9ifun5,7,2018-09-24,“Redneck” Wedding,madeye417,WeddingPhotography,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingPhotography/comments/9ifun5/redneck_wedding/,"Hi all! I’m a photography student in NNY and I just booked my first wedding.  (Background info) This summer I had an internship with a phenomenal wedding photographer based in Philly. I acted as his assistant/second shooter and we shot incredibly expensive and extravagant weddings in the city. The experience I received from that internship was invaluable, and I’m so excited to start my career. 

So here’s my dilemma: 
My hometown is a small, poor area of northern New York and recently people have been reaching out to me for pictures. I’m super worried about this wedding I booked. For lack of a better term, it’s a “redneck” wedding. During my internship I only shot the finest weddings in Philly and now I’m shooting and all outdoor, in a field, drunk as f*ck wedding. The bride sent me wedding picture inspo and it’s all really nice fancy wedding Pinterest pictures. I’m worried she won’t be happy with what I deliver her (I’ve explained that her pictures won’t be exactly like the Pinterest pics).  I’m also worried that these people are going to be too drunk to cooperate. The bride and groom are young and known for going *very* hard at parties. The bride even said it’s gonna be “a super drunk mess”. How do I get good pictures out of a “drunk mess”?? I know I can get silly candids but I’m worried about the more posed pictures- couples pics, family pics, etc...
Lastly, any advice as to how much I should charge? I’m confident in my ability and I have very nice gear that took me forever to save up for. I know most people say you shouldn’t change anything for your first wedding, but I’m a 3rd year photo student and had an incredible internship. I’ll be shooting for 8 hours. These people can’t really afford much so I was thinking $200 or less. I’m thinking of this wedding as a way to build up my portfolio and essentially “come out” in my area as a photographer that can be taken seriously rather than a girl that takes pictures of her friends for Instagram.

Thank you for any advice (I need as much as possible)! "

Young Americans Foundation, TPUSA, Rebel Media, and another think tank that employs many Koch alumni [Speech First](https://www.thenation.com/article/dark-money-behind-campus-speech-wars/), Peterson, Molyneux, etc all promote the mantra of 'liberals' silencing dissent on campuses.

The academics provide the 'intellectual' underpining of the “racial realists” and altright movement, the think tanks work is cited to 'prove' there is a cultural war between 'us' and 'them', the work is used by the likes of Peterson and Molyneux and Kirk and media outlets like Rebel Media to motivate dissafected young people and provide the simple emotionally appealing explanations for what the cause of their problems are, and directing them on to the libertarian politics other elements of the Koch network promote.

And for additional evidence, the high school carriculum they donate when schools run short of funding ([because of Koch backed efforts](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) to cut taxes that fund them): [1](https://www.theroot.com/millions-of-students-are-quietly-being-taught-the-koch-1823742091), [2](https://www.alternet.org/human-rights/what-koch-brothers-want-students-learn-about-slavery).

What this should all point to is that the Kochs are not merely libertarians concerned with government overreach, but rather while we have no direct quotes we can nevertheless surmise from their repeated pattern of associations and funding that the Kochs are racists and seek to create a 'let the chips fall where they may' institutional-bias racism.

And it should also point to a confluence of these academics and media personalities pushing a demographic to an increasingly extreme position that welcomes conflict.

As one of their pet academics once said:

&gt;In support of building their own youth movement, another speaker, the libertarian historian Leonard Liggio, cited the success of the Nazi model. In his paper titled ""National Socialist Political Strategy: Social Change in a Modern Industrial Society with an Authoritarian Tradition,"" Liggio, who was affiliated with the Koch-funded Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) from 1974 to 1998, described the Nazis' successful creation of a youth movement a key to their capture of the state. Like the Nazis, he suggested, libertarians should organise university students to create group identity."

And has [produced](https://pressprogress.ca/rebel-media-produced-anti-muslim-propaganda-with-foreign-group-funded-by-trumps-top-donor/) anti-Muslim attack ads with them featuring far-right personalities.

Rebel Media has been a regular platform for Jordan Peterson [who they have raised money for](https://thevarsity.ca/2017/05/01/jordan-petersons-federal-funding-denied-rebel-media-picks-up-the-tab/), Lauren Southern, Gavin McInnes, and Faith Goldy - who favourably cite Richard Spencer.

As the Garret Jones link demonstrates Stefan Molyneux maintains connections to Jones, the von Mises Institute founded by their former associate Rothbard, Murray who is Koch funded, the League of the South which DeRosa is associated with, and others in the emerging altright, which are all Koch linked either through direct funding or associating with those they fund.

The conventional economists and think tanks they support are combined with the academics that provide an 'intellectual' underpinning to ""racial realism"" and the groups pushing the mantra of 'liberal' take over of college campuses and society being under threat by the likes of Rubin, Peterson, Kirk, Molyneux and outlets like Rebel Media to motivate disaffected young men and provide simple emotionally appealing explanations for what the cause of their problems are, all the while directing them to support campaigns and politicians the Kochs back.

What this should all point to is that the Kochs are not merely classical liberals or libertarians concerned with government overreach, but rather while we have no direct quotes we can nevertheless surmise from their repeated pattern of associations and funding that the Kochs seek to create a 'let the chips fall where they may' institutionally-biased racism concealed within economic jargon.

so in early 2017 I was dating a Chinese lady in the UK and her visa was due to expire in Jan 2018  so we decided to live together in the UK, this didn't work out because my salary wasn't enough to be her sponsor in the UK so we decided to move together to China. I didn't have any savings at the time to be able to support myself in china but she knew a company that could give me a job ""legally"". So i contacted this company &amp; i was told to get an X2 visa and that i would be a paid intern and studying Mandarin and TEFL which all seemed fair enough. We arrived in china and after a few weeks the relationship didn't work out but i decided to stay and earn a little so i wasn't homeless when i returned home as before we left England i gave away everything that i owned and i don't have family that could of sent money for the flight.

As time moved on i met someone else and we moved in together and was fairly happy but then my EX found out and got jealous &amp; reported me for working illegally even though it was her plan and her choice to end the relationship. Anyway my boss had contacts with the PSB and told me to just leave china before they catch up with me and it would all be fine to return after a couple of months.   I wasn't stopped at the border or ever asked any questions by the PSB and left china without a problem. I also have friends who work at the PSB and they have checked the system and cant find any details about me working there or any outstanding warrants. They also checked the immigration and nothing is showing on that system either.

So my boss paid for me to travel to Bangkok and he left me stranded there and didn't really contact me. obviously to save his company! He was clearly employing illegally and it was kinda stupid of me to be so naive!   

anyway I would like to return for a month or so to visit friends &amp; have been told to get an L visa and just avoid that city but I'm worried I'll be wasting my money and the visa will be denied or that my entry will be denied at the border.   I wont be working again in china as i have a great job in the UK now and enough savings to fund the trip.


Any Info would be great! Thanks

I am interested in applying for an internship for a company in Wellington. However, I'm having trouble actually finding out what companies Wellington has that are making innovative electronics or tech (For example a company like WETA workshop, a company that designs solar panels or a company that designs computer electronics could be possible examples). Does anyone more experienced then me know how to find interesting and innovative companies like that? Googling has been a little bit, but not much help. 

I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering, but I am interested in the electronics/software part of things.

Sorry if I am posting in the wrong place. Will delete this post if it is not appropriate.

Thank you!"

**22,295** Negative Creeps for **9 Years**

&amp;nbsp;

In a time when hair metal ruled the airwaves, a small band from Aberdeen, Washington dared to be different. They ushered in the era of Grunge. Music would never be the same after they released 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' off of their second studio album, Nevermind, in September of 1991. Nevermind would go on to be one of the best selling albums in history.

The band has garnered tons of acclaim and is still an incredibly recognizable band. I have been listening to them since my early teen years and no matter where I am if a song comes on I will take a moment to rock out and appreciate the music that they created. Nirvana also had the honor of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, their first year of eligibility.

/r/Nirvana keeps the spirit and fandom going. Featuring AMA from people who have worked with the band. Fan created content, cover songs and art. To see a fans still staying together through the years is amazing.

**Lets hear from the Mods of /r/Nirvana**
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;**1. Whats it like moderating /r/Nirvana?**
&gt;&gt;**/u/kinggutter:** It's an honor to be even the tiniest part of the Nirvana legacy. I get to spend time with fans of a band that changed music history, as well as be in constant contact with the four other moderators who have become like brothers to me.

&gt;&gt;**/u/AcousticTie:** It is a humbling and rewarding experience, you never know what kind of art or demo or collage can surface next.

&gt;&gt;**/u/slavethewhales:** Everyone (for the most part) is super cool to each other and is like a little family with lots of familiar faces. Many regulars with continuing relationships that makes visiting the sub a joy.

**22,295** Negative Creeps for **9 Years**

&amp;nbsp;

In a time when hair metal ruled the airwaves, a small band from Aberdeen, Washington dared to be different. They ushered in the era of Grunge. Music would never be the same after they released 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' off of their second studio album, Nevermind, in September of 1991. Nevermind would go on to be one of the best selling albums in history.

The band has garnered tons of acclaim and is still an incredibly recognizable band. I have been listening to them since my early teen years and no matter where I am if a song comes on I will take a moment to rock out and appreciate the music that they created. Nirvana also had the honor of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, their first year of eligibility.

/r/Nirvana keeps the spirit and fandom going. Featuring AMA from people who have worked with the band. Fan created content, cover songs and art. To see a fans still staying together through the years is amazing.

&gt;&gt;**/u/kinggutter:** It's an honor to be even the tiniest part of the Nirvana legacy. I get to spend time with fans of a band that changed music history, as well as be in constant contact with the four other moderators who have become like brothers to me.

I have been thinking about joining the military as an officer to gain work and leadership experience related to my degree field. My only concern is that while in college, I had used drugs occasionally (Marijuana 3-4 times over a 2 year period, cocaine once at a party). I have no legal problems stemming from my drug use, and I have not used drugs about 6 months now and don't plan on ever using again. I did however reveal my drug use to a potential employer who is a defense contractor, with the job requiring a Top Secret/SCI clearance with Polygraph. I never went through the clearance process, as they only asked me prior to beginning the hiring process to save the time and money of having to pay for the clearance check. The company I applied for said I could reapply in 2 years but I was wondering if it was possible to obtain a waiver from the military to join or if I would have to wait a certain period of time? Any advice or tips would be helpful.

9ijgu0,1,2018-09-24,My (23F) friend (23F) attempted to take my dream job through personal connections,pistaradox,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ijgu0/my_23f_friend_23f_attempted_to_take_my_dream_job/,"My friend and I were in the same university program and we just graduated last month. We met each other 4 years ago when we were still undergraduates, and she was one of my closest friends of 3 years. Last year we were both applying for jobs and hoping to land a position before we graduate. Our career aspirations are very similar due to the degree discipline and common interests, and we were both okay with it and helped each other with applications and interview preparations. 

A few months ago, I was invited to a last stage interview for my top choice position. I was told that this job is highly competitive, and the employer only wanted to hire 2 to 3 people this year. Naturally, I was very excited and told my friend about it. She became very interested and asked a lot of questions regarding the company, the job, the interviewers and how many graduates they are taking. She also expressed regret, as this job slipped under her radar when she was applying. I answered all her questions in hopes that my experience would help her in the future and did not think much of it. 

A week later, she mentioned that she was going to have afternoon tea with her dad’s friend who works at the company I was applying for. I thought it was just a friends and family meet up and told her to have fun. It wasn’t until a month later that I learnt that she started an internship at the same company soon after. One of our mutual friends brought it up when we were hanging out with the group and it was quite obvious that she was hiding the news from me. Later she told me that she got the internship through connections, and that internship eventually led to a full time job offer. Luckily for me, her dad’s friend does not have connections with the team I interviewed with, so she only got a job similar to what I was interviewing for. However, it does not make me feel better, especially because ever since she told me about the internship, she started complaining about it every time I see her. She complained about the pay and her team, and one time she even expressed dissatisfaction regarding the job, because it is not exactly what she wanted to do. (i.e. not the job I was interviewing for) It made my last few months in university very miserable, and the fact that we have a lot of mutual friends made it even worse. At one point I was so stressed out that I had to avoid seeing my entire friend group for a few weeks, which I regret deeply now. 

Fortunately I received the job offer in the end, so in hindsight, this whole episode did not cost me anything career-wise. I also talked to one of our mutual friend, and he thinks that I should try to salvage the friendship, because we had been good friends for so long. He also thinks that although my friend sometimes lack emotional maturity, she is not vile enough to sabotage other people’s career deliberately. 

I am still very upset, and the possibility of having to confront her makes me uncomfortable. I also think that even if she did not do it on purpose(it could be her dad and his friend’s idea), the fact that she completely disregarded my feelings makes it hard for me to trust her as a friend anymore. Right now I am inclined to let the friendship fade and only tell our mutual friends what they had to know, but I am aware that I might regret it later. How should I approach this situation? 

TL;DR: Friend wanted my job and asked her dad’s friend to get her an offer. Do I try to fix the friendship or do I let it fade? "

Definitely a mix of tech and non-tech responses here. Lessons learned, and luckily I have other offers so this won't make me homeless or anything like that. Will ask this question to the tech group tomorrow just for the sake of discussion and so someone else can learn from my mistakes. But I know what I should avoid/do better in my next negotiations! Thank you to the 1 idiot (lol, 250k views, 1k+ comments, and you were the only one), the rest of you were harsh but appropriately and I probably deserved a harsh response to remember. :)

Just trying to learn what mistake I made...

&amp;#x200B;

**location**: Toronto, Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

**me**: 3 years of professional experience (internship, startup). 2 years as Lead Developer at a startup, 1 year of internship. MSc degree on big data related project (source code is public, demo website is also public, pretty innovative approach to handling big data). Nothing too complex, but still cool project where I was doing everything from design to development to server config.

&amp;#x200B;

**company**: startup with 15 employees. No idea about funding status (offer withdrawn rather than give me this answer). Dev team has 5 devs.

&amp;#x200B;

**job**: full stack developer, 3 years of professional experience, MSc degree, experience with front-end, back-end, some Android and iOS experience would be an asset.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer**: here's a summary of what happened in series, emails were professional and courteous (I've worked in a formal office environment).

&amp;#x200B;

* Company: what is your salary expectation?
* Me: I've made 70k before
* Company: when did you get this? we don't see anything on your resume that would pay this (note: lead position is listed there)
* Me: as a lead developer at last company (startup, linked to the company website)
* Company: here's our offer:

&gt;\* base salary: 75k  
&gt;  
&gt;\* hours: min 40 hrs, but variable as needed to accomplish the goals  
&gt;  
&gt;\* benefits: 80% dental and vision, 3 week vacation, 10 sick days  
&gt;  
&gt;\* can't have side business  
&gt;  
&gt;\* 1 month notice required from me  
&gt;  
&gt;\* company can end employment as per province of Ontario's notice period laws  
&gt;  
&gt;\* 3 month probation period

&amp;#x200B;

* Me: Could I get more details on the dental and vision plan, and could we up the number to 90k? (note: I was looking for some movement up)
* Company: 75k is max we can do, at 90k we would look for someone with intermediate level experience. (note: every company I've interviewed with has put me in intermediate category, 2/5 interviews have been for senior positions BASED ON RESUME AFTER I applied for a non-senior position)
* Me: 75k is fine, I'm looking for a long-term opportunity. May I get answers to the following Qs:

&gt;would you agree to flex scheduling or work from home on some days? I am okay with 40+ hrs required, but I would prefer some flexibility here to run occational errands or workout etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Will company provide dev computer, or will I use my own? (note: there was a clause in the contract that was talking about equipment so I asked...)  
&gt;  
&gt;Can I bundle sick days and vacation as 'paid time off'  
&gt;  
&gt;there is a mistake in the contract clause (country should be canada)  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the 1 month resignation notice from me, could you match that from your side? (note: ontario laws require 1 week notice per year of employemnt, so it would have taken 4 years for me to get a 1 month termination notice/pay)  
&gt;  
&gt;Is the company a privately held or seed/A/B/C funded?

* Company: we withdraw, expectations are too far off. best of luck in your search.
* Me: no problem, wish you the best in your search as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**May be I made the following mistakes:**

1. Asking too much $?
2. Mentioning working out?
3. May be sick and vacation bundle is a red flag?
4. Asking for details on the company funding?
5. Asking 6 bullet point questions/consideration simultaneously? Is that bad enough to withdraw offer?

&amp;#x200B;

If someone could help me understand my mistake(s) I would appreciate it. I was seriously considering it as a job I can keep for 4-5 years when the CEO abruptly ended negotiations."

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

9ijjvj,1,2018-09-24,What am i supposed to do?,nowayout111111,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/9ijjvj/what_am_i_supposed_to_do/,"Okay, anyone having a great day just be advised reading this. Made a throwaway account for this, never shared anything this personal with anyone in my life. Anyway, this is a very positive sub, and the last thing i want is to burden someone having a great time with what im about to ask, this post is about mental illness / depression. I hope this is okay with the mods, i just wanted to post here instead of one of the dedicated subreddits because you folks here seem to be largely happy straightforward people, like some of my great friends used to be that arent around in my life anymore and i really want advice from someone like that, someone with a positive outlook and a clear head. 

Im gonna try and keep this short and concise as possible while still retaining necessary context for you to make judgements. Im 20 years old, and ive been doing absolutley nothing with my life for out of sheer fear and shellshock that taking action might fail me again. Got out of our equivalent of a ""high school"" at 15 like everyone (this age is the norm around here) And i didnt have a good time. I wasnt bullied daily like some other kids, but i received my fair share of humiliation, beatings and insults anyway. In addition, ive always been lonely. Never had many people around. I felt like i had to do something at least, so i applied to jobs and did some unpaid internships. But being that weird, skinny child looking guy that never activley engaged with anyone, thrown into an adult work environment i was only ever in for more humiliation. I did four of these, always 1 - 4 weeks at different companies, for entirely different jobs. A bike workshop, IT Company, opticians office... I wasnt really useful for anything other than basic simple tasks since i was so ridiculously quiet, always in fear of anything and everything that i never took any action and never expressed or revealed things of myself so people just didnt feel like they could trust me.

2 years ago, i completed my 9 months of national civil service as a basic life support medic. Of course, i fucked that up too. But since i didnt really have any vision of my life i had to make the choice between 6 months in the military for basic training and join the militia for work afterwards, or 9 months of civil service at an certified employer and walk out with a useful BLS Medic certification and maybe start a regular adult life with that in my hands. I really liked the job, in practice it was the first that i felt i could really see myself doing every day. But i was still the same person, someone that didnt trust himself and in effect, someone my partners and colleagues could not trust in good conscience. I fucked up my exam, and didnt get the certification so that was one more life oppurtunity consumed by my fear. More daily humiliation on the job and social exclusion for 9 more months, with the added stress of someones health being on the line. Yeah, this was the worst time of my life and what made me realize im sick and not capable of compeeding in any environment. Ever since finishing that, ive been doing nothing but smoking weed at home, only going out to get more every couple of days. I had eating disorders before but now thats escalated beyond my control too, to consider my diet unhealthy would be quite the understatement (big part of my lack of energy too). I dont have any drive. I want to do something, but i cant bring myself to because i really really dont want or can even take any more failure and humiliation. 

I tried several times to call a psychiatrist, but i always hung up before the first ring. Having a mental illness of any kind on my record would cause the military, the last door in my life thats left open to me close for good. I didnt want to do army service at age 18, because i didnt feel like i was physically or mentall in shape for something as highly demanding as that.

So my question for you guys is, what would someone with a clear head do in my situation?

9ijtd3,149,2018-09-24,Being watched getting banged,24justfine,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/9ijtd3/being_watched_getting_banged/,"I went away for an internship for college which was super exciting because it would make the first time I would be alone and have my own place since I would always commute to school. I went to a new city hours away and was nervous how I would do alone. The first few weeks went by smooth. The place I was in was sort of like a dorm but more spacious. I was in a hallway with rooms next to each other. My room was the last in the hallway across from a empty room. Being a perv I would sometimes walk slowly to my room to hear if anyone was fucking or watching porn, but the building was often quiet. 

I do like to hook up and into one night stands but not really into Grindr or anything as I am super careful with who I sleep with. I'm an average looking guy kind of on the cute side. So I don't have trouble finding men. But I found no luck sleeping with any guys, loved getting to jerk off anytime I wanted to though. 

The place I was at was quiet and I rarely saw the people who lived in the same hallway as me. One day I was just in pjs looking like a hot mess and decided to chill out in the lounge at the end of the hall. When comes in from the elevator the most attractive looking guy. Very athletic and nice bubble butt and overall charming dude. He stopped and introduced himself to me and found out he was moving to the empty room across from me. I'm stuttering the whole time and drooling from the inside, but I helped the guy move in and totally felt embarrassed that I look like a mess. Hes the same age as me and straight and also extremely religious. So I decided not to do anything stupid and be friends. 

One night I went to the gay bar and brought a man back to my place and we went at it. I had those blue mattresses from the 90s that squeaked so when he was fucking me from behind it was no secret to anyone in that whole hallway that I was having sex. The guy from across the hall knocks on my door while I'm going down on this guy. I get up and just put my underwear on, hard on and all and opened the door. He asks if I had extra change for the laundry and I'm like ""oh yeah"" and I get it for him. I come back and said "" here you go, I have a whole jar so come and ask anytime."" and he smiles and said thanks. So horned up about the whole situation when I went back to having sex, I imagine it was me and him fucking. 

Days go by and I randomly knock on his door at night for food and he opens the door without a shirt and I'm thinking ""Jesus you sure are testing me tonight."" Dude invites me and literally makes me food. We talk and we get into a conversation about sex as he mentions he heard me moaning. He tells me he likes the idea of sitting and watching people have sex. Heart instantly starts racing as I'm staring at his nipples watching them get hard. I try jokingly to say ""you should of came in and watched me."" He smirks and says ""well lemme give you my number then."" I start dying on the inside of excitement. I told him why wait when I can get someone now. And I texted the man from the pervious week if he was into it, which he was. Wait 20 mins for the guy to show up and we're standing outside my door. He sees the guy and instantly says ""Wait you're gay.."" and I said ""Oh shit, sorry thought you knew."" he hesitantly said its fine. We all go into my room and it felt awkward at first but he pulled up a chair and watched us the whole time. He told us to pretend he wasn't there which was hard. But certain times I would look at him. Such as when I unbuttoned the guys jeans to pull out his hard cock and went down on him to the time when the guy was laying down and I slide his cock in me and starting flopping my ass up and down on it. He eventually pulled down his shorts and underwear and started jerking. When it was time for us to cum, he came too and he came all over my floor. 

After, the guy leaves my neighbor tells hes not gay, but he didn't want to leave after telling me he would watched. But he had a good time, and said thanks."" I told him that was really nice and that I owe him for staying. 

We had many more weeks together ahead of us.

9ik3f5,6,2018-09-24,[Advice] I need help interpreting some red flags at my company.,ertgbnm,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/9ik3f5/advice_i_need_help_interpreting_some_red_flags_at/,"I just started as a part time intern at the company I intend to work at once I graduate in December. The company is small (~10 people) and young (~8 years old), which are both aspect I like. However, now that I have started I noticed some weird things. The HR / Office Admin quit since starting. The team of 2 I work with were all hired this year and it seems they replaced a previous group that from what I can tell in our documents and LinkedIn only worked here for about a year. The two from the infrastructure side of the office also started this year. Apart from the owner and his wife, the oldest employee has worked here 4 years. From zoominfo, it seems that there have been 20 employees that have worked here in the last 8 years. That mean there has been a very high turn over rate, especially because it was a lone practice for a few years before the owner grew it enough to demand support engineers. These are definitely red flags, but from my two weeks of experience I have not seen any others. My coworkers are great, expectations feel about right, work load is manageable. The company appears to be doing really well for such a young company in an established field. To those of you with more experience, what do you think explains the turn over rate? Is there a likely cause that I can look for? Are these really red flags I should worry about? I am not too worried considering how much I have enjoyed the rest of my time here, but if something is clearly amiss I would love to know as soon as possible.

So there is this girl (F 21) who I (M 22) met through my friends almost two years ago. We just started off as friends because we were both dating someone when we met. We (my friends, her, and I) still hung out semi-regularly, but obviously I didn't think much of it. Fast forward about a year (2017) and I realize she broke up with her boyfriend. Didn't think much of it, then a couple months later my girlfriend and I broke up. Honestly didn't think much of it, my crush is so beautiful I just assumed she was out of my league and that I had no chance.

We then all hung out for the first time in a long time (last October) at a friend's place, it was a casual night of drinking and playing games, etc. I was standing next to her and cracking some jokes because that's just my sense of humor, and I notice her laughing a lot and touching my arm flirtatiously. I noticed a little but didn't try to look too much into it. Fast forward a month and my friends, her, and I all go see Thor: Ragnarok in theaters. We go get something to eat first and I notice she's doing the same thing as what she did at the party. Even better, after we eat we go to the movies and while waiting in line she says she's tired and rests her head on my shoulder. I don't really react much physically, but inside I'm kinda losing it (is she really doing this? this is awesome!) and then she even sits next to me in the theater and leans on her arm really close to me. Also, in between actually seeing each other in person, we talk fairly regularly in between. The next day after the movies, I text her and ask if she wanted to go on a date (noticed that probably was a mistake, should've just asked to hangout) and she declined but her reason was because she was still caught up on her ex a little, which makes sense because they dated for more than 3 years. I was a little bummed but was ultimately fine because I was kinda in the same boat from my ex.

Fast forward to winter break and I'm about to head home from school for Christmas and I ask her if she wants to hangout over break. She responded really excitedly and we decided to meet up and go bowling. The day comes, and we go bowling and it was a blast, she was dressed really nice and we were very flirty towards each other. I ask her out on a second date and she gladly accepts. We end up going back to my place and watch a movie and we ended up cuddling and holding hands. I am absolutely on cloud 9 because of this, I never thought she'd like me like this. The movie ends and I walk her to her car, we hug and I go in to kiss her. We kiss and she reacts all giggly and giddy, I remember her saying ""I guess I'll see you later then"" with a big smile on her face. I'm so happy because of this.

A couple weeks go by and we're back at school now. She comes over to hangout with all of us and I go to the front door of my apartment building to let her in. While walking up the stairs she says she had a great time bowling, but she just wants to work on herself and doesn't really want to date right now. She also says that she just isn't in the right place to date. I totally understand what she says (because of the ex boyfriend thing) and that she is probably still a little caught on him. That night was awful for me, it's like when you almost have something so awesome and it just barely slips out of your hands. I felt heartbroken, but I couldn't complain because I understood her reason. Plus she is a super nice girl and is so caring that I don't think she'd lie about that.

The next semester of school all my friends, her, and I hang out more but I obviously have backed off to give her the space she needs to work on herself (basically I'm just being a friend to her and not flirting at all). I still would catch glances from her sometimes and she would just act a little different towards me (in a good way). Again that's just what I'm getting from her, could I be wrong about my assumptions? Sure, but I just trusted my gut.

Anyways, over the summer (this past summer) we all still hangout and she seems less flirty (more off and on, sometimes when she would hangout with us she would seem more smiley towards me, other times it's more just like we're friends). Anyways, I just couldn't tell if she still liked me or not. I still can't tell. We would talk fairly often like I said, but I myself stopped from talking her as often because I just assumed she didn't like me like that anymore, but like I said, I don't know.

I graduated back in June and moved back home this past August, and she's still in school. She hasn't dated anyone (that I know of) since our little ""thing"" or whatever you'd call it, so I don't believe she lied about her reason to not continue to date. I'm moving this weekend about 3 hours away from home and 2 hours away from where she is at school because of an internship I received. I'm debating about messaging and asking her if she still has feelings for me, but I don't know what to do.

Should I just get over myself and move on? Should I see if she still feels the same way about me? Should I just be friends with her? I still like her so much and I have never crushed on a girl this hard, I'm just afraid she doesn't feel the same way, but I have no way of figuring this out. Also, if there's any more details that I possibly could have left out, please ask. Any support/opinions will help.

EDIT: included the ages of her and I

I feel like organizing an AMA is difficult because you have to reach out and coordinate everything for every single AMA. Making it into a reoccurring event would only require initial effort setting it up, but after that it won't be much more work other than just starting a thread every time it's time for one.

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

Morning - starting at internship, very interesting. Not used to this freedom.

Evening - meeting with the party commission. The start of the meeting went shaky, people came late, and no big steps were made. Later the meeting took a positive turn and everybody chipped in. I felt the energy in myself, and hoped other would pick on it. Was a real good meeting. Good ideas. Huge.

EMBITTERED OR JUST NOT INTERESTED
-
Girls, my biggest weakness. Always fall in love too fast. But lately I've been having the opposite, not interested at all. I'm not sure why the sudden change. Perhaps it's because of previous attempts and my brain finally realising it isn't worth the energy.

Both my housemates fell in love with the same girl. And another dude in the friends group as well. Usually I would be part of this group. But I am happy I'm not. Feels like I've got a better grip on my emotions.






22 september 2018

Saturday - making music with Jisse our new song is come as you are of nirvana and afraid of heights of Billy talent.

Had some beers in the evening with Jop and Irwin they wanted to go out and I refused because I was tired and honestly just wanted to play fallout 2, which I finished so now I don't really have much to do.

Sunday - had some beers in the evening with Ilse.

She is a girl I just don't understand, well she is easy to understand on the surface, bit shy but happy. But what does she really think? Well maybe it could be that I am a retard and don't know how to read such things. But I know I feel this way for a reason, I've evidence build up.

CASE A: THE AMERICAN MESSAGE
Back when I was on the continent America we messaged eachother a lot, even a bit more spicy things. To clarify with spicy I actually mean quite bland spicyness, but for me spicy nonetheless. Things like sharing a bed because she is scared. Or how she missed me and how we shared pictures of our vacation.

CASE B: GETTING MARRIED
OK, easy one to crack this one. She mentioned how we should get married when both of us don't have anybody when we get 30 years old. Yeah, I know this is kinda like in how I've met your mother but hopefully this gets a better finale.

CASE C: SAY WHAT YOU MEAN, DONT JUST COME KNOCKING
At our latest party she was also there. I invited her to come and eat with us. When we went to the store she stayed with the others. At the party she spend most of her time with the others. I stayed in my room with my friends while the others were partying in the living room. While I was in my room she entered multiple times, just to say: ""wow, the party is so fun it is so crazy, you should see it.""
Ok, thanks for the info I am enjoying myself over here. Or did you mean you wanted that I come and join you?

CASE D: THE CASE OF BEER
Every evening we spent drinking she has a tendency to spent most of her times with the others but suddenly visit me, telling me how greats it is with the others and leaves. In the club when she gets disturbed she comes to me.

When I went for beers with her I leaned against her with my head while we watched TV. Eventually I took her hand and put it over me (I like being the small spoon). I said: ""this is much more comfortable"". While she nervously replied: ""uhh, ok""

CONCLUSION: no 
She doesn't say what she want, that is clear. But maybe I should say what I want. But my biggest fear is that I like her, not exactly because I like her but because I want to be liked. Getting a girlfriend so you can have that title.

I like what she is, fun, driven. I dislike her unwillingness to tell what she really wants, her uncertainty.

I've written about her quite often, but now I feel like I've reached a point, continue or cancel her. Be more or be nothing. And for my own sanity I've chosen to be nothing. Case closed."
9ilygr,24,2018-09-24,[NA] September 17-23 Week Recap,Tomahawkeye12,boxoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/9ilygr/na_september_1723_week_recap/,"Happy Monday everyone! This is a continuation of my dailies posts that recap and analyze box office for Mondays-Thursdays. I’m tracking several comps for films in the top 5 (and more), and I want to provide full-week recaps and analysis of weekend grosses. These will be posted on Mondays after weekend actuals come in, and in preparation for the regular series posts on Tuesday-Friday. **To be clear, these recaps are for Monday-Sunday gross, not for a Friday-Thursday box office week.** Additionally, to stay focused, these updates will look solely at the films I’ve been running comps on. There’s enough general discussion about weekend results without me throwing out random thoughts. Let’s get started. Today, I’ll provide full-week updates on *The Predator*, *A Simple Favor*, *The Nun*, *Crazy Rich Asians*, and *Mission: Impossible – Fallout*. Tomorrow, I’ll roll out a few comps for *The House With a Clock in its Walls*. 

- *The Predator* had a bad week and a significant 2nd weekend drop, but it held relatively well over the course of the weekend itself, with a 61% jump on Saturday and only a 38% decline on Sunday. Due to this, the weekend turned out stronger than the weekdays for 2 of our 3 comps. For the full week, it ran at 105% of *Predators*, 77% of *Alien: Covenant*, and 59% of *Kingsman 2*. Of those comps, it’s tracking very closely to *Predators*, which would give us a final projected gross of **$53m**.

- *A Simple Favor* had an exceptional week, and I’m rolling out these comps for the first time. The film ran at 87% of *The Intern*, 121% of *I Feel Pretty*, and 113% of *Acrimony*. These comps were selected due to either similar target audiences or release schedules. However, these all had wildly disparate trajectories, with projected total grosses ranging from $45-67m at this point. A midpoint of **$55m** seems like a decent projection, but the film hasn’t exactly been predictable so far.

- *The Nun* had bad weekdays but a good weekend. For the full week, it ran at 65% of *The Conjuring*, 98% of *Conjuring 2*, 125% of *Annabelle*, and 110% of *Annabelle: Creation*. After running significantly behind *Conjuring 2* and *Annabelle: Creation* for the weekdays, *The Nun* had a shocking comeback with a strong weekend. I hate this movie with a fiery passion, so it hurts me to report this, but I must attempt to analyze without bias. Before the weekend, I thought $110-115m was a realistic ending point. After the weekend, I’m revising that to a **$115-120m** projection, with a shot at $125m.

- *Crazy Rich Asians* is running remarkably close to *The Help* since the Labor Day boost in 2011. For the full week, it ran at 96% of *The Help*, driven by a strong Tuesday and offset by a weak Thursday. My current projected final for *Crazy Rich Asians* is **$180m** based on the trajectory of *The Help*.

- *Mission: Impossible – Fallout* did exactly what it needed over the weekend. I’ve been saying for a couple weeks now that *Fallout* can make it to $220m if it has even slightly better weekend holds over these 2 crucial weekends. *Rogue Nation* dropped by 60% on this past weekend in its run; *Fallout* dropped by less than 50%. For the entire week, *Fallout* ran at 115% of *Rogue Nation*, better than each of the prior 2 weeks. The current projected gross from *Rogue Nation’s* trajectory is $219.9m, and with *Fallout* holding on to more screens, I now feel confident that **$220m** will happen.

Please let me know what you think about this! If people enjoy it as a continuation of the dailies posts, I’ll keep it up. This gives me a good chance to develop a consolidated narrative of the box office for these films, rather than comments each individual day. It also lets me comment on weekend results early, rather than waiting until Tuesday to chat again."

I was only 16 when all this happened and ever since then I developed anger issues. My brother even asked my family to meet his psychologist but my mom straight up said no in the harshest way possible but me, my dad and my oldest sister went with him but neither of them went with an open mind.. My dad LITERALLY told the psychologist that depression isnt that big of a thing and that she has no idea what shes talking about. 
My sisters r just as annoying. They all are fuckin brainwashed. Always like ""Ooh look how hes hurting our mom and dad!"" Basically always siding with them. My brother literally had to leave the country cos they were making his life a living hell and yet if u talk to them they will be like ""other parents would have hit their kids or kept them locked up in homes but we didnt see how good we are and this is what we get""
I also fuckin hate how my mom uses everything to say ""See how good parents are they do so much for their kids"".. cant watch any movie with her anymore cos i know this shit will come up and it pisses me off sooo fuckin much. Im gay and I always feel upset about the fact that I will have to walk down the same road as my brother some day. 
Arguing with my family is pointless cos everyone fuckin gangs up on me and start sobbing and saying im being rude. No way will they ever admit their faults. There are so many hypocrisy stories of my family... My mom turns two of my aunts against each other by telling bad things abt them, has dones lots of other stuff that I cant really list out here.. and my sisters are her pets who r willing to defend her no matter what and if I even raise my voice a little at anyone, my sisters will come screaming at me telling me to stop being disrespectful. 
I am in a different country for university now and my mom calls me every fuckin day cos she is concerned.. Its so fuckin annoying and if i dont reply she makes a big deal out of it and wont shut the fuck up abt it and even if i tell her to stop fuckin calling me everyday she is gonna cry and my sisters r gonna bombard me with messages on whatsapp. 
Now, I feel like the bad person whenever they get hurt by me... Thing is despite all of that, my family still has done lots for me.. I barely ever had to ask my mom for money cos she always gave me lots when i was going out with friends even tho she wouldnt have enough herself, my sister once stayed up all night fixing my CV while I was in my room watching friends, she drives me around whenever she can and if I need anything she doesnt let me pay for it and tells me I can pay when i get a job. Its hard to find internships in my country and I got so fed up with everything a couple of months ago that I just gave up on everything but my sister still kept sending me different hiring pages to apply to and researching on what I can do to improve my profile and get a good job with good salary... and when I was in high school I cant begin to explain the amount of things my mom used to do for me.. From talking to teachers who were giving me hard time to letting me skip school and hiding my uniform so that my dad doesnt see and yell at me... If I couldnt do some of my homework or felt too tired to, she would literally do it for me and im not saying thats a good thing but just showing how much she loves me.
Because of all of this, I cant hate my family and feel like leaving them is the not the right thing to do.. Which is why I find myself in the position im in now, anger towards my family. I think its because I look at the shitty things they do to my bro and will do to me also but I still cant hate them even tho I curse them in my mind all the time. Whenever they are upset or hurt or angry cos of me I always feel like a shitty person filled with guilt.. and that just makes me more angry. I think I have high anxiety cos of my family as I find myself always uneasy.. Like I cant enjoy myself at all cos something in my life isnt alright and so I dont deserve to relax.. idk what to do

I tried multiple websites to look Computer Science internships and it seems like there isn't much offered here in Edinburgh. (Ex: [https://www.indeed.co.uk/jobs?q=Computer+Science+Internship&amp;l=EH16+5AY](https://www.indeed.co.uk/jobs?q=Computer+Science+Internship&amp;l=EH16+5AY)). I tried other websites, such as GlassDoor, but the amount of listings for CS internships was like in the single digits. The career website linked to my school (Studying abroad at University of Edinburgh for 1year) keeps bugging out so I can't use it.

   

So, I'm wondering if you know any websites or good resources to find a local internship here.

   

Thanks!

A little bio + resume: 3rd year University of California, Irvine computer science student currently studying abroad at UoE in the informatics department for one year. Have attended multiple hackathons, most comfortabl with Python, and just looking to get experience in the real world.  



If you have an internship available, I can give you CV by PM.

TLDR can a voc rehab counselor help you with getting a government internship? or even a regular one for that matter.  And should I even bother trying to bug them for more information?

9in2lx,32,2018-09-24,The Disappearance of Men in Higher Education,TziganFaerie,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9in2lx/the_disappearance_of_men_in_higher_education/," **Introduction**

The past decade has seen a reduction in enrollment and graduation rates in the male population. Based on data provided by the National Center for Education Statistics, only 37.9 percent of enrollees were female in 1960. Female enrollment then began to rise and eventually surpassed male enrollment permanently in the 1990s. The cause of the male decline in higher education settings is created by two major factors. First, changing times have caused the demand for men to be the breadwinners in the family to decline. Second, males rarely see an advantage related to the economic outcome of obtaining a degree due to the rising costs of education.

**Changing Times**

Men don’t have the same drive to attend a college that they had thirty years ago. Once upon a time a man was the one who was educated, worked at a large company and supported the family. Modernized times introduced two-income households and women began climbing corporate ladders ahead of their husbands. As a result, women and men began to lose the opinion that a man’s college education was a necessity for the sake of their family’s future as they once did. If a man has a steady job and brings home a paycheck, a two-income household will bring home as much as a single degree holder in an advanced career will.

It takes much longer to land an advanced job with high pay than it used to be. Graduates were typically from high-class families with heirs who followed in family professions. College graduates would be welcomed to their family practices or under internships with family friends. Low to middle-class families typically don’t have those notable connections. Once a degree has been obtained by the average graduate, they must start at the bottom of a very large ladder making approximately $25,000 a year and may never make more than the average annual salary of the holder of a bachelor’s degree, $50,000 a year, in their lifetime.

**Rising Costs of Education**

The second event which has caused the decline of men in college is the cost of education. There are more scholarships and grant opportunities for women than there are for men. In addition, the cost of college, which averages $40,000, causes the much more frugal nature of man to come into play. Men are typically much more watchful than women with money and spending habits. If a person will never make more than $50,000 a year, again this is the average income of a person who holds a bachelor’s degree, is a $40,000 degree worth the time, effort and cost? Men are also prone to a desire for instant gratification. The time and money put into the education process take away from the time and money of the now, thus causing a loss of the instantaneous results.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the changing social climates and the cost-benefit analysis of education plays an important role in the disappearance of men from college. The lack of men in college does not necessarily signify a socio-economic crash, but perhaps shows us how the roles in our culture have changed. While social orders continue to change and tuition costs continue to rise with little increase in salaries, men can be hypothesized to have their current population decline further over the next several decades.

Dr. Christian Troy and Dr. Sean McNamara had found themselves in Princeton, New Jersey at Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. Really, it had been neither's first choice, but with Christian's dire cancer diagnosis, he had been grasping at straws and wanting to get more opinions other than his own oncologist and none came more recommended than Dr. James Wilson. 

Things with Sean had been a little rocky at best lately, but Christian was scared and according to his own doctor, he was dying. This was a last resort, but he was already having his doubts. 

""Sean, I think this may have been a mistake,"" Christian commented as they were seated in Wilson's office, waiting on him to get there. 

""We haven't even met him yet,"" Sean said, rolling his eyes. 

""It's a *teaching* hospital,"" Christian said with a hint of disdain in his voice. 

""What's wrong with it being a teaching hospital?"" Sean asked him as Christian squirmed a little in the seat. ""We did rotations at a teaching hospital when we were in med school,"" He reminded him. 

""And that means we know how much these kids screw up,"" Christian said with a frown. ""Interns are great for a quickie in the supply closet, but I don't want a few of them going over my case."" 

""They might find something that someone else has missed. Besides, I don't think Dr. Wilson has anyone working with him,"" Sean said just as the door opened. 

""Wilson, where are--"" House paused, seeing the pair seated across an empty desk. ""Where's Wilson?"" 

""That's what we'd like to know. Who the hell are you?"" Christian asked, a little perturbed at having to wait so long. He looked over the scruffy looking man with the cane, who was currently popping a couple of pills into his mouth. Christian frowned at the display. ""The resident junkie here?"" 

House smiled. ""Oh, you got me,"" He said sarcastically as he walked further into the room and walked behind Wilson's desk to rifle through it. 

""Are you... You're not Dr. Wilson, are you?"" Sean hesitantly asked. 

""No, but he owes me twenty bucks..."" House lied, continuing to look through drawers. 

""This is ridiculous,"" Christian said, standing up. ""I'm going to go call security."" 

""Sit down, Gucci Pants,"" House said to him, rolling his eyes. ""I'm Dr. Gregory House,"" He introduced. ""Security already knows me."" 

""Wait, did you say *House*? As in *the House*?"" Sean asked, completely starstruck, much to his partner's confusion. ""Christian, don't tell me you've never heard of him. His cases are always featured in all the journals,"" He mentioned. ""I'm Dr. Sean McNamara and this is my partner, Dr. Christian Troy,"" He introduced, holding out his hand for House to shake. When it wasn't reciprocated, he awkwardly pulled his hand back. 

""Are you two here for a consult with Wilson? I wouldn't have pegged you for oncologists... Maybe you,"" He indicated Sean. ""But not him,"" He said, giving a glance to Christian. 

""We're plastic surgeons,"" Christian informed. ""And we're leaving,"" He said, heading towards the door. 

""If you leave now, you'll have to get a consult with another oncologist and that one may not catch the mistake on your workup, Gucci Pants,"" House called out to him. 

""How did you know we weren't here on behalf of a patient?"" Christian questioned. 

""Please. That's why they pay me the big bucks. Also you've got that whole fifty yard stare that all desperate chemo patients have about them... or I might have just seen your file here on Wilson's desk,"" House stated. 

Christian was outraged. ""You know what, I don't give a shit who you say you are. I'm still going to get security. And who just leaves their patient files out and open like that--"" 

""Not Wilson,"" House realized. ""He would have put this away. He wouldn't have just left it open on his desk if he was going away for any amount of time or he would have locked the door behind him when he left."" He reached for a nearby phone on Wilson's desk to page him. 

Suddenly, in the corner of the room, there was a blue box materializing and House nearly dropped the phone. Sean stood up and backed towards Christian, who was frozen in the doorway, still shocked at what they were seeing. There was a creek of a door and Wilson stepped out of the blue police box. 

""House, you're never going to believe where I've been,"" Wilson said, looking a little bewildered. 

A grey haired man wearing sunglasses and with a guitar strapped to his back stepped out of the box. 

""Hello. I'm the Doctor,"" He introduced. 

House looked over, appraising the man and the situation at hand. ""*Bitchin*,"" He said with a grin.

9inktv,1,2018-09-24,I'm having suicide thoughts almost everyday since I've started working on my first job.,d0rts,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9inktv/im_having_suicide_thoughts_almost_everyday_since/,"I'm a Graphic Design student (22M) and last year I got a scholarship so I could go study Fine Arts abroad for one year. I came home in the end of June of this year and I was excited to start working so I could get some money to try and get a masters degree abroad. 

I have BPD and struggle with depression since I was 11 and  I usually have really intense ups and downs, but I've kind of learned how to manage the downs after I tried to kill myself three times in 2016. During my exchange program I had a depressive episode but I managed to be productive and eventually I started to feel better again.

Anyway, after I got a job (an internship at an advertisement company) I started to have intrusive thoughts, mostly because I'm working on a field that I don't really love and I started to feel that I was wasting my time. From that thought alone, other thoughts came along such as:
""You will never be able to be good at something you love because you're useless""
And similar stuff.
The other problem from working is that I have zero to little contact with my friends since I'm studying from 8h-13h and working from 14h-19h from Monday to Friday.  Before going to my exchange program I actually had some friends in my class, but I had to go back an year because I wasn't studying Graphic Design abroad.
During the weekends my friends rarely go out with me.

So I started working on some healthy coping mechanisms, I'm doing a lot of exercise and eating well, and I'm trying to stay active all the time and doing art which is something that I love.

But by the end of the day the suicide thoughts never go away, and even though I try to exhaust myself so I don't think about the many ways I cam kill myself and how everyone that I love don't give a shit about me and that i'm gonna feel alone and empty forever, nothing seems to work.

I try to think rationally, because I know that all my intrusive thoughts are false, but it is SO HARD.  I also go to therapy every week and I'm on medication, but still, it doesn't really help that much. 

And it makes me scared, because I do have reasons to live, I have goals and I wanna see myself grow into the artist I want to be, but the suicide thoughts NEVER go away and I don't want to live like this forever.

Also, it's not like I have like REAL problems, feeling suicidal just makes me feel more of a loser and a weak person that only knows how to deal with life by thinking about ending it... like everyone is alone and have shitty jobs.

9inol4,6,2018-09-24,Do you/Should you show your current company the offer letter you received from another company?,sinyanmei92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9inol4/do_youshould_you_show_your_current_company_the/,"I received an offer letter from company B, and I just briefly told my boss about it today. 

The current company I’m working at is in PA while I’m living in NJ, so it would be 4 hours commuting back &amp; forth, maybe more due to the traffic. Company B is only 30mins drive from my place.

The problem is, I was just re-hired a few days ago, 5 days to be exact. (I had a problem with my working Visa so I had to stop working for a month but ended up resolving everything early and got re-hired 1 month after) 

While I do appreciate my boss for giving me a chance to stay, my current contract is just a continuance contract for 1 year, with 401k 3% match and $1500 bonus I would receive by 01/11/19. When I was rehired I would want to be a full time employee but it wasn’t the case.


My boss told me that she would talk to me about it within a few days to see how it goes. If it’s just because the company is too far, or if the benefits package the new place offer. I believe she wanna give me a counter offer, but she still needs to talk to the director &amp; HR about it.

Anyways, today when I came home and check my email, the HR from company B told me that the offer was rescinded because they found found a better candidate.

My question is:

1, If company A asks, do I need to show the offer from company B? 

2, I know I’m being underpaid at the current company ( $19/h, the same amount of money they pay for their interns). My annual income is 40560 + 1500 bonus.
My paycheck after tax, 6% 401k and medical insurance would be around $2200/month.

The other company offerred me 50k with no benefits. How should I approach it with my boss? I graduated last year so this job is actually my first job out of college. I know that I’m just a contract employee and doesn’t have much power to negotiate but I’ve been working here for 7 months and I did prove that I’m a good asset of the company. That’s why they really helped me a lot by providing me paperworks so I could expedite my work permit that fast. 

I do really appreciate what they do for me and I love everyone in my team. On the other hands, I still wish that I would be paid more. 

Now I’m completely lost, I’m not sure how to handle this kind of situation.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you all!"

I feel like organizing an AMA is difficult because you have to reach out and coordinate everything for every single AMA. Making it into a reoccurring event would only require initial effort setting it up, but after that it won't be much more work other than just starting a thread every time it's time for one.

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

*A Day in the Life is a series of short stories documenting a single day in the lives of people from all over Fretton. These people can be any race, class, age, or sex, hold any profession, be from anywhere in the country. This series is intended to help Frettonites gain a broader worldview on the way their fellow citizens live and survive.*

Ted Johnson awoke to the feeling of a hand massaging his cock. He opened his eyes and stared at his wife, Sandy, who had obviously just woken up as well. At 41, she was starting to enter middle age, and he could see a few wrinkles in her face, but she was still the most beautiful woman in Fretton to him. He leaned over lightly and kissed her. She returned, and wrapped her arms around him. The handjob continued, and Ted broke the kiss to see who was jacking him off. A curvy figure with long, wavy brown hair was sitting at the foot of the bed. His eldest daughter, Jennifer, smiled at him. He saw that her other hand was busy between his wife’s legs. 

“Good morning, sweetheart,” he said, still slightly groggy. “What’s this for?”

“Oh, nothing,” she replied, then leaned down to suck him off. He wasn’t sure he believed her, but decided that he might as well enjoy her ministrations. For an eighteen-year-old, she was a very skilled cocksucker, and it only took a few minutes for him to unload. She swallowed it all down without flinching, then waved goodbye. As she walked away, he saw her suck her mother’s juices off her other hand. 

Ted and Sandy kissed again, then rolled out of bed and made their way to the bathroom. They washed each other off in the shower, and played a little, though years of marriage had revealed shower sex to be less exciting than could be hoped for. Ted still made sure to get an eyeful every time he saw her naked, though – he loved her long, sandy hair, her big breasts, her wide hips, and everything about her. He dressed himself in typical office wear, slacks and a button-down with a tie, while his wife dressed in slightly more alluring attire. She wore very high heels and a black dress with a plunging neckline and a pencil skirt barely long enough to cover her ass. He often joked that she looked like she was going to the club instead of to work, but she said that it helped drive sales when the client wanted to fuck you. Ted combed his short black hair and left while Sandy was still working on her makeup. 

He smelled breakfast cooking in the kitchen and assumed that Jennifer was in there, then moved on to make sure the rest of his progeny were up and about. He knocked on his son Braden’s door, but the room was empty. Of course, nowadays Braden typically spent the nights in his sisters’ bedrooms, so that was no guarantee that he was awake. Sure enough, when he peeked into the next door over, he saw Braden curled around Lindsay. The two were very close in age, he now 16 and she 15, and they had been inseparable since childhood. He shook them both awake, leaning down to smooch Lindsay’s cheek, then left the room. He was about to knock on the last door, but it was already open, and Maddie, his youngest at 12, was wandering to the bathroom. She was wearing a cute baby blue nightshirt just short enough that he could still see her pussy. He leaned down for a quick kiss on the lips. 

“Morning, pumpkin,” he said. She mumbled something resembling “morning” in response and kept walking. Ted also turned around and made his way to the kitchen. There, he saw Jennifer chowing down on a pile of eggs, toast, and bacon. He honestly didn’t know how she maintained her figure, eating as much as she did. He could only guess that all the weight went to her tits, which were even bigger than her mother’s. She looked a lot like Sandy at that age, in fact, though her hair was more of a chocolate color. She had the same body and the same beautiful face that had all the boys at school lining up to fuck her. He sat down at the table and Johanna brought him a slice of toast and a cup of coffee. 

Johanna was the family’s yellow-ribbon slave. Ted had bought her ten years ago, when Lindsay had started school and Sandy had wanted to go back to work. They had thought that a sixteen-year-old could handle baby Maddie while the adults were away, and even at that age she was a sexy little thing. Now 26, Johanna had just gotten sexier. She was much thinner than Sandy or Jennifer, and had bigger tits than Lindsay or Maddie, and a bigger butt than any of them. She also had golden blonde hair and stunning blue eyes. She wasn’t nearly as beautiful as Sandy, of course, but Ted still loved to fuck her. Unlike many owners, the Johnsons let Johanna wear something besides her yellow collar, and today she was resplendent in a lacy red shelf bra and garter belt, which showed off her features without hiding anything. Ted slapped her on the ass as she left. “Morning, Johanna!”

“Good morning, Mr. Johnson,” she replied, going back to fry more bacon. Ted sipped his coffee and crunched his toast. 

“So, Dad,” said Jennifer, sliding towards him. She was wearing a green dress with a low, square neckline and a long skirt that went almost to her knees. She had spread her legs slightly, and he could see her lack of panties. *Here it comes,* he thought. 

“I was wondering if I could borrow the car tonight. Lacey’s hosting a party.”

“Who all is going to be there?”

“Just the usual crowd. Lacey, Marissa, Julio, Alexa, William, maybe Justin.”

“And do you know what will be going on? Any drugs?”

Jennifer shook her head. “From the sounds of it, it’s pretty much just going to be a regular high school orgy.” 

Ted considered. Jennifer and her friends were rather geeky, and were usually pretty conscientious. “Okay, but you have to be home by midnight.”

“Thanks, Dad!” she leaned over and hugged him. Ted squeezed a boob, then went back to his coffee. 

The rest of the family slowly trickled in. Sandy sat next to him, opting for only coffee. Maddie was the next to arrive, wearing her middle school uniform – Black shoes with thigh-high socks, a short blue skirt, a white shirt that reached halfway between her budding breasts and her belly button, and a blue tie that went down past the shirt. Maddie still had a rather girlish figure, as well as long, straight black hair and an impish yet adorable face. Braden came in next, wearing open-crotch jeans that revealed his hard-on and a camo t-shirt. He was rather stocky, and had short black hair and a tiny amount of facial hair that he though made him look mature. Lindsay followed shortly after, her sandy hair done up in pigtails, wearing only a pair of bright pink short shorts. Those quickly dropped to her ankles, and she climbed onto Braden’s lap and began rocking back and forth as Johanna brought them breakfast. 

“Hey, Johanna,” Ted called out. “Sandy got fingered a bit today, but hasn’t cum yet. Could you help out?” The slave girl quickly crawled under the table and started to eat her mistress out. Johanna was very good at her job, and by the time Ted finished his coffee Sandy was already cumming. 

“Thanks, Johanna. I need that,” she said as the blonde reemerged. Ted stood up, kissed his wife, and waved his kids goodbye, then walked to the car to start his day. He worked as a middle manager at an accounting firm, and his day usually consisted of going to pointless meetings, scheduling meetings that hopefully wouldn’t be pointless, trying to translate what upper management wanted into something actually possible, and getting chewed out when the accountants didn’t do it anyways, all in the name of pushing numbers around until they added up in a way that looked good. The only saving grace to the job was the absurd amount of money he made. Well, and his secretary. 

“Morning, Mr. Johnson,” she called out. 

“Morning, Rebecca. Anything come in that I need to hear about?”

Rebecca was a tall, willowy redhead with a friendly face and a killer ass. As per usual, she was wearing a smart, professional-looking black jacket and nothing else, allowing for easy access. 

“Yes sir, Mr. Smith has scheduled an urgent meeting this morning, which means that either the Glendale meeting or the Green meeting has to be moved to tomorrow.”

Ted groaned. “Send me the case files, and my new schedule.” 

He sat down at his desk and scrolled through endless emails, including the one from Richard Smith, a very important person in the company. He had not only a smoking hot secretary, but a college intern whose job description consisted entirely of fucking, sucking and otherwise pleasing Mr. Smith, so that he barely even fucked his secretary. 

Rebecca arrived with the case files. “Here you go, Mr. Johnson. You’ll probably want to decide before the meeting – the Glendale meeting was scheduled for eleven.” 

“Stick around, will you?” he asked. Having worked for him for several years, Rebecca hadn’t even turned around, and quickly dropped to her knees. She took out his cock and licked it, then began to suck it. As Ted examined the files, she bobbed her head up and down, sliding her lips over his sensitive member. 

Ted made a decision, then wheeled back his chair. He told Rebecca to lean over the desk, then lined up his dick with her pussy and started fuckin her from behind. He had an unobstructed view of her spectacular backside, which he spanked a couple of times as he thrust into her. However, he had an urgent meeting to get to, and blew his load far more quickly than he would have liked. 

Over the course of the day, Ted went to several pointless meetings, scheduled some meetings that hopefully wouldn’t be pointless, fucked Rebecca’s ass over her desk during lunch, tried to translate what upper management wanted into something actually possible, and got chewed out when the accountants didn’t do it anyways. His mood gradually improved over the course of the drive home, and he was positively cheerful when he walked through the door. 

Johanna looked up from a book she had been reading. “Hi, Mr. Johnson. Is there anything I can help you with?”

“No, thanks,” he replied. “I fucked my secretary twice, and got a blowjob from Jennifer in the morning.”

“Supper is in the oven – meatloaf and mashed potatoes,” she replied, and went back to her book. 

Ted looked in on Jennifer, who was playing a video game of some sort, then on Braden and Maddie, who were watching porn with their hands in each other’s pants. He then went to his bedroom to change. Through the doorway, he could see Sandy wiping cum off her face in the bathroom. They exchanged greetings and talked about their days as they both stripped. Sandy had closed three deals and made a very good start on two more. As proof of her ‘sex sells’ method, all three deals had been closed while a cock was inside her. Her description of the exact process ended with the two of them in bed, Ted with his face buried in her cunt and Sandy deepthroating his cock. 

Once the two of them calmed down a bit, they made their way out to the living room, Ted not bothering to put on clothes and Sandy only wearing a pair of sweatpants, and turned on the TV. Eventually, they settled on a show from the Outside called “A Game of Thrones”, which was rather prudish but had engaging characters and good production value. Ted could head Johanna puttering around in the kitchen. After a few minutes, the door opened and Lindsay arrived. She was no longer topless, and instead wore her cheerleading uniform – a red pleated skirt and a shiny red-and-blue crop top. The top really accentuated her small breasts, making them look bigger and rounder than they were. She waved hello, then went to her room. She emerged in the nude. 

“Jennifer and Braden and Maddie are all busy. What are you guys up to?” she asked. Ted invited her to join them, and she sat on his lap. The teen started rubbing her butt against his crotch, and soon his cock was twitching. She turned and smiled slyly at him, then half stood up and sat down again, this time impaling her butthole on his dick. Lindsay was an anal slut, and never missed a chance to get fucked up the butt, especially by her Daddy. Ted groped her perky tits as he pounded her cute little butt. They took it pretty slow, and were still building up tension when Johanna announced that dinner was ready. 

Deciding to end it quickly, Ted grabbed Lindsay’s waist and stood up. Now carrying Lindsay off the ground, he bounced her up and down on his cock. She wrapped her arms and legs around him and nuzzled her face into his shoulder as he slammed into her tight little pussy. Her hair was flying in front of his face, and he heard her making cute little squeaking moans. The moans increased in intensity until she cried out in orgasm. Ted allowed himself to climax as well, filling his daughter with his seed. 

He felt her shaking, so he carried her to the bathroom. They both cleaned up, then walked to the kitchen, where the rest of the family had just finished serving themselves. Johanna had a seat at the table and was included as part of the conversation. Lindsay, despite her excitement over fucking her parents, had started to show signs of being a surly teenager, and so was mostly quiet. Maddie was the most talkative, going on about her day at school, and especially about how her best friend Krystal had been gangbanged in Sex Ed. Jennifer wolfed down her meal, then ran off to get to the party. 

After dinner, Ted and Sandy were sitting in the living room, Johanna was doing the dishes, and Braden, Lindsay, and Maddie, were all on their phones. Ted stood up. “Who wants to play a board game?” Braden and Lindsay both expressed their disinterest, but Maddie and Sandy were up for it. They looked through their collection, and chose *Sex Empire*, a game in which the players compete to create the most successful brothel company. As they were setting up, Johanna asked if they wanted her to join, and they accepted her offer. 

Ted looked around at the other players. Sandy was topless, wearing only her sweatpants, so that her beautiful breasts were in full view. Johanna was still wearing her tantalizing lingerie set and her collar. Maddie had changed from her school uniform into yoga pants and a tube top that showed off her belly button. The game began slowly, with Sandy needing to be reminded of a few rules. Ted decided to go for an unusual strategy, focusing more on producing porn than on whoring out his workers. Sandy, as usual, wasn’t doing very well, and focused more on which card had the sexiest art than on what the cards actually did. Ted knew his only real competition would by Johanna. When she had been bought as a teenager, she had never played a board game, but in the years since had become quite the strategist. 

Ted’s strategy wasn’t working very well, and he could tell that he was falling behind Johanna. To his surprise, however, it was Maddie who was in the lead. She was still learning the basics of strategy, but was making an even weirder playstyle than his work, and work well. She had focused almost exclusively on black ribbon whores, which could make a lot of money but frequently had to be replaced. It looked like Maddie was about to win, but at the last minute Johanna revealed some hidden resources and flooded the market on both black ribbons and porn, just barely squeezing past Ted and Maddie. 

They all applauded the slave girl’s ingenuity. Sandy offered her a reward, and got down on her hands and knees to start eating her out. It was an erotic sight, and Ted started to jack off. Then, he felt a tiny hand on his dick. He looked to the side and saw Maddie reaching over to him. He relaxed as the preteen gave him a handjob. Maddie was skilled with her hands, and he was watching two very sexy women, so Ted was feeling very turned on. 

Maddie paused the handjob. “Daddy, can we fuck? Please?”

“Sure thing, pumpkin,” he replied. She pulled down her yoga pants and kicked them off while Ted lay on his back. He glanced at Sandy, who he saw was looking at him and smiling. Maddie climbed onto him and started to lower herself onto his dick. Her cunt was incredibly tight, and it took a while for her to get all the way down his dick. Once she did, she rode him cowgirl-style while he thrust up and down. She moaned, then leaned down to kiss him. They kissed long and hard, then she arched her back towards the sky again. Her pussy felt incredible, and he felt himself about to cum. He told Maddie this. 

“No, Daddy, wait…. OH! Wait just a little… uhn… bit longer….”

He managed to hold himself in until he felt her pussy contract in an orgasm. She cried out, and he thrust one last time as he came inside her. Once her climax ended, she leaned down and kissed him again. 

“Thanks, Daddy.” 

She was obviously fading fast, and he got up and carried her to bed. When he returned, he found his wife and his slave still going at it like rabbits. Sandy was fingering herself while flicking her tongue all across Johanna’s clit and cunt, and Johanna was moaning and pinching her nipples. Ted was still hard, somehow, and slid his dick into his wife’s pussy. She cried out and started thrusting back against him, so that he hardly had to move to fuck her. 

After a few minutes, Johanna called out, “Please, Master, let me taste that cock. I want to taste her pussy juice!” Ted pulled out of Sandy and walked around to Johanna, who latched onto his cock and started sucking like crazy. After a few seconds, she gasped for air, but Ted grabbed her blonde hair and started facefucking her. He loved the choking, gagging sounds she made, but from the way her hands and legs were moving she was obviously about to cum, and he wanted to hear her, so he pulled out. 

“Lie down,” he told her, then he straddled her belly. He grabbed her breasts and pushed them together, then started titfucking her. His cock, already slick with her saliva, slid right through, and it felt and looked incredible. 

Johanna was something of a screamer, and her cries of pleasure got louder and louder. “Oh… ohhh… Oh, yes…. Oh, yes! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! OHHH! Oh, yes! OH, FUCK, I’M CUMMING! I’M CUMMING! OHHH!” He felt her thrashing beneath him as he kept fucking her beautiful tits. Another pair of tits appeared in his vision. 

“It’s time to repay the favor,” said Sandy, and she sat down on Johanna’s face. Ted leaned forwards and sucked one of his wife’s breasts. Sandy was already pretty worked up, and it wasn’t long before she was climaxing herself. The sight sent Ted into orgasm, and he came all over Johanna’s face and Sandy’s tits and belly. 

The three collapsed into a sweaty pile. It was several minutes before they got up. 

“That was great, Johanna,” said Ted. “Oh, and congrats on the win. Could you clean up the game? I’m exhausted, and from the looks of it so is Sandy.”

Johanna looked exhausted too, but she nodded. “Of course, Mr. Johnson. Just one second.”

As the adults slowly recuperated, the door opened and Jennifer walked in. She was carrying her dress in her hand and was covered in cum. She smirked a little at the pile of bodies on the floor. 

“Enjoy yourselves while I was gone?”

“Oh, yes,” said Ted. “How did the party go? It looks like you had fun, too.”

Her eyes lit up. “Oh, it was lots of fun! We started out just playing games online, though we only had five controllers so we rotated who played. The two who were out gave oral to the players. Then the pizza guy arrived – he was super hot by the way, like seven feet tall and with this massive black cock that felt *so good* – and after dinner we just all fucked. It got a little crazy at the end – the girls were being passed around like sex toys, and Marissa actually passed out while fucking William. I think he took her back to his place, she was still out of it when they left. Anyways, I have about a dozen loads of cum in me and I came like twenty times, so I’m gonna take a shower and hit the sack.”

Sandy smiled. “Sounds like fun, dear.” She gave Jennifer a kiss good night as her daughter walked by. 

Ted and Sandy made their way slowly back to their room. As they passed Lindsay’s room, they heard her and Braden having sex. 

“I’m a little worried about them,” said Sandy. “They fuck each other more than they fuck everyone else combined. I don’t think it’s healthy.”

“I’m sure it’s just a phase,” Ted said soothingly. “But I’ll try and fuck Lindsay more often, and you fuck Braden. That might help them remember that there are other people with dicks and pussies.”

They collapsed onto bed, and talked over the events of the day. “I did notice Maddie asking you for sex back there,” said Sandy. “That’s good.” Ted grunted agreement. 

They were somewhat old-fashioned, in that they held to the belief that parents shouldn’t fuck their children until puberty, and not until their child specifically asked for sex. That had worked well for their first three, but Maddie was something of a late bloomer, and had only lost her virginity a couple of months ago. They were both glad to see her slutting it up a bit more lately. 

After a few minutes, Ted rolled over and got on top of Sandy. They were having sex again, but this was a much more gentle lovemaking, slow and tender. It was a nightly ritual for them to do it this way, in the dark, in missionary position. Their friends thought they were weird, but they thought it brought them closer together. It took several long minutes, but they both came together, then fell into a deep sleep.

9ip9u8,12,2018-09-25,The Kochs and the altright,Lamont-Cranston,Fuckthealtright,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fuckthealtright/comments/9ip9u8/the_kochs_and_the_altright/,"This is something I've been trying to write for a while, its kinda rough. Let me know what you think.

The Kochs [historical background](https://www.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/85xtfv/the_kochs_reason_magazine_robert_lefevre_and_the/?st=jmaeoyso&amp;sh=95a891c5) with [extreme elements](http://www.unkochmycampus.org/los-preface/), their father and attempt to control the Ludwig von Mises Institute, is well documented and Nancy MacLeans book examines their association with James McGill Buchanan.

But their contempory interactions and funding aren't as well understood or clearly documented. 

What they point to is the Kochs being a major influence on the promoting the notion that white people are under threat from dangerous minorities and permissive liberals, and the pipeline from libertarianism to anarcho capitalism to the altright.

[Charles Murray, author of infamous The Bell Curve, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute – one of the key Koch funded think tanks and David sits on the board of directors.](https://www.aei.org/scholar/charles-murray/)

&gt;Garret Jones, an economist at George Mason University, the largest recipiant of Koch funding on college campuses with 95 million between 2005-2015 and earlier this year it was discovered they have in fact obtained control over the hiring and firing of faculty [whose recent monograph was positively reviewed by VDARE in July 2017. Jones draws heavily on the work of white supremacist and eugenicist Richard Lynn, and even personally thanked the Pioneer Fund figurehead in an article he published in the Journal of Economic Growth in 2005. In 2015 Jones delivered a lecture which argued that less democracy in the United States would lead to better governance.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux)

(You have to scroll down a bit to the timeline of interviews)

[Florida Atlantic University professor Marshall DeRosa is a member of the League of the South and employed by the Kochs for their 'prisoner outreach'.](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-charles-koch-is-helping-neo-confederates-teach-college-students/)

[Assistant Professor Jonathan Anomaly at the Department of Political Economy and Moral Science at the University of Arizona, which has received 1.8 million from the Kochs and 2.6 million from their associates, published an article, Public Goods and Education. Anomaly has discussed the value of exploring links between genetics and IQ of different racial groups, and the value of eugenics.](https://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2018/01/02/libertarians-on-public-government-schools-from-milton-friedman-to-the-koch-brothers-to-ua-and-asu-an-incomplete-history)

These three come just from stories found on /r/KochWatch, considering how much money they spend on colleges, endowments they have provided, schools they have set up on campuses how many more are there?

[The Kochs, along with the Mercers and DeVos, fund another think tank Young Americans Foundation that funded those lecture tours of Murray and Milo Yiannopoulos that caused so much commotion.](https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/rightwing-billionaires-are-intentionally-funding-hate-speech-college-campuses)

As the Jones link demonstrates Stepfan Molyneux maintains connections to Jones, Murray who is Koch funded, the League of the South which DeRosa is also associated with, and others in the emerging altright, which are all Koch linked either through direct funding or associating with those they fund, and so too is [Jordan Peterson](https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/968633924724256768)

[In Canada, Rebel Media was founded by Ezra Levant – formerly he worked at the Koch funded Fraser Institute and did an internship at the Charles G. Koch Foundation.]( https://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/2012/04/25/charitable-fraser-institute-accepted-500k-foreign-funding-oil-billionaires?page=0,1) And Rebel Media is a regular platform for Peterson. As well as the likes of Lauren Southern and Gavin McInnes.

Charlie Kirks TPUSA [is also Koch linked.](https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/who-funds-conservative-campus-group-turning-point-usa-donors-revealed-2620325) 

Young Americans Foundation, TPUSA, Rebel Media, and another think tank that employs many Koch alumni [Speech First](https://www.thenation.com/article/dark-money-behind-campus-speech-wars/), Peterson, Molyneux, etc all promote the mantra of 'liberals' silencing dissent on campuses.

The academics provide the 'intellectual' underpining of the “racial realists” and altright movement, the think tanks work is cited to 'prove' there is a cultural war between 'us' and 'them', the work is used by the likes of Peterson and Molyneux and Kirk and media outlets like Rebel Media to motivate dissafected young people and provide the simple emotionally appealing explanations for what the cause of their problems are, and directing them on to the libertarian politics other elements of the Koch network promote.

And for additional evidence, the high school carriculum they donate when schools run short of funding ([because of Koch backed efforts](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) to cut taxes that fund them): [1](https://www.theroot.com/millions-of-students-are-quietly-being-taught-the-koch-1823742091), [2](https://www.alternet.org/human-rights/what-koch-brothers-want-students-learn-about-slavery).

What this should all point to is that the Kochs are not merely libertarians concerned with government overreach, but rather while we have no direct quotes we can nevertheless surmise from their repeated pattern of associations and funding that the Kochs are racists and seek to create a 'let the chips fall where they may' institutional-bias racism.

And it should also point to a confluence of these academics and media personalities pushing a demographic to an increasingly extreme position that welcomes conflict.

As one of their pet academics once said:

&gt;In support of building their own youth movement, another speaker, the libertarian historian Leonard Liggio, cited the success of the Nazi model. In his paper titled ""National Socialist Political Strategy: Social Change in a Modern Industrial Society with an Authoritarian Tradition,"" Liggio, who was affiliated with the Koch-funded Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) from 1974 to 1998, described the Nazis' successful creation of a youth movement a key to their capture of the state. Like the Nazis, he suggested, libertarians should organise university students to create group identity."
9iqe28,2,2018-09-25,5 AI chatbots for your business,behindthedash,Chatbots,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chatbots/comments/9iqe28/5_ai_chatbots_for_your_business/,"**Users spend hours in messaging apps each weeks. Chatbots automate interactions with them in those places**

Chatbots are simple computer programs that ‘talk’ to you through Instant Messaging conversations. They’re usually powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) behind the scenes.

Chatbots are used to automate a particular customer’s interaction over chat sessions. For example, a one could deal with the most common questions your customers ask staff when they chat on your website.

The technology behind chatbots, notably the AI behind them is getting better all the time. Such are the potential productivity gains to be had, from automation delivered in the form of chatbots that every business owner, big and small, is going to have to confront the question of which chatbots they want to allow in to their business.

We spend hours each day on our smartphone and we’re always thinking about how we can cut the phone bill.  Chatbots are important because they are designed to be in the place most people increasingly find themselves – in an instant messaging session on mobile phones.

**90% of ‘big customers’ chat before buying**

Each of the following chatbot examples is a product which operates on a messaging platform like Microsoft Exchange or Slack. Here are 5 chatbots case studies you can use for your business

**Winnie – 72% of the people who talk to her use her**

[**Winnie**](https://www.ventureharbour.com/5-b2b-chatbot-case-studies-do-chatbots-increase-conversions/), one of the more capable chatbots in market does something very simple. She helps you establish the right hosting provider for your new website. Through a simple conversation with her, Winnie will walk you through the options that are available and expose the key decision making criteria. An incredible 72% of people go on to use Winnie and click through to a new hosting provider – an incredible conversion rate for a website.

**Niles: A Chatbot for Slack to automatically answer common queries.**

[**Niles**](https://niles.ai/) is a simple Chabot, currently available only in Slack, which automatically answers common questions within your team. Niles works just like an incredibly smart intern at your company. Any employee can ask Niles any question they want to. If Niles doesn’t know the answer, he’ll find someone who does. Once he’s been told the answer, he never forgets and, if he’s asked again in the future, he’ll automatically deal with the query for you.

**Jarvis : A Reminder Bot for Facebook Messenger**

[**Jarvis**](http://hellojarvis.io/) is a Facebook Messenger based task tool. Even business people are real people during the day. And if, while they’re being normal people in Facebook Messenger during the course of their day, there’s anything they need to be reminded t do, (‘Get milk!’) then Jarvis will help remind you. It’s also worth mentioning that Mark Zuckerberg’s personal home assistant is called Jarvis. The two are unrelated.

**Chymebots: Customer Service Bots which can save you $1m a year**

[**Chyme**](http://chymebot.com/) provides a range chatbots across a range of tasks. Customer service is just one of that range. With proper training Chyme can automate initial tasks occupying your Service Agents. After that, he’ll watch for other repetitive tasks and offer to take them over.

Customer service of this sort is such a huge part of companies that the cost savings, simply based on automating answers to common questions saved Amtrack $1m using a similar business Chabot, [**last year alone**](https://overthinkgroup.com/chatbot-case-studies/).

**Polly the poll: A Chatbot for Slack which polls office staff**

Whether you’re deciding where to go for lunch on Friday or determining the strategic direction of the company, there are times that you need to establish an outcome through a team vote.

[**Pollybot**](https://www.polly.ai/slack-poll) (previously called Polly the Poll) works in Slack, among other messaging platforms and provides a disarmingly friendly way to solicit the opinions of your work colleagues.

**Bringing it all together**

Chatbots are worth your time and attention, despite their current inadequacies. There will be a day when chatbots form the majority of the customer interactions. Even now, chatbot systems can determine the emotional state of a user and respond appropriately.

These off the shelf chatbots are all free and a nice way to dip your toe in the water of what chatbots could ultimately mean to your business."

9iru6i,8,2018-09-25,Lavorare durante gli studi,Dracogame,italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/9iru6i/lavorare_durante_gli_studi/,"Salve ragazzi, inizio scusandomi perché credo (ma non sono sicuro) che questo post fosse argomento da caffè, ma visto che voglio scrivere un messaggio un po' più lungo del commento medio, ho pensato di fare un post. Tenterò di dargli una connotazione più generale e meno personale così che possa interessare a più persone.

Iniziamo con una premessa: sono uno studente di magistrale, ho appena cominciato l'anno. Durante la triennale non mi sono mai dedicato al lavoro e nemmeno alla media. Non voglio annoiarvi su come sono arrivato alla conclusione di non dovermi concentrare affatto sulla mia media in triennale, sta di fatto che il mio voto di laurea non è stato eccezionale.

Con la magistrale però le cose cambiano. Ho un fresh-start e sono seriamente intenzionato a puntare al 110, e a rifiutare in maniera categorica qualsiasi cosa mi trascini sotto il 100. Sto anche cercando di dedicare molte più ore alle attività di ripasso così da avere sempre la mente pronta. Insomma, vorrei trattarla come un vero e proprio lavoro, 40 ore alla settimana tutte le settimane.

E qui viene il problema fondamentale: non ho mai fatto una esperienza all'estero, non ho mai fatto una internship, non ho mai fatto un tirocinio e nemmeno ho lavorato in un bar. Nella mia vita il massimo che ho fatto è stato dare ripetizioni e comprare qualche quota di fondo azionario che mi è fruttata qualche centinaio di euro.

Ora, vorrei fare un'esperienza lavorativa, ma non voglio perdere il ritmo con l'università. Data la premessa, capite che se voglio dedicarmi così tanto all'università, è difficile che io possa saltare i corsi per andare in un ufficio. Ma allo stesso tempo mi sento soffocato dall'idea che, anche se dovessi prendere 110 e lode in due anni (il che sarebbe una grande impresa), sarei comunque solo un 110 e lode senza niente altro da offrire. Certo, dalla mia università (Polimi) di 110 ne escono pochissimi e gli uffici HR di livello lo sanno bene, d'altra parte ho molte ambizioni per la mia carriera e troverò sempre competizione.

A questo bisogna aggiungere che dedico 10 ore alla settimana agli spostamenti in treno (un'ora andare e una tornare, per cinque giorni), e che ho una ragazza che inevitabilmente mi porta via altro tempo.

Dunque, dato che so che molti qui hanno studiato informatica/ingegneria, voi cosa ne pensate? Cosa avete fatto negli anni di università? Esistono cose che potrei fare parallelamente (tipo giornalismo e... e non me ne vengono altre in mente), secondo voi ne vale la pena? Dovrei fermarmi tre mesi e fare una internship, o prendere prima la laurea?

Vorrei puntualizzare che la mia famiglia non ha bisogno di soldi. I miei genitori mi pagano treno e retta, sicuramente qualche soldino alla mia età sarebbe bello avercelo, ma non è una necessità, è solo un bonus.

Hope y'all can still understand me.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I met this girl around 9 months ago when she joined my 'school' (not exactly a classic school but the best way to put it for now). She knew one of my friends and started hanging out with us. I don't know what it was at the time, but it was always nice having her around. After some time, she got in a relationship with one guy from the school, resulting in her spending more time with us. This was also the time I got to know her better and she got to know me better. Both of us started internships at the time, so we didn't meet everyday in school like we used to. We started texting outside of school, in the beginning just some standard stuff on how the day went, what we did and so on. One day, after I asked her how shes doing, she said that she had a really rough night and felt like shit emotionally because she got in a big argument with her boyfriend that night. So I asked her if it would help if I come pick her up after work so she has someone she can talk to. (I didn't really know where I was going with that at this time, because I knew I most likely can't help her or give her any advice. But I just wanted to be there for her so she's not alone, it just felt right at that moment.). So I went to pick her up, we talked and I drove her home. Later that evening I got a message from her thanking me for talking and being there for her, even though I couldn't solve the situation at that time it really helped her just talking to me. After that day we started texting more and also started facetiming every evening, our contact got more intimate, not only via phone but also face to face. She started talking to me about every problem she had, always called me when shes feeling bad and I was always available for her to make her feel better. She told me some really hard to swallow pills in terms of the problems she had at that point and in terms of her past. I was always there for her and tried my best to help whereever I could, and if I couldn't help I still listened to her and tried to cheer her up. Some weeks later I wake up to a long message from her, thanking me for all that I did for her, saying that I told her things noone ever told her, that I treat her as good as noone ever did before, telling me that I'm one of the most important persons in her life and that she never wants to lose me. I replied telling her basically the same and also telling her how she made me feel happiness for the first time in my life and that she gave my life some kind of sense. Some time passed and she aksed me if I could imagine a relationship with her and that she loves me. I told her that ofcourse I can imagine a relationship with her and that I love her too. I asked her tho how we're gonna proceed from here on out, since she was still in a relationship and I also knew that she still had strong feelings for her ex bf. She told me not to worry and that she needs some time to sort things out. I was okay with that, we also continued texting/facetiming and met in person at least 1-2 times a week, depending on how our schedules allowed us to do so. Everything was cool for me and I was happy, since we bascially were in a relationship without anyone 'oficially' knowing. I know it was wrong because she essentially cheated on her boyfriend with me, but I was ok with that because I was just so in love. Around 3 weeks ago tho everything started to go downhill, I got a call from her, she was crying, telling me that her ex bf wants to cancel the contact because he found a new GF. This hit her harder than I expected but I still tried to cheer her up somehow. This was the last time we had an actual conversation and she told me about her problems. The next day she broke up with her boyfriend and posted a picture of some other dude saying 'i love you', guess thats her new boyfriend then. I messaged her several times but got ignored completely for about a week. I was feeling bad to a point of having physical symptoms, I slept way less, I only ate once a day and I cried every night. After about a week she messaged me, telling me that shes sorry for ignoring and since then we started kinda texting again, but not the same as before. It's basically a 180° turn in terms of contact with her. She then also lost her job,which makes things even more complicated. I asked her if she still loves me or if her feelings towards me changed and how this situation is going to continue from here. She dodged those questions telling me 'we're gonna find a way to sort things out, I just don't know how'. I told her that I'm still there for her no matter what happens and how this situation pans out. I also told her that my feelings towards her didn't change and that I still love her. Now I don't know how to proceed from here on, do I keep writing her or do I give her time and space and wait until she texts me? Does giving her time just increase the distance between the two of us? I thought about everything atleast 5 times at this point, getting new thoughts and fears everytime, and got the wildest theories in my head on why this situation is like it is right now. My biggest fear is losing her, not only as a potential GF but losing her in general. I don't know if anyone of you can tell me what to do without knowing everything but I just hope someone can sprinkle some thoughts on me so I don't go completely insane. At the moment I just don't know what to think, say or do anymore."

I am transferring into IUP in the spring, I am studying Computer Science (cyber security track). My two major questions to anybody that studied any major: **Did IUP/staff at IUP help you find an internship? Did you find a job/internship in the area?**

I am currently working full-time in an IT position looking to plan out securing something in the area. Maybe I am looking at the wrong time..but I am having *zero luck* finding anything in this area. I'm 26 years old, have my AAS, and have kind of established a career for myself that I am willing to put on hold to finish my Bachelor's. I will be moving up there and really don't want to settle for some shitty part-time job that is not even related to my career.

The only thing I have really found are IUP computer lab monitors, who get paid minimum wage. Are there perks like tuition discount or other things that justify this low wage? Is this/has this been negotiated higher with experience for any of you?

**Does anybody have any other resources for finding local jobs/internships?** I have been scouring all the major job listing websites. I have not yet attended IUP so I haven't met any staff. I am going to try to reach out to somebody in my department as well.

Thank you so much for your time.

I am currently studying at Stockholm University and my girlfriend living in France will graduate from her nursing degree at the end of June 2019.  


We want to live together at Stockholm and we have some questions regarding her arrival :  


\- Is it difficult to find a job as a nurse when you just graduated ? She made 9 interships (meaning 60 weeks of experience)  in different fields/sectors (needed to be able to graduate) and she stayed in Cambodia for 2 months, also for an internship.  


\- She can talk english but she can't talk swedish. Is it mandatory ? If yes, which course do you recommand (SFI ?), till what level to be able to work as a nurse ?  


\- Do you think any french institution (such as a french school for example) would need a french nurse ? Do you have any other french institution suggestions ?  


\- Does she have to make an equivalence demand for her nursing degree ? How long would it take ?  


Do you have any idea that could help us in our project ? Feel free to help in any way you can.  


Thanks a lot for reading ! Have a nice day :)

A bit about myself - I'm a 23 year old final year medical student (5th year) that will graduate next March 2019. Final year started about 4 months ago and so far, things are going poorly because of a few events. For the past 4 years in medical school I've quite been enjoying the process -- I was motivated, disciplined, and a typical weekly schedule would look something like this:

**Mon - Fri**

8 - 430/5  Lectures / tutorials / clinical postings in the wards

6 - 730  Gym / Pole-dancing / Running

9 - 11 Studying

12 Bedtime

**Sat** \- Socialising with family and friends

**Sun**  \- Pole-dancing and catching up on more revision work!

Whenever I had extra time I was also able to go for vocal classes, play the drums with other random music-loving people I would find online, or play the piano to entertain myself.

I was able to do all this despite the long days in the wards because I wanted to challenge myself, and I derived a lot of fulfilment and pride from being to upkeep my enjoyable hobbies while simultaneously maintaining my schoolwork. I had concrete goals on what I wanted to achieve and though it was tough, I was motivated enough to keep grinding and was improving a lot in all aspects of my personal growth (academically / physically / socially / spiritually). The lifestyle was definitely quite rigorous and regimented, but I enjoyed the challenges and seeing results.

Juggling all these might not be a big deal to some and definitely, it is not as tough compared to some other cases (e.g. post-grad medical students who are also newly-wed parents raising a family etc) but prior to college I was a super-studious nerd who literally had no life besides studying day-in and day-out. I'm from an Asian family and my parents are the kind who would preach ""Studying hard to get into a good course in uni is the only useful thing in life! Want to dabble in dance? Not unless you're gonna become a dancer for a living in the future! Which you are most certainly *not* going to, because you'll never make a living for yourself as one bla bla bla."" Hence growing up, I only knew how to excel academically and never really pursued anything else I might find enjoyable. Which is why, in Uni, I did a 180 and told myself I needed to build a life, an *actual* life (on top of the bitterness and resentment that I had already missed out on so much in my teens), and eventually I did.

Now before final year started I already knew I wasn't going to be able to upkeep such a tightly-packed schedule, because final year medical students are made student interns so you basically have to ""work"" like a junior doctor in the wards. Now a day might go something like this: 7 to 530 is working in the wards, add extra hours front and back if you're doing something more demanding like a surgical posting. Most nights I just come home to rest, too mentally exhausted from the day or even if I don't rest, I come home to study because, y'know, the prospect of failing final exams and not graduating has such a stronghold over my life (even though I keep forcing myself to think otherwise and not feel like my entire life is being dictated by having to ""study all the time"" nowadays). Up till 2 months ago I was still able to go running, go for pole dance classes, and keep up my exercise regime whenever I had the time, which was perfectly acceptable by me given my realistic expectations of what I could do any given day.

**Here's the kicker...** 2 months ago I stopped running because I started having pain in my left inner knee. I thought by laying off running it would resolve, but it's only been getting worse since (which is really infuriating because I also stopped lifting weights/squatting whatnot) despite the weeks of rest AND physiotherapy. I finally saw a sports med doctor last week after the pain became more noticeable and was desperate for a diagnosis. He diagnosed me as having a grade 1 MCL sprain, and scheduled a follow-up consult for November 2018 (it's a public hospital so yes, appointments take bloody long). Since the consult my pain has (surprise surprise) only been getting worse and I honestly think I've been misdiagnosed because the pain is getting out of proportion and it's already been 8 weeks. I'm desperate, so tomorrow I'm going to see a private specialist, but man this injury has really left me wretched in more ways than one.

On top of the burgeoning stress and anxiety of dealing with final year, **pausing my running for 8 weeks has really gotten to me** :( I'm less motivated in school now; every night I just come home and collapse somewhere, too distracted by my injury to revise and just spend the night feeling sorry for myself, feeling like I will never be able to overcome my current state and wanting to self-destruct. Of course, on top of the lack of exercise, my diet has gone to crap, and I over-eat, snack too much, make unhealthy choices, and am appearing more bloated every day. My time when I'm not at the hospital now, is either spent sleeping too much, watching too much Netflix/youtube, mindlessly surfing the internet, snacking, or wallowing in self-pity. I blame this on my lack of resilience and I chide myself everyday for behaving this way, but I just can't help it. Without regular running, I feel empty without this hobby and identity as a disciplined runner. Everything else in my life has just fallen apart around that.

Previously I always had so much motivation, was always reading biographies and books on stoicism to sustain myself throughout other struggles in life, but right now I seriously just feel that the odds are against me - I won't ever be able to run again, I'm going to eat my life away and gain all the weight, until the inevitable day where I decide to give up and not try anymore.

**TL;DR**: Ever since my knee injury 2 months ago that has stopped me from running, my life has gone to crap - I am no longer motivated in my studies at school (especially it being such a crucial year), I don't do my other hobbies anymore, I have isolated myself from my friends, and all I do is watch tv \\ use my laptop \\ eat too much \\ sit around crying feeling sorry for myself. Why am I so weak?

If anyone else has suffered a sports injury before and have recovered from it, do feel free to share your experience. I would appreciate it very much."

9ismat,1,2018-09-25,The classic poor college graduate needs some advice. Would working a non-accounting job first hurt my prospects? (see my username),Needajobneedacar,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9ismat/the_classic_poor_college_graduate_needs_some/,"Hello everyone, 

I am a recently graduated poor college student. I just went into further debt to get my CPA exam eligibility and will be taking the first part (FAR) in about a week. I'm nervous as hell, but confident due to studying so much. 

I am in a bit of a pickle: I am not sure what the best course of action employment wise is. Due to various reasons, I did not have a job lined up after graduation, so I work part-time (20 hours a week) at the University I graduated from in a fantastic office job. I am doing an internship now with an accounting department at a local goverment but that will be ending soon (within 2 weeks). They will not be offering a full time job I've already spoke to them and found out, they only had openings for interns from the state funding they got. I've read a lot online that it is easy to get pidgeon-holed into one career path, if that isn't true correct me please. The way I see it, I have two options: 

1. Continue applying for/holding out for accounting jobs and working part-time. 
This is starting to not be a viable option. I need a new car badly (or a ""new"" used car preferably), I need money, and the part-time work isn't going to be enough I've found.

2. Try to get (any) temporary full time job, while applying for accounting jobs. 
Starting to feel like this is the best thing. This would greatly help cover my income, so I wouldn't have to worry about money. But, if I do this, would it look bad on my resume that I didn't go into accounting first?

I guess the core of the issue is that I need money, which in the end is basically everyone in the world's issue. Would getting a full-time job to ""buffer"" the transition period getting hired in accounting affect my prospects? If not, then that seems to be the way to go. If it will look bad, I'll even more aggressively penny pinch what I make now and keep working part-time. "

 I was never good at the whole socializing outside the comforts of the group of people that naturally were in my close proximity due to school/work. You could label me an introvert I suppose, every relationship I’ve had I kinda just fell into and never chased after one because I was too scared. 

Now I’m in a new city and not in school yet, just working. I work in an office that’s filled with older people, most of which have been working here for as long as I have been alive. 

With leaving all my friends and family and even though I do have some friends here that I’ve known for a few year, but something is just off. It has all stacked up and made me feel lonely. 

I guess I’m having an issue of meet new people and knowing where to look.  I’m not 21, but will be in November so I can soon go to clubs to meet women there, but that can’t be the only place. Also as you imagine, me a computer nerd that would rather stay home and play WoW, the club doesn’t seem like my natural habitat. 

I’ve tried Bumble and not to my surprise I find that this method is very lack luster. 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice from other people while might have gone through what I’m going through. "

So there is this girl (F 21) who I (M 22) met through my friends almost two years ago. We just started off as friends because we were both dating someone when we met. We (my friends, her, and I) still hung out semi-regularly, but obviously I didn't think much of it. Fast forward about a year (2017) and I realize she broke up with her boyfriend. Didn't think much of it, then a couple months later my girlfriend and I broke up. Honestly didn't think much of it, my crush is so beautiful I just assumed she was out of my league and that I had no chance.

We then all hung out for the first time in a long time (last October) at a friend's place, it was a casual night of drinking and playing games, etc. I was standing next to her and cracking some jokes because that's just my sense of humor, and I notice her laughing a lot and touching my arm flirtatiously. I noticed a little but didn't try to look too much into it. Fast forward a month and my friends, her, and I all go see Thor: Ragnarok in theaters. We go get something to eat first and I notice she's doing the same thing as what she did at the party. Even better, after we eat we go to the movies and while waiting in line she says she's tired and rests her head on my shoulder. I don't really react much physically, but inside I'm kinda losing it (is she really doing this? this is awesome!) and then she even sits next to me in the theater and leans on her arm really close to me. Also, in between actually seeing each other in person, we talk fairly regularly in between. The next day after the movies, I text her and ask if she wanted to go on a date (noticed that probably was a mistake, should've just asked to hangout) and she declined but her reason was because she was still caught up on her ex a little, which makes sense because they dated for more than 3 years. I was a little bummed but was ultimately fine because I was kinda in the same boat from my ex.

Fast forward to winter break and I'm about to head home from school for Christmas and I ask her if she wants to hangout over break. She responded really excitedly and we decided to meet up and go bowling. The day comes, and we go bowling and it was a blast, she was dressed really nice and we were very flirty towards each other. I ask her out on a second date and she gladly accepts. We end up going back to my place and watch a movie and we ended up cuddling and holding hands. I am absolutely on cloud 9 because of this, I never thought she'd like me like this. The movie ends and I walk her to her car, we hug and I go in to kiss her. We kiss and she reacts all giggly and giddy, I remember her saying ""I guess I'll see you later then"" with a big smile on her face. I'm so happy because of this.

A couple weeks go by and we're back at school now. She comes over to hangout with all of us and I go to the front door of my apartment building to let her in. While walking up the stairs she says she had a great time bowling, but she just wants to work on herself and doesn't really want to date right now. She also says that she just isn't in the right place to date. I totally understand what she says (because of the ex boyfriend thing) and that she is probably still a little caught on him. That night was awful for me, it's like when you almost have something so awesome and it just barely slips out of your hands. I felt heartbroken, but I couldn't complain because I understood her reason. Plus she is a super nice girl and is so caring that I don't think she'd lie about that.

The next semester of school all my friends, her, and I hang out more but I obviously have backed off to give her the space she needs to work on herself (basically I'm just being a friend to her and not flirting at all). I still would catch glances from her sometimes and she would just act a little different towards me (in a good way). Again that's just what I'm getting from her, could I be wrong about my assumptions? Sure, but I just trusted my gut.

Anyways, over the summer (this past summer) we all still hangout and she seems less flirty (more off and on, sometimes when she would hangout with us she would seem more smiley towards me, other times it's more just like we're friends). Anyways, I just couldn't tell if she still liked me or not. I still can't tell. We would talk fairly often like I said, but I myself stopped from talking her as often because I just assumed she didn't like me like that anymore, but like I said, I don't know.

I graduated back in June and moved back home this past August, and she's still in school. She hasn't dated anyone (that I know of) since our little ""thing"" or whatever you'd call it, so I don't believe she lied about her reason to not continue to date. I'm moving this weekend about 3 hours away from home and 2 hours away from where she is at school because of an internship I received. I'm debating about messaging and asking her if she still has feelings for me, but I don't know what to do.

Should I just get over myself and move on? Should I see if she still feels the same way about me? Should I just be friends with her? I still like her so much and I have never crushed on a girl this hard, I'm just afraid she doesn't feel the same way, but I have no way of figuring this out. Also, if there's any more details that I possibly could have left out, please ask. Any support/opinions will help."

I have an opportunity to do an internship in the Swinburne area, this January! 

I’m from Ireland so I’d love to know what the Swinburne area is like in general?

We also have a bit of a housing issue here at the moment and rent is very expensive, what is the renting situation like in the Swinburne? 

How much would a 1 bed apartment cost to rent in the area on average for example?

Thanks for any help you can offer!"

9iu1er,1,2018-09-25,Is she the one? [best friend crush],PrinceMyskin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9iu1er/is_she_the_one_best_friend_crush/,"There is this girl [27] (let’s call her K.) that I [28M] met in highschool, 11 years ago. The first time I saw her I kinda fell in love, she was so incredibly beautiful with that naive looking that makes you feel like the world might be a nice and pleasant place after all;  we always had an amazing time together, flirted a lot, had deep conversations, we obviously ended up dating after 3 months of friendship but we broke up even faster because she was always busy studying and her parents didn’t really wanted her to go out; I was young, good looking and desperately wanted a serious relationship to forget my ex so I felt like I was wasting time with her.

We didn’t stop talking, we didn’t stop seeing each other, just became friends, actually our relationship improved a lot in that period, we were constantly looking for each other’s advice. I’m not saying there wasn’t attraction, we just never needed to bring things to that level, until a year later. 

It was summer, I just had got my driving license, was experiencing that teenager God complex that makes you feel like you could bend a mountain if you only would, even if I had broke up recently with my ex (yes the same ex from the year before, op is a dumbass). K. called, she was on holiday with her family and that was the first time I was hearing anything from her in the past month, she was confused, talking no sense about a guy that “she kinda liked and wanted to take things to the next level with her but she had always wanted me to be her first time”. I drove 5 hrs that night just to reach K., slept in my car, took her out in the morning for the most amazing second first date ever. I wish I could tell you that we had also the most amazing sex ever, but all I had was a car and her parents didn’t exactly love me so we decided we could wait another month.

We couldn’t. I got back home 10 days before her and started having second thoughts. I felt like I didn’t deserve her and that I wasn’t good enough to be her first time (dunno why it was such a big deal to me, at that point I had almost 3 years of experience). She hated me for that. Broke up with me and stopped talking for almost 1 year.

I was 6 months in a relationship at that time, all went smooth like nothing ever happened, we just met and started talking like we used to, had a lot to catch up and so we did. I couldn’t tell in the beginning but she later admitted she was jealous af of my girlfriend, she thought I was her property, in a cute way imo. 

So time passed and K. met a guy, I don’t really like to judge but let me pass this one, he was and probably still is a giant douchebag, he never treated her properly, never loved her, didn’t want her to see me but she was somewhat happy and I was still in a relationship so I tried to be as supportive as I could, helped her through their problems, helped her through her family issues. Just tried to be the best friend she deserved. 

2 years into this wicked shit (wicked because I probably had feelings for her and she admittedly had still feelings for me) I met the girl that made me forget about K. (well, since you are actually reading this, you know she really didn’t but we had a beautiful relationship as long as it lasted, not gonna focus on that tho since this is already a long ass post) let’s call her D..


K. and me finally were just friends, not the one you could get drunk with but the kind of friend you reach out whenever you have troubles and need some good advice and a laugh. I was with D., she was with that douchebag and we were seeing each other once every 4-6 months.

That lasted until 2 years and half ago, when D. and me broke up and K. finally dumped her ex. 
We both went through a lot of shit meanwhile, work, adult life, busy schedule, depression, I had to move to another city to find a job, we both ended up having a lot of meaningless sexual relationships but somehow we managed to keep contact and see each other once every 4-6 months. I didn’t really see her as a potential partner in that period, I probably just didn’t want a partner at all.


We have finally arrived to the present, we did it reddit! 


I moved back to my hometown this summer to start a business project on my own and K. as soon as she aknowledged it, wanted to meet. We spent an afternoon together, had a good time, at least it was a good time to me and we promised each other we would have been doing that much more often but she “disappeared”, she would text back but would never text first, she would makes plan to meet but she would also drop them because “she was too busy or too tired”. She was actually doing her internship while attending a master but I got demoralized and stopped trying to take her out.
End of august is when we met again, we had probably the most beautiful conversation we ever had, we ended up getting home at 5 in the morning that night and that’s where something clicked in my head, she wasn’t K. anymore to me, she was way more, I wanted her from the deep of my heart to the tip of my D (nope not my ex), she was that beautiful girl I met a life ago but also a wonderful grown up woman that was trying to conquer her place in the world. I could see her most hiddens features or maybe I was just tired af.


We went out again 4 days ago and I’m still trying to understand what happened, I’m usually a really self controlled person, I went through a lot in my life and I usually don’t let anything slip away if I don’t want to, but she made that happen, I found myself talking about things I didn’t even think I could say out loud, I found myself being an harmless child in front of her, she obviously loved it. 
We had the deepest and probably thanks to my self deprecating humor, also the funniest conversation ever. 
Eye contact was costant. I think I felt a lot of sexual tension (might be just me). 
The night ended up at 3 am we didn’t kiss, we didn’t hug, I am awkward when it comes to make the first move, even more since she means so much to me. 

I have no idea what I should do. Let it go? Keep it as friend it might just be a crush? Make a move and risk our entire relationship? She definetly is my best friend, I love her and I don’t wanna either hurt her or lose her.


Excuse my english and the format, not a native speaker and posting from my phone. Sorry for wasting your time with this loooong post and thanks in advance!

Tl;dr
Have a best friend I’ve known forever, we always had some kind of attraction going on. we finally are in the same town and we finally are both single but lot of things happened between us, I have a crush on her but I’m scared to lose such a good friend.

It pays $43,000 a year and I am fucking miserable there. Yes I know many people would love to have a job paying over 40k. However, I am starting to realize that it is making me extremely miserable and anxious. I have to prepare myself to walk in the door every morning. I hate the job, I am awful at it, and I get the sense that my coworkers can't stand me because they know I'm terrible at my job. I found myself crying in the bathroom there earlier the morning. It's like either way I'd be fucked professionally. If i put my two weeks in I'll be viewed in a negative light because of the whole ""don't quit a job unless you've been there for a year!"" Rule and they'd have to find a real placement for me under short notice. If I don't quit I'm just going to continue sucking and causing issues for everyone else I work with. I am genuinely trying to do my job well, I just don't think it's a good fit for me and I should have never taken it in the first place. I know my boss can tell I am bad at my job. 

I currently live at home and my parents keep hinting at wanting me to move out. I want to move out so bad, really I do but I can't afford it where I live. I've searched high and low for a decent studio in a safe neighborhood that I can afford while also paying over $1500 a month in student loans, car insurance, whatever other utilities the apartment will make me pay for, gas, food, toilet paper to wipe my ass, a cell phone bill(thank god for mint mobile its $15 a month).....I just don't understand how people are getting by. This feels like a hole I'll never be able to get out of. I don't want to barely scrape by I want to be comfortable. I have a little over $1,400 in savings right now and if I quit that wouldn't even last me a month since I pay more than that for student loans. I just feel like I am not making enough money. I don't know how people are surviving under 50k as a single person. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. No one understands where I'm coming from, everyone just thinks we are lazy millennials. I don't have rich parents or parents who are even middle class. My parents are poor, my mother took a huge loan for me to even be able to finish college. I have to pay her back. To her she just sees that I have a corporate job, so that means I have ""made it"" and am swimming in cash. 

I just want to be happy. I just want enough money for a place of my own, to save for emergencies, to live my life. I am tired of older people making us feel guilty for wanting more than the bare minimum. 

I studied finance and economics, did 4 internships and got great grades. You would think I'd be able to find a job that will allow me to afford a place of my own. Unless you have 3 years of experience it is extremely difficult to find anything more than 45k. Its simply enough where I live. And no I do not want to move, my family and friends are here and for the sake of my mental health I need a support system right now.

How are you all coping? Does anyone have any ideas? Maybe I should try the whole affiliate marketing thing.

I feel like organizing an AMA is difficult because you have to reach out and coordinate everything for every single AMA. Making it into a reoccurring event would only require initial effort setting it up, but after that it won't be much more work other than just starting a thread every time it's time for one.

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

9ivdq1,3,2018-09-25,The Arrival,OSUTechie,RepublicSenate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicSenate/comments/9ivdq1/the_arrival/,"**Location:** Landing Platform 934, Coruscant  

Akash Septimus stepped off the transport ship out into the bright Coruscant morning. Ships and speeders zipped passed in an orderly line. Hundreds of feet below on the various levels of the planet wide city, citizens move about their business. Akash took in a deep breath, taking in the aroma of the city. The smell of grease, metal, concert, and garbage. Garbage? Akash was taken back. Growing up on Chalacta Akash is not use to the hustle and bustle of a large city. Most of Chalcata is farmland and what few cities there are, are nowhere near the size of Coruscant. And while he has been here before, Akash is still not use to the smell. 

A smaller craft was at the other side of the landing pad. A group of five people stood there waiting for Akash. Akash guessed two were guards based on their stance and position within the group. Flanking the other three. Omisha Billaba was the outgoing senator that Akash was replacing. Shorter than him, she wore a traditional Chalacta robe with bright vibrant colors. Her hair tied in a long braided ponytail. Which when unraveled would extend down to her lower back. Akash smiled, he always thought Omisha was a very attractive person and during his intern days would often wonder what an evening with her would be. He quickly shook those thoughts from his head and as Omisha’s aid, and now his aid, Waman Zravasya, approached. 

“Good Afternoon Akash. I hope your journey from Chalcata was uneventful?”  Waman said.  
“It was,” Akash replied. “Unfortunately”   
“Oh!?”  
“Do not get me wrong. It was a peaceful flight, it is just after being cooped up on a ship for a couple days after spending most of your life in the open air of our planet. You start to feel cramp and isolated.” 
Waman and Akash walked over to the rest of the group.  
“Uh huh” replied Waman. “Well, hopefully Coruscant will be able to offer that openness you so much enjoy. Akash, may I reintroduce you to Senator Omisha Billaba.” gesturing to Omisha.  
Omisha extends her hand and Akash takes it and bows slightly. “Hello again senator.”   
“Former Senator” Omisha replied “You may call me Lady Billaba or just Omisha, since we will be working closely together over the next few weeks with the transition of office.”  
Akash thought he would like to call her something else. “Understood, Lady Billaba.” he said. They all turned and started walking to the smaller transport.   
“Was your trip enjoyable.” Omisha asked.  
“As I was telling Waman, it was uneventful, but I was starting to feel a little trapped there at the end.”   
“Yes, the trip can do that. It’s one of the reasons why I rarely made it back to our home planet. It amazes me we ever did develop interstellar flight, as much as many of us hate the cold confides of space. On the other hand, as you will soon learn, being a Senator in the Galactic arena will keep you busy on many nights...”  
“I bet” thought Akash suggestively  
Omisha continued “...you will find that most deals and compromises are done outside of general sessions, some done in the long hallways of the Senate Rotunda, others in backrooms of gangster ran brothels, and others in the middle of the night behind lock bedroom doors.” Omisha gave a suggestive wink to Akash, making him miss a step as he walked up the boarding ramp.  
“Long story short, you will find that you might not have time to travel back and forth like many of the other Senators do. But that is okay, as Coruscant offers many wonderful things and as a Senator, even a fresh off the boat Senator like yourself, you will find many advantages to being one.” The trio sat down in some nice luxury chairs that were arranged around a table. The two guards stood at either end of the room, and the third person who Akash wasn’t introduced to, but guess was the pilot disappeared behind one of the doors.   
“However, you will also find you will have many so called friends.. Understand that most, if not all of them, are not your friend. They just want your influence, or the status that comes from knowing a senator.” The ship starts to take off from the landing pad as Akash nods.   

They continued talking for the remains of the flight. Eventually they landed and Akash was shown to his new Apartment. It was explained to him that new senators usually do not get apartments in the higher levels, but that his was higher than most new senators. This apartment gave him a wide open view of the Coruscant skyline and a direct view the Senate Office Building. A massive dome like structure where the fate of the Republic was constantly decided. Akash stared out the window, getting lost in his thoughts….

I agree getting MPs themselves to participate might be too much of a long shot and too much work, but I feel like if we'd just approach the parties directly (there's only 8) and ask if they are willing to make a PR spokesperson or intern available to do their bidding, that'd already get the job done. 

I wouldn't mind helping out reaching out to them to get this off the ground, either by contacting the parties directly or through MPs that we know are active and responsive on social media such as Twitter. If two or three other people would be willing to help out here it shouldn't be too difficult.

9iw9v8,1,2018-09-25,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9iw9v8/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

N1njastar28

Hope to rp soon!

9iwlzg,3,2018-09-25,Near the bottom of the payscale in the company,xezitis,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/9iwlzg/near_the_bottom_of_the_payscale_in_the_company/,"Hi all,

First, to preserve anonymity I am writing from a disposable account.

Recently I got hired by an IT company as a developer and joined the company based on the recommendation of a  acquaintance(sort of friend-former lead on a previous job that I had a few years ago) who basically convinced me to take the offer from that particular company. 

Now, almost one year later, I found out that I am toward the bottom of the payscale (it is hard to asses how close to the bottom, but I basically don't know yet someone with a lower pay that is in a dev position). In addition to this I understood that  if is to take in consideration the taxes, given that an intern works up to for 6 months, ussualy 3 tho since they are students, and as such pay less taxes due to less months of work, the take home money will be virtually the same with what I take. 

Of course, this situation is rather unplesant at beast and I do believe that I was lowballed. It does worth mentioning that even in this scenario the pay is quite good since. Nether the less I am not happy with this current under-evaluation and a salary level near the level of an intern.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how its best to approach this situation, which is new to me. My first issue is how to approach that acquaintance (since he is in the managerial team) and two with my direct boss. 

Any suggestions are welcomed. Thanks!

We broke up once befause she lost interest but I got her back improving myself and acting like a catch.

Thing is, 2 months ago she got a better job (more cash) that demands her to go with make up on and very nicely dressed. She put on some weight, which got her really prettier (used to be skinny) and to top it up she got boob implants a year ago.

She now posts selfies every other day on instagram, is aways checking her phone, shes got new friends and a whole different attitude. A month ago I got an internship abroad, in Germany from next January (6-12 months, not decided yet). She was shocked, cried, got a little bit closer to me, but after two weeks became diatant again.

I confronted her and she says its about the trip, shes confused and dissapointed that I would chose to leave her, that I commit to such opportunitiea and yet never talk about marriage.

I really dont think the trip is the problem. She suppoeted me even tho ahe was sad, promissed to visit a couple of times and now its a problem again. She keeps acting sluttu on instagram, never posted pictures of the both of us again. I'm losing her and have just three months to build attration again.

So, you guys also think her higher self esteem is to blame or am I beeing crazy?

I feel like an idiot for even writing this, and I feel like an even bigger idiot for feeling these feelings because you’re not mine and you probably never will be, but maybe it’ll finally give me some closure to write it all down. I hope you're well. I see you found somebody who makes you happy, and that honestly makes me happy. You deserve it—I still think that you’re a remarkable person and that you deserve the world.

I also just wanted to say that I miss you, and that I still think about you way more than I should. I should let the past be the past and understand I missed my chance, but I have a hard time letting it go. I think about that time in our first year of college where I met you at that stupid on-campus carnival and how cute I thought you were, and how all I wanted to do was leave my other friends and talk to you. I think a lot about the time I heard you play piano for the first time and how my heart melted. I think a lot about that time we were drinking in my dorm room with my suitemate when you sat down and asked for help back up.  When I drunkenly offered to help, but awkwardly didn’t let go of your hand, you asked, “you want to hold my hand?” I let go, but I didn’t want to. I don’t think you wanted me to, either. I think a lot about that time you went out of your way to come to my silly choir concert, and how pretty you were in that white dress you wore. I think a lot about the day I found out I was going to have to transfer schools halfway across the country, and the absolutely devastated look in your eyes and the way you held me tight and only-half-jokingly asked me not to go when I told you. I guess I never told you (even though we talked about our feelings for one another, as unfeasible as they were with the distance between us, later on), but that same week I was planning on officially asking you out (because I’m a big, nervous moron who didn’t pick up on the obvious signals and do it earlier). Life got in the way and I never got the chance to, and I honestly think I lost one of the best things that could ever have happened to me before I ever had it. Lastly, I think a lot about how my biggest regret of the past year is getting too busy and not making more of an effort to see you when I was back home for my internship last summer. That was so incredibly shitty of me, and “sorry” doesn’t even begin to explain how I feel.

You’re still not mine. You never were, and you probably never will be. You’re your own wonderful, astonishing, fantastic person. I never want you to experience anything other than happiness and joy. I’m trying my best to do the same. I’m not one for living in a fantasy world where things might or might not have worked out, but if I had the chance to go back and do things differently, I would pick you every time. To hear you play piano again. To hold your hand and not let go. To get to kiss those beautiful lips and finally know what they feel like against mine. “The one who got away” is too corny for me, but you always genuinely felt like home to me, and I think we could’ve had something amazing. I would give up a lot and put up with a million Midwestern winters to feel that again. There’s a small part of me that hopes that one day that’s a reality and not just “in a different life.” Until then, I’m in your corner always--even if we don’t talk as much anymore.

Yours,

J"

In the 2.5 years since I graduated college (and became mostly financially independent), I've saved over $8,000. With what I already saved pre-graduation, that brings me to about $22k in my savings account. That's awesome, right? But now I'm wondering if I'm saving TOO much. Two of those years I was in internships that paid $200-$230/week. I also have a car payment of $370/month which meant literally half of my income was going toward the car (but free housing, yay!).  I made it through surprisingly well. This summer, I've worked a seasonal job that pays $18/hr and continued to pay my car bill and rent and put money in savings. I'm about to move back in with my parents (thanks mom and dad) to work a retail job for the winter (just over $11/hr but no rent payment). 
I feel really good about having this money in savings, particularly since my boyfriend and I are planning on settling down in a couple years once we get jobs in the same city. BUT I constantly finding myself thinking that I can't afford things even when I clearly can. I don't like spending money because I feel like I NEED to put it in savings. And once it's there, I feel like I can't touch it because WHAT IF something happens and I suddenly need to pay some outrageous bill? I don't buy many things beyond food because I'm attempting to move into a low waste and minimalist lifestyle. Typically beyond groceries and basic bills, I'll go out to a restaurant 1x/week and a coffee shop as well. Part of the low frequency is due to living in a small town, part of it is due to not wanting to spend money.
I know I'm lucky to have been taught such good habits, but sometimes I wonder if it's unhealthy or just privileged of me to think ""I can't afford it"" when I can. Am I just overthinking this? Or is there a way to work past the fear/anxiety of feeling like I need to put all my money into savings? Is there an ideal amount I should aim to have saved, then allow myself to spend the rest? I'm nervous that I'm going to just continue to save up tons of money and never use it because of this anxiety, but I hate the idea that my life is just about selling my time to watch the number in my savings account go up."

9iz4th,14,2018-09-25,Accident or Child Abuse?,nerdyone123,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9iz4th/accident_or_child_abuse/,"I (F/28) need advice. Or maybe more reassurance of what I should do. 

My ex (M/27) and I split last year due to emotional abuse. We share custody of our almost-two-year-old.

He also has two kids from his past marriage who I love and care about even if we are no longer together.

Recently we had started to see if we could work things out to get back together but the following incidents have me questioning if I want to be with someone like him. 

I work full-time and go to school full-time so my ex has been taking care of our son during the week. He lives with his mom and doesn't work. 

I started noticing when I visited my son during my lunch hours that he wasn't being fed actual food. Mostly snacks like pb&amp;j sandwiches, goldfish crackers, dry cereal, and juice. When I would pick him up, I would ask his dad if he had eaten and there were a lot of times when he hadn't (past 6/7pm).

I also noticed that my ex would sleep until 11am/12pm and would only feed my son/change his diaper when he got up. I know, because I texted him asking him every day to make sure he ate.

The latest incident that has me a little thrown off is that he didn't bathe my son for a whole week....I had to leave my son with him for the week because I was working on the weekend and started an internship aside from school during the week. He said he was going to give him a bath during the week so I assumed he did. He is usually only in diapers because of the heat so it was hard to notice until I checked his ears and his nails and they were the dirtiest I've ever seen them. 

I feel so much guilt for leaving my son with him because I feel like he's not being taken care of properly but I have few other options since my family lives out of state and I can't afford daycare right now. 

Then today.... When I went to pick up my son, I saw that my ex's 6-year-old son had a BIG bruise/bump/black eye on his left eye and a HUGE stye on his right eye. It looked bad (I took pictures).

I asked my ex what happened to him and he said 'he was horsing around with the other kids and bumped himself on the corner of the coffee table'.

I didn't think much of it because his son is pretty adventurous and high energy so it made sense. 

But then.... While my ex was in the room changing my son before I took him, I asked my ex's son what happened?

He said 'my dad told me to do push-ups and I didn't listen so he pushed me with his foot and I hit my eye on the table.'

Umm WHAT?!?!?!?!?

My ex uses push-ups, bear crawls, and squats on the wall as a form of punishment but this was way off. Apparently my ex's son was supposed to be working on homework but he didn't listen and was playing around so my ex told him to get down and do push ups. His son got down on the floor but not fast enough so my ex pushed him down with his foot and ex's son hit his eye on the corner.

Is this child abuse?!?! Honestly I was literally in shock when he told me. I confronted my ex and he admitted that he did, that it was an accident but that he admits it was wrong. 

I left in shock. I'm still in shock. Why would he lie to me? Why would he keep his son from school that day if it was just an accident?

What do I do?!?!? Is it believable that it was a one-time thing? The boy's mom doesn't have custody of them because she's a drug addict so idk what to do because if I were to do anything, the kids would risk the chance of going to Foster care because their mom isn't allowed to have them. 

I'm heartbroken and still in shock. I was giving him one more chance and everything seemed to be going well between us, but this incident blindsided me and I'm so confused. I love that kid. He deserves better. And so does my son. "
9iz69g,19,2018-09-26,"My boyfriend’s Nmom is going to kill him, and I can’t do anything. PLEASE help!!!",vodkabipolar,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9iz69g/my_boyfriends_nmom_is_going_to_kill_him_and_i/,"Background info: Boyfriend and me live a few states apart. BF is trans. Came out as gay in high school and came out as trans later. Mom is insanely catholic and devastated by this. 

Nmom is classic narc and BF is classic scapegoat. She dresses her children in ugly illfitting clothes until they can choose their own, told my boyfriend he was fat and had ‘cow tits’ even though shes’ plus 200 lbs. Calls my boyfriend awful names. She has hit him before but completely denies it. Makes every tragedy about her. She also hates me. A lot. The first time I visited she faked Strep throat so she wouldn’t have to see me. The second time I visited she made dinner and told me “I eat a lot for a young lady” (When I was at the peak of my ED and only weighed 130lbs). I’ve visited about 6 times. Second to most recent she literally escorted her husband out of a room with me because I (think) she was jealous we were speaking. Last visit, after 4 fucking years of knowing me, she asked ash how “whats-her-name” was doing...unknowing that I was listening. Classic narc. Even went as far to cover up BF’s childhood sexual assault to save face.
BF obviously suffers depression, which Nmom makes about her. When she found out he cut in HS she threatened to kill herself. 

BF is 20 now and struggles to leave the house because of Nmom’s grasp on him. For the most part BF has been doing much better with his mental health (the worst being 2 years ago when he was hospitalized, he was doing amazing recently.) Until one week ago when his shitty car broke down. (For reference, he was given a good car by his uncle but his parents decided to give it to BF’s Goldenchild sister and give him a car that WASNT PASSED SAFETY INSPECTION) so he was forced to exit his internship. Mind you, this internship was not required this semester. Parents FLIP their shit on him and scream, he goes into a hard depression and won’t stop telling me he hates himself and he’s ruining his family. He recorded them yelling and I listened.
(A highlight was his dad saying “you want to be a boy? i’ll treat you like a boy!” and yelling at him so hard his voice was hoarse.)
They found out he was suicidal again and yelled AGAIN.

I tried to cheer up BF but he fell asleep—unfortunately I thought he had been in danger so I had to text his mom with a BS excuse about schoolwork if BF was awake. Keep in mind: she never responded.  (I know I shouldn’t have texted her, but Bf  was missing for 3+ hours with no contact and after previous attempts I thought he was dead.)

She grilled BF the next day about why I texted her, BF broke down and confessed he was suicidal.

Today he can’t stop crying and talking about how he hates himself...He’s talking suicidal too. He came home today only to find Nmom tagged him and his two sisters in a ‘happy daughters day’ post which broke him. His best friend (“E”) commented
“Three daughters? 🤔” implying BF was a son, not a daughter.

Suddenly BF tells us Nmom suffered a surprise(!!) asthma attack and is “on the floor crying!”
I call bullshit.

My boyfriend’s Nmom might make him kill himself and I am so scared. I need help. I don’t know what to do and I’m fucking afraid. He’s my best friend of 4+ years and an amazing person. Help me. 

UPDATE: Nmom is going to the ER because she claims she has a punctured lung "

Been poor my whole life, guide me in the right direction please.",Andrew_RKO,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9izgzt/i_graduate_this_fall_moving_to_a_different_state/,"Hello all,

Some quick background:

* First generation immigrant (so excuse my ignorance about what might seem trivial).
* I will be moving from the east coast to one of the southern states.
* My parents just started making around 35K/yr (family of 4).
* I will be making ~100K/yr.
* I have 2 credit cards. One is insured, about to close it, and planning to open a card once I'm in the new state
* I have 30K in my account through saving from high school jobs, summer internships etc.
* No debts. School is paid for through scholarships.
* I will be leaving my car to my sister. 

Here is what I am planning to do: rent in the cheapest place for the first 2 years, then see the situation. My company tend to move people a lot around sites and we have them all over the US and the world. Once I can settle I need to bring my parents with me to wherever i am, get them a house, and kinda of an allowance (am i thinking too far in the future?) Will I have enough money to get myself my own house? 

I am going to need a car for sure, I am leaning towards a used one from a dealership. But since I'm 23, I will probably get a high finance rate and such, what shall I do? Will dealerships take cash/check? Really trying to avoid craigslist as much as possible. 

For the car insurance, I cant be under my father's anymore correct? Since I will be in a different state? I want to keep myself in it, until I buy a car so I don't have an uninsured period, I heard that increase the rates (I got into 2 accidents already &gt;_&lt;) 

Should I rent my furniture or just buy cheap necessary stuff? Any store suggestions? 

Also, I am currently reading about how prepare for 401K, Roth IRA and such, but if you have any suggestions that you want to give me feel free. My company matches 7% of my 6% so I will be putting that in every month. 

Just any suggestions are welcome. 

Thank you!"

I did an unpaid summer internship at a small IT company when I was 16 where I just prepped desktops for deployment and shadowed some of their techs. I am currently a full time student working towards an associates degree in computer networking technology, which I will have at the end of the spring. My certifications are A+, Net+, Sec+, and CCENT. I have been mostly looking for a part time position while I am in school. I have applied to a few places and followed up with them but never got called back for any interviews. I actively look for new networking jobs in my area but I feel really limited to what I can apply to because of my availability, most of the jobs I see are full-time. So, my questions for you are: How did you go about finding networking jobs to apply to? and How did you end up getting the job? Also any general advice in my job hunt would be appreciated. Thanks and have a nice day!"

I haven’t posted in a while so I guess I wanted to give you all an update. (I’am laying in bed, should be sleeping) 

It was recently me and my SO’s 2 year anniversary: Sep. 9, 2016. Still surreal we are still going strong. As of now she is finishing up her last Quarter in college, and will get her BA in Computer Science, and have a job right out of college that came from her internship. Super proud of her. By December she will hopefully be an hour and half away, compared to 6 hours. We kinda agreed I would save money, and not travel to see her, instead she comes down couple times this quarter for doctors appointments so we will see each other then. 

I guess in a way we are slowly closing the distance, I still have 2 years of uni after I transfer, but still close to home, and her when she is back. 

It’s nice seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I’m just hoping I can land a solid job in the federal government possibly BLM working with Plants, or in agency in the Dept. of the Interior. 

All in all we are doing good. I hope you and yours are doing well. "

My girlfriend and I are in a fairly new relationship with each other. We got together about 4 month ago, but have been close since the beginning of the year. She told me that she used to struggle with Anxiety a lot in the past, but I have actually never seen it hit her before so this is quite new to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is constantly crying for 5 days now and I don't know how to help her and I have no idea what to do... Can someone help me understand her and maybe have a few tips on what to say and what can calm her down again?

&amp;#x200B;

So a little backstory to this:

Her parents divorced when she was pretty young. After that she went to a therapist because she started to have panic attacks and was struggeling with anxiety back then. It all went well since then, she got to know that it all comes from bad thoughts that are irrational when she thinks clearly about it, so her anxiety got a lot better and she did not have it for about 3 years now. 

A month ago she started an internship which stresses her out. She does not like it but she has to stay doing it for 5 more months. So because of that her anxiety came back and she is really desperate herself. As I said, she keeps on crying for no reason and she starts to build up a huge pile of stuff that stresses her out even more.

So out of the internship stress she started crying and went on to getting afraid of her parents dying one day and that we will maybe break up someday. And everytime that we have a little dispute, she just thinks to herself that maybe we will eventually break up which stresses her out again. She knows that all those thoughts are coming from her anxiety but she cant the way she feels. Over this she kept on crying for days now and I dont know what to do.

9j0xr7,336,2018-09-26,"Luffy, His Aliases, and Changes in Character.",ImmaIvanoM,OnePiece,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/9j0xr7/luffy_his_aliases_and_changes_in_character/,"
It’s no question that names matter among the pirates in One Piece and Oda has emphasized it with Luffy’s unique way of introducing himself to everyone he meets so when Oda chooses to dispense of Luffy’s actual name, there’s usually something interesting tied to why he does it. I think whenever Oda makes Luffy take up an alias, Luffy intern actually changes character slightly and for a good reason.

The three times this has happened significantly(enough to warrant an Oda Box) are Lucy the gladiator, Luffy-no-Umi the Sumo Aspirant and Luffytaro the Samurai. Granted there’s also Afro Luffy and Nightmare Luffy but then those weren’t personas taken on to fool the people around him so people still know it’s Luffy.

The first two, Lucy and Luffy-no-Umi are aliases used for competitions which as a concept is very diametrically opposed to what pirates are. As seen in the Crocodile and Katakuri fights, there’s no such thing as sportsmanship in the pirate life. And yet, as Luffy-no-umi, Luffy does very strictly adhere to the Sumo rules. He struggles to stay in the ring, only uses open palm strikes and even calls out his opponent for cheating and yet he never said anything during the Flampe incident in the Katakuri fight. Another thing that competitions entail is showmanship, which can be a pirate thing like with Buggy and all but it’s definitely not a Luffy thing. Lucy on the other hand was actively working the crowds during his tournament. This is the same Luffy who couldn’t care less about Bellamy giving him hell at Jaya in front of people but at the Colloseum he was eating up the attention as Lucy.

Last but not least though is Luffytaro, the man Luffy himself said will turn Wano into a paradise again, in true Hero fashion. But we also know that the last time this issue of heroes was brought up, Luffy ended up fighting Jinbei. According to Jinbei, Luffy should’ve attacked Hody at the last possible second, again in true Hero fashion so that Luffy becomes a hero to the Fishmen as opposed to some human pirate who just wanted to beat up a Fishman pirate because humans are just dicks. Of course Jinbei managed to stall Luffy long enough to bring about this outcome but Luffy did it begrudgingly at best and we all remember Luffy’s words about meat and heroes. Then comes Luffytaro recently saying he wants to actually *leave* Wano as a paradise even when he has no actual stake in it once he leaves. This isn’t Luffy wanting all the meat for himself because he won’t be there afterwards. This is him wanting the people to have all the meat once he fights to provide it for them. This is Luffytaro, a Hero.

I suppose you could call these aliases cheap ploys for Oda to get Luffy into certain situations and have him react in certain ways contrary to how he usually is but I think it’s the opposite. Luffy himself said he like heroes, but just didn’t want to be them. This tactic of using aliases to augment his personality is Oda being the most clever when characterizing Luffy. 

Essentially Luffy is in fact a good kid, but he is also not naive at all about the life he chose. He knows the stigma around pirates and knows what is required to be a pirate. But as a good kid, he would want his good actions to be rewarded with applause like at the colloseum. I think he’d prefer fights were more like sports, where rules could apply and winning was based on merit. He is also a likable guy so why wouldn’t he become like an entertainer and work crowds and live off his natural traits other than having to work so hard and fight countless enemies. He also likes helping people and with the right amount of strength, people who help people should be considered heroes. All these things though are almost impossible with the mantle of a pirate and Luffy fully accepts it. Consequentially though Oda also gives Luffy ways to live vicariously through these aliases, paths he can’t really go down now. That’s where the genius of these aliases comes in, they show what Luffy would be like if he lived in the world where he was applauded for his action, was helping people to just be a hero to them, and lived without the turmoil of almost dying by random things out of his control but, Luffy always chooses the pirate life every time after living as these aliases and so reinforces his belief in his way of life as opposed to just settling for those other paths.

Conclusion:
There’s that common discussion about why pirates don’t just sail without Jolly Rogers in order to reach Raftel and not get bothered by Marines or hated by civilians. It’s just because you won’t be a pirate anymore, because pirating is a way of Life in One Piece not just a means to an end(like in our world). Luffy takes up different names at times because situations don’t always need, Luffy, the man who will be king of the pirates, and he is smart enough to recognize that but also wants to see what it’s like to not be the man who will be king of the pirates for a time. This isn’t presented as an internal conflict though by Oda, it’s instead used to reinforce why the man who will be king of pirates is more important because Luffy always leaves those aliases behind nonetheless. Similar to sailing without a Jolly Roger, Luffy could decide to live as a hero(marine or not) and sail to Raftel trying to amass only good will but that will change his core concept of living free as a pirate by shackling him to strict moral courses of action like *NOT* destroying Impel down just to save one man. In this way, he would want the goal of being a pirate without living the pirate life and we know from Sabaody, Luffy wants the pirate life and adventure way more than just ends.

P.S. I couldn’t think of a TL;DR so I’m not sure if I got my message across so well. What do you guys think?"

I have a bit of a dilemma, i applied to the following...

1. A per diem billing job at a different hospital. Pays $21 an hour, its additional income, perfect 2nd job, and it would be my first official job dealing with finances/billing in general.

2. Paid internship with the city's transportation dept. $18/hr, part time, i can stay until i graduate. Its business admin-related, so a mix of clerical, accounting/finance, project proposals, etc.

Heres the thing... I have officially been offered and accepted for #1. I start in 2 weeks. 

But #2 offered me to.come for interview. I have not scheduled as of yet.

Should i just stick with #1 for now since its already set? #2 sounds nice cuz its with the city and what not. But like i said I've already got #1(which is with a top prestigious hospital), i may or may not win #2 (who knows)."

I am currently working on a side project at my internship. I'm a 3D artist and I'm specialized in Maya and Substance Painter/Designer. So I have never touched Revit before.

I received a Revit model of a house and I need to realistically texture it in order to create a VR tour in Unity. I have been able to export the project as an .FBX file, but the topology of the model is really dirty. 

I'm currently fixing and remodeling parts of the model. But I haven't been able to properly UV the model so far. Does anyone have any experience with a revit &gt; maya &gt; substance painter workflow? 

If so, I would like to know if it makes sense for me to continue working on this project. So far it just feels like it's not getting better and I'm afraid revit models simply aren't meant to be used in a game engine like Unity.

I hope my question has been clear. If not, feel free to ask me for additional information. Thanks in advance!"

*Excerpted from*

**A Sad Day in the Neighborhood:**

**Mr. Rogers, Gay Men, and Me**  *by Marc Acito*

I went to college in Pittsburgh, where Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood was filmed, and I once found myself seated near him on a People’s Express flight home. (For those of you who don’t remember People’s Express, it was the first no-frills airline. It was a good deal until the rubber bands broke.)

We disembarked at the same time and, after making the insightful observation that he was indeed Mr. Rogers, I found I had absolutely nothing to say to the man.

Fred Rogers took one look at my off-the- shoulder sweatshirt and leg warmers (it was the 1980’s, okay, give me a break) and politely inquired as to whether I’d seen Torch Song Trilogy. “I hear that Harvey Fierstein is awfully good,” he said.
That’s right, my one and only conversation with Mr. Rogers was about a drag queen.

A couple of years later, my roommate Lisa got an internship on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood and she began a lifelong friendship with Fred Rogers. Lisa’s most cherished memory is of a trip to Boston they made together for a concert. (No, not to see Metallica, he was doing a children’s concert.) Upon arriving at the fancy home of a WGBH executive, the limo driver Billy turned to Fred and asked when he should return to pick them up.

“Why, where are you going?” Fred answered, and promptly invited Billy to join them for dinner, much to the bewilderment of the hostess.

On the way back to the hotel, Fred sat in front, so he could find out more about Billy. When he discovered they’d be passing Billy’s house, Fred suggested they stop in to meet Billy’s parents.

“So there we all are,” Lisa says, “getting out of a limo in the middle of West Roxbury, Massachusetts to meet the driver’s parents. We walk in the door and there’s Billy’s dad coming down the stairs in his bathrobe, a cigarette dangling from his lips. He takes one look at Fred and yells, ‘Holy Sh*t! You’re Mr. Rogers!’”

Think about it. How would you react if you were sitting around on a Friday night and Mr. Rogers came wandering in your front door? Talk about visiting the Land of Make Believe.

“Then suddenly it was like the whole neighborhood showed up,” Lisa says.
“People brought cookies and Fred was playing the piano…it was just magical.”
Billy and his family never forgot that night (who could?), but apparently Fred didn’t either, because a few years later when he learned that Billy was dying of
AIDS, he took time out from his vacation to call the hospital.

Think about it. You’re on your deathbed, and Mr. Rogers calls to comfort you.
That indeed is a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

I don’t know what Mr. Rogers said to Billy, but I’m pretty certain it was the kind of thing that he said to all of us for over thirty years: “You make every day a special day by just being you. There’s no one in the world exactly like you. People can like you just the way you are.”

No wonder the bigots are so threatened."

9j2oz2,2,2018-09-26,"I can't tell if outgoing/extroverted guy (M,28) likes me (F,21)",melonmilkfordays,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9j2oz2/i_cant_tell_if_outgoingextroverted_guy_m28_likes/,"So the full backstory to this:

&amp;#x200B;

My classmate in school (an arts college) 28 is new to my batch. He was away for two years for an internship and came back to join us. Ever since school started, he and I hang out a lot in school, but because he has such a busy lifestyle. After a couple of weeks in school, all of my close friends (guys and girls) are 100% convinced he's hitting on me.

&amp;#x200B;

So far he's done stuff like:

* Be really touchy. (Always suddenly gives me a backrub or hugs me randomly. At one point he was squeezing my cheeks because I complained I had a tooth ache)
* Teases me a lot. He does tend to tease people by nature but I do notice it happening especially more with me. And when I give him an 'annoyed' look whenever he does so, he always gives me a hug (and sometimes a hug from behind)
* Whenever we go drinking and if I get drunk, we always end up holding our hands interlocked while he sends me back home.
* Also when it's super late in general he sends me back home, sober or not.
* Every so often in text, he'd refer to me as ""love""
* Also sometimes when he teases me and I keep asking why he does so, he jokingly would respond with ""because I love you""
* Frequently calls me things like ""cute adorable thing"" or ""hot"" or ""pretty""
* Always gives me a jacket when I'm cold.
* Once in between classes we were both napping on a couch, he propped my legs up on his, and when I slept on his shoulder (and was shivering) he suddenly just grabbed my hand and tried to warm me up.
* I notice on instagram that suddenly his friends (that I've never met) have started regularly checking out my posts.
* Once I needed to get something from a locker we share together but he had the keys with him, he travelled over an hour to get to school (even though he had a fever) just to pass it to me. And he jokingly said that he did so because that's how much I matter.
* Bought me an expensive tumbler from starbucks as a ""birthday present"" even though it's two months away.
* Rests his head on mine when I do nap and lean against his shoulder.
* Even when I don't need his help he'll always just come along to help me with my own projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand there's also a lot of things that tell me he might not like me:

* In general most of his close friends are females (he's a more sensitive guy or so he says) so maybe I'm just another friend to him?
* In the midst of all my friends suspecting he has a thing for me, he suddenly drops that he has a crush on a girl in our class who I hardly see him talk to. (But despite that he always still stuck around me)
* He's a touchy guy in general so even with his close female friends he'd give friendly hugs to them (maybe not at the same frequency as he does with me)
* We're hardly alone outside of school, when we do hang out he always invites me out with his friends, so there's not much alone time with us. 
* When I tried to ask him about why he's always so huggy with me he said it's because I'm like an ""adorable little sister who's just too cute""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm usually much more used to shy/quiet guys hitting on me and if this guy is really hitting on me, it's a first. I can't get a read on him at all because he's just really friendly in general. I wished I had time to spend with him outside of school but he always has another friend to catch up with every other day.

He’s always gone the extra mile for me and been understanding of my situation as a single mother. I’m an IT major and he’s a big supporter of women in IT.  

Even though I’m technically a sophomore this year he suggested I take his junior level class as he thought I was ready for it and he’d give me ‘extra help’ if I ever needed it and to stop by his office anytime. 

I stopped in his office today for extra help and we were just talking and making conversation and he mentioned off hand that he got a brand new BMW and it goes 60 mph in like 6 seconds and if I ever wanted to see it in action he’d be more than happy to show me sometime and I laughed it off it was a little weird but whatever and then a little bit later he’s like I pulled my shoulder working out and my physical therapist fixed it by using this one move and I’m like oh ok...and then he’s like here let me show you and I was like uh ok...and then he starting massaging my neck and back and it was so uncomfortable. I made an excuse to leave but I’m so freaked out by this I’m scared to go to class later today. 

I’m not sure if I should report this or not it’s not like he tried to kiss me or anything serious. But I know I need his help to get through this class. I have no idea what to do. I really don’t have a lot of friends that’s why I came here. My grandma who I live with said ‘I shouldn’t have put myself in that position’ by going to his office alone. 

I just feel really lost right now. I know this isn’t a big deal and I shouldn’t have said ‘ok’ I just froze and I didn’t know what to do or say. He said he’d help me find a job and write recommendation letters for me to find an internship which I really need. I thought I found a professor that I really got along with that could help me out in the future. I just feel disappointed and grossed out now. 

Do I report this? Or should I just wait and see if something else happens and then report.

I'm trying to decide on which course of action would be the most ideal. I graduated with a B.S in Environmental Science and a Certificate in GIS earlier this year. I got a GIS internship with NYC Parks which is good since I eventually want to be a geospatial analyst in the renewable energy sector. 
So I figure that I could do a couple of things:

1. Get a 2 year posbac computer science degree, strengthening my tech skills and GIS skills
2. Become an electrician and work in the solar industry as a solar electrician, valuable experience as for working in renewable energy
3. Just move to California where the job market for GIS is stronger (in NYC now)

I like the stability and practicality of being an electrician. The income of computer science graduates is substantially high, though I'm skeptical about it and seems somewhat ""hyped up."" I just want my next investment of time and money to be secure and well worth it. Any thoughts?

Thanks for reading!"
9j3gvi,3,2018-09-26,Construction Management Senior Looking for Career Path Advice,TheGhoulsAreComing,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/9j3gvi/construction_management_senior_looking_for_career/,"I am a college senior looking for advice &amp; insight from industry professionals. 

Little background before I get into it - I have 3 years of internship experience working for a large commercial GC. Additionally, the program I am enrolled in is focused more towards commercial construction. Finally, I am fairly confident Project Management is the career path I would like to pursue. 

Recently, we had the career fair, and I mainly spoke to commercial GC’s, but a professor recommended I talk to an oil &amp; gas pipeline construction company. 

I had an informal interview with them, and they informed me that I would be starting as a Project Manager mentee, but would move into the role fairly quick. 

It was a relatively small company with a loose structure. Because of this, it sounded like not only would I be managing most of the projects in the state, but I would be helping grow the company too. 

I had a few interviews with commercial GC’s, and I would start out as a Project Engineer/ Field Engineer, should I choose to go into that field of work. 

Certainly, I feel more comfortable going into the commercial industry, and my roles/responsibilities would be different in each career. So for this reason, I thought it would help to get some info. regarding the two. 

**My question(s)**: 
1. Does anyone have any experience working in oil &amp; gas pipeline construction? What were the pros and cons of the industry and your job? 

2. Does anyone have experience in both the the commercial and oil &amp; gas world? What advice would you give me for making my decision? 

**For those working for a commercial GC**: 
1. What have you enjoyed about working with a large GC? What are some negatives? 

2. In your experience, with high performance, is there much room for career growth? 

3. How can I succeed in my role as aProject Engineer? (Preparation coming out of college, tips, what to look for, etc.) 




**Disclaimer**: Obviously, I know I will be working long hours, traveling (pipeline more than commercial), am going to have to earn respect, and will be expected to perform regardless.

**Sorry for the essay, and loaded questions. Hope y’all can help! Thanks!** "
9j3lz5,31,2018-09-26,Scheananigans with Krystal and Chris...,anonymous_koala23,thebachelor,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/9j3lz5/scheananigans_with_krystal_and_chris/,"Have any Vanderpump/Bachelor fans listened to this yet?

Here's the basics I learned from the podcast (sorry it's so long!!!!):

* Scheana invited Chris and Krystal to a gin event for Tom Tom
* Krystal's grandma called Chris, Drake; Scheana knows Drake from Villa Blanca
* Scheana is single
   * She's ""pitching"" to ABC to make her the Bachelorette (not sure if that is a joke or not...)
   * She doesn't want to go on the Bachelorette first; Chris suggests that she should come in during the last four
   * Claims she is the ""unofficial Bachelorette of LA"" having gone on dates with Robby, Chad, and Chase..
   * Took Wills out to dinner after the podcast; they've hung out a few times; she was hoping he was the next Bachelor
   * She DM'ed with Colton to meet up at the Chargers game and thinks he is cute (nothing happened from this); she wished him well on the show and he said he is excited
* Scheana said men are intimated by her because she makes her own money; she previews her new single (the first song she's written)
* Chris didn't know what a goose looked like until Scheana gave her some type of goose gift.
* She says she watches the Bachelor and looks for new friends; the Bachelorette for new guys to date; She told her friend Adam during Becca's season: ""We're not looking for her, we're looking for me""
* The name Goose came from casting
   * The casting people said there was something Chris wasn't telling them so Chris said ""I'm silly, I'm a silly goose"" and then it came from there.
   * Behind cameras they called him that during the Bachelorette season.
* In response to being called the villains, Chris and Krystal said they were just misunderstood (passionate and would tell it like it is)
* Chris compares Krystal to Anna-Nicole Smith; They met the guys who designed Smith's dresses for her wedding. They invited her to come by (that's where the wedding pics came from on Instagram)
* Chris teases that they may already have a wedding date set, but they are keeping it quiet.
* They both said that heading into BIP, they didn't expect to leave engaged. Krystal said she had low expectations and thought she was going home night 1, in comparison to the Bachelor when she was more confident of getting far.
* Krystal said her and Chris bonded over growing up with single Moms. They both had a fear of commitment and didn't necessarily know if they wanted to get married (in their life b/c of it).
* Chris said he's been watching the Bachelor(ette) for the past couple of years and was nominated by his friends. Krystal was nominated by her friend and was called 9 months later (she was an old submission).
   * Krystal said she was dating someone briefly for 2 months and they planned a trip, but she canceled the trip when she got the call (because the relationship wasn't for her).
* Chris and Krystal's thoughts on Tia:
   * Chris said Tia is a good person (he has no hard feelings), but she was just really into Colton (obvious lol). He said they talked about Colton a lot on the one-on-one too.
* Krystal used to be ""DJ K-Doll"". She studied radio and television; She came out of college without any internship experience, because she had to wait tables during school to pay for it. She worked in food and beverage for 13 years. Her first job was a dish-washer at a truck-stop in Montana, that she had to walk 2 miles in the wilderness to.
   * She couldn't get hired in radio/TV because her lack of experience. She eventually got a job in radio (she wanted to work in entertainment television) and worked her way up with night-time DJs. Then she jumped to television and then eventually moved to LA in 2012.
   * She wanted to work for E-News (which is also Scheana's dream job too apparently).
   * The LA scene made her lose herself so she turned to fitness. She realized in a yoga class on her 26th birthday that she wasn't using her potential; She moved to SD in 2014 and pursued her business.
* Krystal has been putting Chris through her Total Body Guide.
* KRYSTAL ADDRESS HER VOICE CHANGE!!
   * She has always delt with vocal chord issues, but she worked at Orange Theory before the Bachelor which was strenuous to her voice (motivation coach). She picked up extra shifts before the Bachelor and lost her voice (she had to whisper because her voice hurt). She admits to turning on her sexy whisper voice though.
* Bar was not open 24 hours on paradise. It usually opened at noon or 4pm. Wells and Yuki would usually be there 4-10pm (they actually bartended). Chris says Wells and Sarah Hyland will bartend at his wedding (don't think Sarah knows that lol).
* When they ""knew"" they were going to be together forever: Chris said he knew when they had their serious talk about Chris needing to be more self-aware. It was a pleasant surprise they got together (they weren't on each other's list coming into paradise).
* ""Intimate sessions""
   * During that fantasy suite clip, that feather Chris used was a goose feather.
   * Chris had a bad stomach flu during the fantasy suite, but he fought through it. They spend the whole night talking during the FS, because they had ""intimate sessions"" prior.
   * Krystal CLARIFIED that producers provide you with whatever you ask for, but I guess they didn't ask for condoms, as Chris said he doesn't like them.
* Jenna and Jordan
   * Chris: Jordan was head over heels for Jenna. Jenna helped Jordan show a different side of himself: an emotional, sensitive side. He thinks in the moment she was having fun and that she probably felt pressured in the moment. Chris said Jordan saw a long future and that maybe Jenna felt something different when she got back. He says we don't know the validity of it, but we've seen the texts. Jenna is denying but that people (RS) who bring those sources to life usually have very strong sources. They love Jordan and support him.
   * Krystal: It was upsetting to hear because they were close to both of them. They ended the journey together and saw the effect that Jenna had on Jordan. Jordan really did love her.
   * Chris: Talks about Reality Steve. Says RS felt like people needed to know and was looking out for Jordan. He hopes that Jenna and Jordan take the positive from the situation about the good time they had together; apply it to future relationships.
   * Krystal and Chris says who knows, maybe they'll get back together. Scheana rips in on this one and says that Jordan deserves better (TRUTH!)
   * Chris said he would rather have Jenna come out, own up to it, and apologize to Jordan.
* Grocery Store Joe on DWTS; Confirms that Joe and Kendall are good.
* They are going on a trip with Angela and Clay to Miami. Chris set them up (which we knew).
* Scheana asks who they would set her up with from BN:
   * Chris says Jason; Scheana says no (WHAT!!!!); Nicky Slicks (Scheana doesn't know who that is)
   * Krystal says Chris Harrison (lmao); then Jorge or Fernando, the other bartender (I am living for this)
* They are both team Colton (Krystal thought it would be Blake)
* ROSE CEREMONY WHEN WILLS DIDN'T GET A ROSE
   * Krystal was going to give her rose to Chris or Kenny – Chris, IF he wasn't going to get a rose otherwise. Bibi was going to give her rose to Wills (it was all planned out). Nobody saw it coming that Wells didn't get the rose. Scheana thinks the producers were involved.
* On things they would change from their seasons:
   * Chris: his headshot; he would have gotten rid of the beard and a fresh cut. (Really? Not the way he treated Becca?)
   * Krystal: her preparation for the Bachelor. She was working on her phone until the minute she went on the show. She wished she took a week off beforehand. "

9j4lxs,18,2018-09-26,[SUCCESS] Office Sex Domination Fantasy [M4F] #Dallas,[deleted],RandomActsOfMuffDive,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfMuffDive/comments/9j4lxs/success_office_sex_domination_fantasy_m4f_dallas/,"I responded to a Dallas RAOMD listing. She was a few years out of college and said she liked being dominated.  We texted back and forth for a week. She had a domination fantasy where she was an intern or interviewing and was taken advantage of by a dominant sexy man in a suit.   

It went down like this.

I was in my best power suit, and  had her text me from our office building entrance  in business clothes at 10pm.  When she did, I took the elevator down and let her in the lobby.

She was petite, a little over five feet tall, with almond eyes and her long black hair was up in a bun.  She was wearing a dark grey business suit and a white blouse and looked a bit nervous, just like a recent college grad going into an interview. We shook hands and she asked if the building had cameras, I shook my head no.

 I said, "" We normally don't interview at this hour, except for exceptional candidates."" This got a smirk out of her and she seemed to relax.


As I let her into the elevator, I got a great rear view of her tight lower body and legs in her skirt and instantly had an urge to wreck that little thing.

I let her into my office offered her some hot tea, and sat down at my desk.  


I said, "" Miss, to be clear we are hiring, but this a high profile position with a prestigious firm, and this will be a thorough interview process.""

She was already better playing at this than I was and replied, "" Yes Sir, it's an incredible opportunity and I feel Passionately that I'm the right fit, and have the flexibility to switch to any POSITION the company needs.""

Then she took off her jacket. She had a pearl necklace and a white blouse buttoned a bit too low.  She took a slow sip of tea, deliberately blowing it cold while looking me straight in the eyes.

I was already hard under the desk, and her cleavage and blowing insinuation was making my imagination run wild at what it would be like to play with her perky little tits and have those little lips wrapped around me.

I said, "" That is all well and good Miss, but there will be stiff competition for this position.  I need someone who will bend over backwards for this role, any time It's needed.  Someone who will do whatever it takes.""

My she was good, she replied, "" Yes Sir, absolutely, I crave Stiff competition, and I want this job so bad I can taste it, Sir.""

I replied, "" I see, we need you to score high on the oral examination, and then make sure you have the flexibility the position requires.""

Then I slid my chair back and turned it sideways behind the desk. She smiled sexily and came around the desk, kneeling between my legs.

She stroked my cock through my slacks, and purred, "" I'm the right girl for this job Sir."" 

I noticed her red nails as she unzipped me and started a sloppy blowjob.  It was so hot with her hair up and the pearls. I was caressing her hair and ran a hand down to free a hard little nipple from her bra.  Then she deepthroated me while fondling my balls, it was intense and I came so hard my vision blurred for a second.  

She smiled and asked, "" Did I pass the oral examination sir?""

Boy did she ever. "" I said yes, but there are still the positional requirements.""

I led her to the conference room, there was a big table and a great view of the city skyline.  At the window she said, "" Great view."" I came up behind her cupping her neck and slid a rough hand up her skirt. 

"" You haven't got the job yet Miss, "" I said.

I pushed her back onto the conference table, kissed and teased her naked and then went down on her slowly for a long time until she squealed and her little thighs tightened around my head.  


Then I flipped her over, undid her hair bun and pushed her face down onto the table. She was a tight little thing just as I'd imagined but good and wet. I grabbed a big handful of long black hair hair and gave her rough Doggystyle with my thumb in her ass until we both collapsed in a gasping heap.

We got dressed, cleaned up a bit and she asked "" Did I get the job Sir?""

I said, "" Yes, yes you definitely did.""

As we left the building I offered an escort  to her car saying, "" There could be all sorts of perverts out at this hour.""

She thought that was hilarious and let me.

We have talked since and it seems there might turn be more to come...


We are still hiring ;-)

It was my first real job, I was so excited. It didn’t matter that everyone called me the intern. I knew better and I did a really good job. Little did I know that the colleague, the one I didn’t know until he approached me, asked me to join a work trip with him, and I had to. It was all okay, until I woke up one night, him having come in my room, touching me. My worst fear coming true. The next morning, he and some friends of him forced me to listen to him, for an hour! They blocked the door, I couldn’t get out. I was so scared, while they kept telling me, that I should be ashamed of myself, I shouldn’t be overreacting, nothing happened, nobody’s going to believe me and more. But that didn’t stop me from calling the police. And my work place. I had to. He works with teenagers, only 3-4 years younger than me, going on trips with them (like this one). I worried for them, so I told my work place. That’s when the worst 2 months of my life started, I was made fun of, ridiculed, ignored, told some really nasty stuff by colleagues... And, I was also completely alone, as I was not in my home country. Mom, I know you expected me to be all better now that I’m back. But I only got worse, only when being back home did I realize, that for 2 months I barely ate and slept, I barely had a minute not fighting for what’s right, while everyone tried to break me to make me stop fighting. Mom, I’m so sorry and I feel like a failure, but I’m not better. I’m still scared at night. I sometimes am enraged, seemingly without a reason. There are days where getting up seems impossible as dark thoughts filled my dreams and haunted me. I sometimes suddenly, get sad and lost within me. I can’t help it. I’m really trying, I think I’m making progress. But how can I make progress, when I still have to fight with my former employer about some issues surrounding the event? How can I get better, when I’m still denied to move on. When I still am fighting all alone. When no one’s there to support me. I wish I could talk to you, tell you at least that no, I’m not fine. But every time I say something you’re simply telling me to stop lamenting. 
Mom, I’m so sorry I involved you in this. I’m deeply sorry about calling you that night, no mom should get a call like this in the middle of the night. 
But also, no daughter should have to make it.
I’m still not over it. 
I’m sorry, so sorry. Mom, I need you.

9j6hyz,7,2018-09-26,"Headaches everyday for months, nothing has worked!",girlscout_mafia,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/9j6hyz/headaches_everyday_for_months_nothing_has_worked/,"Hello! I am a white 21 year old female. Height 5’2”, weight 120 pounds. 

Since May 2018, so for about 4.5 months now, I have been getting headaches that really interfere with my ability to enjoy life. Seen many doctors but they’ve mainly told me headaches are just one of those tricky things that are really hard to diagnose. I’ve been trying to monitor them as much as possible, so here is a ton of info:

I am in my first month of my senior year of college currently and they started toward the end of my spring semester junior year. When they first started they were about once a week for 1-2 days, but over the summer the got progressively worse until they were happening every day. 

Nothing over the counter has helped, weirdly. Advil, excedrin, Tylenol, etc. They might work for 15 minutes or so but that’s it.

Over the summer I had two jobs. One wasn’t new, I work teaching kids to read. I used a computer for this one, looking back and forth between the kid and the computer. I worked this from 8-12. My other job I worked from 1-5 as a content intern for a digital marketing firm. I basically stared at a computer the whole time for this one. I worked both of these Monday through Friday. 

Thinking the headaches might be from too much blue light from the computers, I bought blue-blocking glasses but they haven’t done anything.

I’m in school again now (I go to George Mason University in fairfax, Virginia) and the severity and frequency of the headaches is still getting worse. Times I’ve noticed they get the worse is when I’m in class, particularly if a projector is being used, when I’m driving for long distances, at parties (whether or not I drink smoke pot doesn’t change much.) 

Two years ago in January 2016 I got a concussion. This concussion caused my pupils to change sizes frequently causing me to feel a bit dizzy, and i has some memory and focus issues for months. After seeing a bunch of doctors, one told me my pupil muscles had been damaged and gave me this eye therapy computer software to do everyday. I did this every day for 2 months and then the software said my therapy was complete. Although I noticwd my pupils being different sizes a lot less frequently, they still to this day occasionally shift especially in dim lighting or if I havent gotten enough sleep. 

I got my eye prescription updated in May when the headaches started and it was the same as it has always been. My prescription is -.25 just in my left eye. It’s a really minimal prescription but I still wear a contact lens in one eye and glasses sometimes. 

The headaches are generally in my forehead and a dull pain that, while making it hard for me to be cheerful, hasn’t presented any other major symptoms (vomiting, passing out), other than maybe a little nausea, but that might be psychosomatic. 

I rarely wake up with the headaches. They begin generally in the afternoon and get really bad in the evening before I go to bed. Despite never waking up with headaches, I’ve been told I grind my teeth in my sleep so i got a mouth guard that I wear at night, but it hasn’t seemed to help.

When I look up and to the right, especially at night, it hurts my eyes and my headache gets immediately worse. If i look to the right my left eye gets this pulse of pain through it, then the pain sort of seeps into my forehead. I strongly suspect it has something to do with my eyes but I cant find anything about it online.

TLDR: 
*dull headaches in forehead area. 
*start in afternoon and get worse until I go to bed
*hurts when I look up or off to the side , pulsing in my left eye then staying in my forehead

I am a 22 year old college student, working part time, and starting an internship.

My commute is long and the current car I'm driving is falling apart.

I am looking for advice on whether I should lease or finance.

Here is my position:

No money for down payment or TTL

770 FICO 

$2,500 gross monthly income


I was initially looking to lease for $0 down but the amount I'd be driving would be too much, 20,000 miles annually.

If I do lease and I go over my allotted miles, am I stuck with that extra cost or can dealerships work with you if you lease/finance another car with them?

As far as financing goes, I don't have any money for tax, title, and fees let alone a down payment!
I would be forced to look at $0 down options with a 72 month term.

-Job postings on Monster /LinkedIn /Glassdoor and other sites have specifically stated the requirements as ""Require local candidates only. Company won't be sponsoring visas"" and these are 85% of the total jobs and increasing by the day 
-Career fairs and campus recruitment events invite companies who just take the resumes of candidates and only about 10% get any response or calls
-In general because of the political climate and not because of any concrete policy changes since nothing major has changed, companies are wary of sponsoring H1B's due to increasing paperwork, filing fees and denials based on RFE's
-Possibility of H4 EADs being revoked by the end of this year which spells the end of working life of the spouses hence they are unable to plan marriage in future 
-Shady contracting agencies and companies abusing visas which has unfortunately stereotyped all candidates requiring sponsorship as untrustworthy 

They are advising me not to come to US as STEM fields are anyway over saturated and getting a job is really difficult. As per my own research I see thousands of job postings that are relevant to my experience and I consider myself as among the top 20 percent in my class so is the situation seriously that bad that I shouldn't be taking a chance? 

I don't want to be over confident, end up taking a loan and regret later. But as far as I am aware, US has always been the land of opportunity when it comes to technology 

Looking out for some opinions from students, local employees, entrepreneurs and faculty on the general situation there at this time. Thanks!

Super excited for the next step of extreme saving and investing!!!

Some background first - I grew up dirt poor and experienced 6 moves and 3 divorces while growing up. Despite the odds, I managed to start digging myself out of bad habits junior year of high school (sitting at a 1.7 GPA at the time), build good study habits, and graduate with a 2.7GPA. From there I got rejected from ASU which has an 80% acceptance rate, and ended up in community college. Aced CC and found the perfect uni that would accept me, poured an entire semester into a single college application (to that uni), and got accepted into their top 10 CS program.

Used the first year of out-of-state tuition (bleh expensive) to get my foot in the door, and took a leave-of-absence to establish residency working. Worked paycheck to paycheck for 12 months and re-admitted (woohoo! instate tuition!), finished up my junior year and interned at a startup. Did senior year and graduated with a solid 3.4GPA, rejected my CS offers and instead interned in a design internship. Was life-changing and steered me towards frontend development and I used that experience to get my first job which bounces between UX design and frontend development (weird right?)! First job means big $$$ for the first time in my life.

This year I've finally, in the first time in my life, felt like I'm finally able to define my life and start thinking about how to thrive, not survive. I went a little crazy in the first 4 months of working and I spent like I've never spent before and lived very glamorously. Got that out of my system and am finally easing back into my old frugal ways, and since then I've decided to address my student loans and start delving into investment.

Thanks to the resources of these subreddits, I've settled into a budget for all my expenses, established my 401k and Roth IRA, determined proper loan payments, and will have a positive net value by the end of 2018. I've learned so much about saving, investing, and frugal lifestyle changes, and i'm extremely thankful for everybody who's contributed. Y'all are fantastic and you've helped me out so much in finding financial purpose in the post-grad life. I've always wanted to be here, and though it's just the beginning of my journey, y'all have set me up for success!"
9j6uld,0,2018-09-26,Incentive To Live Free,extremesecrecy,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/9j6uld/incentive_to_live_free/,"Mr. Debtalot owes 150k dollars in student loans directly to the Federal government. Hi interest rate is an awesome 5.7%. He just hit real life and must chose what to do.

Option A - Work, Work, Work!

Being a great student, he scores a great internship!!! 40 dollars an hour! WHAT? Nice. That is approximately, 80k a year. (Rough estimate.)

According to [studentloanhero.com](https://studentloanhero.com), he can pay one of these options...**STANDARD - $1,643**

**IBR - $774**

**ICR - $1132**

**PAYE - $516**

**REPAYE -  $516**

So...he thinks, great! $516. I make $3,200! Every two weeks!! (Wrong...) Living in California...The check is really \[(3,200-(500 healthcare)-(224 retirement))\*(.73 from taxes)\] = $1,807.48. Approximate 3,614.96 a month!????

Mr. Debtalot needs a car to get to work. $250

The car needs insurance. $120

The car needs gas. $40 per week. (4 weeks.)  $160

Mr. Debalot needs food a month. (12 dollars a day 31 days) $372

Single room apartment: $1500.

Apartment needs utilities: $200.

School Loan: $516

....What? I have $3,118 in expenses? I have $496.96 for cloths or other things I need...For 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the government going to help me? I make more than 80k...I don't qualify...

&amp;#x200B;

Option B - Go back home, work at Walmart.

10 dollars an hour. Drive my bike to work. No healthcare, because I am healthy and Obamacare is gone...ha!

**STANDARD - $1,643**

**IBR - $24**

**ICR - $132**

**PAYE - $16**

**REPAYE -  $16**

&amp;#x200B;

$800 a paycheck...we are still in CA, so $640 (80% I keep), so $1,280.....AND...I qualify for my deduction!! So thanks for the 2500 deduction on my income taxes I am now going on a trip to Hawaii!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What is this rant about? Why do we have to care about Mr. Debalot? Simple. The whole system has been configured to help those that cannot stand up and work to pay up their school loans. But, in doing so, we have create a huge incentive to stop from trying to pay the school loans. For those that work hard, they will work without ""living"". For those that don't work hard or plan to pay their school loans get rewarded for not being contributing members of our society. Those that have the money to try to pay are not helped or encouraged to pay. Those that don't pay are rewarded.

&amp;#x200B;

Can we afford as a country to just wash away everyone's school loans? Can we continue to allow schools sell diplomas that will never earn enough to live and pay the school loans? How do we encourage ""work, work, work"" as a behavior again?

&amp;#x200B;

How can we convince people that when parents say ""You can be whatever you want, rock star/ princess!"" they really mean that ""If you work your ass, cry some nights, work night shifts, study night and day, sacrifice, bear some pains, you can have a chance to get to your dream.""

&amp;#x200B;

Off my chest. Who wants to pay my 180k student loan? I want to go back to working only one job. :)

9j6wgg,13,2018-09-26,Take the WotB Facial Recognition Quiz!,veganmark,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/9j6wgg/take_the_wotb_facial_recognition_quiz/,"See the 3 photos posted here:

https://www.rt.com/uk/439556-bellingcat-identification-salisbury-suspect/

You tell me: is person #1 (Chepiga) identical to person #2 (Boshirov)?

Maybe I'm cockeyed, but it seems to me that Chepiga has a broader, squatter face.  And his nose is shorter, a bit more pug-nosed - unless his head is tilted back.  (Although maybe it grew a bit over the years owing to all the lying he had to do for the Evil Empire.)  His ears appear to protrude slightly more.  And the centers of his eyes are definitely farther apart.

In fact, join me in being an amateur Sherlock.  Print out the first page of the above article - with the 3 photos.  Then, on a sheet of paper, mark off the distance between the centers of #1's eyes.  Then superimpose that on the photo of #2.  The interocular distance is definitely greater in #1.  Then do the same with #2 and #3 - mark off the distance between the eyes in #2, and compare it to that in #3.  #1 is definitely different than #2/3; whereas #2 and #3 are indistinguishable in this respect.  

And yet the identity of #1 and #2 (#3 is a more recent photo of #2) is the entire substance of Bellingcat's new claim that the Salisbury suspect Boshirov is actually a decorated colonel in the GRU named Chepiga.  The British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson issued a tweet congratulating Bellingcat on their brilliant discovery - which tweet was mysteriously taken down soon afterwards.

https://www.rt.com/uk/439559-williamson-tweet-skripal-bellingcat/  

Bellingcat is an affiliate of NATO and the Atlantic Council that concocts ""evidence"" for whatever slander NATO invents targeting Russia and its allies.  Its assertions regarding Assad ""gassing his own people"" and Russian shooting down MH17 have been debunked by credible analysts.  Most recently, Bellingcat collaborated with the NYT to ""demonstrate"" that the Syrian army bombed Douma with chlorine; hilarity ensued.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/24/world/middleeast/douma-syria-chemical-attack-augmented-reality-ar-ul.html

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/25/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-attack-douma.html?mtrref=search.yahoo.com&amp;gwh=585DE50B0A48569F9A290BE041A81BD6&amp;gwt=pay

What Bellingcat did to unmask the ""true identity"" of Boshirov was to cull through passport photos of graduates of Russian military academies who were roughly the same age as Boshirov, and identify one which looked somewhat like Boshirov.  As it turns out, Chepiga is a Colonel in the GRU who, in 2014, was awarded Russia's highest honor, the Hero of Russia; this honor is usually awarded by the President himself.  Bellingcat notes that it would be unusual for a military man of such stature to be sent on a murder escapade; hence, they conclude that he was chosen for the mission by Putin himself.  No doubt Putin also recommended the dive of a hotel he stayed in in London, and the prostitute that he shared with his great pal Petrov.  

In any case, if you are certain that person #1 is identical to person #2, you may have a bright future with Bellingcat - check to see if they need interns."

#General Information and Kinks

IRL I am an early 20s M from the UK. I'm happy to play with any gender/age/location playing as any gender/age/location (as long as you're 18+ in both RP and IRL). 

In RPs, I play M, F and T characters. I generally prefer to play submissive characters, although I will occasionally play dominant F and T characters too. I like to play long-term RPs, with lots of emphasis on detail, build-up and tension before eventually reaching an explosive and messy climax. If you start up an RP with me, expect to spend a few days or weeks building up the story before we finally get to sex, although I'm sometimes open to playing slightly quicker RPs. I also like RPs which are constructed mutually, so regardless of whether I'm a sub or a dom I like to regularly go out-of-RP to discuss our next move. To facilitate this, I often play RPs in an episodic fashion, allowing us to plan episodes then play them out. 

I have a wide variety of kinks which are often dependent on the gender I'm playing. Below I'll post my broad kinks and limits. Not all kinks will always be relevant, just I'd always like the avoid my limits. 

My main kinks are romance, feminisation, incest, cumplay/bukkake/gokkun, D/s (with me as the s) outfits and lingerie, build-up, free use, taking orders, name calling and group sex. My limits are u18s, excessive pain, non-con and skat/watersports. 

If you'd like some examples of my writing, then click on some of my prompts, where I usually include a quick introduction showing my writing style. 

I try to respond at least once per day, although sometimes real life will get in the way. I write in the first person present, and generally try to write detail, liking around 3 paragraphs per response (although of course that fluctuates).

Below are a list of most of my prompts, with those closer to the top of each section being most recent (which means if you're looking for a sample of my writing, the most recent ones are probably best). I'm open to playing out most of these prompts, discussing a variation of them, or creating an entirely new prompt based on their fundamentals. So if anything catches your eye, feel free to shoot me a message about it.

#M4A

In M4A prompts I almost always like to play submissive younger men in feminisation scenarios. Whether I'm someone working for you in the office, the neighbour's kid, or your own son, by the mid-point of the RP I'm going to be dressed up like a girl taking something big in my rear. 

In feminisation prompts, I prefer the feminisation to be realistic and long-term. It has to be believable that my character will not just put on women's clothes, but that they will actively *enjoy* it. Usually I like to plan a couple of episodes out for this, with each episode pushing the feminisation a step further. I only like directly sexual activities once the feminisation is fully completed. 

I'm happy to play with either M, T or F in these prompts. I especially like these prompts involving incest, or at least involving Mommy or Daddy kinks. I also like these prompts to involve a level of romance. 

Here are some examples of these prompts:

#T4A

I have usually used T4A for prompts where I am already secretly interested in cross-dressing, and another character exploits that. However, any prompt that is listed as F4A is also available as T4A. If I am a sub T, I am not interested in having my cock sucked, or played with in any way other than perhaps handjobs. However, if I am a dom T, I am happy to use my cock in any and all ways.

#F4A

My F4A prompts have usually revolved around incest in some way, either involving Daddy-Daughter or Mother-Son relationships. In these prompts I much prefer to be a sub who is slowly seduced by a loving relative. I'm also open to playing out non-incest prompts, especially those revolving around a profession or setting gimmick (teacher-student, boss-secretary, B&amp;B owner, etc.). But generally I enjoy including either Mommy-kinks or Daddy-kinks, regardless of whether it's proper incest or not.

But long distance isn't something that comes easily. I was in a long distance relationship for 2 years prior to meeting my current boyfriend.

Anyway, she flew half way across the continent a couple weeks ago to hang out with one of her life-long best friends. She posted selfies with her and I thought she was really cute so I asked her about her.  Obviously she has an absolute \*ton\* of bias but her friend sounds awesome (like pretty much textbook what I'm looking for in a partner). She just finished up an internship, and she's on her way back to my area and I should meet her within the next month or so. \[My best friend's girlfriend\] thinks that I would be great for her, and is really excited to introduce us to each other. She said that she thinks the probability that we'll end up really liking each other is pretty high.  


Obviously I'm not putting my social life on pause. I'm still keeping my options open and I'm still on dating websites, but I can't help but feel really excited to meet this girl -- obviously that's pretty dumb, and part of the reason why I made this post. I feel like this excitement is unnatural considering I've only \*heard\* about this girl, and I don't want to come across as creepy or desperate or create incredibly unrealistic expectations for her.  


And of course there is always the chance she won't even be interested in me to begin with!

I moved out of my parents house in June after I graduated and found a nice job in a decently sized city; it's only about an hour away from where my parents lived. I was going through a tough time earlier in the year because I felt that a lot of my friends didn't really appreciate me or even cared if I was around. 

I decided I wouldn't contact them unless they contacted me first and I didn't hear anything from them until I graduated. I saw them going out on social media and not inviting me quite often, but I put it behind me fairly quickly since I just kind of stopped caring. I didn't want to just be friendless, so I joined meetup and found this group for young people in the city I would eventually move to. 

I went there open minded and got to know some of the people there. They were really nice and would invite me to come visit and hang out with them from time to time which was nice. At the time I was an intern still in school and living with my parents, so I didn't really feel like I was on the same level as them since they all lived alone and had some kind of serious job.

I got a really nice and well paying engineering job and moved to the city, but it wasn't really what I expected. I guess I was hoping to kind of take the next step in the friendships and have some people who were more than just people I hung out with. They still invite me to things and I invite them over to my condo to pregame since I live in downtown, but that just seems like the end of it. When we're not hanging out, I don't really talk to them.

I'll try to strike up a conversation from time to time, but I usually feel uncomfortable and that I'm bothering them. When we hang out a few of them will have some conversations and I'll try to inject and usually no one acknowledges it or just says ""cool"". I still go to meetups and talk to new people, but the conversations usually end after we tell each other our names and what brought us here. Then I'll see the same person go talk to someone else and have a really in depth conversation.

I try to talk to woman we meet when we go out and have similar results. I think I'm a fairly attractive guy and carry myself well; clean well fitting clothes, good hygiene, atheletic, and the my small group of friends I still had at home thought I was funny and interesting.

 I had only ever been in one serious relationship that ended last year and we were together for 3 years; it wasn't a bad breakup or anything, but we don't talk that much anymore. My ex seemed to always be interested in what I had to say or asked for my opinion even before we were dating. 

I don't know if I'm just lonely or lack of confidence, but I just feel like no one wants to get to know more about me. Like if I text somebody I always feel like I have to watch what I say in fear of coming off weird. For example I have a really good friend who lives across the country and I'll send her memes or tell her about something ridiculous that happened and she does the same. I don't really get that connection with the people I meet now and it's becoming a common occurrence.

9j85lw,1,2018-09-26,Getting Over My (Gay) Best Friend -- Any Tips?,AFriendlyThrow,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/9j85lw/getting_over_my_gay_best_friend_any_tips/,"Towards the end of college (I’m now a year out) I developed a crush on one of my best friends. I told him about it, and he didn’t feel similarly, and though it was a bit awkward for a while, we kept being great friends. After graduation, we went our separate ways – I ended up in NYC and he went to grad school in California – but we still texted &amp; talked regularly.

I don’t want to sugar coat things. It sucked for a few months, but I was eventually able to get over it and move on.

Fast forward to this summer. He got an internship in NYC, and I couldn’t wait to hang out with him again. Within a week of him getting here, however, he got a bf from the area. Things moved SUPER quickly – he was referring to this guy as his bf before the second date and they got to “I love you” within three weeks. 

All of a sudden, the same insecurities of mine from before flooded back. We still hung out frequently, but I felt like we didn’t connect the same way as before. I felt very awkward throughout the whole summer. Any time we hung out, one of the biggest conversation topics was always his relationship and bf.

He’s since been gone for a month, and it's been hard moving on. One thing that’s hard is I feel like I’m loosing him as a best friend as well – we literally haven’t talked and have barely texted since he left.  

With all this in mind, two questions:

1) Am I valid in my feelings, or do I just need to get over myself? I feel like, as a friend, I should be happy for him, but that’s been hard.

2) Any tips for getting over this?"
9j8vkk,11,2018-09-26,Question for Expat and Mixed Couples,hanoi88,shanghai,https://www.reddit.com/r/shanghai/comments/9j8vkk/question_for_expat_and_mixed_couples/,"Do you plan to live long-term in China or move back to your home country? Especially for those of you with kids.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose a few things happened recently that really made me think about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Government is becoming more oppressive in noticeable ways. You can really feel it now: re-education camps in XinJiang, building a huge surveillance system, getting a facial-recognition friendly image of your face (at border or when registering an account with baidu are just 2 ways), again taking a photo of you everytime you check in to a hotel, although we cannot be sure what it will really entail it's clear they are preparing for some sort of social credit system. They can now connect your phone number and face to your passport number. It's won't be hard to track your every move once all cameras have facial recognition.

&amp;#x200B;

And I just think, since he's young they don't ask us for our kid's photo etc.; but at some age it will be required of him aswell. How are we going to feel the first time he needs to stare into a camera and his face be captured by the matrix? What will his life be like here being in the eye of a camera anywhere in public? Will he and people his age just brush it off, or over time will it have some psychological impact on them? Is it responsible to bring up a child in a society like that?

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand I'd say there are a few things China has going for it, and they are mostly to do with daily life:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Better public transport/high speed trains etc. than back home

\- Depending on which city you live (in my case Shenzhen) air quality is improving and am not worried about this

\- Convenience of life (everything ordered from your phone)

\- Lots of things to do/travel

\- Presuming an international/good private school would not be too worried about education, in fact would say the international schools beat any public system back home

\- No drug problem in schools

\- Generally safe cities

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is my wife's family. If we leave China is it as if we are leaving them behind? 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we're in Shenzhen, moving to Hong Kong is an option. Then again, Hong Kong is quickly being integrated back into mainland anyway so not sure how long it would be before social credit system/surveillance etc. reach there. Unfortunately my wife would also experience some discrimination from some Hong Kongers simply for being from the mainland.

&amp;#x200B;

And moving back to my own country? That would be a big decision. Met my wife in China and she has never had any real desire to settle down outside China. She would be open to it, but life is much different there. Slower pace of life would mean she would find it boring. Not as advanced interns of public transport and daily conveniences I mentioned above. Although fluent in English its still a new culture for her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure some of you have had similar conversations with yourself. Would like to hear your thoughts.

That being said I am here because I want to get into the actuarial sciences. But I am worried about my chances of actually becoming an actuary in the near future because of my resume:  


* 2.7 GPA
* Just failed Exam P this month (going for it again early November)
* No internships or work experience apart from part time jobs
* No networks aside from a friend who is in the field who I haven't spoke too much on the subject besides passing tests.
* I have computer science knowledge at the very least
* I was devoted in a competitive club sport and was on cabinet

I have lived my college-career as practically a failure. But I have hope and I'm trying to take my losses as an opportunity to grow and learn instead of how I usually went about it in college, making excuses and telling myself I'm not smart enough. If there is anyone who can give me some advice, resources, or analyze my situation to see where I stand, I would be forever grateful.   


In addition, I am looking into developing skill sets (i.e. what computer languages/programs I should learn to increase my odds of landing an actuary or financial internship).

9j9jgn,753,2018-09-26,"My fiancé (29M) and I (26F) treated my sister and her friend (20F, 21M) to a weekend trip to the mountains. We got drunk, high, and fucked in front of each other in the same room.",Novel_Persimmon,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/9j9jgn/my_fiancé_29m_and_i_26f_treated_my_sister_and_her/,"I'll start by giving my fiancé some credit for prompting me to write this and for cleaning up and embellishing the language....

 

So back over the summer my fiancé (29M) and I (26F) decided we would get a cabin in the Adirondacks to surprise my little sister (20F) and her best friend/ on-off boyfriend/friends with benefits (21M) with a before school weekend trip. We rented a cool little spot on a lake that was kinda rustic: a kitchen, den, one bed room with two beds, a bathroom, and a screened in porch.

Physically, I think our group was pretty attractive. My sister and I are both 5’6 and brunette. I’m a little more stout, longer in the torso with wider hips and a bigger ass and tits (D cups). She is thinner with gorgeous long legs, which I have been really jealous about. Her boobs are smaller, right at the board of a B/C cup, and she has a few tats on her shoulder, ankle, and below one breast. While I trimmed, she waxed everything. My fiancé is 5’10, a sinewy crossfit nut with sandy brown hair. He has a impressive penis at 7.5 inches and a good bit thicker than average. My sister’s friend – whatever their relationship is – is about 6’2,  very muscular as a former football star at her college with a penis similar in size to my fiancé’s.  

I consider my relationship with my sister to be good because we text all the time and are great emotional support for each other. In college, I was a lot like her: impulsive, social, focused on having fun. Having graduated a few years ago, I’ve had the chance to grow up a little and I often chide her to focus on the school work and internships I neglected. I enjoy being the responsible older sister and having landed a good job, it has been awesome to occasionally treat her to cool things like the trip to the woods.

We spent most of the day hiking and canoeing around the lake. My fiancé and her friend were both big football fans so they got along great. In the evening, they cooked steaks over the fire while my sister and I worked on the rest of the meal inside. Eventually, we settled down around the fire and started working through the beer and liquor we brought with us. 

After a while, my sister’s friend broke out some molly, took some, and asked us if we wanted any. My sister, who is a big partier, took some and told me to give it a shot. I had only done it once before when I tried to impress my friends at a Cold Play concert in high school - and had been so thirsty I thought I was going to die. My fiancé took some, which surprised me because he was always really judgmental about anything of the sort since I knew him. I relented and took some as well. 

Eventually, the fire burned out. It was chilly, and my sister and I were both sitting on the laps of our guys. The molly and a lot of crown and coke had me feeling super relaxed, and I distinctly feeling like the molly had really amplified the cicadas to the point where they seemed like they were inside my head. Everyone got pretty quiet as the fire reduced to glowing coals.

Things got a bit hazy after that. I remember watching as my sister’s friend slid his hand into her leggings as she sat on his lap, and her leaning her head back on his shoulder a he fingered her slowly. I remember feeling my fiancé’s cock get hard and press against my ass as we watched them in the soft glow. I wanted his dick inside me, and grabbed his hand and walked inside the cabin.

I knelt down in front of him and gave him very aggressive head, nearly taking him over the edge several times, but stopping just short. He told me he wanted to feel himself inside me, when my sister and her friend stumbled into the room. She was naked already and her legs looked incredible as she pushed him over the bed and begin to suck on his cock. I slid my hand into my shorts and fingered myself as I went back to sucking on my fiancé. All of our moans comingled, and I distinctly remember the hair on the back of my neck standing up because I was so aroused.

Next thing I knew my fiancé was pulling me to my feet, kissing me, taking my clothes off and tossing them on the floor. My sister’s friends commented on how nice and big my tits were, so I leaned over him while my sister sucked on his cock. He fondled my boobs until I felt my fiancé push himself inside me. On molly, the feeling of his size was noticeably amplified. We waddled, his cock inside me, over to the bed where he began to fuck me. When my sister said she wanted to see, we got on the bed so they could see the profile of him behind me.

Much of the rest of the night seemed to run together but specific snippets run together:

At some point, my sister climbed on top of her friend and began to ride him hard. I remember thinking that her hips moved very smoothly and that she was an incredible rider. My fiancé and I switched positions to do the same. As I stood up beside the bed to get on top of him, I watched her long legs and firm ass press forward and back.  I reached out and slapped her right across the tanlines on her ass cheeks. “Fuck yes,” she moaned. I slapped again on the other cheek. “You slap me,” she said to my fiancé. So he did, and she leaned over and lifted her ass off her friend’s cock a little so we could both slap again. As she lifted her ass, her friend’s cock accelerated. His balls slapped against her, and you could hear her getting wetter. My fiancé put me on top of him, and in a few minutes, my sisters friend and he were engaged in a race to see who could make us moan louder and fuck us faster. 

As my sister was nearly done riding her friend, my fiancé was going down on me, and I had just climaxed. I got up so he could put me in whatever position he wanted. My sister hopped off her friend’s dick. It was shiny from her wetness. For a brief second, I nearly swooped in and wrapped my lips around it. I could almost feel it’s weight in my mouth. But my sister began bobbing up and down on him and I immediately turned around to give my fiancé head. My fiancé complimented my sister on her skills as she deepthroated her friend, and as she got up to change positions she took a detour to kneel beside me. She tried grabbed his penis so I would stop blowing him – and I assume so she could start. My fiancé brushed her hand away and explained she had to suck on her friend and not him. She got up, and he slapped her ass she walked away toward the other bed.

A while later, my fiancé put pillows under my hips and proceeded to fuck my while I lay facedown in front of him. It was a position that normally caused me to have long, intense orgasms, and the molly made it so intensely pleasurable it bordered on pain. My sisters friend, who was on top of my sister’s writhing form, paused his thrusting while he looked over at us. “Let’s do that. I want to fuck you like her,” he said.  I watched as my sister flipped over for him, as he propped her hips up with pillows, and then slid inside her. He grabbed her hair and pulled her head back toward him so she was looking at the ceiling. Then my fiancé did the same. I heard her ass get slapped hard, and the my fiancé begin to slap me. My sisters’ moans suddenly changed, and I waited for my fiancé to mimic my sister’s friends. “Fish hook her dude,” her friend said. My fiancé slid his finger slid into my mouth. I tried to suck on it, but then it curled, grabbed my cheek, and he pulled back twisting my head to the side so I was forced to look directly at my sister. Her friend had her hair in one hand, his other hand in her mouth pulling her head to the side, and was thrusting with his entire body down on her. Watching her smooth and firm ass compress as he brought himself down on her was unbelievably hot.

At one point, my sister made the comment that it was hot to look at my fiancé and I fucking. My fiancé and my sister’s friends bent us over so we faced each other across the few feet between beds. They grabbed our hair so we had to look at each other getting fucked. My sister, as her friend entered her, told me that she couldn’t wait to see my tits swing. She put on a show – twisting her hips as he fucked her relentlessly. As she climaxed, she announced that “he is in my cervix” and that “she was going to squirt.” Her face and chest flushed, and beyond the curve of her shoulder and back I could see her ass jump as he thrust hard into her.

Eventually my fiancé was on top of me, my legs on is shoulders. He told me he was close and I told him to come on my face loudly so that my sister and her friend could here. “You have to let us see,” I heard her friend say. When my fiancé withdrew, I knelt between the beds and let him come across my mouth, neck, and breasts. He collapsed back on the bed to watch my sister, who was again being penetrated while she was stomach down on the bed, her hair held tightly in her friend’s hand and her head struggling to turn and look at the come on me. Her friend intensified his thrusting until he pulled out and began to come across her ass and back. She moaned “no, inside” and he slid back into her as he finished. She let out a guttural moan. As he withdrew, she turned over on the bed and spread her lips so he could see his come drip out of her. “That is hot,” my fiancé said.

Between the alcohol, sex, and molly, we were all parched. I remember stumbling to the kitchen where we all got drinks of water and my sister wrapped her arm around me and told me she loved me. I felt supremely numb and somehow still horny. The understanding of what had happened didn’t hit me until the morning when I woke up with a pounding headache and the episode came crashing back into my conscious memory.  So, a few months later and the memory sways between incredibly hot and kinda gross depending on my mood.  But at least my sister and I are still as close - if not closer- than ever."
9j9twc,1,2018-09-27,International Student Trying to Lease a Car,Sgtpwner,askcarsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/9j9twc/international_student_trying_to_lease_a_car/,"So some details about me first: I'm an international graduate student (Canadian) living in Los Angeles. I'm on an F1 visa, I don't have an SSN or an ITIN, however I do have a line of credit and great credit score. I want to do a three year lease because I'm going to be employed full time as soon as I graduate and I prefer the idea of having a new car because it's been a few years since I've driven regularly so the added safety features, reliability, gas mileage etc. are really attractive features to me. Also I did some math, and the overall cost of a used car (that meets my reliability, mpg, safety, etc. standards) would be similar or greater than a lease. The cost plus the added benefits of having a brand new car tipped me towards a lease.

I can't get an SSN from the place I'm going to get employed by until january for my CPT, and I can't begin my CPT until january regardless of if the company wants me or not. I work their as an intern more or less unofficially now, and the uber's there and back have become way too costly.

An ITIN would take 5-6 weeks to get and would have to be rescinded immediately upon receiving an SSN. An SSN will take 2-3 weeks from when I can secure employment. I've been looking for any odd jobs on my schools campus but it turns out that that's going to take some time as well. I'm trying to get those documents REGARDLESS of my lease situation, but I need to try to get a car ASAP.

I've decided on the 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid EX trim. I already worked out all the payment information and numbers with the dealer, but much to my disappointment the sales rep realized once we were trying to run my credit check that I require one of those two federal numbers (I tried to talk numbers over the phone and I prefaced my situation with them but the car dealers kept reassuring me that we'll find a solution later and insisted I come to the dealership and test drive the vehicle etc, very frustrating but I digress). Now I'm stuck in this position where I can't get the car I want despite being able to provide every other piece of proof that I can and will be able to afford the car.

So I was thinking, I have a family member who lives in Texas whom I trust very much. They would be willing to sign the lease under their name and allow me to get added on as a cosigner once I get my SSN and to fully takeover the lease in one year (when I will definitely have an ssn and the Honda allows me to refinance). The only issue is insurance, they're under their moms policy in texas and they would be willing to add the car and add me as a driver on the insurance but their insurance is based out of texas and the car would have to be registered to my family member, which would mean that it would have to be registered with texan plates etc (I think). We're both unfamiliar with what the registration and insurance process for this situation would be.

So I guess my question is: Is this possible to do? Are there any work arounds to the insurance and registration issues? Is there a way I can get car insurance in my name but have the car registered to someone else? Is there anything else I could possibly do to get this lease? Time is one of my limiting factors because I do need a car ASAP, I've been considering getting a cheap rental until I get either my paperwork clears out but that's not ideal either. The international department of my university and the various dealerships I've spoken too have not been particularly helpful in helping me find a solution, so I figured I would have to try to take care of everything myself and just present them with the solution I find. I realize this is an unusual circumstance so I'm open to any and all suggestions.

If there's any other information that would be helpful for you to help me find a solution please do let me know, as I'm a bit lost and any help from somebody who knows more than me would be extremely helpful. 

Thanks!

9jaq85,1,2018-09-27,SO [23/F] of 3 years decided we [23/M] were no longer compatible partners and broke up,crazyloverthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9jaq85/so_23f_of_3_years_decided_we_23m_were_no_longer/,"One of the main reason we broke up was because she thought we were incompatible. We argued a lot over petty things and rarely found a solution. One of the biggest disagreements was that she was not okay with me watching porn or looking at anything visual for stimulation. She was only okay with erotica or nothing at all. Another thing she couldn't accept was that I wanted to get an internship in a different city and experience what life would be like there.There were many things I did that she really hated and she told me she never let them go, she held a grudge. Everything piled up and she was hurting pretty bad and realized our relationship wouldn't workout anymore. I can clearly see that we had problems and we weren't perfect but we always ended up talking it out and trying to figure things out together, or at least I tried to talk to her. I know I can't force her to change her mind and right now I'm just giving her some space. Although sometimes she got on my nerves and we argued she also made me extremely happy and I felt comfortable with her. I love her very much still and I want the best for her. I'm just not sure what to do with my emotions of love towards her. At first she was very angry and wanted to break up and I had an extremely hard time understanding but eventually I realized it wasn't for me to decide and I calmed her down and talked to her about everything. I didn't fight her or argue about her decision after that. I let her know that I would always be here to support her, and that I would always care for her. Am I crazy for feeling this way and holding on to her like this? I'm not too sure how to get over this. Is there still a chance for us?


TL;DR SO broke up with me because of incompatibilities but I feel like no two people are so perfectly compatible that there are no problems and my heart doesn't want to give up on us."

###Context:
**Fair warning: probably some cringe-inducing things ahead**

I am in my very early 20s [M, undergrad student] and have never dated anyone until now; thus, you can easily say that I am inexperienced. A friend of mine set me up with one of her best friends a little more than 8 months ago (those two are closer than I am).

I honestly never thought I would go on a date due to a lot of problems with self-confidence, body image, lower-than-average mental health, and general awkwardness around others.

She is also very new to dating; never has had a relationship or anything. We share many similar interests (academics, movies, taste in food, etc.) and have our differences (taste in some music, I'm ugly, she is far from that), but I always feel extremely anxious when I am about to see her or talk to her.

We've been on 10 or so dates, however, most of them have just been at the movies so I never really got to know her since all we did was sit in the dark together and watch the same film. The first ""date"" we went on was more of a group outing with some of my friends and some of hers. I only had the balls to talk to her when she approached me at the end of the night.

The only few times we went on an actual date were two picnics that I planned. Those two dates were great because I felt like I had actual conversations with her. Most of the time, I ask her a question and she answers it, but I never know how to flip that into a conversation so it feels like an interview. I'm learning a lot about her, but I don't think she knows anything about me, thus making it harder for us to connect on a deeper level. I obviously don't want to just talk about myself all the time, but I wouldn't mind talking a little bit more so we get to know each other equally.

Physically, the furthest we have ever gone is just a quick hug before and after a date. Never even held hands. First time I could have kissed her, time felt like it slowed down. It was at the end of one of our dates and she kind of just stared at me for a while with the cutest expression. Before I knew it, 15 seconds had just passed by with us standing in silence - even though it felt like 15 minutes. I panicked and gave her a quick hug before running back home, realizing what an idiot I was. I even got a text from our mutual friend confirming my suspicions; she wanted me to make a move. 

We kind of had our first kiss when she was just about to go back home at the end of the school year (she doesn't live in-state) and we both kind of missed. It was a spur of the moment thing that - again - her friend pushed me to do. That was a few months ago and neither of us has initiated anything since.

More importantly, I don't really know how to talk to anyone, especially people that aren't men. I fear failure and try to be a perfectionist in everything I do. Thus, I am usually in my highest state of anxiety right before I have a date with her or think about her because I don't want to mess things up, even though I know there is nothing I can do since I have no prior experiences/knowledge. I also have a hard time reading people's emotions and body language. Thus, to be respectful I don't really touch people because I don't want them to feel violated or awkward. I really, really like physical contact. Even just a simple hug makes my entire week, however, I never learned how to initiate it or recognize when it's wanted, so I lean away from doing so.

Unfortunately, she is really busy all the time, especially for the next 3 months. She's a super smart person with an incredibly busy schedule (she's an RA, interns at a lab, and is taking her core classes for her engineering major).

I've asked her a couple of times where she sees things going (since I honestly have no idea wtf I'm doing for the most part) and since she is new to this too, she told me that it would be great to use the next few months to figure things out. Again, she is incredibly busy juggling her schedule so I don't think she will have enough time to see me at all these next few months.

I really like her and if she decides she wants to just be friends, I will be fully in support of her because she is honestly one of the most unique, intelligent, and kindest people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. However, if there is a chance for us to go further, I would be stupid not to go for it.

We're having another date this week (I'll be cooking for her, watching a movie, and playing card games - all at my place^(I also live with her friend that set us up). I am scared shitless because I feel like I am losing precious time and with every date that goes by, I feel myself missing so many opportunities and solidifying myself as somebody that is *undateable*.

###Questions (don't have to answer them all, even one would be fine):

- How do I start gaining confidence with myself - whether it be in my own personality, appearance, or any other part of my person?
- How do I get more comfortable around her?
- How do I break the touch barrier without having a mild-stroke due to my anxiety, lack of confidence, and general lack of experience?
- How do I have better/more natural conversations with her rather than feeling as if I am conducting an interview?
- How do I make the most out of the limited time I have with her?
- How do I get her to open up more/how do we achieve a deeper and more personal relationship?
- How do I read subtle signs or emotions?

Sorry for how long and strangely formatted this entire thing is. I am honestly really confused with the whole situation and am in dire need of help. I feel like things are going too slow because of both of our lack of past relationships, but I also don't know how to healthily and steadily advance things. Hoping some friendly Redditors can lend me their minds on some of my problems!

## Study in Canada: Introduction

There are plenty of reasons for international students to study in Canada. An array of reputed educational institutions, a wide range of comprehensive and specific courses, highly-trained educators, an exceptional education system, an unmatched quality of living, an advanced economy, diverse and affordable lifestyle, scenic locations and one of the safest places to live in – that’s Canada for an international student in a nutshell.

One of the most sought-after destinations to [study abroad for international students](https://www.buddy4study.com/article/study-in-canada-everything-you-need-to-know), Canada stands tall amid the top 10 countries by the United Nations in its Quality of Life Index. Amongst others, thousands of Indian students fly to Canada every year in the hope of pursuing quality education, eventually creating a top-notch career pathway for themselves.

Known for making a huge investment in the education system, Canada is home to hundreds of prominent educational institutions that take pride in their army of highly knowledgeable educators whose sole purpose is to create future leaders. The levels of education in Canada is divided into Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Bachelor’s degrees, Postgraduate Diplomas/Certificates, Master’s degrees and Doctorate or PhD.

## Why Study in Canada?

### Creating global leaders

Most of the educational institutions in Canada offer internationally accepted degrees, which ultimately open the careers doors for the students in the global market, instead of restricting them to a certain geography.

### Less expenditure, more knowledge

The cost of living and studying in Canada is comparatively lower for international students as compared to other countries that are at par with Canada in terms of quality education. The fee to study at a top university in Canada is almost half of what a student would pay to study at a renowned private university in countries such as the US or the UK.

### Be a permanent part of Canada

Many educational institutions in Canada also allow international students graduated from their institution the option to apply for a permanent residency visa while staying in Canada. Canada also has an extremely high number of international students bagging employment in their field of expertise within just a few months of graduating from an educational institution in Canada.

### Student Partnership Program

An added benefit for Indian students looking to study in Canada is the Student Partnership Program (SPP) – an organisational outline between the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) launched in the year 2009 with an aim to streamline admission and visa process for Canadian Community Colleges and eventually support more Indian students in getting visas issued for studying at these colleges. More than 40 colleges in Canada are under SPP currently.

### Unparalleled support

Besides quality education, Canada also boasts of quality support provided to international students during their term in Canada – from support programmes to advise session, from student clubs to accommodation assistance, Canada not just accept international students with open arms but also provides ample support to make them feel at home.

### Promoting independent living

Canada also allows international students to work or join an internship programme during their educational period, preparing them to become independent individuals at a very early stage in their lives.

### Unity in diversity

The chances of an Indian student feeling close to home in Canada as compared to other international destinations for education is higher as Canada too is a country of diverse cultures with more than 200 languages spoken, English and French being the two major languages.

### Unrivalled exquisiteness

Breath-taking scenic lands, serene lakes, lush forests and grand hills – travelling to every inch of Canada is an experience in itself that international students can submerge in while accomplishing their educational dreams.  


 

## Study in Canada: Admission Cycle

The academic session Canadian universities usually begin around the month of September and is divided into two terms. The application start date varies across different universities but the application procedure usually commences 15-18 months before the beginning of the course. It is recommended that international students should keep a check on the application start date and apply at the onset, keeping in mind the extra time for study permit and other formalities.

## Study in Canada: Cost of Study and Living

The cost of studying in Canada as compared to other study abroad destinations is comparatively lower for international students. In addition to that, a number of scholarships and financial aids are available for international students looking to study in Canada. These scholarships vary in nature, eligibility and award in different educational institutions.

Another major part of the cost incurred in studying in Canada as an international student include the accommodation expenses. Various educational institutions offer housing option on their campus, but living off the campus might be a less-costlier option.

## Study in Canada: Scholarship Options

Some Canadian universities offer entrance scholarships for international students who are coming to study in Canada for the first time, some offer in-course scholarships for international students who are already a part of a Canadian university, which some offer both. Here are the top scholarships for Indian students looking to study in Canada:

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Study in Canada: Study Permit

A study permit is mandatory for international students to study in Canada. The prerequisites for applying for a study permit are an acceptance letter from a designated learning institution (DLI) and a valid passport or travel document. Apart from these, you also need to show an evidence of financial stability enough to pay for your tuition fees, living expenses and return transportation. You must not have any criminal records (police certificate may be required), and you must be in good health (medical exam may be required). You must sound convincing to an immigration officer that you are visiting Canada for the purpose of your education and that you will leave Canada at the end of your studies.

Once submitted, your application and all necessary documents will be thoroughly checked. You may then receive a letter asking for your biometrics. If incomplete, the application will be returned as is. In some cases, you may also be asked to go for an interview with Canadian officials in your country or you may be asked to send in more information.

If the application is accepted, you will receive a letter of introduction to confirm, and an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visitor visa (temporary resident visa) to enter Canada. If the application is rejected, you will receive a letter explaining why.

## [Study in Canada](https://www.buddy4study.com/international-study): Safety

A lesser known beneficial aspect of studying in Canada is The ‘Walk Safe’ programs that help students access public transportation during late hours. It’s a community that supports walking as a primary means of transportation, eventually doing wonders for health, safety, the environment and the economy.

9jc9tv,1,2018-09-27,I feel bored in this library. I know I should study but honestly I don't feel like it.,Consumeradvicecarrot,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/9jc9tv/i_feel_bored_in_this_library_i_know_i_should/,"I have so many issues in my life and they dont seem to stop. 


I am overweight, failed college, living with my widowed father. Single for three years now.
I did manage to lose 4 kgs over the past 1 1/2 months. But I still have some 110-20 kg to go to dip down to remove stubborn fat, and then gain 5 kg by fat and or building muscle. In 12 days I have a two day internship at an investment firm. I don't have an education and will be 5-8 years older than the rest who apply. Based on the programme, i decided to borrow some books from the library and try to self study either through memorization or sq3r or problem solving. 

However some of these books are either purely nobel prize academic math papers, or easy to understsand books with following exercises which I can't get access to hte answers. They are linked to educational institutions and I am not a teacher so I can't study on my own. Dammit. 


My father wants me to move out. Or help. Or pay rent. And my bitch sister want me to move out so she can bring her boyfriend home and fuck him in that room.  Occassionally I try to help by stacking lumber or emptying the dishwasher or the like. But my father actually constantly bullies or teases me. He is a class A asshole who prevented his dying wife from finishing her will, and I only later realized he has also stolen from me my whole life and told lies about me to family friends. My sister is halfway in on it in that she licks our father metaphorical asshole. Like its always cake and sugar with her. So sweet. But towards me, totally disrespectful. I cut her off but my father doesn't respect my choice. At all. And I actually recovered something that could count as semi proof fo my moms will. My father snuck into my room while I was away, learned of the documents, and ever since, and I realize, all my life, he has been discrediting me shamelessly. When I fell over a chair and asked for him to come pick me up, he didn't care. While he has been making wooden tables for my sister and driven here everywhere in life. Like wtf. This power dynamic between the four of us tilted heavily when my mom died. I am wondering if I should hire a lawyer but I can't afford the fee. And I would only shoot myself in the foot. Or so I believe. because of inheritance.

My last gf lives in Thailand and is both promiscuous and sick. So I can't really say I should care for her. But she is the only one who has actually ever been able to fit my 17 cm inside of her. How am I going to find a gf like that again? I am not a player. Far from. So now I need to tell myself I have to go out and socialize on fridays and saturdays. 

I don't have an income. I am lucky I have savings but its not great to burn through them. 

The government offered me to do what can essentially be described as prison work for minimum wage. Connecting a rubber ball to a plastic pump. Sequential work with only two steps, 8 hours 5 days a week. And oh, I am not allowed to study the governments online classes which would qualify me for some other higher education. Its like the government put me to do prison work without me having done anything wrong. What the fuck? Like as if I am going to scrape by and tear my fingers up doing this manual labour. We live ina a society where robots do all the manual labour. Pippetting in blood analysis at hospitals, storage transportation in amazon, automated mining vehicles. And now I have to sit amongst borderline criminals or mental illness people and do this kind of shit? No way. I was there half a day, and never went back. 

And thus I am trying to wrap my head around money, or wealth. This means reading books on financial advising, compliance, and books of Tobin James. No one assigned this to me but myself. No one will test me or hold me accountable but myself. I might never use this on the two day internship. 

How the fuck am I supposed to  focus with all theese problems flying around my brain?

Edit: thank you for all the supporting comments! its nice to get some encouragement to improve. I kind of wish I could invite you out for dinner."
9jcm92,352,2018-09-27,"My fiancé (29M) and I (26F) treated my sister and her friend (20F, 21M) to a weekend trip to the mountains. We got drunk, high, and fucked in front of each other in the same room.",Novel_Persimmon,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/9jcm92/my_fiancé_29m_and_i_26f_treated_my_sister_and_her/,"I'll start by giving my fiancé some credit for prompting me to write this and for cleaning up and embellishing the language....

So back over the summer my fiancé (29M) and I (26F) decided we would get a cabin in the Adirondacks to surprise my little sister (20F) and her best friend/ on-off boyfriend/friends with benefits (21M) with a before school weekend trip. We rented a cool little spot on a lake that was kinda rustic: a kitchen, den, one bed room with two beds, a bathroom, and a screened in porch.

Physically, I think our group was pretty attractive. My sister and I are both 5’6 and brunette. I’m a little more stout, longer in the torso with wider hips and a bigger ass and tits (D cups). She is thinner with gorgeous long legs, which I have been really jealous about. Her boobs are smaller, right at the board of a B/C cup, and she has a few tats on her shoulder, ankle, and below one breast. While I trimmed, she waxed everything. My fiancé is 5’10, a sinewy crossfit nut with sandy brown hair. He has a impressive penis at 7.5 inches and a good bit thicker than average. My sister’s friend – whatever their relationship is – is about 6’2,  very muscular as a former football star at her college with a penis similar in size to my fiancé’s.

I consider my relationship with my sister to be good because we text all the time and are great emotional support for each other. In college, I was a lot like her: impulsive, social, focused on having fun. Having graduated a few years ago, I’ve had the chance to grow up a little and I often chide her to focus on the school work and internships I neglected. I enjoy being the responsible older sister and having landed a good job, it has been awesome to occasionally treat her to cool things like the trip to the woods.

We spent most of the day hiking and canoeing around the lake. My fiancé and her friend were both big football fans so they got along great. In the evening, they cooked steaks over the fire while my sister and I worked on the rest of the meal inside. Eventually, we settled down around the fire and started working through the beer and liquor we brought with us.

After a while, my sister’s friend broke out some molly, took some, and asked us if we wanted any. My sister, who is a big partier, took some and told me to give it a shot. I had only done it once before when I tried to impress my friends at a Cold Play concert in high school - and had been so thirsty I thought I was going to die. My fiancé took some, which surprised me because he was always really judgmental about anything of the sort since I knew him. I relented and took some as well.

Eventually, the fire burned out. It was chilly, and my sister and I were both sitting on the laps of our guys. The molly and a lot of crown and coke had me feeling super relaxed, and I distinctly feeling like the molly had really amplified the cicadas to the point where they seemed like they were inside my head. Everyone got pretty quiet as the fire reduced to glowing coals.

Things got a bit hazy after that. I remember watching as my sister’s friend slid his hand into her leggings as she sat on his lap, and her leaning her head back on his shoulder a he fingered her slowly. I remember feeling my fiancé’s cock get hard and press against my ass as we watched them in the soft glow. I wanted his dick inside me, and grabbed his hand and walked inside the cabin.

I knelt down in front of him and gave him very aggressive head, nearly taking him over the edge several times, but stopping just short. He told me he wanted to feel himself inside me, when my sister and her friend stumbled into the room. She was naked already and her legs looked incredible as she pushed him over the bed and begin to suck on his cock. I slid my hand into my shorts and fingered myself as I went back to sucking on my fiancé. All of our moans comingled, and I distinctly remember the hair on the back of my neck standing up because I was so aroused.

Next thing I knew my fiancé was pulling me to my feet, kissing me, taking my clothes off and tossing them on the floor. My sister’s friends commented on how nice and big my tits were, so I leaned over him while my sister sucked on his cock. He fondled my boobs until I felt my fiancé push himself inside me. On molly, the feeling of his size was noticeably amplified. We waddled, his cock inside me, over to the bed where he began to fuck me. When my sister said she wanted to see, we got on the bed so they could see the profile of him behind me.

Much of the rest of the night seemed to run together but specific snippets run together:

At some point, my sister climbed on top of her friend and began to ride him hard. I remember thinking that her hips moved very smoothly and that she was an incredible rider. My fiancé and I switched positions to do the same. As I stood up beside the bed to get on top of him, I watched her long legs and firm ass press forward and back.  I reached out and slapped her right across the tanlines on her ass cheeks. “Fuck yes,” she moaned. I slapped again on the other cheek. “You slap me,” she said to my fiancé. So he did, and she leaned over and lifted her ass off her friend’s cock a little so we could both slap again. As she lifted her ass, her friend’s cock accelerated. His balls slapped against her, and you could hear her getting wetter. My fiancé put me on top of him, and in a few minutes, my sisters friend and he were engaged in a race to see who could make us moan louder and fuck us faster.

As my sister was nearly done riding her friend, my fiancé was going down on me, and I had just climaxed. I got up so he could put me in whatever position he wanted. My sister hopped off her friend’s dick. It was shiny from her wetness. For a brief second, I nearly swooped in and wrapped my lips around it. I could almost feel it’s weight in my mouth. But my sister began bobbing up and down on him and I immediately turned around to give my fiancé head. My fiancé complimented my sister on her skills as she deepthroated her friend, and as she got up to change positions she took a detour to kneel beside me. She tried grabbed his penis so I would stop blowing him – and I assume so she could start. My fiancé brushed her hand away and explained she had to suck on her friend and not him. She got up, and he slapped her ass she walked away toward the other bed.

A while later, my fiancé put pillows under my hips and proceeded to fuck my while I lay facedown in front of him. It was a position that normally caused me to have long, intense orgasms, and the molly made it so intensely pleasurable it bordered on pain. My sisters friend, who was on top of my sister’s writhing form, paused his thrusting while he looked over at us. “Let’s do that. I want to fuck you like her,” he said.  I watched as my sister flipped over for him, as he propped her hips up with pillows, and then slid inside her. He grabbed her hair and pulled her head back toward him so she was looking at the ceiling. Then my fiancé did the same. I heard her ass get slapped hard, and the my fiancé begin to slap me. My sisters’ moans suddenly changed, and I waited for my fiancé to mimic my sister’s friends. “Fish hook her dude,” her friend said. My fiancé slid his finger slid into my mouth. I tried to suck on it, but then it curled, grabbed my cheek, and he pulled back twisting my head to the side so I was forced to look directly at my sister. Her friend had her hair in one hand, his other hand in her mouth pulling her head to the side, and was thrusting with his entire body down on her. Watching her smooth and firm ass compress as he brought himself down on her was unbelievably hot.

At one point, my sister made the comment that it was hot to look at my fiancé and I fucking. My fiancé and my sister’s friends bent us over so we faced each other across the few feet between beds. They grabbed our hair so we had to look at each other getting fucked. My sister, as her friend entered her, told me that she couldn’t wait to see my tits swing. She put on a show – twisting her hips as he fucked her relentlessly. As she climaxed, she announced that “he is in my cervix” and that “she was going to squirt.” Her face and chest flushed, and beyond the curve of her shoulder and back I could see her ass jump as he thrust hard into her.

Eventually my fiancé was on top of me, my legs on is shoulders. He told me he was close and I told him to come on my face loudly so that my sister and her friend could here. “You have to let us see,” I heard her friend say. When my fiancé withdrew, I knelt between the beds and let him come across my mouth, neck, and breasts. He collapsed back on the bed to watch my sister, who was again being penetrated while she was stomach down on the bed, her hair held tightly in her friend’s hand and her head struggling to turn and look at the come on me. Her friend intensified his thrusting until he pulled out and began to come across her ass and back. She moaned “no, inside” and he slid back into her as he finished. She let out a guttural moan. As he withdrew, she turned over on the bed and spread her lips so he could see his come drip out of her. “That is hot,” my fiancé said.

Between the alcohol, sex, and molly, we were all parched. I remember stumbling to the kitchen where we all got drinks of water and my sister wrapped her arm around me and told me she loved me. I felt supremely numb and somehow still horny. The understanding of what had happened didn’t hit me until the morning when I woke up with a pounding headache and the episode came crashing back into my conscious memory.  So, a few months later and the memory sways between incredibly hot and kinda gross depending on my mood.  But at least my sister and I are still as close - if not closer- than ever."
9jd0mh,1,2018-09-27,Should I stick to my current job or risk it and leave?,neutr0,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/9jd0mh/should_i_stick_to_my_current_job_or_risk_it_and/,"Hello fellow marketeers, I found myself in quite a situation and I would like your input on this. 
I have a bachelor degree in Marketing &amp; Advertising and I landed my first job in the marketing area working as a all-around digital marketeer for a consulting company (managing all of the intern digital marketing, from SEO, to mail marketing, adwords, social networks, well you know the drill).

I'm simultaneously taking a post-grad in digital marketing since I felt I wasn't performing particularly good in the digital area. It’s gonna cost me 5000€ for a full year. Which is half my yearly paycheck. 

My job is pretty decent, but I have no senior to coach me and I feel that’s a big disadvantage career wise. I’ve been doing everything by myself since I’m the only marketeer in the company and I’m responsible for pretty much everything.
I'm earning 10k/year which is decent, but i'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that I'll have a hard time growing as a professional, knowledge wise.

Basically I feel trapped, the company is growing and I can grow within the company. Make a career here and do this for quite a long time.
On the other side, I want to be the best marketeer possible, and I don’t feel I will become as good as I want to over here.

I have until December to make a decision, (contract is automatically renewed). 
Should I stick to my current safe &amp; decent job, pay my post-grad and try to overcome my challenges alone?
Or should I risk it and try to find a different job to get bossed around and learn with others?

9jdihe,3,2018-09-27,Broke up a bit over a month ago,daylate__dollarshort,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9jdihe/broke_up_a_bit_over_a_month_ago/,"I broke up with my girlfriend in the first half of August, and it has been weird. I don't know whether I can trust my own judgment on this since I am such a mess, but I feel like a more objective opinion from someone online could maybe help me center myself.

&amp;#x200B;

We were together for just under 2 years, but were unofficially together for about half a year before that as well. It started really strong until the first summer, when we spent 2 months together abroad in a summer internship. I can be emotionally distant and although we had some great times as well, generally at that time we did not know how to act around each other all the time.  Once we got back to our country, we were both afraid that we might break up. But school started and we grew closer again, then her grandfather died and she says I was really loving and supportive towards her during that time. Trouble started again next summer, this time she grew emotionally distant as well (due to my sporadic distancing/aloofness) and though we had really good moments as well, by August we both had doubts about our relationship.

We were supposed to go study abroad and move in together, but in the uncertain state of our relationship I decided to break it off with her, we were both terribly sad but she agreed that it might be a good idea. I let her keep our other friends we were supposed to move in with and found a place of my own, where I am now. We are in the same study program, so we see each other a few times a week. During this time I was depressed 4 days of the week, both because of her and due to being alone in a new city. But last weekend we were in the same place for 2 nights, on an introductory cabin trip with other people who started the same studies.

She was friendly the whole of the first evening, and at one point we decided to go outside to photograph the night sky. It was then that I asked her how she was doing with the breakup and she told me that she already has someone new, our mutual friend we were all supposed to move in with, but who now lives with only her and the other friend. I had my suspicions before, but it still hurt so much to actually hear it. She told me all of this through tears and since it got cold we decided to go to our common bedroom to find a quiet place to keep talking. We held hands and talked nearly all night, we both missed each other very much, we were both very sorry it ended, but she explained as well that she thought she might have real feelings for the new guy.

Sleeping arrangements were on mattresses on the floor, she was sleeping between me and the new guy. I couldn't sleep all night and I could hear her quietly crying as well, at one point she quietly took hold of my hand and held it hard.

The next day we were also together for most of the day and when I at one point went back to hopefully recover a few hours of lost sleep, she came to lie next to me as well. She gave me such a loving look as she gently took my hand when lying next to me that I literally could not keep an incomprehensible mix of very strong feelings inside and I ran to go vomit. We also cried together, and the most she has seen before is my eyes getting slightly wet. We shortly discussed the possibility of a future relationship as well, but she said that even if she did not have someone new we would just fall back into our old patterns, and I agree that we broke up for a reason. Later in the day we spent 2 hours walking around and taking pictures of the countryside, we discussed everything that was wrong with our relationship and how I should generally be more caring towards my next girlfriend. At one point she made a lighthearted jab at how could I let our relationship go when just this summer we had made a romantic gesture of building a heart out of pebbles at the beach and taking a picture with our bare feet next to it together. That was nearly a literal gut punch to me, I instantly started sobbing and nearly fell over. She instantly started sobbing  as well and profusely apologizing. The rest of the trip was uneventful, though I could feel a general distancing and focusing more close feelings on her new boyfriend

By now we are both back in our respective homes, me alone and her with her new boyfriend. She still texts me at least a few times each day and I try not to seem over eager in my replies, but I do not know what to feel and do. This summer she also gave me a series of novels to read that she once read, and asked me to reflect on our relationship through them. By now I'm nearly done with them. She always wears my old scarf and she wants me to return to her old gifts that I gave her once and were left at my place when we broke up.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I feel like in any case I should work on my studies, being less emotionally distant with people and just generally trying to improve on myself, whether she eventually wants me back or not. I can't deny hoping that one day we will have something again, since we really were great together. For both of us it was our first serious relationship and we both agree that we learned a lot. She says she does not want to lose me as a close friend, but I don't know if that commutes with wanting to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this, I hope I am in the right place."
9jdknc,2,2018-09-27,How do I ask out this girl from 'work'?,Nidicuf,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/9jdknc/how_do_i_ask_out_this_girl_from_work/,"In the company where I'm doing my summer internship there's a girl working that I'm really into and I could really use some advice on how to handle this.

I needed to vent a bit, I realize that I'm most likely overthinking the whole thing but any advice would be very welcome!

I'm not sure whether she likes me or is just being friendly. I seem to get along with her, although I think she gets along with lots of people. But when we start talking it seems to go on for far longer than professionally necessary, she smiles a lot (which makes me feel like I'm 15 again), plays with her hair,... 

Tomorrow is my last day and I really want to ask her out. I'm just not sure about how to do it. 

Should I just do it at work face to face? Start a conversation and then randomly drop the question somewhere or should I rather add her on Fb and then ask while chatting? I realize that I might be shitting where I eat a little here, or rather: where I would like to eat.

In a best case scenario where she agrees to go out and it evolves in a passionate love affaire that might be a problem in said company.

In a worst case scenario where she doesn't want to go out with me or she does but it doesn't go anywhere, that would also be weird if I ever get to return to this company (and I really want to).

We're both in our mid-twenties, I'm a bit older than her.

Thanks in advance to everyone who read all that rambling and has some advice to offer!

9jdwhm,1,2018-09-27,[A4A] Literate M x M Fandom Romance,Coffeeandcatsrp,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/9jdwhm/a4a_literate_m_x_m_fandom_romance/,"Hey all! I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

9. I usually do written bios, but if you HAVE to have pictures, I only do anime/cartoon refs and will only accept the same. NO REAL LIFE PICS PLEASE!!!

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9jets1,2,2018-09-27,"My(23m) fianceé (22f) and I have been together for 7 years, she's worried about her feelings for me.",MotherOfEggsWalkin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jets1/my23m_fianceé_22f_and_i_have_been_together_for_7/,"Hi there, sorry this is going to be a long one for sure, but I cant tl;dr it because each detail is important to the whole picture. Thank you in advance if you can read it all and help us understand what's going on.

A bit of backstory for context: We met in sophmore year of highschool and were both each others 3rd relationship, but first serious one. We went full on puppy love for each other and in our first year and a half we had our first kiss along with countless other firsts together (no sex yet). We were such a happy couple but at the end of junior year, I suddenly felt a brief emotional disconnect (maybe a week) and broke up with her, basically out of the blue, because I felt guilty about it. It was probably because I was afraid that the commitment was already longer than anything I had before, and I was afraid I was missing out on dating in my youth, as well as negative pressure from my dad. I deeply regret this now. 

Regardless, I ended up dating someone else a month later, which fiancee was really upset about understandably (we kept in contact the entire time because I still cared about her a lot). Nothing feels right in this other relationship and she dumps me.

Over the course of about a year I slowly get closer again to my now fianceè. We go through a small period of dating, decide we weren't ready for that yet, and then a few months later got back together for good. Since then, its been about 4-5 years and we've been so happy together, our relationship is rock solid. We're complete opposites, so we don't often like the same hobbies, but we both give each other totally different perspectives on life and introduce each other to new music and experiences together. Plus we can handle literally anything together because if one doesn't know how to deal, the other almost certainly does. We are extremely honest with each other emotionally speaking, and of course we have plenty of disagreements and pet peeves, but we communicate well enough to keep moving forward. This is where our biggest hurdle comes in. 

Just to let you know, we don't live together, we each still live with our parents because we can't afford to yet. We live right down the street so its not much distance issue but it means we don't always have a place to go ourselves.

We do love each other, that's no question, and we both trust each other 100% which is why can say everything I do with such certainty. But as of last year, she's had periods where she feels detached from me for reasons she can't always understand. The first time was a month or so before I proposed to her. That was a clear communication issue on my part. I'm not very good at texting or remembering to express my feelings, and she felt disconnected in that time because of it. We cleared that up after some very long conversations and we were doing great by the time I proposed to her. It's been a wonderful year together but it came back when she got her internship. We both work and have school so time together is already slim, coupled with my lack of telecommunication makes for some rough times. We got that cleared up and were happy again for a month or two but now its back again as she got the followup job. This time, we both know it will probably pass like it did before, but our main concern is now that it's happened several times, and we can't let this keep repeating.

For each occurance she says she feels guilty because she thinks of dating other guys (not planning just thoughts, and no specific person or guy with any trait in particular; we're extremely loyal to each other, even mentally, so invasive thoughts like this are a big deal to her). We also feel like the fact that I dated someone when we broke up gives us imbalanced experiences here, where I had the chance to see first hand that she's the only one I want but she just has to trust her gut. She does insist that she still loves me and would never want to break up. 

We are definitely considering couples therapy, so any advice about setting that up and making the most of it would be appreciated, but of course any advice would help. I've just never heard of a situation quite like this, so I wanted to know what people here have to say.

Just to clarify, because I know this is going to be a first reaction: There is no cheating involved here, I do know that for a fact. If you were going to make a comment about that, please just trust that I know and refrain. Also our sex life is awesome, so that's not an issue.

Edit: More clarity"

9jf24v,1,2018-09-27,"Position being eliminated, offered severance / move to another position. Graduate from college in December.",offbeataccent,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9jf24v/position_being_eliminated_offered_severance_move/,"Hey! I'm typing this from my phone so excuse any formatting issues or typos. 

First off, I'll start by stating that I am 24 years old. I'm single, no kids, no debt other than $7500 in student loans that I will need to start paying off in June. I currently work for a big box retailer (not sure if I should name drop so i'll leave it there). I've been with the company for four years. Last August I took a position which is a lead position. It's a step above regular full time, right below supervisor. I make $16/hr in this position. I've recently found out that the position is being eliminated company wide. I'm offered a severance package which will equal eight weeks of pay. My manager told me that he values me at the company and has argued that he would like to get me into a supervisor position, but it's not a promise. I would still need to interview for it but a strong candidate. That would be around $20/hr. There are several positions that are going to be opening at that level so I will have a good shot at that. In the meantime, I would drop to regular full time (small pay cut due to a cap, $15.50). 


Reason why this is important: I graduate in December with a computer science degree. I live in Nashville, if that helps. Although, I don't have any internships or real experience in any big projects other than one I'm doing in my last class. The only thing I'm worried about if I take the severance is finding a job promptly. I'm worried that if I decide to take the severance that I'll regret passing up the opportunity to stay with the company and grow more while I focus on trying to find a job. 

I think taking the severance would be a great opportunity for me to finish this last semester stress free, and maybe even take some time to work on my other hobbies for a few months. It'll also give me plenty of time to apply (which I would start doing soon) and interview for jobs. 


I currently have $4800 in all of my accounts. My severance would be around $3000 net, I'm guessing. My current outgo is about $600 in bills and I would round up to $900 total for the worst case, as far as gas/food/whatever. In December I am moving into my parents for a little while and I won't have any bills. I have the opportunity to stay for as long as I need. 

Any more information I'm happy to supply. I might even be thinking too hard about this. It might even be the fact that i've worked for a company so long that I can't imagine life without it.  Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I found out that I can come back whenever I want and I would more than likely be able to negotiate a similar pay. I took the severance! "

9jgbol,2,2018-09-27,I’m a failure,squishiebutt2020,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9jgbol/im_a_failure/,"I am in community college going on 4 years for a 2 year degree, I changed my mind several times. So I’ve finally found what I would like to do. Information Technology. All is going good and I get an internship job and I was nervous but could handle it. My first day there I couldn’t answer questions like they were wanting not enough detail. Then we had a orientation meeting everything was going smoothly. After meeting walking out interns start talking shit about the supervisors and how they know nothing and will yell at you for small infractions. So raises my anxiety level a bit. Next day wasn’t job day it was classes and low and behold I have a couple classes with the interns. So as we’re waiting for professors to get in class they start asking me how I liked my first day, how it went, what I did and they start saying “oh man, if that was last semester you’d have been yelled at and replaced.” I’m like for not putting in enough details of describing a computer? So anxiety skyrockets. And these conversations keep happening telling me how horrible supervisors are. Then next work day I’m supposed to install Ubuntu OS on computer sounds simple I know how. Well they give you a thumb drive and say it’s on there...it’s not. So I was trying to do some technical support style figuring this out 2 work days later I find out you need a dvd instead. Like wtf no one says anything. Kept telling me read the instructions. Bullshit. So I’m like feeling like I’m stupid. Want to just leave and never return even to school. And the interns keep telling me horror stories about the previous semester. You have to finish 2 semesters of this internship to move on to a better internship. 

My mom’s health turned bad come to find out it wasn’t mini strokes it was her bp dropping well below where it should be. So my sister and I get that straightened out within a week. 

I quit my internship cuz we both are looking at this health issue being more than expected because she also has seizures so we didn’t know wtf was going on and the docs didn’t seem to care. So we had to figure it out on our own. Took us a week and she’s so much better now. And now interns are talking about how much fun their having. 

These fuckers scared the shit out of me with horror stories making my anxiety not only sky rocket, but have panic attacks just before going into work. I take Xanax so I’ve been taking them like candy trying to calm down (not literally just 2 or 3 a day depending on attack’s). 

Now I feel like an even more idiot. I have to do this internship. I’m hoping next semester their all gone and I can get a fresh start. The company works with out school so they always want interns so that’s good. And I used my mom’s health as my reason for quitting. I didn’t want to tell them the interns were making life hell with their horror stories of the previous semester. And now I’m having to talk to a school mental health counselor to help me overcome my anxiety which isn’t a bad thing, but now everyone things I’m some freak who can’t function in the real world. 

I’m so pissed with myself. I’m going back Spring 2019, I pray the others are gone by then. Your not supposed to do the internship more than 2 semesters so they would all have done both semesters so hopefully it will be better. I hate anxiety and panic attacks. I’m socially awkward to add to it and I don’t know how to talk to people. I wasn’t socialized as a child or teen. Only with family so that’s not helping the matter. I went to public school until 9th grade but I wasn’t forced to socialize with other kids. I could be shy and just do my own work and be fine. I’m just so tired of anxiety. 

Have a dr appt Tuesday to see about changing from Prozac to Zoloft hoping it will help. Been on Prozac for 5 years and I’m still having major anxiety issues. Hopefully it gets better. I’m doing cognitive behavioral therapy with the school counselor. It feels so stupid. Like I’m gonna tell myself these stupid tricks like stop, take a breath, observe your surroundings, proceed. Yes STOP 🛑. Writing in a journal. I’m giving it a try and trying to keep my thoughts open about it. She says 12-15 weeks and I should have better mechanics. I hope so. "

9jgtlj,5,2018-09-27,Integrating as an Immigrant,MrBojanglesReturns,askswitzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/9jgtlj/integrating_as_an_immigrant/," Hallo zusammen!  


Before I ask my questions, I'll give you some context.  
I  am currently 24 years old and living in Brazil. I'm going through my  Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and working really hard - forget  those weekends - on my side projects relating to software dev and data science. I speak moderately good English, Spanish and taking baby steps  in German now, learning by listening to podcasts and doing exercises in my commute to my internship.    


Perhaps you have visited here before or may know it from another way, but living in a developing country is really rough. 

We don't get the same opportunities as North American or a European in terms of quality of life in general if not born in a wealthy family. Crime rates are skyrocketing, the education budget is going down for each year in succession, the list is quite long. Although not trying to play the victim here, this reality sucks and this is not the place I want to raise a family. 

I want to be part of a fair and functional society, with people that know they have obligations as citizens such as respecting the laws, paying taxes, but do get something in return, high standard education, safety on the streets and good healthcare. And Switzerland seems to be a great place to live.   


While not still sure that I can get to land a job on Switzerland in the near future, albeit working really hard for it (already researched about, need to have huge qualifications), I am still open for other countries to immigrate.

What is your opinion about it? Can an immigrant integrate well into swiss society and culture?

Only thing that I'm a bit afraid of is that whereas not an extrovert myself, the swiss are very reserved, is that true? 

Thanks"

I am a 19 year old (soon to be 20) college sophomore studying accounting. Right now I am attending a public university and relying on scholarships, federal loans, and my parents to pay for tuition, rent, and school expenses. I am working part-time on campus and using that money to pay for my own food, groceries, and other personal expenses. I want to start moving towards being self-reliant and start building my credit, and I also want to be more responsible about my student loans. I will break down my current income, expenses, financial aid, and thought processes down below.

**Income**:

$100 per week. (10 hours per week @ $10/hour.) 


**Financial aid**: 

$6500/year scholarship from university

$2000/year scholarship

$4250 total, one-time scholarships

Federal Unsubsidized loans: $2000 (17-18), $4666 (18-19)

Federal Subsidized loans: $3500 (17-18), $1834 (18-19)


**Expenses**:

Groceries: $80-$150 per month, depending on how much I plan to cook vs. eating lunch on campus

Eating out: $20-30 per month. I get Chick-fil-A about once (sometimes twice..) per week. I plan my groceries around these purchases.

Rent: $769 per month. This one hurts.

Electricity: $12 per month(?). We just got our first power bill. Landlord covers $40 up front, rest is split 4 ways among roommates. $12 is my share.

Tuition and fees: $5800 per semester.


Basically, I am able to cover all of my food-related expenses with my income. My financial aid has been able to cover this year's expenses to the university and two months' rent. I may be able to cover December's rent by myself as well. My parents paid for my first two months out of their pocket.


As of right now I know that I can't just stop accepting help from my parents as my rent bill is just far too high. I also can't live somewhere else as 1). I signed a 10-month lease, and 2) I live in a very large city with terrible traffic and public transportation and I don't have a car. This is probably the part where I should mention that my family was immensely affected by a certain natural disaster that we were not insured for, and that is the reason I no longer have a car. That being said, I am actively applying and recruiting for potential summer internships where I could work full time for 8-10 weeks from anywhere between $15-$25/hour. I could put this money towards savings for next year's rent, my current loan balance, or into an IRA or any other form of investments. I currently don't have any invested as this is my first formal form of employment.

Additionally, I would like to look at building my credit. Right now I only use my debit card through my credit union. Now that I have a source of income, I think I could afford to get a card geared towards students, but I have absolutely no clue which one I should get.

My biggest concern is student loans. I have been way too irresponsible when it comes to monitoring the interest rates of the money I've accepted, so I don't even know that off the top of my head. I will spend one year post-graduation completing 30 hours of coursework to obtain my MS Accy degree, and the cost of that degree is really frightening. I know I'll have at least one or two internships before then to save some money but I know it won't be enough. I really don't like the thought of paying off these loans for the next 10 years.

I would really appreciate any and all advice concerning moving toward financial independence. My parents have enough to deal with debt-wise and I don't want to get in the way of that if I can help it. Thank you all."

I have an internship at a CPA firm, would a letter or something from them help my case?

9jhkld,3,2018-09-27,Headaches every day—chronic eye strain?,girlscout_mafia,medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/9jhkld/headaches_every_daychronic_eye_strain/,"Hello! I am a white 21 year old female. Height 5’2”, weight 120 pounds.

Since May 2018, so for about 4.5 months now, I have been getting headaches that really interfere with my ability to enjoy life. 

The pain is mainly dull and in my forehead, sometimes in the back of my head as well. It starts in the late afternoon and gta progressively worse.

Seen many doctors, including a neurologist, but they’ve mainly told me headaches are just one of those tricky things that are really hard to diagnose. I’ve been trying to monitor them as much as possible, so here is a ton of info:

I take an albuderol inhaler when I exercise. I take iron supplements, vitamin B, C, and D. My doctor prescribed topamax so I’ve been taking that for a little less than two weeks.

I am in my first month of my senior year of college currently and they started toward the end of my spring semester junior year. When they first started they were about once a week for 1-2 days, but over the summer the got progressively worse until they were happening every day.

Nothing over the counter has helped, weirdly. Advil, excedrin, Tylenol, etc. They might work for 15 minutes or so but that’s it.

Over the summer I had two jobs. One wasn’t new, I work teaching kids to read. I used a computer for this one, looking back and forth between the kid and the computer. I worked this from 8-12. My other job I worked from 1-5 as a content intern for a digital marketing firm. I basically stared at a computer the whole time for this one. I worked both of these Monday through Friday.

Thinking the headaches might be from too much blue light from the computers, I bought blue-blocking glasses but they haven’t done anything.

I’m in school again now (I go to George Mason University in fairfax, Virginia) and the severity and frequency of the headaches is still getting worse. Times I’ve noticed they get the worse is when I’m in class, particularly if a projector is being used, when I’m driving for long distances, at parties (whether or not I drink smoke pot doesn’t change much.)

Two years ago in January 2016 I got a concussion. This concussion caused my pupils to change sizes frequently causing me to feel a bit dizzy, and i has some memory and focus issues for months. After seeing a bunch of doctors, one told me my pupil muscles had been damaged and gave me this eye therapy computer software to do everyday. I did this every day for 2 months and then the software said my therapy was complete. Although I noticwd my pupils being different sizes a lot less frequently, they still to this day occasionally shift especially in dim lighting or if I havent gotten enough sleep.

I got my eye prescription updated in May when the headaches started and it was the same as it has always been. My prescription is -.25 just in my left eye. It’s a really minimal prescription but I still wear a contact lens in one eye and glasses sometimes.

The headaches are generally in my forehead and a dull pain that, while making it hard for me to be cheerful, hasn’t presented any other major symptoms (vomiting, passing out), other than maybe a little nausea, but that might be psychosomatic.

I rarely wake up with the headaches. They begin generally in the afternoon and get really bad in the evening before I go to bed. Despite never waking up with headaches, I’ve been told I grind my teeth in my sleep so i got a mouth guard that I wear at night, but it hasn’t seemed to help.

When I look up and to the right, especially at night, it hurts my eyes and my headache gets immediately worse. If i look to the right my left eye gets this pulse of pain through it, then the pain sort of seeps into my forehead. I STRONGLY suspect it has something to do with my eyes but I cant find anything about it online. Possibly chronic eye strain. 

TLDR: *dull headaches in forehead area. *start in afternoon and get worse until I go to bed. It definitely hurts worse at night time *hurts when I look up or off to the side , pulsing in my left eye then staying in my forehead"

I've been thinking for a while about how to write this prompt, and I wanted to get it out there to see if I can connect with someone on it! I'm worried this will end up being too specific/exclusive for many people, so read the last paragraph if you feel that way!

If you read my post history, you'll see that I'm from Washington, DC. I'm really proud to call such a transient city home, and going to college this close to where I grew up was a great decision. Today, I want to find someone to write a story with who can help me make this amazing town a character, somewhere that feels as real as it is to me every day. I'm hoping to use specific places as settings, and have our characters behave like locals here do.

Because I'm so dedicated to the setting of the story, the plot is something I'm still undecided on. Are we lobbying interns meeting at our bosses' cocktail hour at the Watergate? Are you my intern coordinator, taking me to Eastern Market to socialize after work? Are we long-suffering Nats fans meeting at an open air bar before a game? Maybe you have another idea completely! I'm open to a lot of ideas, as long as we can set them somewhere that feels authentic to DC. We'll definitely discuss our plot and content before we start off.

**If you feel like this is too detailed about a place you've never been, no worries! I'd love to talk about any DPP prompt I've posted before.** Either way, send me a couple options for what you want me to look like so I know you read my whole prompt! Hope to hear from you!"
9jkcj5,2,2018-09-28,Wayyyy too much blood to be a UTI?? (TLDR at the end),justkindafloating,DiagnoseMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/9jkcj5/wayyyy_too_much_blood_to_be_a_uti_tldr_at_the_end/,"21F, 160lbs. I have Hashimoto’s (on Synthroid) and am on blood thinners for a clotting disorder. I also have PCOS and am on mirena. I apologize for the length but really could use some help!!

So before mirena I had periods 2x every 6 weeks for 10 days with hideous cramps. Started mirena 3.5 years ago, all good ever since. Minimal bleeding and rare cramps. 

End of April I had the most painful experience peeing ever. Passed clots and the urine was clearly orange. BUT my inr (blood levels for warfarin users) was perfectly normal. No burning or itching, just pain. It eventually went away on its own. two weeks later I had one of my full blown periods for the first time in years.

Beginning of June, same thing starts happening again. I figured it’d pass on its own and after 48 hours it seemed to be okay. Next day I have the immense pain with peeing again (also extreme urgency) and look down and it’s STRAIGHT BLOOD. There was no urine in that. It was unmistakeable opaque, bright red blood and I was absolutely positive it wasn’t vaginal.  Off to the ER I go. After three days of the most useless hospital stay I have some antibiotics and they say it was a UTI. (Wasn’t sure how since my cultures were all completely negative and there wasn’t burning or itching or anything plus I only have my one very faithful boyfriend of 2+ years and have never had a UTI in my life, but whatever) INR was fine, No bladder or kidney inflammation visible via MRI or ultrasound. No clots either. 

Ok so everything’s going good until mid July. Same amount blood and pain and urgency. My inr was normal and I felt fine otherwise so I decide to just wait it out after a few days the pain and bleeding stopped after a couple days but the urine was cloudy and urgency still there so I just go to urgent care bc the hospital was worthless last time. Again, they say it’s a UTI and give me antibiotics. Negative cultures and negative STI/STD tests.

Ultimately, the urgency and discomfort stayed for another 4 weeks when I finally was home from my internship. I got to a urologist who says all cultures negative except for yeast which must be in my bladder? Gave me a week of oral fluconazole and it hasn’t been back since (yet). 

BUT what makes me nervous is that I’ve had several yeast infections before and they always had the same itching and discomfort and it was definitely different. And if you saw the amount of blood that I was putting out you’d just think there’s no way a yeast infection is doing that. It was insane. Think a full urine sample cup of just blood. The last part that has me on edge is about two weeks after I finished my antibiotics with no warning or previous feeling of needing to urinate, straight up peed my pants. Out of nowhere. For no reason. How does that happen???? Anyways those things plus the return of my periods plus the fact that they keep getting worse every month (severe cramps this last time around, the worst and longest cramps I’ve had ever, suddenly having hot flashes all the time, and then extreme bloating both during and off my period), makes me nervous that there’s something being missed. I don’t know what, but something feels off and I don’t even know where to start. People of Reddit, please help! 

TLDR; peeing massive amounts of blood 3 different times, diagnosed with uti despite negative cultures and no other typical uti symptoms. Return of periods and horrible cramps despite being on mirena. Worried that something worse is going on.

9jkdfe,1,2018-09-28,[M4F] Body Perception Program,dare-2-bare,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9jkdfe/m4f_body_perception_program/,"I had only just started at the college having completed the induction week before beginning the three year course in Business Studies. Not the most exciting profession but I thought it would give me a good grounding to keep my career options open.

Walking into my first seminar of the day, I'm greeted by the lecturer, a jaded looking guy in a demure shirt and trousers who hands me a note. I notice that it has a copy of my access card photo on it, it must have been for the lecturer to identify me by. Reading the note, it simply says 'Hello James, please proceed to the Dean's office in the campus administration building'.

I look up at the lecturer but he has already switched his attention to the rest of the class already taking their seats. Maybe there's an issue with the disbursement of my loan for the tuition fees or a change to one of the modules I signed up for, different issues and scenarios running through my mind as I make my way across the lawn in front of the imposing admin building. After getting directions from the girl on the front desk, obviously an intern working for minimum wage, I make my way along the almost deserted but brightly lit corridor until I find the dark solid wood door with the word DEAN in capital letters on a brass placard. My knuckles wrap with a deep knock before I hear ""come in"".

Stepping into the ornate room, lavishly decorated with dark wood, certificates, pictures, accolades and book cases lining the wall, my attention is first drawn to the Dean sitting behind a desk that looks like it could have been there since the inception of the college itself. She looks to be maybe 50-something, dressed in a sharp pin-striped suit, glasses delicately resting on her seasoned face, her eyes studying me with a look of intrigue, indifference and purpose. ""Please James, take a seat"", your hand gesturing to one of the leather chesterfield chairs across from her. 

I'd already noticed when I came in that I hadn't been the only one summoned but it's not until I take my seat that I look over to you, your slender figure comfortably supported in the chair, cute, delicate features framed by long nourished hair that cascades over your shoulders. The look in your eyes as they silently connect with mine, searching with the same curiosity tells me that you have no idea what this is about either.

""We've had a change in policy for the college,"" the Dean started to explain, removing her glasses and placing them on the polished table before her. ""We're going to pick a couple of students each week. Here, this will explain further."" Opening a paper file that until now I hadn't noticed, she extracted a couple of pamphlets and handed one to each of us.

Each of us could have been the only one in the room as we carefully studied the material. Embossed with a glossy finish, the front cover had a picture of a nude man and woman on it. 

""You can review that later,"" she told us, both of us looking at one another, searching for some kind of indication that at least one of us understood what was going on. ""It explains a new program we have, where we will select a couple of students each week to attend college in the nude. It's a program being pioneered by the government to tackle body dysmorphia and the attitudes of young people such as yourselves in accepting their bodies. This college is the first to undertake this program. You have both been selected at random and you will not be permitted to wear any clothing this week during college hours, except shoes and socks if you wish. Could you please undress now?""

You looked at us both so matter-of-factly, no hesitation or uncertainty in your voice and a look of impatience on your face, as though to ask what the delay was for with more important matters to attend to.

You were the first to speak up ""I'm sorry what???!"" your eyes wide with disbelief and shock. ""With all due respect, you've got to be out of your mind if you think i'm going to take my clothes off and walk around campus in front of everyone."" crossing your arms in front of your chest defensively. 

""Miss Samantha"" started the Dean, her now fierce eyes also turning to me ""and this goes for you too Mr James, this is a mandatory program, instructed by the government and if you do not cooperate, you will be removed from this institution with a note on your permanent record that will remain for the rest of your life. You have 2 minutes as of now.""

I could see the tears already gathering at your eye liner topped dams. Turning to me, fear and panic strewn across your face, ""I don't know you James but you this is insane right? I mean they can't force us!""

""One minute"" the Dean said, resolute in her demand.

My mind was a mess right now. I definitely couldn't have even dreamt this up if I had tried on the scenarios I played through my head on the way here. Naked for the whole week. I couldn't even get my head around that statement. ""What choice do we have? We lose our places and careers and it's on our permanent record for the rest of our lives"", tears now rolling down your delicate cheeks trying to accept our fate. 

Placing the pamphlet on the desk I pull my t-shirt over my head exposing my toned youthful torso. ""What are you doing??"" You say through panicked sobs.

""You'd do well to follow Mr Jame's lead Miss Samantha. He obviously understands the value of education at this institution"", a sly grin of satisfaction creeping into the edges of her pursed lips. 

I unzipped my bag ready to place my clothes in before the Dean interrupted. ""Oh you'll have to leave your clothes here, we can't risk you putting them back on the moment you step out of the door"" as she gestured towards two cardboard boxes placed against the wall to our right, our names taped to them on pieces of white paper. 

I could feel your eyes following me as I rose from the chair, taking the couple of steps on the plush carpet needed to stand in front of my box. Dropping my t-shirt in I popped the button on my jeans, releasing the zip and lowered them to the floor, stepping out of each leg independently before they joined my t-shirt in the box. I stood there in a pair of socks which were quickly removed, my boxers the only item of clothing left on my body.

""James.... you can't? You're really going to...."" The tears didn't seem to be falling anymore, your attention captivated by my submission. The words reverberated in my head again, what choice do I have? I closed by eyes, took a deep breath and hooked my thumbs into the elasticated waistband, liberating the final item of clothing from my body as I stood there with my back to both of you. Throwing them in with the rest of my clothing there was nothing left for me to do but turn around and return to my seat, giving you both a full unobstructed view of my member as it hung loosely between my legs, the hair around the top trimmed neatly and as far as you could see, seemingly smooth along the shaft and below. I could see your eyes following it as I took my place back at my seat, resolved to my fate.

""It seems that it's your turn Miss Samantha. Mr James has already demonstrated what it means to be a part of the community at this college""

""You won't get away with this"" you hiss scathingly at the Dean, only serving to amuse her it seems as she smiles back at you. I watch as you angrily pace over to the box and without any measure of finesse or femininity as you start to remove your clothing, throwing each item with a demonstrated reluctance until you're standing there in a matching black pair of underwear, the french knickers perfectly accentuating the taught curvature of your toned ass. With your back to us, I watch as your hands move to the the clasp on your bra, releasing it in one smooth motion, a skill I felt should be taught to guys in school! I watch as the straps roll down your outstretched slender arms, dropping directly into the box in front of you. Your head turns, your eyes thin and angry as you look at the Dean, her expression blank but seemingly enjoying her position of power. I hear you utter 'bitch' under your breath as you quickly pull down the delicate underwear, bending at the waist as you do so and giving me a perfect view of the smooth orbs perched at the top of your toned and now bare thighs and just the briefest glimpse of the smooth lips nestled in the gap between them.

This time my eyes follow you as you cross your arms in front of you, trying to preserve some sense of dignity and modesty but all the same I can see the definition of your torso leading down to a neatly trimmed thin strip accenting the start of where every guy and probably some girls, would love to be. Despite the obstruction I can see the pertness of your chest and I would guess probably somewhere between a B and a C cup. Despite my predicament, I can feel a familiar stirring happening between my legs and I pray that the feeling will go away!

""Good, I'm glad we got over that. Now, there are some rules which you must follow. All of the staff here have been briefed to enforce them and failure to do so will result in a punishment. If you continue to resist the program, you will be automatically expelled. Nod if you understand."" We both nodded, relenting to the situation. ""Excellent, now we have re-arranged your timetables so that you are in the same classes without disturbing your program. You are not permitted to cover yourselves in any way, effective immediately"", her instruction unquestionably aimed at your still crossed arms. She paused until you rolled your eyes, repositioning your arms on the chair rests and revealing two amazingly pert breasts accented by a pair of perfectly proportioned little pink buds. The stirring between my legs continued as I tried to divert my attention back to the instructions being given. ""You will go about your days as usual and you will allow people to take pictures of they request them. As part of the program, you are also permitted"" there was a pause as she examined her copy of the pamphlet, ""actually you are encouraged to engage in any sexual activity on campus at any time or place you desire. However, this is only allowed to happen between the two of you only."" Her eyes coming back to meet both of ours. 

It couldn't be helped and with our current state of undress, as well as the persistent mention of sex, my member had grown to its fullest and proudest state as it throbbed between my legs, protruding towards the underside of the desk in front of us, its presence not escaping the attention of your eyes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, I'll leave it there but I think you can see where i'm going with this. Perhaps you feel disgusted, ashamed or embarrassed about it all but then you start to enjoy the attention, as well as the opportunity to tease me back into my current state in front of everyone. Getting more brazen until you need me inside you, irrespective of where we are or who's watching."

Outside the Dirsken Senate Office building on Thursday morning, Cameron Mixon, a 22-year-old Georgetown Law School student was sporting a tee-shirt with the slogan: “Men Are Trash.”

“I love your shirt!” one woman told Mixon. “It’s amazing,” another agreed. By 9:30 a.m., Mixon said, about 20 people had asked to take photos next to her.

Even by the super-charged standards of American politics, passions were red lining on Capitol Hill Wednesday for the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on an allegation of a 1980s sexual assault that has placed Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination in grave danger.

“Kava-No!” shouted the protesters who marched Thursday morning from the steps of the Supreme Court to the Dirksen Senate office building, where the target of their ire would soon face a kind of political trial. ““We believe Anita Hill! We believe Christine Ford!”

But just as America is divided on Kavanaugh’s fate, so were the activists, protesters and counter-protesters on Capitol Hill Thursday as some of the most explosive social and political dynamics of the Trump era collided in the form of a nationally-televised spectacle complete with anger, tears and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court.

They included Josh Ertle, 32-year-old retail worker wearing a shirt and a trucker hat that both sported President Donald Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.”

Ertle said he was showing up to support both Kavanaugh and Trump — despite the fact that he himself had been sexually abused by a great-uncle as a child. Ertle said that he only came forward himself many years later, but still thinks that the context of Ford’s accusation would undermine survivors like himself. “This makes people not believed anymore because they’ve made this completely political,” he said.

Tara McCoy, 39, a homemaker from Martinsburg, West Virginia, stood back on the sidewalk, wearing an “I stand with Brett” shirt and held a “Confirm Kavanaugh” sign.

“He needs to be confirmed,” McCoy said. “The circus needs to stop,” she said.

A moment later, a man with television camera stepped up to her. “I’m with ShowTime’s The Circus,” he said.

Ford’s supporters saw not a circus but a tragic forum for an alleged sexual assault survivor to tell her story.

“I can’t imagine what this has to be for her,” said Tracey Cordor, 35, a protest organizer who serves as director of the Racial Justice Campaign at the Center for Popular Democracy. She wore a shirt that declared “Believe Women.”

Others had come to depict Kavanaugh as the real victim. In a park near the Dirksen building, a crowd of the conservative judge’s supporters gathered for a rally. A group of young people leaving the park said they were students at Grove City College in Western Pennsylvania. The students, who declined to provide their names, said many of them were members of their school’s College Republicans group. They had left campus last night at 10 p.m. and arrived in Washington at 3 a.m. on a bus paid for, they said, by the American Conservative Union.

Inside Dirksen, anti-Kavanaugh protesters clogged elevators as they tried to access the building’s second floor, the site of the hearing, where Capitol Police — who restricted the floor to congressional staff and a few preapproved reporters — continuously turned them back.

Another group of protesters marched silently through the building. Some had had black tape affixed over their mouths and others held up their hands. One middle-aged woman had written, “I did not tell” in red marker on her right palm and, “I was 15” on her left palm. The protesters walked up a flight of stairs leading to the second floor, where they were also turned back by police.

The actress Alyssa Milano, who has become a prominent face of the #MeToo movement, flew in from Los Angeles to attend Ford’s testimony. ""I felt like I needed to be here to show my solidarity for Dr. Ford,"" Milano told ABC News from inside the hearing room. ""On this day that will be very difficult for her.""

In a hallway during a break in Ford’s testimony, one woman confronted Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the judiciary committee, and told him that she “was raped 13 years ago” and asked whether he believed her. “You needed to go to the cops. Go to the cops,” Graham said.

On the fifth floor, dozens of people lined up to wait for a seat in an overflow gallery set up in another hearing room. As the hearing began, those left waiting outside the overflow gallery pulled up livestreams of the proceedings on their phones.

“My girl!” exclaimed one congressional intern who watched on an iPhone as Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., began her opening statement.

Of about 85 spectators watching the proceedings via closed circuit television on two large screens in the overflow gallery, more than 50 of them were woman.

At several points, laughter punctured the tense silence in the gallery as spectators watched the emotionally wrenching testimony taking place three floors below.

In her opening statement, Ford said she would need a caffeinated beverage after delivering her opening remarks. Following her statement, Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, asked if she needed a break, and she responded cheerily, “I’m okay. I’ve got the coffee, thank you very much,” as the camera cut to her holding up a paper cup that Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., had just handed to her. The moment prompted uproarious laughter in the gallery.

Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin’s comment that “Mark Judge should be subpoenaed from his Bethany Beach hideaway,” drew scattered laughter. Judge, who allegedly participated in the assault on Ford, was found at a beach house earlier this week by the Washington Post and declined to speak to the paper, just as he has so far declined to voluntarily testify to Congress.

And when Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor hired by Senate Republicans to question Ford, asked her how she got to Washington, she responded simply, “an airplane,” drawing more laughter.

Some gallery spectators, who seemed to favor Ford, grew increasingly agitated with Grassley. In response to a request from Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobucher to enter documents into the record, Grassley shot back, “You got what you wanted. I think you’d be satisfied.” His response drew disapproving gasps and an “Oh my god,” from the gallery.

During a lunch break, Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican on the committee, called Ford “a good witness.”

“She’s articulate,” he said. “She’s an attractive person.” Pressed on what he meant, he added: “In other words, she’s pleasing.”

A floor vote during the hearing break gave reporters a chance to question senators about the hearing. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he was “not happy” that the panel’s Republicans had outsourced their questioning to Mitchell.

During a second recess in the hearing, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. — who had given a rousing speech praising Ford for coming forward — approached Ford and, in an overheard remark, privately told her, “Thank you for telling the truth.”

Graham left the hearing room and vented his frustrations to a gaggle of reporters. “The friends on the other side set it up to be just the way it is,” he said. “I feel ambushed as the majority.""

In between hearings, Mitchell, the prosecutor working for the committee’s Republicans, paused in the hallway outside the hearing room to pat a service dog on the head.

Kavanaugh’s opening statement, an angry and defiant rebuttal of Ford’s accusation, drew gasps and exasperated responses from the gallery.

When he named “revenge on behalf of the Clintons” as a motive for the accusations against him, the gallery erupted with outbursts of “What?” and “Oh my god” and “seriously?”

Kavanaugh’s warning to Democrats that “What goes around comes around” drew another “Oh my god.” And when he choked up after invoking his 10-year-old daughter, one spectator cried out: “Come on.”

From there, spectators in the gallery began to greet various Kavanaugh answers with derisive laughter.

By the late afternoon, the appetite for the spectacle had waned, and roughly half the seats in the gallery sat empty. At a quarter to seven, the hearing adjourned, with the future composition of the Supreme Court uncertain.

Afterwards, Grassley, marching up the stairs with a police escort, did not respond to a question about how he thought the hearing had gone.

He was followed up the stairs by Booker, who told POLITICO, “I’m going to have to process it all before I comment.”

On the ground floor, Graham walked quickly down the hallway trailed by survivors of sexual assault who peppered him with questions.

“Senator Graham, I’m a survivor, do you believe me?” asked Mary Jane Maestas, a disabled 52-year-old from Delta, Colo.

After Graham disappeared around a corner, Meastas and a fellow activist — both wearing shirts reading “I’m a survivor and I vote” — recounted the entirety of their exchange with Graham to POLITICO.

“I’m a survivor, will you vote 'no' for me?” Maestas said she asked Graham, following it up with, “Senator Graham do you have a soul?”

“Yes, I do,” she said Graham responded, prompting her to say: “Because we’re all starting to wonder.”

It is quite simple to take the [ccie lab exam](https://cciedump.spoto.net/ccie-rs-lab.php), because the ccie exam does not have the imaginary difficulties, but also because of the need of work, need to master the knowledge of ccie lab.  
In July 2015, when I started my internship at the company, I often heard colleagues talk about VLANs, saying that I want to configure vlan. Later, because I need to deploy the VM myself, I have to configure the network and configure the VLAN of the VM. Configure the VM’s IP, Gateway, etc., but there will be some inexplicable problems. I don’t know how to solve it. I can only find help from my colleagues. At the time of my college, I passed the computer three-level network technology exam, but this exam did not elaborate on this content. Later, I read the CCNA study guide before I took the exam. Then I got an idea of ​​the VLAN and the ping process, but I still don’t know what the routing protocol is and how the route is delivered. Later, after getting the offer, the company is mainly engaged in the research and development of SDN. SDN is nothing more than simplifying the network. I don’t know why the original network should be simplified. Why is the original network complicated and how the original network is structured?

In July 2016, I came into contact with a project about the management of BGP routing to a controller. At that time, there were some configurations of BGP, OSPF, and VRF. At that time, I was responsible for how to configure these configurations and configure them for the router. Things don’t matter, but the configuration is not very understanding after all. These configurations are the core after all, especially the topology of the entire network and the routing, how to separate the controller plane and the data plane to implement SDN. In addition, according to colleagues, after taking CCIE, you can have a bonus.  
Can learn things, but also get bonuses, how can such a good thing be missed. With these questions and the benefits of getting bonuses, I prepare for CCIE lab exam."
9jly64,3,2018-09-28,Girlfriend (21) Suddenly Talking About Breaking Up and How I (24) Deserve Better,jimmyshmittens,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jly64/girlfriend_21_suddenly_talking_about_breaking_up/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for only 4 months now, but I really love her and am new to dating (never been in a relationship). After trying out Tinder for about a year and a half, I met her at university. She was hilarious, silly, outgoing, responsible, and worked hard. We clicked immediately and started dating not too long after. The reason I asked her to be my girlfriend was that even though she was a bit overweight (30-35 pounds overweight at 5'), I loved her personality, which I actually enjoyed her presence rather than just her looks. It did bother me because I just prefer skinnier girls, but I always had a great time with her which really made me question what I used to think love was. 


Anyways, things were going great, but all of a sudden, after a month long vacation in Japan during which she didn't enjoy as much as she thought she would have, she began to feel really anxious and depressed. She works almost everyday, dances, and has an internship on top of going to school. She began to say things along the lines that I will eventually leave her for someone better, I deserve better than her, etc. I forgot what triggered that. She just came back from a dance workshop which another ""really good looking"" female dancer taught. I made a joke like ""Man, the things I would do to her (the female dancer)"", only to say afterwards ""The things I would do to her, like ignore her, and not pay attention to her, because I already have my awesome girlfriend!"" We make jokes like this all the time, and I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. My girlfriend began to remark on how ""obese"" she (my girlfriend) is and how ""ugly"" she is compared to the female choreographer. How my girlfriend is a ""fat, ugly, piece of shit who I will eventually leave for someone skinnier and prettier"". I kept reassuring her that I would not leave her and that I love my girlfriend for who she is now, and I never would have gotten with her if I didn't want her. But she kept insisting that she's fat and ugly and nothing will change that and that I should find someone else. 


I do have an issue with her weight and do want her to be healthier. We've talked about going to the gym and eating healthier, and I'd help her change her diet (cutting 250-500 cals a day), install something like MyFitnessPal to track calories, and go to the gym more often. I don't like her suddenly talking like this and I want to help her. She is already beginning to see a psychologist at school, but she just started and she is only seen once a month for an hour each session which sucks. 


I don't know why this is happening now? She's had suicidal episodes back in high school. She's been in an abusive relationship. She just got an IUD 3 months ago which might be affecting her hormones (Kyleena). Why is she self-sabotaging now? I used to sabotage relationships because I thought they'd be better off without me and I felt like they would leave me anyways, so I better end the relationship first so I have the power of ending it. But I realized it's best to just keep trying because a relationship could become something so beautiful if you let it. 


Anyone have any advice, personal experience, or anything I should keep in mind? 


Note: I won't break up with her. I love her, it's early, and I don't give up easily because I care about people. "
9jm2mv,36,2018-09-28,"Diverse Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy Topics, Dry British Humor: Four Excellent Audiobooks Written and Narrated by Yahtzee Croshaw",Flopsy_Gearhead,audiobooks,https://www.reddit.com/r/audiobooks/comments/9jm2mv/diverse_scifi_fantasy_topics_dry_british_humor/,"**Narration:** I hesitated to listen because the author narrated his own books. Only one other fiction book in my library had that author/narrator combination: [Patrick Rothfuss reading The Slow Regard of Silent Things](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Slow-Regard-of-Silent-Things-Audiobook/B00MOXI512). I did not like that audiobook; the voice of a middle-aged man was too incongruous in the character of waifish teenage Auri. In contrast, I thoroughly enjoyed Yahtzee Croshaw’s readings of his own books. He would have been a great narrator in any case, but beyond his voice skills, his authorship gave his narration the weight of instant canon. Excellent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Outlandish Topics:** I hesitated to listen because the plot synopses looked so ridiculous. Fortunately, the nonsensical themes were so well handled that I didn't need mindbending effort to suspend disbelief. These books were effortless enjoyment. (Despite three good experiences with this, I'm still worried about the fourth - see below.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Likable Characters, Welcoming Worlds:** These factors are always important to my enjoyment of books. Yahtzee Croshaw consistently delivered these - see below.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Library (the Oeuvre,** if you're feeling fancy and you know how to pronounce that word)**:** The list below shows the order in which I listened, but it's “wrong” (ie, it's not in chronological order of publication). Any order should work; the books are completely independent (except for some fun wink-wink nudge-nudge references about shared world elements), so you can pick by bargain/sale status or by your interest:

* [Will Save the Galaxy for Food](https://www.audible.com/pd/Will-Save-the-Galaxy-for-Food-Audiobook/B06X3QQTFH) \- published in 2017. “The novel is written from the perspective of a down-on-his-luck star pilot who gets unwillingly drawn into big events. Although the protagonist initially comes across as a clumsy oaf who only cares about himself, it turns out he is mostly very competent and genuinely cares about helping others. … While much of Croshaw's humor is low-brow, it is usually clever and well-executed, and many parts of the book had me laughing out loud. He mixes situational humor, irony, amusing character flaws, humorous non-sequiturs, and other forms of humor to keep the laughs fresh and varied.”
* [Mogworld](https://www.audible.com/pd/Mogworld-Audiobook/B009EVGGEK) \- published in 2012. Don’t read too much about Mogworld in the reviews or synopses; just listen and let it unfold and be surprised. It’s in the LitRPG genre; that’s all you need to know. “Mogworld is a comic fantasy novel in the tradition of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett.”  The protagonist sounds grim in the following publisher's description, but he absolutely is not grim -- he's dryly humorous and will make you his friend: ""In a world full to bursting with would-be heroes, Jim couldn't be less interested in saving the day. His fireballs fizzle. He's awfully grumpy. Plus, he's been dead for about 60 years. When a renegade necromancer wrenches him from eternal slumber and into a world gone terribly, bizarrely wrong, all Jim wants is to find a way to die properly, once and for all."" I worried that the apparently-suicidal theme would be triggering or insensitive, but instead the protagonist is endearing and enjoyable.
* [Differently Morphous](https://www.audible.com/pd/Differently-Morphous-Audiobook/B07958SX8N) \- published in 2018. “… gelatinous, otherworldly creatures are infesting the English countryside. Which is making life for the Ministry of Occultism difficult, because magic is supposed to be their best kept secret. After centuries in the shadows, the Ministry is forced to unmask, exposing the country's magical history - and magical citizens - to a brave new world of social media, government scrutiny, and public relations.” It's a fun world with diverse and engaging characters; I liked all of them in different ways. I even enjoyed the characters who weren't designed to be likable (ie, sullen teenagers). It was easiest to like Allison (an eager-beaver teenage intern at the Ministry who has a photographic memory, but doesn't have any wished-for magical skills); and her forced-into-mentorship partner Dr Diablory (who speaks in Shakespearean style and acts with the flourishes of a stage magician); and the childlike, trash-eating aliens.
* [Jam](https://www.audible.com/pd/Jam-Audiobook/B00GJVAEZK) \- published in 2013. “We were prepared for an earthquake. We had a flood plan in place. We could even have dealt with zombies. Probably. But no one expected the end to be quite so…sticky…or strawberry scented.” I haven’t listened to this one yet, but was very happy to pick it up in Audible’s recent buy-one get-one sale. I grouped it as “excellent” in this post title (""four excellent books"") based on my hope and on high ratings at Audible. Can anyone here reassure me that *Jam* will match up to the other three books for me? :)

A caveat to my statement that ""any order should work"" -- one reviewer wrote the following about the first book (Mogworld): ""On his blog, Yahtzee wrote that it was really hard to learn to speak slowly again and if you listen to the audio sample you can tell. The narration early on is stilted, as if he's trying to compensate. ...  you need to get through at least the first 3 hours. By that time, Yahtzee's voice has warmed up and the story picks up enough to let the jokes occur more naturally."" Therefore, if you listen in chronological order of publication, you might notice some weaknesses growing into strengths.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Other Job:** Apparently [the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_%22Yahtzee%22_Croshaw) started as a video game developer, then became a video game reviewer (and still posts [weekly reviews at ""The Escapist""](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation)), and is followed in one subreddit for his current reviews ( /r/ZeroPunctuation ) and another subreddit for his previous podcasts ( /r/LetsDrownOut ). I don't know anything about those, but I'll cross-post to those subreddits too - the more the merrier. :)

&amp;#x200B;

**The TLDR:** I hope a few readers/listeners here will join me in the enjoyment and appreciation of these 4 excellent audiobooks: the known ([Will Save the Galaxy for Food](https://www.audible.com/pd/Will-Save-the-Galaxy-for-Food-Audiobook/B06X3QQTFH), [Mogworld](https://www.audible.com/pd/Mogworld-Audiobook/B009EVGGEK), [Differently Morphous](https://www.audible.com/pd/Differently-Morphous-Audiobook/B07958SX8N)) and the hoped ([Jam](https://www.audible.com/pd/Jam-Audiobook/B00GJVAEZK))!"
9jn0ot,19,2018-09-28,Futa4F - Lilith Fairchild: High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9jn0ot/futa4f_lilith_fairchild_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my aggression spiked (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- *The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The New Kid*: This is just too easy... Some poor little lost thing, torn away from her comfort zone, perhaps from some country where their grasp on English is less than fluent... Let's just say that I've always wanted a pet.

- *The Competition*: All right, to be honest, I've never been what one could consider a *sporty chick*. Tossing a ball around and pretending I'm hot shit? Fuck. That. Boxing, on the other hand... Working up a sweat and *clobbering* some pretty little thing? Sounds like my kind of evening. And you'd be surprised what kind of things happen happen in the locker room afterwards... **Bruised skin, bloody lips and perhaps a lost tooth or two. Not for the faint of heart.**

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful summertime employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *The Jock:* All right, I know one or two guys are reading this. Well, I don't top dudes, and if you want inside my ass, you've got to be *hot* shit. I'm talking chiselled-from-marble, fuck-happy *and* able to go toe-to-toe with me at my worst. Four therapists haven't been able to pull off that last one, so I doubt you can. If you're some needledick pillowhumper who's looking to feel a thick rod rearranging his colon, find a dude. On the other hand, if you think you can pin me, drill me *and* tame me, well... I'd like to see you try. 

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

---

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm trying something different today: I’ll be playing a bitchy, mean 18 year-old futadomme with more than a few destructive habits. Everything above was in-character, by the way. ;)*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.* **Detailed replies get priority!**

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, dubious consent, impregnation (one-night stands only), cumplay, sweat, spit, spanking, facesitting, modification (piercings, tattoos, etc.), humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are ageplay (18+ only), full noncon, vomit (unless plot-relevant) and scat.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon,*

9jn3vu,299,2018-09-28,"I may be receiving a job offer with a significant pay increase, can I use it as leverage to get more money at my current job that I enjoy?",Riley_Cubs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9jn3vu/i_may_be_receiving_a_job_offer_with_a_significant/,"So I currently split time between two IT tier 1 support roles. One job is two days a week at a food manufacturer and I hate that place, but the place I'm at three days a week is a local MSP (managed service provider) about 5 minutes from my house that I love working at. I started at the MSP about a little over a year ago as an intern making $10 an hour. Around February I was offered a non related IT job for $14.00hr. Only working about 20hrs a week at the MSP I used that offer to ask for full time work at the MSP. The MSP didn't give me full time but they did match the pay and got me another part time job at the food manufacturer for the same pay. So currently I work about 42hrs a week between the two places making 14hr at both.

I've been dying to work at a single place for a couple months now, I'm tired of having to split my time between two places. I really love the work I get to do at the MSP and I enjoy the people I work with so I would love to get full time employment there. I just feel like I haven't been offered such things because I haven't really asked them for it since February. So Monday I got said I've had enough of working at two places and started submitting my resume to a few jobs in my area. Less then 8 hours later I got a call from another job I submitted my resume to telling me they would like to schedule an interview next week. This job is pretty much covers the same duties that I do now but is offering between $20-22/hr compared to the $14hr i make now. If they offer me the job should I use that as leverage to try to get my MSP job to match their offer? Or is it a bad idea to try to use another job offer to leverage better pay twice in the same year? I'm prepared to take the new job if needed, but I would really love to get hired full time at the MSP as I enjoy how much I get to do there, the people I work with and how much I learn on a regular basis. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!

Edit: I should have mentioned that my in the past my supervisor did mention to me that if I ever received other job offers to inform them so they can evaluate the offer and see what they can do for me regarding possibly matching such an offer. Not sure if this is common practice or not but I figured I should include that detail. Also the new job would be about a 35min-45min drive one way compared to my current job which is about 4 minutes from my house.

TLDR; Possibly getting offered an IT job with better pay. I really like my current job but could really use the increased pay. Should I use this as leverage to get full time work and better pay at my current job?"

I have constant pimples and acne on my face because of the touching, I've gone to a dermatologist and I've been prescribed medication for my hormonal acne and Tretonin cream. Even then pimples persist because I just can't stop. I know I have nice skin naturally and with the Tretonin it should be glowing but yet I'm stupid and I can't stop. I see it in the mirror and I just feel such a strong compulsion. It's gotten to the point where it's putting a huge wedge in my relationship with my boyfriend he hates it and gets very angry with me when I do it. I've been to a counselor, we tried to find a replacement behavior but nothing ever gave me that satisfying feeling of picking or popping so we tried to just focus on keeping my face clear which works for a little bit but I've since relapsed multiple times. I've also moved away from home for an internship and have absolutely no money for a counselor again. I'm under so much financial stress right now and I feel like I'm going to crumble, no one knows how I feel and I don't know any one with the same problem. Please I could use advise I'm desperate. "
9jo48i,2,2018-09-28,Don Welke's Presence Felt Throughout Padres On Deck Game,brown_boot,PadresFarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PadresFarm/comments/9jo48i/don_welkes_presence_felt_throughout_padres_on/,"SAN DIEGO — Don Welke loved baseball. More specifically, he loved prospects.

The Padres chose to honor that love in memoriam this week, renaming their annual prospects game at Petco Park the Don Welke On Deck Classic.

Welke, a renowned talent evaluator who most recently served as Padres vice president of scouting operations, died on Sept. 19 at age 75. He spent more than 50 years in baseball, beginning as a scout for the Reds in 1965 and growing into one of the most influential scouts in the game, developing a long list of protégés that includes Padres general manager A.J. Preller.

The third edition of the Padres' prospects game was played Thursday night with Welke’s family in attendance and his name prominently displayed all throughout the stadium. A montage honoring his life and career played on the video board prior to first pitch, and a moment of silence was observed in his memory.

“The biggest thing is Don loved prospects, he loved scouting, he loved grassroots baseball, he loved seeing young kids on the way up and seeing kind of who the next great player was going to be,” Preller said. “This was a game he’d be most comfortable at, so we just felt it was really fitting to name the game in Don’s honor.”

Welke worked his way up from being a scout and before long played an integral role in building some of the best teams of the last 50 years.

He was a key component of the Royals' playoff teams of the 1970s, the Blue Jays’ back-to-back championship teams in 1992-93, the Orioles' playoff teams of 1996-97 and, most recently, the Rangers’ back-to-back World Series teams in 2010-11. In 2014, he left the Rangers to join his protégé in San Diego after Preller was named Padres GM.

Preller and his staff quickly concluded following Welke’s death that the prospects game should be renamed in honor, especially in light of the fact the Padres annually play the game against prospects from the Rangers, the last two organizations Welke worked for.

“We talked about it with the family and just I think ultimately it was obviously pretty fitting,” Preller said. “Rangers and Padres, it’s two teams he had a big impact on, two organizations that he had a big impact on.”


Welke’s influence goes beyond the field of play. Affectionately known as “Coach”, Welke made a habit of familiarizing himself with employees from top to bottom in every organization he worked for. He had nicknames and even occasionally personalized songs for almost everyone he worked with, from the elevator operators to the young interns to the front office officials occupying corner suites.

“As good of a baseball mind, he was an even better person, one of my closest friends for sure,” Preller said. “I think the biggest thing to me was just his ability to connect with everybody. He’d be the guy who’d have a nickname for the sales intern and two minutes later he’d be in the owners office recommending a big trade or free agent signing.

""His ability to connect with people in all walks of life, not just baseball, et cetera, he loved that. He loved to be at a game and kind of pretend like he wasn’t really paying attention, messing around with the usher or the elevator person, but at the end of the day he was doing his job. He was watching, doing it with his style.”

Preller, who was 23 years old and just starting out in baseball when he met Welke, kept his composure in discussing his old friend but acknowledged not having Welke beside him for the game was going to be difficult.

But through renaming the game in Welke’s honor, the longtime scout’s presence will still be felt throughout.

“He was a guy (I) spoke to almost daily for the last 15 years. It’s going to take a lot of getting used to (not having him here),” Preller said. “Looking over when one of the guys does well or asking his thought about this prospect or this player, him looking over and giving me that glance, that kind of knowing look, that this guy is going to be pretty good, that will definitely take some getting used to.

“I don’t know if you’ll ever fully get over that, but seeing his name up here, it’s appropriate. He loved this game the last few years. He would have loved it tonight. He’s a guy that basically gave his life to baseball and loved the scouting end of it, and he made a lot of impact on the people here today.”

9joo44,0,2018-09-28,European character in GG or how Arcsys learned to love Europe (Satire),Dreynard,Guiltygear,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/9joo44/european_character_in_gg_or_how_arcsys_learned_to/,"The following contains an exclusive ^^satirical ^^and ^^made-up interview with one of the person involved in the character design and conception for Guilty Gear on how they integrated Europe to their game and design philosophy.

**Intro and how Ky is french**

**Journalist** -Guilty Gear has a few european character, a land quite foreign for a japanese fighting game. How did you go about that?

**Designer** -With very thorough reasearch, and by trying to have a global understanding of what is Europe. We applied the same tricks we did for american character. Take Sol for instances. He embodies a good american: Gun, reckless offensive and rock. We always have a great understanding of foreign culture.

We nailed it at such a point that sometimes we accidentally create european character.

**J** -Really ? Who are you thinking of ?

**D** -Yes. Well the most obvious one is Ky Kiske.

**J** -What's the story behind his europeanness?

**D** -So Ky is quite a special character, to us. He is one of our newbie character, that we recommand to beginner, so we put extra care in him. We had already designed Sol, had finished Ky, and were like: ""what kind of backstroy to give him? Where does he come from?"".

**J** -When you look at Ky, you sure think he is japanese, don't you?

**D** -That is actually what we tought at first. But during a very important team meeting, we discussed about grave matter and one of our newlyled colleague talked about his honeymoon in Europe and how he had visited France. 

That’s when I had, dare I say, a spark of genius ! Of course, since Ky wasn’t japanes and wasn't gay, he was european. What we hadn’t realised yet, was that Ky was actually french. He had already the name to match it, since, as everyone know, France is the Japan of Europe. By designing a japanese  character, we had indeed designed a european, french character. We, by chance and talent, deisgned a character respectful of what France is.

**J** -But I'm sure respect wasn't the only driving factor in Ky’s backstory?

**D** -No, of course, we also wanted a way to reach new audiences. As a kind of... some would say pandering, but I disagree... we, as I said, made Ky a frenchman, and went even further: in typical french fashion, we had him become a king. France loves their king, you know? However it's not pandering, it's just common sense and respect. The same values that lead us [to merge France, Germany and Spain on our map](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/631553/ss_f09dde415d5c42410ab877ccfaaa55564aaa1e80.1920x1080.jpg), in anticipation of a united Europe, or never translate our game in anything but english for the west.

**Axl**

**J** -Speaking of english, there is also an english character in the game, Axl. How did it go for him ?

**D** -Axl is quite an original character. We actually had a lot of help. I think we cannot even claim we got the idea of Axl.

**J** -How come? Who did create Axl?

**D** -Actually, the idea of Axl came from our localisation team in Texas. You may know them as the one who gave us the idea of the ""Neo New York"" stage. One of them, John, had went to work, years before, in England, in the outskirts of Manchester. There he was very impressed by the lifestyle and fighting style of the natives.

**J** -That's peculiar.

**D** -Indeed. But what was really appaling to us was how people could survive in such a threatening environnement. And, when we went to back to the story, we thought long and hard. We came to the conclusion that, if an ordinary man could have survived the Gears, the chav was that man. That's how we conceived the lore of Axl, an englishman who went and lived through the worst periods for humanity.

**J** -So, you're quite proud of how he ended up being, how english he was?

**D** -I think so. Since no one in the team ever went to England, we relied a lot on John to design the character. We had to make a few concession, like giving up on him throwing empty beer bottle as a special, or not making him overweight, but I'm overall quite pleased with the result we reached.

**J** -It seems you can proudly say you incorporated european culture in your game.

**D** -Indeed, as our texan friends would say, ""Mission accomplished""

**THAT new german intern**

**J** -But do you have some disappointment, some things you would revisit?

**D** -Ah... Yes I have one. But there is quite backstory about that.

**J** -Please tell.

**D** -When working on Xrd we had a very important late meeting, and, as we wrapped up, everyone went home, except THAT new intern. He stayed at the office and started designing a new character.

**J** -That's a model employee

**D** -No, that was... I still shudder thinking about that. 

We went back the next morning. The office was full of empty beercans from the previous meeting. And he was there, asleep on the controller, finalising the output of his caracter.

**J** -In one night! I cannot believe...

**D** -Neither did we. We woke him up, while he was fine-tuning this character’s combo. THAT new intern was still completely shitfaced. We started shouting at him: ""What have you done? What have you done?"", and he meekly answered ""just try"". He didn’t fall in alcoholic coma from our breath, I will give him that.

**J** -Did you dare try?

**D** -Yes. Man was it weird. I was mashing button at random and still dealing huge damage, going left/right through the enemy and so on. In a way, it was genius, wicked genius. But we couldn't have that in our game.

**J** -So you deleted it?

**D** -No... THAT new intern went directly to Daisuke, and told him ""If you can correctly pronounce his move list, I will delete it myself, else we put it in the game"". And Daisuke asked: ""even in engrish?"" and he answered ""yes"". Daisuke accepted. He didn't know where he had stepped in.

**J**-I mean, he couldn't have lost that...

**D** -And how are you supposed to pronounce Siega Parato properly? Blin idyl? Kaltes Geschte... I cannot... THAT new intern gave us recording to train but it was impossible. So we sticked to our word and put his caracter in our game. He still allowed us one concession.

**J** -Wow, you really did all of that? 
 
**D** -We are people of pride, we gave our word and…

 His concession… He accepted to change his name from... 

*At this point, visibly shaken, the designer took a paper and wrote ""Leonhardt"" and some unreadable gibberish*

**D** -He accepted that we change the name from that to something more pronounceable, Leo Howaitofangu. 
But it still stick as a sore in our pride. THAT new intern then went on to work on Raven. Truly a tormented soul.

**J** -At least the move list wasn't in danish.

**D** -What is that? A disease?

**J** -Nevermind."

So Gina Haspel CIA director just contacted Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump yesterday in regards to Christine Blasey Ford and let them know Christine and her father are CIA and this is a smear op. I should have included this information with my correspondence with the Donald on Sunday evening the 23rd. I thought they all followed CIA movements, why weren't they already aware of this?.
Hammer is going to drop, watch Grassley. Deliberation on Kavanaugh confirmation has been scheduled for Friday in the Dirksen Bldg, room 226 beginning at 9:30.

The timing of the Thursday meeting set up by DNC Attorney was to align with the Cosby sentencing and the fact that Cosby used date rape drugs.

The allegations of Avenatti that his client could speak on date rape drugs and trains of high school boys having sex with intoxicated underage females where Avenatti also alleges were orchestrated by a teenage Kavanaugh. Evidence will soon come out that such parties did occur with Honey Trap Christine spiking the girls drinks with drugs obtained from Dr. Frederick T. Melges, her mentor.
Dr Melges is most likely the reason Christine became head of Stanford University’s CIA Undergraduate Internship Program. Her email is cblasey@stanford.edu

9jpcsk,7,2018-09-28,I'm a loser and I'm damn proud of it,Omnichromic,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9jpcsk/im_a_loser_and_im_damn_proud_of_it/,"This week I choked an internship interview and it resulted in me not getting the spot. That's fine, failure stings but that spot deserves to go to somebody who didn't choke it. 

I've spent the vast majority of my life as a failure. I've failed my parents, my friends, my classes and myself for a long time. Over time I've learned that's there is nothing I do better than fuck up and lose. I got angry, I was depressed, I broke myself down and shattered my self-confidence. I was convinced that one day my failures would lead to my suicide. It wasn't a matter of if, just a matter of when.

But then I met the right kind of people. The kind of friends that inspire you to become a better version of yourself. Because you think they deserve better, and they think you deserve better. I told myself that if I was going to be a loser, than I'm going to be the best damn loser that ever lived. Step by step, loss by loss, I learned how to fail properly. How to reflect, how not to dodge the blame. Losing taught me more about accountability and responsibility than any self help book ever could. 

Success is a process. It's a long, painful, shitty process paved with failure and fuck ups. But the first time I achieved it was the best feeling I've ever had in my life. I've learned how to embrace failure, time and time again, and overcome. And now, there's nothing I do better than fuck up and lose.

So what that I choked on this interview? It's reminded of the best quality I have. Failure is empowering. I've got time. I'll learn. And I'll be back next year, twice as determined as I was before. If that doesn't work, I'll do it again. That way, it's not a matter of if, just a matter of when.

TL;DR: I'm (metaphorically) ugly and I'm proud!"

I was told I should be prepared on these subjects:

    Basic testing knowledge
    SQL

    Logic
    API

The SQL part won't be very much of a problem, but the others? I was told, although I'm not sure, the 'Pseudocode' part would be a little bit of programming, which again isn't a problem at all. The 'Logic' would probably be some basic logic tests to check out if i have monkey brains or something of sort. The 'API' and the 'Basic testing knowledge' are the things that I have no experience, nor any idea what they should be about, so i can prepare for them.

Any ideas? :)"

I was very pleasantly surprised to see that WGU is taking 70 CU's from my Associates Degree in Computer Science, which I obtained from my local community college. With only 50 credits left to finish in the CS degree, I hope to finish in two terms (25 CU's per term). 

I have already secured a conditional offer for a Associate Software Engineering Job. This offer came from the same company I've been interning with the past 4 months and is contingent on completing my Bachelor's Degree. So you could say my motivations for quickly completing this degree are VERY strongly rooted. Basically if I can complete this degree in &lt;1 year, I am guaranteed a Software Engineering job with a large tech corporation.

I am 26 years old, married, with a 5 year old son. I work part-time (20 hours per week) as a Software Engineering Intern, which was my first job is a CS related field. I don't have any other Software Engineering experience (I used to work in retail). I feel like I'm definitely set up for success in this program, and it appears I may be ahead of a lot of people who are starting this new program. I will definitely be an active member here and can provide guidance to those who follow behind me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking forward to joining this community and finally finishing out this CS degree.

Cheers and I look forward to working through the coursework with you all!"
9jrqpk,2,2018-09-28,"My story, struggles, and successes",emls,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9jrqpk/my_story_struggles_and_successes/,"About 4 years ago I posted to this subreddit about my anxiety after getting clean from a 5 year opiate addiction. I wanted to share what’s happened in my life since. This serves me because I am having a really mentally hard time right now, so I want to reflect on my progress and get some catharsis. I also hope to help inspire/motivate/comfort others on this subreddit. 

After I overcame my battle with addiction, I really struggled to deal with anxiety, as I had lost my coping mechanism (drugs). I slowly built back my confidence through getting part-time jobs and eventually a full time retail job. Once I had built up my confidence, my boyfriend and I (who’d also gone through the addiction/recovery process) applied to college and in the fall of 2015 we began our studies. 

My anxiety in college was rough. I struggled with panic, inadequacy, depressive episodes, and near constant diarrhea (from anxiety). However, I slowly kept pushing myself to challenge my anxiety and depression, and build my strength. I took extra credit hours, I worked two years as a research assistant, I presented at research conferences, I flew internationally multiple times, I did internships abroad, I forced myself to make friends and socialize, I joined and eventually took executive positions in multiple clubs. All of these things were massive massive challenges, but I knew I couldn’t let my anxiety and depression keep me from fulfilling my potential. 

The summer before I graduated, I did an internship conducting research in Nepal. One research project was independent which was incredibly intimidating. The other one was with a PhD student and professor which provided more comfort. However, I was alone in the country, where I didn’t know the language, for over a month while doing my own research. I took terrifying bus rides on incredibly dangerous mountain roads, I flew on 50 year old planes (flying is one of my top anxieties) and took care of myself day to day even when my anxiety made me want to hide in my hotel room.

While there, in rural Nepal, I got a call from my parents. My sister (who was my best friend), my aunt, and my family dog were killed in a house fire. The next few weeks were beyond horrific; Traveling 36 hours home, alone, while dealing with these overwhelming emotions, burying my 29 year old sister and my aunt (my dogs body was never recovered so we couldn’t bury her), eulogizing my aunt (I wasn’t able to bear eulogizing my sister) and many many more traumatic moments. I can’t put into words how terrible that time was. 

However, following that month of intense trauma, I decided to return to Nepal and finish my research. I was in a dark place but I knew it wasn’t going to get better sitting home with no distractions day in and day out. Research is my passion and I needed to feel some
fulfillment again. 

After I returned home, I began classes. Trying to maintain my academic success was challenging, and even more daunting was that at that time I had to complete my grad school applications. It was so difficult to write about how I was a good candidate and how I was passionate about my studies when it felt like nothing mattered, including myself. However I did it, and ended up getting offered a fellowship to my top choice program. 
 
The next 6 months before starting grad school were bittersweet. I tried to cherish my time with my friends and family, and work hard in school, but I still struggled daily with grief, anxiety, and depression. Many days were spent crying in bed. I did manage to have a good deal of joy during this period too though, and focused on trying to be more compassionate to myself.

And now that brings us to my current situation. I started my grad program two months ago and it has been so insanely challenging emotionally. Some days it feels harder than opiate withdrawal or the loss of my sister. My anxiety and depression have been so intense that I have no appetite and my stomach is constantly sick. I have to force myself to eat because I know I need to, and I suffer from insomnia most nights and migraines many days. 

I’ve been going to classes and getting my work done, but I often suffer brain fog and can’t think; I cry daily. I feel so alone being 1000+ miles from my boyfriend, friends, and parents. And my mental illnesses are making me doubt that I’m even cut out for academia, even though it’s been my lifelong dream. I have been doing counseling, reaching out to people, making friends here, and trying to take care of myself, but it is so so hard.   

I also just found out today that my 92 year old grandpa is being put in hospice and probably won’t make it to Christmas. He’s very old so it isn’t surprising, but it brings back a lot of pain from my other losses. I’m flying home today to say goodbye to him. 

In order to try to restore some faith in myself, I felt I needed to reflect on what I’ve been through and survived. It is very frustrating that this anxiety and depression never seem to go away. I hate that I know that I will never be neuro-typical. But I do know one thing: as hard as this battle is, time and time again I’ve faced it, and I refuse to give up my faith in me. I will not let these demons stop me from doing all the things I want in life. It doesn’t get easier, but I will keep getting stronger. "

I have a bachelors in Communication and I currently work in account management, but I don't like the high turnover rate in the field, along with not being a specialist in anything (I am a ""generalist.""). At the time when I got my degree I wasn't wise enough to really think about my future as I am now after working a few years out of school. I had an internship in digital marketing which introduced me to tech, and right now I work in healthcare tech and from the combination of the two jobs/industry I'm having a change of heart and I think a fresh start would be best for me. 

I am starting out pretty fresh and I would like advice in choosing a major. I am certain I want to go to WGU because it is affordable, online, and I don't have to take a ""break"" in my career and cut my paycheck/hours to go back to school and physically commute to classes(I live in a high-commute region). 

&amp;#x200B;

Programs I am looking into:

Health Information Management: This degree attracts me because I worked in healthcare for 4+ years on the clinical and business side, so I have a advantage of knowing the industry already. Plus, i've taken many of the classes required for the degree too. It also combines tech and healthcare, which is secure in terms of finding a job. It would most certainly be the ""easiest.""

&amp;#x200B;

Software Development: I like this option because I know HTML and CSS already, and this really allows me to be creative and a problem solver. The job opportunities and projects are lucrative right now in it. I am worried though on its competition, but it is definitely an option that I can strengthen some of my current technical skills and experiences. 

&amp;#x200B;

Computer Science: From what I am seeing, it is the ""gold standard"" of any IT/Software Development job. It provides a broad and comprehensive education for anyone looking to go into computer technology and allows you to explore some options in tech. I am concerned though that it could possibly be too broad because it can mean you want to do anything from AI, Cybersecurity, to Software Engineering. I have always been good at math so thats not the biggest issue, I just haven't taken Calculus in at least 5 years. Hah. This would take longer for me to complete because I have not taken as many of the classes required for the program.

Advice would be greatly appreciated. "
9jtca5,167,2018-09-28,My super awesome Big Brother finale experience. Very long read.,ClevelandSteamer81,BigBrother,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/comments/9jtca5/my_super_awesome_big_brother_finale_experience/," I am still on cloud 9 after the experience last night. My journey to the finale of Big Brother 20 began on August 4th 2013 when I signed up to be notified to become an audience member. 

I received an email on 8/18/2014 to sign up for the voucher, but by the time I saw the email all the tickets were gone. I was super bummed. To make sure that didn’t happen again I set up a notification anytime I received an email from On Camera Audiences (OCA). Over the last 4+ years I received many notifications to attend shows like Let’s Make a Deal, the Wall, AGT, but never Big Brother. I would go on every now and then and try to sign up but it kept saying I am on the waitlist. 

Friday September 21st at 4:21pm I received the email again providing a link to Big Brother tickets and I knew the only live show left was the FINALE! I was at work so I didn’t see the email notification right away, but I glanced down saw Big Brother and immediately whipped out my phone and clicked the link. There were still tickets available and at 4:26 I secured tickets! 

I immediately logged on to r/BigBrother to get advice. I was torn because I was in the busiest season at work and I didn’t want to get my hopes up, drive to LA and be denied tickets. I decided this isn’t just an eviction episode. This is the damn Big Brother 20 Finale. One of the best seasons I have ever seen and possibly the last time I see Julie Chen! 

After reading every post ever about attending a live event I created a game plan to make sure I made it on time. I didn’t want to leave anything to chance so I headed to Studio City to scope out the situation and decide the best move. 

1130: I arrive in Studio City (tickets said 1545, in hindsight 1430 would have been sufficient), I knew I was early but I thought I might be able to get some insider info from the security guard at the garage. Alas that was a no go. They said come back at 3:45pm sharp and not a minute earlier. Well I had lots of time to kill so I had a nice lunch and I continued reading any tips I could find to get in. The main point made was be part of the lineup of cars so you are among the first in the garage.

1300: I park down the road from the studio and relax a bit and take a quick nap. 

1430: I see many people pulling into the garage. I start to freak out. Put the car in drive and floor it to see what the commotion is. I pull up to the two hour parking meter and park and go to see if they are allowing Big Brother in but they tell us me it’s another show. I am parked in the third meter and there are two cars ahead of me who I could tell was also there for Big Brother. About 20 more cars try to enter and then immediately exit and take spots on the street. I start to get anxious because these people all want to attend Big Brother. Note: From many posts on this subreddit I know only a handful of people will be let in if any at all!

1538: I see the guard start waving people in. I quickly rush to get in the garage and the guard lets someone who arrived two minutes prior in before me. I am angry but still on a mission. I get through the garage and he tells us park on the 5th floor and goto the basement. We all go whipping through the garage up to the fifth floor and I park quickly and get out and make a mad dash for the steps. I run down the steps and get to the ground level and end up being among the first in line. As the many other people show up after me you can see disappointment that they were not the fastest. We all get numbers on our tickets and I have a number between 1-5. I am ecstatic and I feel like my chance to get in to see the finale is almost a lock. 

1630ish. They didn’t keep us waiting too long which was nice. The OCA rep was super nice, but he said there are 83 seats for the season finale; however, all 83 seats are already reserved for VIP. My heart sank. My fears were coming true and I started questioning my decision that led me to this line and not to work that day. 

The rep than continues and says while all the seats are taken, 6 VIPs will be leaving midway through the show and they will need 6 individuals to fill those seats and those 6 people would be sitting in the back in the studio until called on! It was happening, I knew I was going to be part of the studio audience! As we were standing in line an absolutely gorgeous and tall blonde dressed to the nines was signing in as a VIP with her husband I assumed. She looked familiar and then I looked at the guy for the first time and it was freaking Dr. Will himself and of course that was his wife with him! 

Ok Ok are you still with me? So after about another 30 minutes they usher us through security and out the door to stand outside the studio. It was warm, but the sun was on the other side of the building which made it pleasant. Everyone of the 21 line waiters that were not VIP picked up the release form and took their picture with it after signing It. Oh shit is this against the release form?!? I don’t remember the form. I just signed it without seeing if I sold Julie my kidney. Which I probably would. Ok so the line waiters release form started at 84 and as I said before I snagged one of the lowest numbers. 

So we are just sitting on the wall and I look over and I am sitting a few seats down from Josh and Mr.  Pectacular himself! I of course yelled hello and got a thumbs up which was pretty damn epic. In my rush to sign up for tickets and plan this whole damn day I didn’t even check my DVR schedule to see when the live show would even air and since no phones aren’t allowed I have no clue. 

1730: they round us all up and tell us to get in line from 1-105 or so. They tell the first 93 (they had an extra three seats open up) you will be in the audience. The other 15 or so got to attend a watch party with free food, wine, and beer. Not a horrible constellation price actually. 

We arrive at the Big Brother studio! Oh my god I see the fence to the backyard and I can’t believe I am that close to attending a finale! As I walk into the studio I can’t believe how small and intimate it is. There are like 5 total rows. I am freaking out and I have am seated on the end only a couple rows back from Dr. Will and his wife! Then I look over and see Omarosa has arrived and is seated a few seats down from me. At this point I realize that I am already in the crowd and I probably won’t be replacing anyone because I have my seat already. This experience is so surreal that I feel like I could pass out. They have the hype man come out and explain the rules and gets us to cheer the loudest and craziest to get ready. Then an older gentleman wearing a Dodgers jersey gets on the stage and we all go wild and cheer. He says you guys are all cheering for me but I bet most of you don’t even know who the hell I am. I was among those who didn’t know who he was. He then told us about the emergency exits and said oh one more thing. “Will, please go to the diary room.”  It was Big Brother himself, Don Wollman!! He then told us if we haven’t seen the clip online  to watch JC calling Big Brother Bob. He said it’s the first time he’s been named before and really got a kick out of it. 

Next up the hype man tells us Julie is about to come out and he wants us to give her a silent ovation, because they had to be super quiet the whole surprise eviction show so the houseguests didn’t hear the crowd. He said once he gives the cue to go crazy wild for Julie. We did as told and then erupted in cheers. Ok, Julie is a tall goddess in person, I was so in awe of how gorgeous and ravishing she looked! 
From 1800-1930 was a complete blur of the events. 

1800: They have us do a rehearsal for an upcoming segment where Julie says the finale is in 22 minutes and we have a packed house. We all erupted into applause and screaming. After a couple minutes we do the real run and I have just been part of a live TV promo. It was so cool.  After the promo they ask the crowd who they want to win and JC gets a light applause, Kaycee gets a slow roar, and Tyler the audience goes crazy for. It was funny because Kaycees dad was doing a thumbs down gesture all in good humor. 

For the next 22 minutes the hype man needs to keep us entertained so he has a dance off.  The dance off is between Tyler’s Mom and JC’s friend Regina. It went exactly how anyone would imagine. Tyler’s mom attempted the sprinkler and other fun wedding dances and Regina started twerking and getting wild. Neither was crowned the winner,  but they got free shirts. Tyler’s mom was a champ and was having such a great time with everything. 

The next fun game he has is Big Brother Bachelor where he brought a girl up and three eligible bachelors. I say eligible lightly because two of them were a couple and the other may or may not have been Kaycees brother.  He blindfolds the girl and asks each one of them cheesy questions and they answer with cheesy questions. Boring! Then he asks the crowd if anyone has a question for the eligible bachelors and Regina says I do. “Bachelors, do you prefer the bottom bunk or the top bunk”? The crowd gasped and I don’t think the hype man even understood the undertones of the questions. Awkward audible chuckles were heard. 
Bachelor 1: I prefer the top bunk, because I can just hold on if I’m about to fall off. 
Bachelor 2:  ugh I forgot his answer
Bachelor 3:  I don’t have a preference sometimes I like the top and sometimes I like the bottom. 

You could half the crowd understood and the other half was baffled as to why some of us were dying. Such a funny moment and question from Regina. Oh she chose Bachelor 3, who’s prize was his seat sitting in between Josh and Omarosa was stolen by a VIP and him and Bachelor 2 had to relocate to the back of the studio. 

Ok moving on. 

Once the show officially started we got to all sit and watch the intro on the big screen to the left of the stage. I was actually watching Big Brother while sitting in the audience of Big Brother right outside the the doors to the house. Did I mention it was completely surreal yet? 

I made sure not to read anything, goto Twitter, or reddit so I wasn’t spoiled. I had zero idea how any of the HOH competitions went. 

Part 1 HOH. Since that was taped earlier I assume most know what the outcome was. However, I was one row behind Kaycees mom and dad I am not sure her mom knew who the winner was, because she was going crazy, covering her eyes and cheering like crazy. Watching her was the highlight of my night. You all know what happened at the HOH and the crowd is laughing hysterically at JCs comments and facial expressions. JC falls and it’s Tyler and Kaycee left. Kaycees mom and dad are pleading for Tyler to fall with their daughter Kaycee, but alas Tyler wins and his mom and step dad go crazy with applause. 

Before the commercial break you see Omarosa, what you don’t see is Bachelor 2 and 3 as I said earlier they were replaced. 

Commercial Break the hype guy has a contest of who is the biggest Big Brother fan. The first persons response was not memorable. Kaycees dad says he has been a fan since the beginning and him and Kaycee are super fans who watch every season together, another woman explains she pays her administrative assistant to watch live feeds to update her when she can’t watch, third girl works for CBS and says she’s such a fan she has auditioned and been denied to BB Canada three times, and she almost got fired from her intern early on because she was caught watching live feeds instead of working. The fourth one said she got the call for the tickets and immediately put her dad on the plane to fly across the country to attend. We all voted with applause and the winner was the executive lady. I personally think the CBS employee or Kaycees dad should have won. Kaycees dad kept asking for a shirt and the hype guy kept telling him you might get 500k. He never got a shirt. 

Back after break time for HOH number 2. Ten minutes into the show watch back and you will see a girl in red sitting directly behind Dr. Will. Soon after that she and her friend are booted for Marissa and Ross. 

HOH 2 everyone is watching intently and I am watching the pain on Kaycees mom face when she fails over and over again on the third part of this comp. I thought for sure JC was about to win Part Two of this competition. The crowd once again laughed really hard at JC falling all over the place and then felt bad when he was struggling. When the competition was over and the times were revealed Kaycees mom let out a quiet yesss as her daughter was moving on to Part 3. 
More commercials more little games, pretty lame. 

We all watch the Dr. Will segment with Dr. freaking Will himself sitting a few feet away. This segment is pretty funny and during it I was discussing with other audience members the comments from the jury members. We actually thought Bayleigh was going to respect Tyler’s game based on her answers. When Angela came out it was so awkward how salty and unimpressed the jury was. Myself and other members of the audience were a little annoyed they didn’t go into more detail of Level 6 since nobody had a clue! How is that even possible?!? I think Tyler lost Sams vote right then and there when she found out Tyler wasn’t with her for real. I think Angela might have hurt Tyler’s chance by bragging about him. The best part of the segment is when Bayleigh says you have to be evil and Dr. Will looked at the camera with the smirk. After the segment hype guy told Dr. Will to give us the smirk and it was identical and freaking great! 

Part 3 of the HOH 

This was the most nerve racking HOH ever. Watching Kaycees mom was agonizing. She could barely watch. The audience was silent between the questions and with each correct answer the audible gasps got louder when they continued to tie. We were all shocked that they got the same ones wrong after getting all the same ones right. When it came to the chalkboard Kaycees mom and dad were almost white they were so nervous. When they asked the question I said 3,400 which was the same as Kaycee. No big deal... I knew when they revealed Tyler’s number he was way too low, but I didn’t remember if it was closest or closest without going over. When Julie revealed Kaycee was the winner her mom and dad yelled out and her mom screamed the longest loudest cheer. You can actually her at the :42 minute mark of episode. She was pumping both arms in the air and then started crying. Man I loved that lady so much! Her family is so genuine. And everyone was congratulating her family on her victory. 

During the commercial break the crowd is debating who she should take and myself and my others said it’s a mistake to take Tyler and she will become the next Cody if she does. 

After the commercial break at :46 minutes you can hear Julie say Kaycee became the final HOH of the summer and you hear Kaycees dad yell yeah. It’s faint on the tv, but it was loud in the studio. JC looked so distraught when he knew he was going home without a fighting chance. The points he made were very valid and I still think she wins hands down with JC. His speech doesn’t work and JC is evicted. Seeing him run through the doors and peaking into the BB house was so cool, actually seeing a player come running out of the house was a dream come true. He was so little in person, but such a ball of energy. He sat and talked to Julie for a bit and then was whisked away to the back of the studio. 

During the commercial break it was a mad house, producers running to grab chairs and set them up. In the commotion I didn’t even look over to my right and see all of the jury lined up. Rockstar lost so much weight this summer, Sam got a new haircut, and Bayleigh looked stunning, but Haleigh stole the show and her dress with those sparkling eyes of hers. A total smoke show and the best looking in person. Faysal is way out of his league on this one. They get on stage and Scotty is dancing
In his seat to the commercial break music playing in the background. He’s so fidgety.  

Coming back from the break they are clapping and waving to the crowd and Scottie is cheering like a crazy person like he was part of the audience. We have heard everyone’s opinion on the responses so I won’t reprise mine again. We all know Tyler’s speech possibly lost him the win and myself and many in the audiences cringed when he kept bragging about his accomplishments. I still never in a million years thought he would lose even with the bragging. Her answers didn’t really change my mind either, the one thing she said that stood out was saying her moves were loyal and she never made a promise she couldn’t keep. Oh damn I just gave my opinion again. 

Coming back from commercial break. Remember girl in red from above sitting behind Dr. Will? At 1:07 she has magically turned into Ross and her friend Marissa. They got evicted from their seats and sent to the back. 

From my seat I could almost see what the names on the keys said, but the jurors were really good with blocking the view from both the camera and the live audience so we had no idea who the winner was! 

During the commercial break they bring out the other houseguests and I can’t believe how much weight Steve lost. He looked awesome, but Rachel is a damn goddess, but no Haleigh. 

Coming out of the next commercial break 1:17 there is red shirt girl again, oh no that’s Ross and Marissa the seat stealers. I joke I joke, I love those two. Anyone know who the old gentleman next to Marissa is? He had a phone and was texting, so I am guessing a high up studio executive. 

This is when the whole night got crazy. We didn’t get to even hear from anyone but Christoper and then it happened, the most talked about part of the night. Swaggy walks over and I know it’s about to be a proposal and the crowd is shocked but going crazy for it. 

CBS did not expect the proposal to take so long and then definitely did not expect the after celebration to last so long. As there was only 10 minutes left Julie had to go over to the keys and get ready to pull them. I didn’t like Haleigh telling Julie “we already have a winner” and the producers didn’t like everyone standing around gawking at the ring and congratulating them while Julie was at the key box. He started waving his arms and quietly yelling for them take their damn seats. They key pulling went so fast we didn’t have time to process it, but when it was 3 to 1 and Haylee cast her vote for Tyler I figured it was a runaway and Kaycee’s mom looked on so sad.  Then the votes shifted and it came down to the last key and that moment seemed to take an eternity for the final key to be pulled. Then the final Key is pulled and it’s Kaycee. She’s the winner of Big Brother 20 and the crowd erupts. Her mom can be heard again screaming a high pitch loud scream filled with pure joy. I felt like Tyler should have let Kaycee walk out by herself, but besides that it was such a great moment. The confetti bomb goes off and everyone is on stage partying. Such a fun sight to see. Brett and Winston instantly reunited was so hilarious. During the commercial break more congratulating and we are all reeling from what transpired on stage. Julie actually looked a little worn out from that last segment. 

Coming back from the break I predict a Brett AFP player, but alas it’s Tyler who wins. Still a great choice. After the show ended it took way too much time to allow Kaycees mom and dad to get in stage to congratulate their daughter,  but seeing her embrace her parents was so great and I was very happy for Kaycee and her win and she should be celebrated. Oh and I hated Swaggy front and center when the jury members were off to the side during the sign off. 

After the show no invites to any backyard parties, but I was so tired from screaming for two hours that was one with me. Leaving I shook hand with Ross and Omarosa and said goodbye to Josh and Mr. Pectacular. The ushered us back to the garage and as I was walking up the steps I saw Mr. Pectacular one more time and told him to enjoy the party. This experience was once in a lifetime and I hope you enjoyed my retelling of it. 

Someone TL:DR this. Haha.

9jtmt9,1,2018-09-28,College Junior Looking For Advice!,CasuallyGreen,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9jtmt9/college_junior_looking_for_advice/,"Hey r/Accounting, 

I need some advice. I am finishing up my undergrad and there are a lot of factors that are contributing to my decisions with staying in accounting. I am actually *interested* in what I study and I have made the decision to make a career out of it. However, no one in my family has gone this route before, and I really do not know how to go about attacking the educational side of this field.

I go to a relatively small school that isn't well known, and while accredited, is not an AACSB school. I bust my ass and make pretty good grades (greater than a 3.9/4.0), am involved in leadership in some of the school's more premier student organizations, and have locked down a spring internship for next year at a mid-sized firm. The internship is in tax. I feel as if I have done what other accounting students at more established schools go to. My college does not emphasize internships as much, and most of the knowledge of the career path(s) are left to the professors to explain (which, thankfully, the professors at this school have been nothing short of amazing).

Here is my issue, I have begun looking at several schools to attain the 150hr mark and have hit a road bump. Do I get a Macc? Mtax? MS in Accounting? What schools would even consider me at my non-AACSB status? Many of these questions are coupled with studying for a GMAT. **I have reached out to the professional services at my school and the responses I get are the equivalent to crickets. The teachers and advisors have an attitude of dismissal if any interest is shown in different schools.** In short, my goal is to go to a more well known university and crowd source a **timeline** of events that I would need to accomplish in order to attain my goal.

This is just a brief overview of where I am at. This semester and the next will finish off my junior year. I want to plan accordingly. "
9jtrmp,0,2018-09-29,Internship Questions,psmica,Etsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/9jtrmp/internship_questions/,"Hi everyone! I just got an in-person interview for a software engineering internship at Etsy. 

How do I prepare? Will they fly me out? I have so many questions!!"
9jtxxz,0,2018-09-29,Failure from placement or myself?,swintern,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/9jtxxz/failure_from_placement_or_myself/,"Hello, all. Sorry but this is a long post. *Please* bear with me. 

This is my second semester doing an online MSW Program. I will not mention any names nor the school I'm from.

Placement begins the second year. I was responsible for going out of my way and choosing the agency, schedule interviews and then report back to the university in order to coordinate my placement. It is already difficult being an online program so communicating back with staff and finding agencies was a nightmare. 

So I get placed at this agency, yay! At.....around the end of august. So.. as standard procedure there are HR things that need to be completed such as background checks, drug tests, and training in order to start interning and being around clients. I wont argue that, I understood the requirements in order to start. The training thankfully was all done online and worked well with my part-time school status. I mentioned this to my supervisor when we met for the first time and mentioned I was also taking another course. 

Fast forward to the training. This training was a lot of material. I get it, it is an agency devoted to helping clients with an assortment of mental health issues and I need to be competent. I was on board to do the training and even enjoyed doing some of them.  The more I would continue with the training, the more I noticed my start date would have to be pushed back. I reached out to the HR coordinator and they mentioned it was fine I was taking a little longer; that some people complete it in a week but to continue taking my time on it.  My supervisor was communicated on what HR said. So.. Start date was pushed back so I continued.. I would communicate with my supervisor and mentioned what was going on.. that the training was lengthy and I was trying to get it all done even with my part-time school status and life. They agreed it was a lot to ask for the interns and I felt that the empathy regarding this was acknowledged. 

Fast forward again to when I reached 40 hours (this was already 2 weeks in doing the training) I started doing the math for all the modules (because it says total completion time) because I wanted to know how long this would be. It all amounted to 70-80 hours!! It is unheard of for someone to complete all of this in a span of a week UNLESS YOU FAST FORWARD AND SKIP THROUGH EVERYTHING. I didn't skip through everything. I wanted to give a fuck and learn and digest this material because I cared. Well, I guess I should have done that and taken the easy way out because I was eventually let go from my placement due to not having completed my training and start date was pushed back twice. That I had a lot going in my life and I should sort that out and that it wasn't ethical to hire me given my health problems and inability to prioritize the internship training. 

This was my supervisors first time supervising, mind you. I thought they were nice. I learned a lot about therapeutic/professional boundaries towards the beginning of the training and decided to start using these skills building trust with her. I communicated that I was experiencing physical problems as part of my PCOS early on before I started the training and she thanked me for being honest and open. I mentioned that I would *possibly* be undergoing surgery sometime in the semester. Because my hours were 16/wk, two days a week, this would work out in getting this POSSIBLY done on my off days. I communicated that I was a part-time student and the training was starting to affect my own personal life. My stress levels were starting to go off the roof, as expected. 

Fast forward again to when I finally completed the training and managed to finish in mid September. I thought it would never end. Mind you, I have a life and also have other courses to attend to. I met with my supervisor and I'm given a document listing our interactions, push back dates, etc. The director was called in as well. I was already nervous but I went with it. I had a feeling I was going to be let go.  I'm not sure if I screwed myself over during this meeting by saying something or if my supervisor was bad at being assertive with me. She never really said it wasn't going to work out, or that I was fired. It was only through our conversation, which was done in a reflective listening style that I understood she required more of me and that it wasn't going to work out. I communicated I have health issues I'm dealing with as well as a life to attend to and that this training was starting to take longer than expected. I mentioned it was affecting my school work as well. They said no one had ever taken that long to complete it and I still think its because people rushed through it and did not gaf. 

The agenda list she provided  had quotes of things I said in confidentiality via e-mail and it was not until after I left their that it dawned on me how shitty this was. The supervisor claimed I kept dodging  calls and would quickly respond via e-mail to  after I would miss calls.  a) I don't always have my phone on me b) I didn't just want to call back, I wanted to make sure first it was okay to call so I sent an e-mail. It was mentioned how I was two-faced and how when we met in person I would say one thing and when we would talk via e-mail I was another person. Completely dismantled my integrity as a whole. Assuming, and assuming. I was already anxious and stressed so I was not able to respond and think correctly. What I kept understanding was that I did not make this training a priority. I should have made it my life despite me telling them I am a part-time student and also have a life. The supervisor followed to say how they would have started immediately. That they would have made this their #1 priority, basically. I asked if I was supposed to do this over the weekend and they would ignore the question. 

I was left without a placement until further notice now and I don't know what to think. I get to keep my hours, but fuck. I was never told the consequences of not completing this training in time. Nothing was communicated to me, no notice, nothing. My school hasn't done much about this but that is another story.  I have never felt so many emotions all at once in a single day. I was mostly shocked, though. I guess I should start getting used to being fucked over, right?

ANY advice would help. What could I have done differently? Should I have prioritized this even though I have my own life to attend to? How have your initial weeks at placements been? How have you dealt with a first time supervisor?

Thank you for reading\~ 

**TLDR; Was let go from internship due to not completing training on a short amount of time, lack of communication from supervisor &amp; HR** "
9ju2ag,5,2018-09-29,New NF Rant,Maynovaz,Nanny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/9ju2ag/new_nf_rant/,"I just started with a new family a week ago and I don't know if I'm going crazy or what. I had a phone interview with MB, drove 25 miles to spend a few hours there for a interview, and did two 8 hour paid trial shifts to see if it worked out. She told me my duties were to come at 6am to make breakfast, wake the kids up (3), remind them to brush their teeth, and make their lunches. I'm suppose to start driving them next week if she approves of my driving, and then I'm suppose to clean the breakfast mess, handwash their pots &amp; tupperware that can't go into the sink, pick up dirty dishes around the house &amp; island, load the dishwasher, do cleaning around the house, and make dinner. Initially I thought that she meant I would prep ingredients for her to cook real quick but she meant cook it and load it in tupperware for her family. I love cooking so that's great, but as FT with 8 hours 6-2 on MF, there isn't a lot of time to do cooking &amp; cleaning. 

The family is crazy and quirky healthy. I make special meals that incorporate veggies into sauces, soups, meat, etc to get them to eat more veggies. And this takes time and I have to look into their fridge in the morning to decide what to make. I asked for specifics and she said be creative but what if I make something your family doesn't like? I love combining different cultural flavors and etc but they just want healthy and tasty. They say that they are open to anything, but I'm not making them fish egg pasta anytime soon. It usually takes me about 2 hours to prep all the ingredients, cook with her one pan &amp; pot, clean up the kitchen while it cooks, but asian styles usually have to be babysat or they will burn. I'm basically her private chef and they eat organic everything. 

In the morning, the three kids leave at 7 and I'm suppose to drive them and be back by 8. Then I'd feed &amp; make the 4th kids lunch, who leaves at 9. As of right now, I use the time between 7:15 and 9 to make his breakfast &amp; lunch, but also clean the kitchen mess, and start the hand washing and dishwasher. Once I start driving them, I lose almost 2 hours of that time. 

I usually cook from 10 to 12 after doing all the dishes, running a laundry load, making MB and DB's beds, and while I cook I try to clean up the meal prep things and hand wash more.  I'm a pretty good cook but I've never gone to culinary school or worked as a chef but my family are all chefs so I've learned. I read &amp; do a lot of cooking at home so I know how to make those healthy meals like oatmeal pancakes, cauliflower alfredo, and veggie soups that don't just taste like carrots and celery. So I really enjoy the cooking aspect but they want me to do a lot of cleaning. Sometimes I don't get a chance to make the kid's beds or pick up their toys because there are always toys thrown around even though I cleaned it up yesterday. I absolutely loathe cleaning. I try to vacuum daily and always the kitchen daily and mop when needed. I do all their countertops, mirrors, sinks, toilets, and I must hand wash two or three loads of dish drying rack loads a day. 

They let me eat anything in their house and said it from day one, but they never ask me about lunch or anything. I usually eat any leftovers from their lunches or breakfasts or some of dinner prep to try flavors but I barely have time to sit down and eat. My knees are hurting from standing to meal prep, cook, dsih washing, and running around to tidy their messy house. I dread coming in the morning to find last night's dishes everywhere or their groceries just scattered because they just bought them. 

I didn't wipe some countertops one day because I ran out of time and she messaged me to remind me it has to be done daily. I had already ran over and stayed until 3 because I washed everyone's sheets and it's hell getting them onto bunk beds where you can't even sit up in. 

I take care of the kids for about an hour and half, over the span of 6-9, but the one who goes to school late had a lot of time to prep. So I'm only seeing kids for 3 out of 8 hours, and I have 5 hours to clean and cook. Once I start driving them, I'll have 4ish hours to cook &amp; clean. 

I also scoop the cat's litter, change her bowl of water, and top off food. They asked me to trim her claws because I'm a cat person but I pushed it off and finally after them mentioning it several times, I said I would show but refuse to do it. 

Oh and I'm also her PA. I check her fridge for groceries and keep a shared list to notify her of low ingredients, and she always asks me to research or send her links on things. 

Today she mentioned that I should maybe do meal prep for 2-3 days and I jokingly said if you're willing to eat the same meal for three days. She immediately said two and maybe I could make several different things to save time. She doesn't cook but that isn't how it works. I said we can try that because she wants me to clean more. 

All in all, I'm a nanny, private chef, housekeeper, and personal assistant. It's a bit ridiculous to expect me to do all those things and keep her house spotless. 

She won't pay OT and I've already done 45 hours this week. I'm paid 15/hr and I honestly love the kids and cooking, but I hate mornings and I wake up every day at 5. It's a 30 min drive each way. I'd love to be her nanny and private chef but they are such a messy family. The two youngest&amp; the parents are the worst. The older kids 14 and 12 are cleaner actually but so so. 

The other day her guest toilet was clogged and she sleeps in so I held it for 2.5 hours to make sure all the kids were ready and hopped down to the pool bathroom downstairs. She sleeps in and I didn't want to use it while she slept. I asked for maintenance's number when she woke up and she asked me to plumb it. I ain't no plumber and said no politely and got maintenance to fix it they pay 3k to rent, they can plumb. Also the complex has a staff of cleaning ladies on hand and honestly they need more help. I love certain parts of the job &amp; hate some of it but they are nice and flexible people. It's just they don't understand nannies are not those interns you ask to do everything. 

I don't want to quit and spend time finding another job although I had interviews for 20/hr plus for nanny jobs but they wanted more followup interviews and this NF wanted someone right away. So I took it. I have some expenses I need to take care of so I want to stick with this as long as I can but I just finished my first full week and I'm exhausted. I was almost as tired being a server &amp; bartender but at least the tips were good even though customers could be shitty. I want to see once driving starts this Monday, if we could renegotiate duties because she has offered to get a cleaning lady twice a month to deep clean, but there is a lot of daily cleaning. If I can persuade her to do meal prep 2 or 3 days out of the week because on Fridays she apparently expected me to make extra food for the weekend which she told me suddenly. So I spent almost 4-5 hours cooking and prepping. They asked I knew how to make sushi during my interview and I said yea, so she bought ingredients yesterday. I love making it and the kids really appreciate it but this stuff takes time lady. So she asked me last min to stay a few extra hours to clean but I said I have a prior engagement and she's like oh what. None of your business. 

I enjoy the peace &amp; quiet when the kids are gone and the parents go to work at about 10/11. But I absolutely hate sorting their dirty laundry to wash for colors and they are all washed together so it's hard to tell whose clothes are whose. I'm just going to buy gloves go sort their laundry because honestly I don't want to touch your junk and undies, and if they notice, well too bad. I'm going to hold out for as long as I can before they want to fire me because it doesn't matter if my food is tastier and healthier than most restaurants if I can't do enough cleaning to satisfy them. They give me a messy kitchen in the morning and I leave them with a spotless one. 

I went over 40 hours and she paid me on time and said she'd like to keep it to 40 yet she asked me to stay a few extra hours today. So what does she want. I barely take lunch and eat while something is cooking on the stovetop. "

So I applied to a B4 firm in my area for an advertised internship position in Jan. After going through a couple rounds of interviews they just emailed me today offering me a full time position starting in the fall (upon my graduation) and not the internship in Jan. While I am very happy I received a full time offer it's confusing to me why they wouldn't have offered me the internship position as well. I still need to complete another internship for my degree; I will probably end up going back to my old firm from my last internship but I feel bad not telling them and then leaving. Do you think I should mention that I'm still in need of a internship for Jan when I accept the b4 offer? Or just keep quite and do it with my old firm."
9jv6q2,1,2018-09-29,i'm just so tired [NAW],justlikeh0ney,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9jv6q2/im_just_so_tired_naw/,"(i'm so sorry this is super long)

i don't know where to start.  i feel like i must have done something really messed up somewhere down the line and have the universe throw one thing after another after another just continue to bring me down and i just gotta let it out somewhere.

i just recently started a new contract therapy job, stepped down to a per-diem position at the hospital i've been at for over a year now and my financial situation got really shitty.  i have 2 bosses due to working in 2 different areas of the hospital and the one i've been under exclusive up until 2 months ago is driving me crazy, guilt tripping me when i cannot work, and making up random policies.  other boss is fine and i'm loving my other job even though the pay is shit because it will get me the relevant experience+licensure hours i need to become a therapist.  

i've been living on my own and i guess ""adulting"" since march, paying for my own apartment since every roommate situation i was trying to arrange flaked out on me or wouldn't work out due to me having a cat who i consider my child and cannot live without.  ever since i mentioned getting this new job, i've had my mom threaten me saying i'm going to be homeless and that i'm stupid for doing this and just all sorts of negative comments.  i've recently just kept things very surface level with her because i cannot fucking take it anymore with her.

i've been out of school for 1 1/2 years, the one friend i had is too busy to do anything anymore and now ignores my texts even.  i never made any other friends in school due to being constantly busy with work (I worked 5:00am-2:00pm 3-5 days/week w/full courseload/internship).  i have been battling depression and anxiety since at least age 15-16 which is when i started losing friends in high school and would never do anything again, due to working (not at 5 am) and taking AP and college courses at the same time.

i've lost all interest in hobbies around that time due to being busy and just due to not caring anymore.  started self-harming at 17 after an emotionally abusive relationship and dealing with my mother constantly making me me feel like an inadequate piece of shit (i graduated top in my class at high school and finished my master's degree at 23 and still feel like i'll never be good enough).  this lead to me developing a bad drinking habit as soon as i moved out into college and could get my hands on alcohol and i guarantee my liver will be the death of me.  then after graduating, i tried cocaine 1x at a party and am just now finally getting over that addiction that cost me i don't even want to know how much money and impacted my health and probably ruined my reputation with the few people i did interact with when they would hang with my boyfriend.

i just don't feel like i can connect with anyone.  i don't have things i can relate to with people.  i've been at my hospital job for over a year and the next youngest person in my department besides the interns who don't work with our subdivision of our department is like 34-35.  i definitely get treated much differently due to age.  this new person covering my position has already gotten along with everyone else so much better than myself and it fucking hurts.  i like my coworkers but i have always felt like i'm an outsider and that they don't want me to be there which is why i'm glad to be per-diem at this point. 

even when i was at my job during college, no one wanted to talk to me or was friendly to me there for a solid 8 months until my now current boyfriend of 4 years approached me and we started dating.  only then did people start accepting me but no one in particular was my ""friend"" i guess you could say.  never hung out with any of them without my boyfriend.  and as mentioned, the whole addiction thing probably fucked my chances of ever being friends with any of them even though i'm finally now in the recovery process.

i did finally took a huge leap of courage and started hanging out with a girl who was dating one of my boyfriend's friends that i helped through a difficult situation.  we started talking+hanging out regularly for about 2 weeks and then she just suddenly moved and has pretty much ghosted.  that really hurt and i don't know if it was me, her boyfriend who's a bit abusive, or what.

my boyfriend has been my main support for the last 4 years and he finally decided to move in with me 2 months ago.  i was so excited, i felt like it was a huge step in commitment in our relationship.  i was excited to cook together, do more things together, and be able to sleep together every night and have him always available to talk to.  in addition, he was helping pay a small portion of rent which was helping.  however, tonight he just told me he cannot deal with being around me so much anymore and feels that living in my apartment is driving him crazy and he cannot save any money so he can go rent some house with his friends.  i cannot stop crying.  i can't even blame it on him because i know it's me.  having this impossible work-life balance right now, unpredictable financial situation due to building a case load of therapy clients and figuring out how to not screw myself during tax season w/a 1099 job, no friends, minimal family support emotionally (i cannot ask for financial support, i just can't), and just other stupid little random things that seem to be coming up.  

i'm just so sick of everything.  i'm trying to cut back on my vices so hopefully my medication may actually do something.  i'm just blessed that one of the psychiatrists i work with was willing to accept me into his practice immediately and get me started back on medication and give me something for anxiety since it's gotten really bad.  in addition, i'm blessed that if i need a med adjustment between 3 month appointments he's told me that whenever he's at the hospital i can always come to him and he will take care of me and not charge me for a visit or anything which is such a help.  i cannot afford to go to therapy myself right now and i've had a hard time finding a therapist that will take my problems seriously and understand that i did go through emotional abuse.  i honestly wish i could just get a small break from reality because i am having such a hard time dealing with everything.  i've been awake since 2:30am, it's just past 5:00am and i have to work tomorrow around 8-9ish. 

i just feel so tired emotionally and mentally.  i don't even feel like i have a right to complain or have problems because i work with patients and clients who have it so so so much worse.  i can handle that and separate myself from that thankfully.  but as i said, i just feel constantly these torturing feelings in my brain and all this shit that i can't handle isn't valid and that i'm being a baby and need to suck it up.

please do not give advice.  i just needed to get this out.  if anyone reads this, thank you for listening.  i guess i should try to sleep now."

Greys for me, went downhill a number of seasons ago but I carried on watching because I grew up with it.

The reason I like this season so far is that it feels like old Greys where they actually focus on the medicine and the patients have solid storylines where as s14 was barely about medicine and just about their poorly written personal lives.

 I think they've finally found a good balance where its medicine and their personal lives. 

I am also glad they are finally properly introducing the interns and i have good hopes for the new characters.

The only thing i will never enjoy is Amelia and Hunt, i personally just cant stand them together or separately so i just go on my phone when  their scenes come up. Also, i would enjoy Teddy so much more if she wasnt always associated to Hunt."
9jvyyl,1036,2018-09-29,Ich war gerade bei einer AfD Kandidatenvorstellung für meinen Kreis und muss mal etwas loswerden,Abdi04,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/9jvyyl/ich_war_gerade_bei_einer_afd/,"Also erstmal vorab. Ich bin kein Anhänger der AfD oder unterstütze die Ideale die in ihrem Parteiprogramm vertreten werden nicht. Ich bin hingegangen um die Argumente zu hören und zu diskutieren. 

Es begann erstmal mit dem Monolog des Ersten Direktkandidaten unseres Kreises. Dann begann die erste Fragerunde. Der erste Fragte: ""Wieso trennt sich die AfD nicht von den Rechtsradikalen?"". Er kam natürlich mit, dass man die Rechtsradikalen nicht mit den Bürgern gleichsetzen darf und das man natürlich die Hooligans und sonstige Leute nicht unterstützt. Dann bemerkte er, dass die Hooligans in Chemnitz natürlich sich dazu mischten und nichts mit den Trauernden zu tun hatten. 

Dann fragte ich Ich ihn: ""In ihrem bayrischen Parteiprogramm steht, dass sie zukünftigen Lehrern keimen Beamtenstatus geben möchten. Wieso?""  Er sagte er persönlich sei dagegen und wisse nicht was für Argumente dafür sprechen. Verständlich aber dazu komme ich noch zurück. 

Ein Deutsch-Türke fragte wieso sie das Kopftuch in öffentlichen Dienst verbieten wollen (z.B. Lehrer). Die Antwort war, dass das Kopftuch als Unterdrückung der Frau gilt und der Islam als sehr aggressiv gilt. Dann kam das Argument, dass die Kinder verstört wären und bei gleichzeitigem Anwesen eines Kreuzes im Klassenzimmer sowas nicht möglich sei.   Ich pauschalisiere hier natürlich die Aussagen der Kandidaten, aber man muss dazu sagen. Sie haben die Argumente sehr sachlich, höflich und nicht herablassend gesagt wurden. Es wurde sogar betont, dass sie die Glaubensfreiheit respektieren und nicht ändern wollen (lol). Ob man den Argumenten zustimmt oder gar glaubt ob sie das ernst meinen ist natürlich eine andere Frage, aber sie waren alle sehr höflich und wurden nicht aggressiv oder herablassend. 

Doch dann kam der Saure Apfel der die sachliche Stimmung verdorben hat. Ein Herr in den letzten Reihen schrie förmlich: ""Dann geh doch zurück wo du hergekommen bist!""  Was zum Fick?  Den Herren und seine Familie der die Frage gestellt hat kennen einige aus dem Ort. Und trotzdem werden hier Islamophobe oder gar rassistische Parolen gerufen.  Wie kann man den bei einer relativ normalen Diskussion so etwas sagen? 

Der Kandidat wechselte schnell das Thema ansonsten wäre das sehr hässlich geworden. 

Ich fragte ihn was er davon hält, dass Herr Söder die Kreuze aufgehängt hat. Da drehte sich eine Frau vor mir um und sagte zu mir ins Gesicht: ""Bayern war schon immer Christlich und das bleibt auch so"". Wer hat dich denn gefragt? Was zum Fick?  Hat die Frau etwa das Gefühl gehabt, dass ich ihr  verbiete Sonntags in die Kirche zu gehen oder wieso fühlt sie sich angegriffen? Der Kandidat sagte erneut sachlich, dass das nur eine reiner Wahlkampf move war, aber sie dem zustimmen denn das ist eine bayrische Tradition und so. 

Dann begann er über GEZ zu reden und verglich den ARD als Propaganda Sender. Ich habe natürlich nichts anderes erwartet, aber der Herr von vorhin sagt: ""Jawohl"" 
Und der Kandidat begann ja wie die AfD zu Unrecht als Nazis beschimpft werden und so. Und der Herr sagte wieder So was wie: ""Die sind alle Fake die Nachrichten"". Alle nickten und stimmen den Kerl da zu. Das sind also auch Leute die dem Begriff Lügenpresse zustimmen und verbreiten würden. 

Also dann erzählte der nächste Kandidat über bayrische Werte/Kultur/Traditionen und so. Dann drehte sich die Frau von vorhin um und nickte herablassend zu mir. Alles Klar. 

Dann irgendwann war natürlich der Abend vorbei, ich blieb da um etwas weiter zu diskutieren. Ich sah, dass sie Sachlich und höflich Argumentiert haben und fand die Idee weiter zu diskutieren nicht schlecht. 

Ich fragte die anderen Kandidaten über den Beamtenstatus der zukünftigen Lehrer und sah wie zerstritten die Partei intern ist. Ein weiterer meinte zu mir, dass er die Idee verabscheut. Ein Beamter darf keine Politische Meinung zeigen und weitersagen. Weiterhin zeigt es die Wichtigkeit der Bildung und so weiter. Ein anderer sagte, dass wenn man Lehrer anstellt man dabei Geld spart und es deswegen gar nicht schlecht sei. Aaaaah Ja. 

Manch einer gibt zu, dass die falschen abgeschoben werden. Asylanten die schon eine Ausbildung besitzen werden zu Unrecht abgeschoben und der andere meinte, dass es gar nicht so weit kommen durfte und kein Grund gut genug ist sie nicht abzuschieben. Sie könnten ja ihre Heimat selber aufbauen und so was. 



Fazit: Die Partei ist ja selber nicht gerade einig habe ich das Gefühl. Bei einigen Themen scheiden sich die Wege einzelner Kandidaten und das beunruhigt mich. Wenn beispielsweise zwei Kandidaten von verschiedenen Landkreisem gewählt werden kann man nicht mit Gewissheit sagen, dass er die Ideen des Parteivorstandes unterstützt oder eigene Wege geht. Aber das ist auch verständlich. Bei einigen Themen haben Leute Persönliche Erfahrungen gemacht oder sonstige Gründe. Aber die Streuung und Varianz ist sehr groß meiner Meinung nach in der Partei. Ich möchte betonen, dass ich mit diesem Pfosten nicht die Kandidaten angreifen möchte oder gar anschwärzen. Ehrlich gesagt waren sie mir sogar sympathisch. Auch von ihrer Persönlichkeit her. Eine sachliche und höfliche Diskussion freut mich immer wieder. Ob man ihnen zustimmt oder nicht ist eine andere Frage. 

Und was mir noch aufgefallen ist: Mir war klar, dass die AfD ein Magnet für Rechtsradikale sind. Aber der rechte Bürger versteckt sich unter dem Schirm der Partei um Seine islamophobe und fremdenhass Parolen zu verbreiten. Die AfD lebt förmlich nur von diesen Wutbürgern die vermeintlich vor einer Umvolkung steht oder Sonstige Ängste spürt. Natürlich war mir das bewusst, aber dass wirklich ein Großteil der breiten Masse in eine solche Schiene gerutscht sind macht mir Angst. 

Gewaltiger Rechtsruck in meinem Ort wo es wirklich keinen Grund für einen Rechtsruck geben sollte. Das verstehe ich einfach nicht, denn wenn ich einen Kandidaten für meinen Bezirkswahlkreis Wähle, dann beäuge ich hier nicht nationale Probleme die mich nicht betreffen. Dafür gab es die berechtigte Bundestagswahl in unserer Demokratie. Ich persönlich wählte die SPD in der Bundestagswahl, aber wähle wahrscheinlich hier den Direktkandidaten der Freien Wähler, da er sich für das marode Kreiskrankenhaus und für die Umgehungsstraße in meinem Gebiet breit macht. Oder da spricht mich auch der lokale CSU Abgeordnete an, da er aus meinem Dorf stammt und sich in der Bezirksregierung sich immer für mein Dorf und die umliegenden Dörfer stark gemacht hat. Die Abgeordneten der AfD aus meinem Landkreis haben spärlich Probleme des Wahlkreises genannt, sondern die Typisch nationalen Themen geschnitten. Die aus dem nebenliegenden Wahlkreis da sah es Ganz anders aus. Die hatten sich für einiges lokales eingesetzt wie die Schließung einer Entbindungsstation oder oder die Baustelle einer Brücke einer Bundesstraße, aber da kannte ich mich nicht gut genug aus. Aber wenn islamophobe Parolen genügen um Wähler zu gewinnen statt lokale Probleme zu erwähnen wie die fehlende Infrastruktur (zumindest in meinem Landkreis), dann finde ich es schade. 

Das ist jetzt ein sehr langer Monolog meinerseits gewesen, aber das musste ich loswerden."
9jw4e2,0,2018-09-29,An Interview with Golf Channel's Chantel McCabe,tshold,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/9jw4e2/an_interview_with_golf_channels_chantel_mccabe/,"[This article can be originally found at http:\/\/www.SholdMediaGroup.com](https://i.redd.it/x1dfob9a56p11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Chantel and I have been in touch since her days working with the  Carolina Hurricanes and then we even briefly worked together at the NHL  Network during the 2014 Stanley Cup Final. She has been nothing but  gracious with her time, sharing her story and advice with SMG over the  years, so it’s great to see her broadcasting nationally for the Golf  Channel. As an active viewer of the channel, I continue to be a big fan  of her work. I had the chance to chat with Chantel once again and she  continues to share great advice for our readers here at SMG. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

[**Taylor Shold**](https://twitter.com/tshold)**: Tell us about yourself, who are you and what do you do?**

[**Chantel McCabe**](https://twitter.com/chantelmccabegc)**:**  I’m in my second year at Golf Channel as a reporter and host for Golf  Central, our nightly news program and Morning Drive. I cover the PGA  Tour, LPGA, Web.com Tour, college golf, World Long Drive and anything  that involves a golf club.

I began on-air work by stumbling into the scene when I was majoring  in Sports Management at University of New Hampshire. I covered UNH  sports for the school paper and grinded at internships every semester at  local stations, and NESN. I was logging tape for hours on end, running  the ticker and editing other people’s work. I knew NESN wanted more of  an online presence so I asked if I could go the sports not already  covered, in my own time to try out interviewing and stand ups. They were  UGLY. Wow was I awkward. No training, just interested in the challenge.

I began my career in local news, right out of college in 2012. I got  live reps through morning news. That was critical. Live TV can either be  seamless and smooth or bumpy and awkward. It takes a lot of work and  experience to make it “natural.” That was frustrating for me to digest.

After a few stops, a lot of patience and the right support, I landed at the Golf Channel headquarters in Orlando, Florida.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taylor:** [**Shold Media Group**](http://www.SholdMediaGroup.com) **is all about networking, how important has it been in your career?**

**Chantel:** I got a job with Fox Sports completely by the  blessing of networking. At NESN, when I was running prompter, I made a  point to ask questions to executives, talent, producers, directors, etc.  It took some courage to do that but it paid off. An NHL analyst from  NESN recommended me to Fox Sports Carolinas and was very enthusiastic  about me applying. At 22-years-old, I had what was then my dream job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taylor: When people are applying for on-air jobs, what are some ways they can stand out from the crowd?**

**Chantel:** What makes you stand out? That’s not a  one-size-fits all answer. In any interview it’s important to know your  flaws, and your strengths. Highlight what you know best in terms of  subject matter and give examples of qualities like work ethic and  creativity. Be HONEST. People always appreciate this, I promise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taylor: In your opinion, what makes a great on-air person?**

**Chantel:** They say “be you.” At the start of my career I  wasn’t. I thought I should be this polished, more mainstream  personality like some of the people I look up to, but that stunted my  growth. I now fully embrace my colorful and sometimes silly personality,  and you can tell by how genuinely happy I am on camera.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taylor: What do you think it takes for someone to go from reporting on their local station to a national one like Golf Channel?**

**Chantel:** Young professionals and college students often  contact me and say they have this goal in mind to be on X, Y, Z network  by next year. It’s great to have direction but you’ve got to be  realistic. And please be in this business for the right reasons. There  are reality shows and plenty of other ways to just “be on tv.” You’ve  got to put in the time. I know people don’t like that answer but that’s  how you get trusted, respected, and get better. You don’t want to be  making rookie mistakes on a big stage. The 2018 internet will roast you  really good.

Most importantly, enjoy the stage your at and own what you’re doing.  Your work will shine brighter, your coworkers and the people you’re  covering will appreciate that attitude. Be proud of every stop because  some people will never get as far as where you are right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taylor: I’ve been speaking to a lot of people about agents recently, what is the process in getting one?**

**Chantel:** Agents are a touchy subject. I know people who hate them and I know people who have gotten great opportunities.

The most important thing to remember is that your networking is your  biggest tool, especially in the first few years. My agent connected me  with my job at Golf Channel. I would’ve never known it existed.

I fired my first agent because it wasn’t the right fit and it got  messy. This is your partner to help you find where you spend 80% of your  life…the workplace. It’s hard to find a good blend.

Remember, they have a lot of people they need to serve so you may not  be their top priority, especially if there are people on their roster  with similar abilities to yours. The going rate is 8-10%. Choose wisely.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taylor: What is your best practical advice for someone trying to succeed on-air in this industry?**

**Chantel:** Don’t compare yourself to other people. Give as much as you can to your craft.

9jweb9,0,2018-09-29,Was I (31M) too possessive and controlling? Or did I have a reason to doubt her (24F)? Still not over my ex.,FCPfan77,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jweb9/was_i_31m_too_possessive_and_controlling_or_did_i/,"Before I begin this long story I should make reference to the fact that I had been cheated before in a previous relationship, which I found out by way of a text accidentally sent to me of a print screen of my ex talking about meeting another dude. That obviously made me a little insecure about trusting people.

Anyway, after a few months I met another girl and things went great for abouth 6-7 months, we would have a great time together, I usually slept at her place on the weekend and we got along great. Until one day she got home and said she was going to sleep, which I thought was unusual because she never slept in the afternoon but no big deal, she texted me around dinner time saying she would have dinner and then study, I said okay but after a little while i texted her something and she didn't receive my text, she usually had her wi-fi on when she was in the house, so I got very suspicious and called her, no answer, called her again after a few minutes, no answer, after the third missed call i texted her something like ""don't bother talking to me again, you're a fucking liar"". After about half an hour she texted me asking what was wrong, i called and was very mean to her saying she lied about studying and that she went out, i even called her a whore. She said she just had her phone charging and turned off the vibration and the ringtone, i didn't believe her and i blocked her from social media but didn't delete her number, next day she texted saying i was being unreasonable and i decided maybe i was. So I apologized for the way I talked to her and we stayed together, but after that i think i lost my trust for her, everytime she got home a little later I always questioned her in an accusing tone, everytime she got out with friends i asked her to send me photos to see if she really was with who she said she was, i called her trying to see if would answer just to control her, i knew she hated this but she did it because i had talked about my past experience and my difficulty in trusting people now.

By this time she had stopped letting me sleep with her, we still were intimate but just in my car and never again in her house, we still got along pretty well when we were together but when we were apart during the week things were still difficult, one day i started to figure out that when she told me she would go to college she went at a time when she didn't have classes, i confronted her and she told me that she just went there to be with her friends before class and that she didn't have to tell me her schedule, I agreed but being insecure i obviously thought something was off there, one day i got mad at her because i had thought she had called me by the name of her supposedly gay friend, she didn't even fully say his name just that she seemed to start with the first letter of his name and then kinda caught herself and said my name, i got mad at her and broke up with her, after a few days she texted me saying she missed me, i missed her too so eventually we got back together, after another few weeks she got home later than she said she would when she went out with her friends, i wanted to break up with her but she again convinced me not to but she also said i needed to relax, a few weeks later she accidentally texted me something saying ""you're going to get a job? but we're gonna have an internship you won't have time for a job"", she said it was meant for a female friend of hers, normally i would ask for a print screen but i didn't that day because i was trying to trust her more, but that stuck with me because her female friend she mentioned already had a job but it was just working for an aunt and wasn't a real job, i tried letting it go but obviously deep down i thought she was lying, a few days later i caught up to the fact that she had been online when she had said she would be going to sleep, i confronted her and she said she was just checking the time, you don't have to turn on your wi-fi to check the time so this time she was obviously lying, i got mad at her and asked why was she lying, she said she didn't even think about what she said and that she was still sleepy when she answered and she had 3 exams that day and was mad at me for always controlling what she was doing, we still stayed together but by this time she was very distant, she would refuse to have dinner with me saying that she had to study, but then she would have lunch with her gay friend (who she actually had sent pictures of him and his bf so he was actually gay) I started to notice this and i asked her if she still wanted to be with me, i told her to just be truthful to me, if she didn't want to be with me i would understand, she told me she still wanted to be with me but by this time she rarely even said she loved me anymore.

Step foward to the last day we spoke, she wanted to go buy a dress and i asked her if she wanted me to go with her, she said no and that i would be bored, i obviously took this as her not wanting to be with me and just making excuses, again i decided we were better off breaking up, she said she still wanted to be with me but she didn't want me to wake up early and be bored, but she also agreed that maybe we just weren't right for each other, we talked all night, she cried, i really didn't want to leave her but by now all the fighting was awful and had taken it's toll. Next day she texted me saying she missed me, i texted back saying i missed her too, but she didn't get that text until an hour later so i called her very agressively asking her where she was, she was at college doing a group work, i noticed she was very mad at me calling her like that but she didn't say anything, later that evening she said she would have to go to the airport at dinner time to buy plane tickets, i told her she was making excuses to not talk to me at dinner time and i demanded a photo at the airport, she later sent me the photo along with the text ""leave me alone"", i texted back ""yeah i'll leave you alone, you're disgusting"" to which she answered ""i'm sick of you, it's over"" and then we never spoke again. Oh i forgot to mention in one of those times we had an argument i demanded her to give me her social media and email passwords, it was very wrong of me, and after that she became very secretive of her phone, if she would ask i would let her have my phone but she didn't really like me using hers, maybe she was just protective of her privacy but knowing how my mind works these days that always made me feel like she was hiding something, and one time she was laughing at her phone right in front of me and texting, i never asked her what she was laughing about but that also made me think she was talking to some other dude. I was never this insecure, what the fuck is wrong with me?

I feel very guilty about the way things ended and i feel like i didn't treat her right, i feel like i always handled things very poorly but being cheated on really changed me. I still miss this girl and a part of me still wishes we could work things out, but i also know it's been a little over 2 months since we spoke and she probably has moved on and doesn't care about me anymore. Still i feel like i owe her an apology for insulting, controlling and mentally abusing her, even though i feel hurt about the way she broke up i don't think i can judge her for that after all i did.

So should i try talking to her and apologize or should i just let her move on and let time heal all wounds?

Sorry about the text book i just wrote ahahahah any advice and criticism would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for your answers. Trust me when I say that I know my behavior was completely unacceptable, this isn't the way I was in my previous relationships, in fact after we broke up I talked to a lot of friends about this (one of them is actually an ex-gf of mine who I still get along with very well and is a dear friend) and they were all shocked at the way i carried myself. The reason i mentioned me being cheated on is not as an excuse, what I did was inexcusable! It's just the only explanation I can find for my sudden change of behavior. I don't think i'll ever act like this again because it already cost me a person I really loved and it's just not right to treat someone like that, I won't have a relationship for a very LOOOOOOOOOONG time, and when I do if this happens again i'm going straight to therapy. I don't believe that is who I am at all.

As for me apologizing to her I was really torn about it, I felt like I should do it but after reading all of your answers I also think leaving her alone will be the best course of action, I want her to be happy, this is a person I loved very dearly and a person who once said I was the best boyfriend in the world (yeah imagine that! little did she know what she was about to go through), maybe an apology would make her feel better or then again it might bring up bad memories so i'll just stay in no contact.

Once again thank you for your answers. They really helped stress to me the error of my ways.

9jwo1o,132,2018-09-29,when my family spoke about me i was the definition of a good kid,alienscat,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/9jwo1o/when_my_family_spoke_about_me_i_was_the/,"I got in contact with drugs almost exactly 6 years ago. I was 15, had good friends, good grades and a good relationship to my mother and family but somehow i tried smoking weed.

My language teacher introduced me into drugs when i was around 13 years old back in middle school. It was some sort of campaign from my school and we learned a lot of interesting things, it wasn't like ""drugs are bad don't take them"" but more about the effects, dangers, health and addiction issues. We even had to write an essay about which drug we'd like to try hypothetically and discussed it in class. This might has been the reason why i never learned all the stereotypes/stigma around drugs and i'll be forever grateful for that.  
I got interested into drugs but i knew ill never ever even meet a person who uses drugs so i might just stop bothering about it and dropped the topic until that day when i first smoked weed. 

I felt guilty and weird but not because i enjoyed it too much or had fears of losing my mental strength and get addicted to it and try out harder stuff or whatever bullshit people think, no i was just an honest kid and i knew in order to keep my family/friends at peace i'll need to hide whatever happened even though there was nothing wrong with it. I have a history of family problems connected to my mental health and therefore the only strong connection i grew up with (beside of some friends) was my mother. I didn't want to disappoint her because learned at a very young age to take care of myself. 

 I started (/ tried) drinking at the age of almost 16 (you can drink legally with 16 where i live, europe) but never got too drunk/blackout/alcohol poisoning.  With almost 18 i felt confident enough to try MDMA. I knew a lot about dosage, harm reduction, dangers and the effects beforehand so I felt safe doing it and it was an incredible experience. Before I was 17 i didn’t go out lot and had only few opportunities (summer holidays..) where I smoked weed.

I still had to ""hide"" whatever substance i took because i didn't want my mother to think bad of me. My grades, that was two years before my high school graduation, were still good and I've successfully found a routine to keep up with responsibilities (homework, summer job, money, cleaning house, taking care of whatever i had to do) while, once in a  while, safely, going out, smoking weed, drinking and sometimes doing MDMA and stuff like that.


I lost a good amount of friends in that time due to ""taking illegal drugs and excessively partying"" (which was bullshit), people snitched on me and i got extremely  insecure doing drugs while half the people i knew regularly got drunk to the edge on weekends and i couldn't see the logic behind.

I started reconsidering my decisions and felt ashamed of me. It was one year before my graduation when i quitted everything and went out partying sober. And i think that was the first time in my life where I really saw other people beside me using drugs and it was terrifying. 

I saw (young) people taking high doses of MDMA, taking tabs which they thought was acid, snorting whatever their friends just bought from a shady guy in a toilet cubicle, starting to have  seizures, getting carried out by the ambulance and even end up dying. I saw a lot of people taking MDMA weekly, mixing it with alcohol, other substances, meds. Dropping high dosed pills, snorting cocaine and amphetamines  at a very young age because they got offered to do it. Because their friends told them they'll be fine. Because there was no time to test it. Because everyone was doing it. Dropping out of school, getting arrested, fucking up their mental and physical health due to it. Starting to develop serious problems because of their use.

I was always the good kid for my family and friends and will ever be. Maybe my mother knows that i tried a couple drugs and still do whenever i feel like it/time has passed and maybe she does not and ill tell her one day.   
I'm responsible because i had to be responsible when i was younger, there was no other choice and i learned it the hard way. I'm not a good example because, even though i don't regret anything, i would have changed some things if i could and i also did mistakes which i learned from.  

It took me very long to understand that the kid she thought i was was not just an illusion created by me while i was hiding things. I actually gave her good reasons to believe in me, believe that whatever i was up to I won't regret and she was right. 

But there are other kids and people out there who grew up entirely different than i did. They didn't get educated on the risks and dangers of drugs, they got peer pressured into doing things they normally wouldn't. They developed a bad habit and got a false sense of what's okay and whats not. Some might call them stupid and irresponsible and some stories end up really tragic. 

Now ill turn 22 next spring, around that time i'll finish my bachelor's degree in sociology. Three years have passed since i graduated high school.   
This summer i passed the entrance test for psychology at my university and am able to work in harm reduction groups educating young people. 

  
I wrote this because I was very insecure about my actions and thoughts. I always felt uncomfortable when my family spoke about my well behavior because yeah, they didn't know what i was doing in my free time. Meanwhile i was also very saddened and shocked about how people used to do drugs totally different (in aspects of risks and dangers) than I did - and potentially ruining not only the relationship to their family and friends but also risking their lives. I don't know what will happen in the future but for now im finally happy, happy that I can educate people and students like i got educated, maybe even pointing out the importance of drug testing and minimizing risks as much as possible.   


TLDR: in my high school years i started doing drugs recreationally. even though i was very careful and didn't use that often i somehow felt bad until i saw whats really going on in the area where i live/europe. started studying psychology and got  (some sort of) internship in a harm reduction organization.

9jx0x3,22,2018-09-29,Day 32 - I'm a little perturbed,Montymoo18,NoFapChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/9jx0x3/day_32_im_a_little_perturbed/,"Alright, so it's day 32, which is the furthest I have got in years, so praise God for that.

But I'm a little confused - I haven't been tempted at all over the last month, not even a little bit. It's interesting because 32 days sounds like a huge achievement, but I haven't had to overcome any urges or temptations to get here.

Let's contrast this with my previous average streak of 3 or 4 days, where most days would be a battle - what's going on?

Well I doubt it's a coincidence that this streak began at the same time that I started an internship at a local Church. Since I started there, I think because I'm focused on God and Godly matters every day, sinful thoughts just don't have a place. I've also been so busy I've barely had time to pmo anyway.

But I still have no urges. What I'd encourage you guys in is seeking God every day. You don't necessarily need to be as busy as me, but as I spend more time with God and his word, my mind is becoming less and less corrupt and more and more like his.

I'm aware that temptation could strike in the future, and I'll be ready to combat that when it comes, but for now, I thank God for this period of peace that I'm in.

God bless lads"

Da ich [den Fall Worboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Worboys) schon in einem Kommentar aufgebracht habe, fasse ich ihn hier noch einmal zusammen, für die, die ihn nicht kennen (wer damals wie ich in Großbritannien lebte, konnte ihn gar nicht verpassen). Er ist symptomatisch dafür, wie die Strafverfolgungsbehörden vielerorts mit Vergewaltigungen umgehen. Was ihn von anderen Fällen abgrenzt, sind die Anzahl der Taten und dass es hier keinerlei Zweifel mehr an der Täterschaft gibt. Aus Opferperspektive ist die Situation leider sehr ernüchternd gewesen.

* John Worboys ist ein ehemaliger Londoner Taxifahrer.
* Er beging zwischen 2002 und 2008 geschätzt über 100 Vergewaltigungen an seinen Kundinnen.
* Zur Polizei gingen von den Opfern nur insgesamt 14. Was nicht überraschen sollte, wenn man sieht, was den Opfern passierte, die Anzeige erstatteten.
* Diesen wurde [regelmäßig nicht geglaubt](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/05/how-the-establishment-failed-victims-of-black-cab-rapist-john-worboys); in einem Fall wurde das Opfer sogar [von der Polizei ausgelacht](https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2010/jan/20/rape-police) (Anmerkung: von Polizisten der *zuständigen Spezialabteilung für sexuelle Straftaten*, nicht von irgendwelchen Feld-, Wald- und Wiesenpolizisten, die sich da nicht auskennen). Vermutlich wurden die Fälle intern jahrelang als ""nicht begründet"" oder sogar als Falschanschuldigungen geführt.
* Erst 2007-2008, als sich die Anzeigen häuften (drei in einem halben Jahr) und auf denselben Fahrer hindeuteten, griff die Polizei ein.
* Verurteilt wurde er dann, trotz der eindeutigen Beweislage wegen einer (!) Vergewaltigung, fünf sexuellen Übergriffen (d.h. ohne Geschlechtsverkehr), einem versuchten sexuellen Übergriff und 12 Fällen der Verabreichung von Betäubungsmitteln.
* Vergewaltigung konnte in den meisten Fällen nicht nachgewiesen werden, da die Polizei den Opfern nicht glaubte und keine hinreichende Beweisaufnahme vornahm.

Ich schreibe das, weil mal wieder die Mär von den vielen Falschanschuldigungen umgeht. Was der Fall illustriert, ist, dass Frauen regelmäßig von der Polizei nicht geglaubt wird, dass viele deswegen gar nicht erst Anzeige erstatten. Im vorliegenden Fall haben wir dann auf einmal im nachhinein Bestätigung und eine Entlastung der Opfer von der Verdächtigung der Falschanzeige. Dieses Glück werden aber im allgemeinen die wenigsten Opfer haben, denen so etwas passiert."

He was a lonely teenager, often bullied at school, when a freak accident grants him incredible powers. With his newfound abilities, he becomes a high-flying, building-jumping thrill-seeker, using visual media to promote his brand. But when he loses someone very close to him, he learns that there's a great responsibility that comes with great power, and finds himself in the crosshairs of a corrupt giant tech corporation.   

You know his story very well. He's amazing, spectacular, and even sensational! He's a brand new hero for a brand new day! He's [the one and only...](https://i.imgur.com/a8xjxn7.png)

**Derek James, Sideways**  

When Challengers Mountain suddenly appeared in Gotham (yeah, that's a thing that happened, read *Dark Nights: Metal*), high school student Derek James was pulled in through a dimensional rift and trapped in the Dark Multiverse for four days. When he escaped, he discovered a strange power: the ability to create rifts through time and space using his fingers. With these newfound abilities, he decided to start up with his webstreaming show, titled [""Steppin' Out with Sideways""](https://i.imgur.com/w59JO6W.jpg). And shortly after a strange series of circumstances, he found himself going face-to-face with an assortment of [colorful bad guys](https://i.imgur.com/gcNnKnk.jpg).   

&amp;nbsp;  

**His Supporting Cast**   

[**Ernestine Edgars**](https://i.imgur.com/e4qeUX6.jpg) - Ernie is Derek's best friend, and the only person aware of his secret persona. She's a huge cosplaying science nerd who wears an animal onesie to school, and she designed Derek's Sideways costume. She also cares deeply about Derek, often reminding him of his family obligations while simultaneously supporting his webstreaming show. Her twin sister Emeline is the complete opposite of her, a high school socialite with [a crush on Sideways](https://i.imgur.com/3HbGzzX.jpg). With her genius intellect and her unwavering loyalty, one might consider Ernie to be the *ultimate* best friend...

[**Helen Flynn**](https://i.imgur.com/Nq9Cbs5.jpg) - Derek's mother works as a publicist for Dark Star Sciences, a tech company run by the definitely-not-shady [Leto Dominus](https://img.fireden.net/co/image/1457/40/1457405792484.jpg) ^(whoops, that's the wrong image). Despite her busy work life, there are few things that Helen cares for more than Derek's well-being. She tries to keep him on a close leash out of worry for his safety (much to Derek's discontent), and pushes him to apply for a prestigious internship with her company. Hopefully, Derek will appreciate how much his adopted parent cares for him...  

[**Tempus Fuginaut**](https://i.imgur.com/x04Stvq.jpg) - Tempus is a Fuginaut, a guardian of time and space who's been [kicking ass and taking names for millenia](https://i.imgur.com/lWCiXW1.jpg). At first, he believes that Derek is a threat to space-time stability thanks to his callous use of his rift powers, and must be eliminated. However, he soon changes his mind, realizing that Derek can help against incoming threats, and mentors him on how to use his powers.

9jxwh4,3,2018-09-29,My (F26) LDR boyfriend (M24) went from being the most loving man to having no feelings in a few weeks,wagon2003,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jxwh4/my_f26_ldr_boyfriend_m24_went_from_being_the_most/,"Hi Reddit!

Last few weeks have been a real nightmare for me and I now am puzzled, angry, heartbroken and devastated all at once.

I lived in a foreign country for several years, where I met my boyfriend. He isn't from that country either (we studied there, but not in the same uni). Just so you understand, we come from very different cultural and religious backgrounds and neither of us is from a country where you'd want to move for good. Despite all that, we were a perfect match and our cultural differences have never been a problem, as we both are very open-minded. After we started going out we moved in together very fast and lived together for a year. It was the best time of my life (and his, as he was saying). Even though I had plenty of problems at that moment, I regret nothing. We really became one, we spent all of our time together, and it was never too much. We just were so great for each other. He became my best friend, my closest person in the world. After a year I had to move back to my country for the reasons I couldn't control. We both cried and I still remember his face as I was walking through the security check... It was heartbreaking, but we decided to stay together and find a way to move to a third country together, even though there was no clear plan at that moment. We have been in a long-distance relationship for almost a year and it was making me happy every day. Every single text or call would gave me such a warm feeling. Seriously, having him in my life, knowing that he loves me, gave me so much power and motivation, I was so grateful for having him, I can't find right words to describe how strong of a bond I felt I had with him. I visited him his May, we spent a week together and it was amazing. He told me I was the love of his life and everything was just like as when we lived together.

Everything started to deteriorate after he graduated and went back to his home-country (two months ago). Now he lives with his parents and has little privacy there, so it became more difficult for him to skype and even text (his family doesn't know about us), plus he has lots of responsibilities there. He also says that life there is hell there.... First, he was trying hard and was still good to me. We didn't talk as much, but I felt that he missed me and cared for me.  I also tried to adjust to this new reality, not expecting him to have as much time for us. But a few weeks ago he just became very different.... very detached and started to take way too much time to reply (he also started his internship, so first I thought it was understandable). But there was no more affection in his texts and he couldn't find time for us to skype. Sometimes his answers were almost rude and would make me feel like I am not understanding and am a terrible girlfriend, who's nagging all the time. He would often tell me that his family is going through hard times, but wouldn't explain what was going on, but he often told me ""there are things I can't explain"", which didn't make it easier for me to understand. I started feeling that his family is much more important for him than me, which hurt... as I considered myself his family too... Even though I admired how caring he was towards his family...

he started kind of ghosting me, I could see him online on facebook while he had messages from me unanswered. He would tell me that he isn't ignoring me, isn't ghosting me, simply denying everything he was doing. I expressed him my discontent many times, told him it wasn't respectful and so on. Again he would tell me that he wasn't  disrespecting me. Which made me feel like I am crazy. Several times it just seemed like he was gaslighting me...One time he tried to convince me that we talked about something I texted him about, when in fact we never did. During all this horrible time I was telling him that we should talk face to face, that texting makes everything complicated. He'd tell me he'd find time for us to skype, but then he never did... I couldn't understand what was going on and he didn't give any answers, only excuses... It came to the point when he told me he need time to think and some space (which was crazy, cause he had all the space in the world, that's how little we talked). We didn't talk for almost a week, Eventually I couldn't take it and texted him. He said we'd talk, but then started ignoring me again! I was completely drained, I sent him many voice-messages, telling him how horrible it was that I didn't know what was going on... he replied saying that he is confused and has a conflict inside, he also said that all of his feelings felt blank, not only towards me and blablabla.... He said he wasn't optimistic about our future and that continuing would hurt us more, but at the same time he said that being apart scared him even more, and ""idk what to say, Idk what to do"" and that long-distance relationship don't go well with his personality (after a year of such). He also said that I was always on his mind and that he missed me....

What I couldn't digest is that he never talked about such feelings with me, didn't discuss his apprehensions about our future, which was expectable, cause it concerns us both... And I was always there to talk and to support him... I replied to this and he eventually said he didn't think it'd work and that he ""isn't feeling it anymore"". No need to say how broken I am. Less than a month ago he was telling me he loved me and that he wanted to spend all his life with me... Less than a month ago we were so intimate in our conversations, just like we used to be...  I have cognitive dissonance, his behavior is so not him. It feels like he's a different person, not caring, not compassionate, cold and indifferent ... and this change was so sudden, I still don't understand what are the reasons... And it hurts so much that he keeps ignoring my texts or replies only to the parts he wants to reply to...I don't believe that the feelings we had can just disappear overnight...  I know that he isn't likely to have any temptations there and I know he isn't having fun there or cheating...I know that his life there is really hard... we didn't officially break up, we didn't talk anything through...I asked him still to Skype with me... He agreed... And I really don't how it will be. I am so scared and confused, feels like someone pulled the rug from under my feet... It also breaks my heart thinking we'd become enemies, cause his behavior makes me so feel so angry and helpless... Also I think if I didnt' insist on skyping, his text would be it, and breaking up through a text with someone you loved is just beyond my understanding...

I am asking you guys for advise on how to handle this situation and maybe how to talk to him when we skype... Also, do you think it's possible to stop loving someone like that or he has been lying to me for a while or it's something else?"
9jy9nm,4,2018-09-29,My gf (23) is breaking my heart and there's nothing I can do about it.,seancar13,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9jy9nm/my_gf_23_is_breaking_my_heart_and_theres_nothing/,"My girlfriend and I are nearing our one year anniversary (near Thanksgiving) and lately she's been tearing me down and I don't know what to do.

We've been long distance for most of our relationship. We went to school about an hour from each other in Illinois. Shes still in the tail end of Pharmacy school. I graduated took an internship in South Carolina (about 10 hours away) around the start of February. Our relationship worked out just fine for that time. She had no problem coming to see me and I would go see her when I can. 

I recently began a job in eastern Kentucky where I'm basically the communications director of a collegiate athletic department (Sports Information Director, if you all know). I am in charge of all 22 of our sports and as can be assumed a lot of those take up my weekends as I'm supposed to be at as many home events as I can. I basically work seven days a week. 

Lately she has been stuck in a funk where she starts manipulating me and making me feel like crap because I can't see her. For example, last Sunday she texted me something to the extend of ""It's going to suck being the mom that has to go to all our kids sports and school events because you'll always be working."" I called her and talked through it and thought this was over. 

Yesterday she asked me to meet her halfway between us to do fall couples stuff which I said we could, but I won't be there until like 8 or 9 and she said it's too late and went with her friend. Meanwhile she snapchatted me saying ""I'm done trying."" To which I said please don't say that, so she replied ""Well literally begging you to come see me doesn't work so I'm done."" And ""it'd just be nice to see you more than once a month.""

Meanwhile, She's planning on coming to see me next weekend for my birthday and on the day she's driving in, I found a concert (in a genre I don't even like) along the way that she tried to go to earlier this summer but got rained out, and she replied ""I have a class presentation until 5 so I can't"" with a crying emoji. Just trying to show an effort and I'm trying and I still get shut down. 

All of this has taken a huge emotional toll on me and I've been so anxious and down on myself the last week because I feel like it's my fault. I guess I'm basically asking you all for guidance because I really do love her and think she's the one. When we're together life is great and we're both extremely happy. She's always treated me great for the first 10 months of our time together but I just feel like it's falling apart and I'm scared. 

Obviously, her friends are all on her side and my friends are on my side, but maybe one of you has had a similar experience and can help.

9jyawg,2,2018-09-29,What’s a good way to get an internship in Australia as an American? [F20/M22],mormispos,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/9jyawg/whats_a_good_way_to_get_an_internship_in/,"Hey r/LongDistance

I’m a junior in computer science and it’s very expected by future employers and peers that I should have a professional internship this summer. I have plans to live in Melbourne with my partner for at least year while he is finishing university after I graduate. (He is in year 1/3, I am in year 3/4). I was thinking it would be helpful to have work experience in Australia, preferably in Melbourne CBD or near it, before going over there (plus I would then know what to expect about living in Australia if/when I relocate. )

In CS, it would be dumb to take an unpaid internship and I wouldn’t be making that sacrifice when I could work for an American company with an office in Melbourne and still be able to make some money this summer. I also don’t want to do one of those programs where you pay to intern somewhere unless someone can make it seem financially worthwhile. 

Right now I have about 100 companies in my field that I was going to go through to try and find places that accept foreign nationals, but this seems very inefficient. Does anyone know a better way than just blindly shooting out emails? Is there another subreddit where I could crosspost this that would be able to help?"
9jye6h,1,2018-09-29,Is TSP rollover the best option?,somerandomchick92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9jye6h/is_tsp_rollover_the_best_option/,"Hey guys,

First time poster here, with a couple questions about my best move for retirement accounts and investments.

Quick situation summary:
Income: 1500- 2500, monthly
Savings: 40 K + 100/month
Debt: 0
Retirement (TSP): 9.5 K

Currently a college student and paid intern for the rest of the year and my living situation leaves me with a little bit of savings. Since I left the military I have been unable to contribute to my thrift savings plan and I’m considering opening a target date fund with vanguard. This is my first year having taxable income since I separated, so it’s the fist year I will be able to contribute to an IRA (no 401(k) through workplace).

Should I rollover my TSP balance into an IRA and then max my contribution? Or should I leave the TSP alone and open an IRA strictly from savings? Does TSP get taxed like a 401(k) rollover would?

Additionally, I want to supplement my savings with some investments and plan to take about 15k out for that.  Should I stick with vanguard, probably their mutual funds or ETFs? I don’t know if it’s a higher risk to have all accounts with a single company, but I like their options. 

Any advice or opinions would be appreciated.
Thanks!

I kept up with this sub all while season 14 was airing to see what was going on because I was too lazy to watch it live. But now that it’s on Netflix I’ve binged it, so here are my thoughts.

I expected to hate Maggie a lot more, considering the negative opinions about her on here. I really do find no chemistry between her and Jackson and I hope their relationship ends (What bothers me most is that they had previously referred to each other as step siblings only to start dating). I also think her relationship with Richard makes a nice addition to the show.

Okay, and I HATE Bello. If anyone is “hey look at me, I’m so quirky and cute and relatable” it’s her, not Maggie like I’ve seen mentioned. Like oh my lord she was so annoying and I’m glad she moved to Switzerland. Honestly I hate all the interns except Glasses (he’s a really good addition!) and Helm on most episodes. 

Roy sucks. He should be written off. 

April and Matthew ending up together was ridiculous, don’t even get me started on how backwards that all is. 

I still don’t like Catherine, never have never will. The Catherine Fox Foundation is laughable considering she was helping keep those assaulted by Harper Avery quiet. She shouldn’t be rewarded for it, like come on grey’s, if you’re gonna do a #metoo episode at least execute is correctly. 

Overall I didn’t hate this season as much as I thought I would, surprisingly.

However: tl;dr below.

When we started dating, we had been friends for quite a while and when we finally got together: it was a dream come true. Starting out with a deep trust and appreciation of one another is something I'd always wanted. This was three years ago, and the start of my first actual relationship. Even though I'd had girls be interested in me, this is the first time I'd felt in a good enough place emotionally, ""compatible"" enough, and in stable enough living conditions to go for it.  

When it came to intimacy, I honored her wishes that everything advance at her pace. Not that I would have felt comfortable ""pushing"" her in the first place. I made it clear that I had no expectations, so, most of the time, it was her pushing the boundaries. On days when she took erotic/asthaetic pictures of herself to post online she was especially enthusiastic about pushing for more, sometimes even making me drop what I'm doing and saying that she needed me right then. Having been a virgin before her, and to be honest, sort of repressed, it really helped me acknowledge myself as a sexual person, that it's okay to have sexual desires.

One persistent issue was penetrative intercourse, which is painful for her. Over the three year period that we've been together, we've only tried it a handful of times. Not having it is not really an issue for me, but I suggested that she could ask her obgyn about it, to which she replied that she's never seen one. And that she doesn't intend to see one ever. Since I'm not a woman myself, I'm not quite sure how big of a deal is, but it did concern me.  

After some time we decided to move in together, putting an end to us only being able to meet on weekends. Not out of nowhere, mind you. We'd been living together for 6 weeks before as she had an internship in my city. 
This, however, led to a gradual decline in our sex life. At first, it showed as her not initating much anymore. I try to pick it up, perhaps sometimes too persistently. Then she gets herself a toy. A week in between sex turns into two, which turns into months. Eventually, trying to initiate just makes her depressed, angry or grossed out. Talking about it proves difficult as well, as even that was has the same effect. She says she's just not a sexual person, that she's always felt uncomfortable with anything sexual.  
  
I felt like a rug had been pulled from under me. I felt sick to my stomach. Like I'd been a rapist all this time; And simultaneously like I'm not ""good"" enough.
Afterwards she made it clear that it was always consensual, but that I shouldn't try to initiate anything anymore. She wouldn't either.
Trying to talk about it after that mostly lead to us both getting pissed off or in tears, but also sometimes in sex, which is the most confusing part about the entire ordeal.  

Basically anything I express that's of sexual nature is making her uncomfortable. Talking about her fantasies or why she's not attracted to me is a no-go too.
At this point any hint of me having a libido or any suggestion such as using weShouldTryIt or going to couples counselling will just make her sad or annoyed.
Even though we're still very much in love in every other aspect, even non-sexual physical closeness, it's taking a toll on the relationship. She thinks that she's ""ruining me"" and I'm thinking that I'm not good enough or that she'll eventually find someone else she's more compatible with and will drop me.  

Recently, she's been saying that I should just find someone else to fulfill my desires. Not just once, multiple times.  

This devastated me. Makes me feel like she just said ""You will never be good enough"". And even if I remotely considered it a possibility, I don't think I could go through with it.
I also believe that she wouldn't be able to deal with it either: She had a dream where I did just that, leaving her distraught when she woke up. She insists that it was because she ""didn't like the girl"".  

I feel so lost right now, like I don't know anything and that I'm misinterpreting everything, all the time. I'm struggling with my self-worth and am plagued by thoughts about how this makes me an egotistical, sex-obsessed nightmare of a boyfriend.
Worst of it all, I don't have anyone to talk to IRL.  

I'm at my wits' end and don't know how to frame the issue in a way that's conducive to real discussion. Any advice on how to approach the issue more delicately? How to talk about it in a way that's less uncomfortable? Or should I just infer she's asexual or simply not attracted to me and drop the issue?

***

tl;dr: After moving in together, sex life slowly ground to a halt, especially since she got a toy. She says she's not a sexual person and that I should find someone else for it. Discussing anything sexual makes her uncomfortable. How do I constructively approach the issue?"

&amp;#x200B;

[https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holoport-manufacturing-has-begun-25935796af76](https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holoport-manufacturing-has-begun-25935796af76)  


  
We at Holo are excited to share that we have made a significant step towards achieving a milestone event. The hardware components for the highly anticipated HoloPorts have been purchased and the manufacturing process has begun!

Holo has the potential to do to the internet what AirBnB has done to the hotel industry. Now everyone can be a host… online. Together we can take back the internet!

Holoports give you the ability to share or sell your computer’s spare capacity to help others connect to each other via peer-to-peer apps using Holochains. When people use the apps you host, you can get rewarded in cryptocurrency. This currency is designed to give the world more “value-stable” digital assets that it is backed by a vital modern asset: computing power.

But that is just the beginning.

By pooling together our computing resources we make possible an entire network of distributed apps that are free from centralized control.

A centralized Internet makes us more vulnerable to hacking, censorship, tracking, and numerous other abuses. And because we have little say in how these systems we rely upon operate, we aren’t able to improve how they work for us.

Building the distributed internet is important because it has the potential to change the world in powerful ways by empowering individuals, fostering trust, and helping build thriving communities.

Backers of the Holo’s crowdfunding campaign, some of the organizations longest standing supporters, recently received details about HoloPort manufacturing as well as general updates regarding Holochain in this (further updated) progress report on Indiegogo:

It’s high time for a Holo crowdfunding campaign update to all of you our most faithful backers — and it’s a mega one because we’ve made a ton of progress over the last weeks of summer! The most exciting news for many will be that we’ve made the payments that have officially kicked off the process of manufacturing the HoloPorts! We’ll be receiving the first shipment of official prototypes in the next few days, and continue our testing efforts with these latest versions. As that process goes forward we’ll continue keeping you in the loop. But the entire Holo team is just as excited to share many others details with you now about the Holo ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/suoqbovit9p11.png

**HoloPort Updates**

HoloPort &amp; HoloPort+ Processor Upgrade: As can be expected we faced some challenges finding a large enough supply of the processors initially chosen for the HoloPorts. Rather than a delay in delivery, we’ve opted to give the HoloPorts a speed upgrade! The only drawback with a processor upgrade is that it naturally comes with a slightly higher energy usage. The original specs for maximum continuous power were 15 watts for the Nano, 35 watts for the HoloPort, and 45 watts for the HoloPort+. The Nano will remain at 15 watts and we even expect that typical usage for the HoloPorts will be in that original range, but those who wish to push the limits will be able to access more power. Regardless, HoloPorts will still require massively less energy to host a distributed app than anything built on a blockchain. We’re doing some final testing for heat dissipation at peak load to make sure we can proceed with the upgraded CPUs but we do not expect this to affect the average HoloPort user or our expected delivery target.

&amp;#x200B;

One Year Warranty: We’re excited to officially announce that there will be a one year warranty for all HoloPort Nanos, HoloPorts, and HoloPorts+.

&amp;#x200B;

HoloPort Cases: In the last update, you may have noticed the sleek design of our latest cases brought to life with our latest renderings. The custom cases for the HoloPorts and HoloPorts+ as well as the Nano’s have been molded and nearly finalized so they’ll be ready for assembly after all of the last few hardware components have been purchased.

&amp;#x200B;

HoloPort Operating System: HoloPorts boot up with NixOS because it provides for package and configuration management that puts you in the driver seat when it comes to setting up your device and helps smooth the way for excellent Holo customer service.

&amp;#x200B;

**Holochain Core Upgrades (Warning: Tech Jargon!)**

If you have been following the action on our Github repositories, you will have noticed that the first iteration of Holochain, “holochain-proto” is no longer under active development. That’s because we have been busy with the current refactoring of Holochain Rust, which is getting closer to completion. The development team is excited to release the Alpha version with Rust incorporated into the design that will enable several key improvements in a matter of weeks. There will be more details on our Medium blog soon but system upgrades will include:

&amp;#x200B;

Native Cross-Platform &amp; Mobile Ready Deployment

Harnessing Web Assembly as the execution engine for Holochain Apps

Language Extensibility

Richer Interfaces with Unity

&amp;#x200B;

**Holochain Applications**

&amp;#x200B;

In combination with upcoming Holochain Rust release, our summer interns, and Holochain Apps team (hApps!) got some fantastic work done. We have made significant progress on HoloChat and we have demonstrated key aspects of app bridging (connecting multiple Holochain applications) as well as Holochain core app integration. By launch, we will have a completely automated build, test, and deploy pipeline with patterns for extension by Holochain application developers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the hApps that should be ready in Alpha or Beta by launch include:**

&amp;#x200B;

HoloVault: A working name for a personal identity and personas management application

HoloChat: A base chat application (The Mother App!) akin to slack or Mattermost, portions of which will be used by many other hApps

Fractal Wiki: Exactly like it sounds! A wiki with wikis inside of wikis which were started at our last hackathon in London and extended at a Vancouver hackathon.

Errand: A simple kanban project management tool with similarities to Waffle or Trello

Games: Who doesn’t love a distributed minesweeper, battleship, or chess?!

We will also soon have a complete guide to all of the Holochain UI Components. Our process uses Storybook from the moment a hApp or feature is requested, right through to being in use, so it’s always up to date and accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Join the Community!**

&amp;#x200B;

If you haven’t already, get our community newsletter and be part of the conversation on social media (Twitter/Telegram/YouTube/FB) where we’ll be sharing more details about Holo and Holochain and continue conversing with our global community.

&amp;#x200B;

If you did not participate in the Indiegogo campaign you will soon be able to order a HoloPort directly from our online store. Get our newsletter to get be among the first to have the opportunity to purchase a HoloPort and be part of this transformative technology.

&amp;#x200B;

We remain in a steady state of gratitude for all of your support, big and small, and the heaps of patience you extend to our team as we continue pushing forward on this complex project. You’re the roots that keep us fed, grounded, and focused on continued growth. You’re the best.

I am still on the hunt to do a literate fandom romance rp. Below are a few plot ideas, but I'm open to any you may have! (Note: These are Canon x OC, with you playing the canon role)

New Royal Crush (M x M)

Bowser x OC Bowser grew tired of chasing Princess Peach. He knew she didn't feel the same way he did. So he decided to pursue a new person...

This can be kidnapping, or maybe Bowser shows a sweet side. Up to you!

Not for Long (M x M)

Wallace Wells x OC (Scott Pilgrim Rp) When Scott brings over his new friend from work, Wallace outs on his usual moves. His best friend telling him the cute boy is straight won't stop him...

The Lab Intern (M x M) Professor Birch x OC (Pokemon) When Professor Birch was told he would get a new intern, he wasn't expecting someone so cute. As his feelings grow by the day, what will he do?

HE'S MINE! (M x M) BTR guys x OC (Big Time Rush) After a new up and coming artist moves into the Palm Woods, the guys go crazy for them (except for Kendall). Who will this new artist choose?

This is a love rivalry plot.

New to the Force (M x M) The Ginyu Force x OC (Dragon Ball Z) After Guildo left, the Ginyu force hired a new member- but weren't expecting someone so adorable and begin fighting over him. What will he do?

This is a love rivalry plot.

Game on, dude! (M x M) Bastion, Chumley and Hassleberry x OC (Yugioh GX) After a new student moved to Duel Academy, the guys couldn't resist them. Who will the newbie go for?

I will play pretty much all other characters in this, and it's a love rivalry.

Colors (M x M) Beast Boy x OC (Teen Titans) Beast Boy never thought he would love again. Until a cute boy joined their team... Wait, did he like guys? How will he deal with his feelings as they grow stronger?

Moving on (M x M) Tom x OC (Star vs the forces of evil After getting dumped by Star for Marco, Tom never thought he'd love again... Until someone new comes into his sights...

Gotta go faster! (M x M)

This can either be an OC x OC rp or OC x Canon (you'd play Canon). I have a lot of ideas for this but not enough space, so feel free to ask!

If none of these strike your fancy, feel free to give me your ideas/fandoms! Other fandoms I enjoy but don't have a specific plot for: Adventure Time, Avatar the last airbender, Disney, Inuyasha, Left 4 Dead, Legend of Korra, Total Drama

⭐⭐ Here are my rules:

1. Please be literate. No text talk or bad grammar (minus the occasional slip up of course).

2. I only rp in 3rd person. This is non-negotiable. Please be okay doing 3rd.

3. I ONLY PLAY UKE/SUB, NEVER DOM!!!! MY CHARACTERS ARE SUBS ONLY!!!! You have been warned!!!!

4. Be okay with OC x canon

5. Please be an active role player overall. We all have lives but please don't just disappear for days on end and never return.

6. If you are looking for all smut, you have come to the wrong place. I am fine with a build up to smut, but I want there to be a focus on romance and plot.

7. Please be respectful of me. I am a very friendly person but the quickest way to end an rp with me is to treat me badly. I am a human that deserves dignity like everyone else. Insult me once and it's over.

8. I'm sorry, but if your profile pic has a real person in it, I would ask that you change it before rping. It really just throws me off as weird as that sounds (anime/cartoon pics, scenery and anything else really are fine).

I am fine with people of all gender expressions, as long as you play M! My timezone is EST US time. All characters will be 18+. I am working most of today but I will reply as soon as possible. &lt;PLOT DRIVEN NSFW&gt;

I think that's it? If interested, kik:

Hope to rp soon!

9k25t6,12,2018-09-29,New Babysitter weirdness- need some outside perspective,DontFuckWithMyMoney,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/9k25t6/new_babysitter_weirdness_need_some_outside/,"We recently hired a new babysitter, as my wife is going to school for her Master's and has two days per week where she works a full day for her internship. We hired her to pick up the kids from school those two days, bring them home, and be relieved a few hours later. She has a young baby (&gt;1 year). 

The first day she watched them, she told us that she had forgotten to bring an extra bottle for the baby and drove the kids to her house (about 15 minutes away) but didn't take them inside, just ran in quickly. A few days later my kids told me they'd actually stopped at her friend's house first, where they stayed in the car while she ran in to pick up her baby who was being watched by her friend. She never mentioned that first stop, and  this being the very first day it rubbed us the wrong way.

Then on Wednesday, the night before Day 2, she sent my wife a text at 8:30 PM saying she'd had foot surgery earlier that day (???) and since it was going to be tough for her to move around, she was going to take the kids to her house (where we've never been) and her friend (whom we haven't met) was going to help her out.

We balked immediately- both because of the short notice and the fact that she was right off the bat bringing them somewhere we hadn't agreed to and enlisting help with people we didn't know. We told her that we'd figure it out and she didn't need to do that.

I took a half day and when I went to pick up the kids, she was there, apparently not totally sure that we'd made that arrangement.

After all these things my wife wanted to fire her immediately- it was too many red flags. I agreed it is strange, but might also just be something where there's a miscommunication somewhere and we need to more clearly lay out our expectations.

I should note that if we fire her we don't have many options right away. I can't keep taking half days and she can't be leaving her internship whenever she wants. All the local daycares that pick up are over capacity and we had a hell of a time finding someone available in the first place.

So what do you all think? Are these red flags we shouldn't ignore? How might we resolve this and retain her? Are we overreacting by considering letting her go right away?

Edit: Let her go today. It was.... weirdly easy. I think she expected it."

At the same time, this was also the arc (to my knowledge) where pacing was becoming an issue  towards the second half leading to a few execution problems  more so towards the finale of it.  So I'm definitely sure the pacing issue is gonna be resolved when it comes to Season 4 that's for certain, and maybe it can also fix some of the execution problems that Kohei was having at the time just in terms of that arc near the conclusion. That and I believe it was also the time he took a good amount of breaks (not that breaks are bad, but you know). 

&amp;#x200B;

The important question is do you guys think Season 4 is just gonna be solely centered on the Internship arc, or will there be another arc to follow it up? 

As of right now we've covered the first 4 chapters of the arc from Episodes 62 &amp; 63 (S3 Episodes 24 &amp; 25) and there's a total of 41 chapters.  Which means there are about 37 chapters left for the anime to cover the rest of the Internship Arc, and if I'm calculating this correctly that would estimate to around  the first18-19 Episodes of Season 4 maybe including some in-cannon filler.  Also assuming that Season 4 is gonna be 24-25 episodes like Seasons 2 &amp; 3 then I can see the final 6 episodes covering the Remedial Course Arc, and then the last episode of Season 4 teasing Gentle.

I wanted to do a tier list of sorts of my favorite doctors (plus Carol) after seeing a bunch of lists out there. Probably missed some doctors, but if i completely forgot them they probably weren't that important to begin with (or i just forgot).





#27.) Rocket Romano#
 I hated him more than most other people on this sub. Yes he occasionally showed his humanity but his blatant homophobia and sexism (and the blackballing of Peter) always kept him on my shit list.

#26.) Archie Morris (Early)#

Had to break his up b/c Morris really grew on me in the early seasons but he really was a worthless pos at the beginning.

#25.) Victor Clemente

Not much to say about Clemente but I do feel in retrospect that he was kind of a prototype for Moretti as a Chief who believes the ER should aspire to be better.

#24.) Simon Brenner

#23.) Maggie Doyle#

Felt the need to explain this one—it's not that she did anything wrong, it's just that she was so boring. I can't remember anything about her aside from being pushed out by Romano's homophobia and a bunch of police in her family.


#22.)  Dave Malucci

Was he dumb? Yes. Did he,in general, deserve to be fired? Yes. Did he deserve to get fired in the way he did? Not exactly. That whole fiasco of prescribing thrombylyitics to a patient with Marfan's Syndrome always stuck with me. He lost a lot of points in my book when he called Weaver a Nazi dyke, but before that I didn't actually hate him that much.

#21.) Neela Rasgotra

Always whiny, worked at the corner store for no good reason, kinda self righteous, and ineffectively paired up with 40% of the male characters on the back half of the show.

#20.) Catherine Banfield#

Probably deserves to be higher but I never was a fan of hard-ass chiefs. Angela Bassett couldn't save this one for me.

#19.) Cleo Finch

Problem completely lies in ineffective use. Cleo was great, and never around.

#18.) Kevin Moretti

I always say Moretti could've been an interesting an effective chief/heel/mild antagonist if given more time. He was never too wrong about the ER or its doctors, he was just kind of an ass.

#17.) Kerry Weaver

I realize I rank Kerry lower than most other people but I was never able to forgive how self serving she was. Over her tenure, there were few doctors she *didn't* try to either push out of the hospital or position to her liking. Her push-out of Jing Mei and Malucci especially never sat right with me, as it was essentially her just lying. Kerry's always playing politics over Mark was tiring. The less power Kerry had the more tolerable she was.

#16.) Jing Mei Chen

I never hated Jing Mei (although I did hate her parents). I found her promiscuity fun, although the start of her relationship with Pratt was weak.

#15.) Ray Barnett

#14.) Luka Kovac

Ineffective Doug replacement. Never fully bought into his character. Shoutout for giving us the Forrest Whitaker plotline though, really though Baby Joe was gonna die.

#13.) Lucien Dubenko

The shittiest moments with Dubenko all come from his interactions with women. Without his nice-guy, insecure shtick, he could've maybe been top ten.

#12.) Greg Pratt

#11.) Michael Gallant

Wasted on Neela. MVP intern when he first arrived on the scene. Gone too soon.

#10.) Liz Corday

Liked her more in the early seasons, domesticity weakened her. Still, shoutout to Corday and her Kangol hat.

#9.) Peter Benton

Damn I struggled with Peter. He was so reluctant to embrace his blackness and the unique position he held, he was needlessly cold, and he was largely responsible for Omar Epps' character's suicide. I was always hoping we would see him learn his lesson, but much like Romano his character left the show without ever fully addressing his primary character flaw.

#8.) Archie Morris (Late)

When Carter first told Morris ""you set the tone,"" I marked it as the beginning of the end of ER. And while it kinda was, Archie's character really did do a complete 180 in my book. Still never the most competent, but he brought a lot of heart to the ER in the back half. Like Rudy with a medical license.



#7.) Tony Gates

Jokes on you subreddit, I never hated him as much as you all promised. He was a much more effective Doug Ross replacement than Kovac. Really, it was Sam who was lacking in the equation, she never could get out of her own way and she was much too quick to anger. Gates' apartment was cool, his hair was cool, his kid was cool. Suck it, nerds.

#6.) Abby Lockhart

#5.) Mark Greene

Mark's lower placement in the top 10 is largely a side effect of how much I loved and missed the remaining core cast. If i ever did another rewatch, his placement might shift up once I watch his scenes through the lens of understanding how important he was to the hospital.

#4.) Carol Hathaway

Top tier. Loved her hair. Missed her deeply. 

#3.) Doug Ross

Honestly he should probably be lower on the list because of how often he got in his own way. But damnit Ross you were a loose-cannon doc on the edge who followed nobody's rules but his own and I feel for it.

#2.) Susan Lewis

I had a major crush on Susan Lewis the whole time, plain and simple. Honestly I view her a lot as a female version of Carter. Deeply caring, willing to go above and beyond for her patients. Sherry if you're reading this I love you.

#1.) Motherfucking John Carter. 

The heart of the show. The main character in my eyes. The Intern Who Lived. There wasn't a plot line of his I didn't appreciate. Two things of his character will always break my heart: we never got to see him as chief, and Kem, in the end, couldn't loved him back. John Carter set the tone.

9k2jn2,2,2018-09-29,I've been terribly anxious all weekend and I feel like I have no one to talk to about it.,TheButtholeOfBravery,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9k2jn2/ive_been_terribly_anxious_all_weekend_and_i_feel/,"I don't think I've felt this anxious since forever. Yesterday I had an episode of insomnia while being consumed with anxiety and dread about the future. I can’t even sit down and relax for a bit without feeling anxious this weekend. 

I’m going to attend a career fair next week and I think that might be the trigger for my current anxiety (and the fact that I am going to start applying for summer internships starting next weekend). I’m confident about my major/skills (BS in Geography, Intel Analysis Minor with knowledge of Python/R/SQL), but I’m still consumed with endless fear about the idea of not being able to find an internship/job when I graduate. I’m hoping that I calm down after I attend the career fair and network, but I’ve been dealing with nothing but anxiety, fear, and dread about the next year and a half (I graduate in Fall 2019).

I just want to feel better and stop feeling so fatalistic about the future. I want to have some self-compassion for once lately. My anxiety is eating me physically and mentally (My anxiety is making feel like I just recovered from a bad cold). 

I emailed to schedule an appointment with my therapist (whom I have been quite satisfied with), but I am waiting for him to respond. I know its just the weekend and that he will respond to my email soon, but the fact that I haven’t got one yet is making me feel more alone and helpless. My parents have been very supportive of me, but I feel that there’s only so much that I can talk to them about my current fears/anxieties before sounding like a broken record. 

I’m sure that I’ll do fine at the career fair, but I’m honestly scared about what this week has for me in general and I feel alone and afraid. I feel like I’m just bottling up my anxiety while the rest of the world chugs along confidently. I don’t think I’ve felt this bad in a long time. I just want to feel relaxed again like I did not even a week ago and just feel like everything will be okay in the end.

9k2km8,3,2018-09-29,"""Dude you've been pissing for literally the longest time I've seen""",FPSPizza,DreamInterpretation,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/9k2km8/dude_youve_been_pissing_for_literally_the_longest/,"About myself before I start my story: I'm 18, Male and I'm actually about to start an internship program with this big toy company and I'm planning to be an intern there while still working for my part time job selling phones. I'm Asian if that helps and a Leo if that's useful too. 

So I had this dream where we were on a school trip to go skydiving. My class and I boarded a bus from school and soon we're on our way to the place. I can't remember if I was sipping on something the whole way there or something, but I knew that my friends and I had to go to the toilet once we arrived.

So the bus stops, my friends and I alight and made our way to the building (bus had to stop like 50M (164ft) from the actual entrance of the building because there was no cul de sac or roundabout for the bus to exit safely after letting us off the bus so the driver made us walk the rest of the way there from a main road, no traffic on it now that I think of it)

We got into the building and there's a toilet near the entrance, it was visibly busy from the outside so my friend, who happened to have been to the place before, showed the rest of the clique another toilet somewhere nearer to the back. And we went.

Got to the toilet and the 5 of us all went to pee, some went to the cubicles while I and some other friends went to the urinals (you know, bro code not peeing right next to each other unless it's extremely busy)

So anyway, I unzip and go right down to business. 

30 seconds pass, the friend who's two urinals away now finish so he goes to wash his hands.

45 seconds, one of my other friends in the cubicles come out to wash his hands.

One minute pass, another friend exits his cubicle, followed by my other friend who was in the last cubicle at around the 1 minute 25 second mark.

I'm still peeing.

2 minutes, friends are getting impatient. But they're still standing around the sinks after washing and drying their hands, all giving me weird looks, no eye contact was made, I just felt like they were staring daggers at me.

3 damn minutes. One of my friends stand like a couple of meters behind me to check if I was still peeing, surprise surprise, yes I was.

People start coming in, suddenly the toilet gets busy. This includes some of my classmates and for some reason my co-worker from my part time job (I should say ex-co worker because I have recently been transferred to another outlet closer to my house).

People come in, do their stuff and leave. Except for my classmates and the co-worker, pretty much all the guys in my class are watching me piss now after one of my friends tell them ""He's been pissing for 4 and a half minutes""

5 minutes now.

Same friend stands behind me with his hands on his hips and says 

""Dude, you've been pissing for the longest time I've seen, literally no one has pissed this long before""

""Must be a world record"" another friend says, along with laughter among them.

""Guys, I really don't know, what's going on here?"" I say to them.

""We don't know either, if you're not done pissing in like a minute, we're leaving to get help"" friend with hand on his hips says, gesturing to the door.

""Well then give it a minute"" I replied, now trying to force pee quickly. The flow/stream (dude honestly wtf never thought I'll be describing the flow of piss in a dream, but anyway) increases.

I get impatient too, and I recall some people unbuckling their belts when they piss, ""Maybe that helps?"" I thought to myself.

So I did that, I wear one of those 'easy on easy off' belts that use a track with teeth and a locking mechanism, (Google 'Anson belt and buckle') so I get it off quite easily. The moment I do this, the pee stream increases and then stops completely after pushing hard for 2 seconds or so.

If it might be useful, the colour of the stream was yellowish, almost unhealthy yellow when I was unzipped, and when I unbuckled it became transparent, almost only slightly pee coloured.

When they finally stop hearing the sound of pee hitting porcelain, followed by the sound of me zipping up, my classmates cheered. Literally like world cup last minute winning goal cheer.

I just quietly say thanks sarcastically and wash my hands before leaving the toilet.

Woke up right after that.

And no I didn't pee in real life, which was a relief.


TL;DR: Went to pee in a not so busy toilet with my friends after a long bus ride, ended up peeing longer than 5 minutes to the point that the toilet becomes busy with my classmates and most of them watched me pee to see the end of it happen. When it does, they all cheer. (I really recommend you reading it, it's really weird)

9k2tu7,3338,2018-09-29,"Ford's ""second door for claustrophobia"" line is bullshit. The second door was for an illegal apartment they built in 2007, 5 years BEFORE she claims she saw her therapist about it. Yeah just a little white lie, but under oath.",Its2015bro,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9k2tu7/fords_second_door_for_claustrophobia_line_is/,"They added the second door because they added an APARTMENT.  No surprise there, but that apartment is illegal in palo alto.  Presumably, when neighbors asked about this second door, she and her husband tell people she is claustrophic.  Yes, it's just a little white lie to dodge building codes, but you don't lie about ANYTHING under oath.  They were not ""hosting google interns"", they built an apartment.  Now I will present my research.

I can't post their address, but their zone is ""R-1 (7000) (S)"".  https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/8784

The residential zone codes are here  https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/8694 but here's the important part: https://imgur.com/a/tzr6fXO .  It clearly states a minimum lot size for adding a second dwelling is 9450 square feet.  Their lot size is 7000 sqft according to redfin.

Their 2007 permit is for a 735 sqft addition and remodel including adding a bedroom and bathroom.  Not an apartment.   Thus, they had ALREADY decided to add that door in 2007, but they went to couples therapy in 2012.  Kindof a long time to be fighting over a front door they decided to add in 2007, right?  5 years of arguing over a door they already built?  The logical explanation is she wanted a paper trail if the City of Palo Alto ever came after her.  Being a ""psychologist"" (she's not), this was probably her idea.  Motive and means established.

Another clue is the second door was for ""claustrophobia"" but now ""uses the second door to host google interns and students"" (paraphrased).  This clue is important because of WHO they ""host"".  By targeting these renters, can avoid listing their apt on craigslist and instead use internal mailing lists, avoiding detection from the City.  She was VERY stupid to include this detail.

How does this factor into the situation?  It certainly calls her credibility into question *as well as her husband's*.  If she can go in front of congress and repeat some bullshit they used to dodge building codes, not only is that perjury (a ridiculously dumb one at that) but it means she can lie without any trouble.  For instance, at 55:00 in this video: where she talks to feinstein with a cutesy voice about the front door. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ7ovA37u-0  *I don't blame them for building the illegal apartment*, not at all, but DO NOT take your little white lie to congress and the entire fucking country.

""My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh.""  (we can safely throw this out because he participated in her lies, also I don't think she provided the therapist notes)

""KLOBUCHAR: Yes. Right.

FORD: I just happen to have it in my record twice. So the first time is in 2012 with my husband in couples therapy with the quibbling over the remodel, and then in 2013 with my individual therapist."" (a little strange she knows precisely when the record is, alright, but she ALSO said ""therapists don't write every detail down"" or something.  How would she KNOW it's in her record if they don't write everything down?  Nothing damning here but fits my re-creation of events)

Apologies for not summarizing better, but it's a huge amount of info and wanted to include all the relevant research quickly, so perhaps the FBI can investigate her.  I'm not very familiar with building codes, but I do know rents are insane and people do tricks like this, because it's california.

Anyway, she needs to go back to congress, heck get FBI to arrest her before she flees.  Bring her husband too.  I wanted to believe her story, maybe it was some other guy or something.  It's not a comfortable feeling to know someone can lie straight to your face, and one would rather believe them.  However, I believe this is undeniable proof.  Her entire testimony should be thrown out and she should go to jail for perjury.

Here's the full testimony transcript as well if you would like to search.

I've been thinking for a while about how to write this prompt, and I wanted to get it out there to see if I can connect with someone on it! I'm worried this will end up being too specific/exclusive for many people, so read the last paragraph if you feel that way!

If you read my post history, you'll see that I'm from Washington, DC. I'm really proud to call such a transient city home, and going to college this close to where I grew up was a great decision. Today, I want to find someone to write a story with who can help me make this amazing town a character, somewhere that feels as real as it is to me every day. I'm hoping to use specific places as settings, and have our characters behave like locals here do.

Because I'm so dedicated to the setting of the story, the plot is something I'm still undecided on. Are we lobbying interns meeting at our bosses' cocktail hour at the Watergate? Are you my intern coordinator, taking me to Eastern Market to socialize after work? Are we long-suffering Nats fans meeting at an open air bar before a game? Maybe you have another idea completely! I'm open to a lot of ideas, as long as we can set them somewhere that feels authentic to DC. We'll definitely discuss our plot and content before we start off.

If you feel like this is too detailed about a place you've never been, no worries! **I'd love to talk about any DPP prompt I've posted before.** Either way, send me a couple options for what you want me to look like so I know you read my whole prompt! Hope to hear from you!"

However, as one might guess such a lifestyle caused me to be underdeveloped in a lot of ways. I became somewhat fat, very lazy, and probably a lot dumber? I study Math at my university but as someone might guess my GPA is far from great (I'm talking about &lt;2.0)...  


I got my real wake up call when my girlfriend threatened to leave me because she didn't see me as someone who would be able to hold a stable job in the future. I think what had happened is I became a shell person, there is literally nothing inside me, I have a few skills but other than that I have no hobbies, and nothing to really look forward to, somewhat useless to society. This was 9 months ago.  


Don't be like me. Don't fuck up.  


I'm doing a lot better now, I've begun to take care of myself, focus a lot more on my studies and eat better. I managed to find a better place and score an internship for next summer.

There have been too many instances where I felt like I am just not...respected? Especially compared to my cubicle mate, who is also a female RCG who started around the same time I did. We are both on the same team, but I just get the feeling that our lead takes her work, suggestions, and statements more seriously than mine. 

For example, there are times when I will update him on the status of something I am working on, and he will just give me a very...dismissive ""ok, thanks for the update"", while with her, I can see that he intently listens to the things that he is saying and actually takes what she says seriously. Also, one time I was taking more time than I needed to finish a task, and he asked my office mate to help me with it, which my she and I found pretty offensive (on behalf of me), because it was such an easy task.

I am not sure what it is...I have done a lot of things that geniunely made life easier for the team, and I can objectively see that me and that cubicle mate makes the same amount of progress that I do. But for some reason she gets more respect than I do? 

It has been really making me upset lately, and I am not sure what I am doing wrong? This is not the first time this has happened either; at my last internship, my mentor spoke to me in a really condescending manner...im front of everyone numerous times, and I always just took it (which I really regret). What am I doing wrong? Should I stick it out (seeing it has only been 3 months), or what? This project I am working on will finishin 2 weeks...

And what I really feel upset about is how alone I feel here. My cubicle mate has work friends, and they all just seem to...exclude me? So I habe no one I can go to either and be like, ""Hey, I am going through this...what do I do?"" "

9k5vbf,18,2018-09-30,"Greetings everyone. It’s Sunday, hope you’re all doing well. There’s a few things I’d like to say.",MarcoMaroon,CSULB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULB/comments/9k5vbf/greetings_everyone_its_sunday_hope_youre_all/,"Hello everyone,

I’d like to start right off the bat by mentioning that this will be a lengthy post and by thanking /u/azizus1 for doing the Sunday posts I started a while back. I had been unable to continue doing them given that I’d become very busy in the springtime and had an internship over the summer and have just been very busy all around. 

It was my intention to make a weekly post in which people would just chime in - if you want - to talk about how you’re doing for the week.  As some of you may know, I’m an advocate of mental health and pursue healthy ways of dealing with stress and relief. 


I’d like to address the recent trend over the last week of meme posts. I’d also like to reiterate that we do not limit discussions about our school or topics relating to our school - that being said we are also not a meme subreddit. 

Humor relevant to our school isn’t the issue, but constant meme posts that serve no purpose other than to mock the already heavily-complained topic of the removal of Prospector Pete are just low hanging fruit that do nothing for the topic or its discussion. 

Pete has been essentially retired since 2014 as school teams have gone as *Beach Athletics* without the use of Pete since then, so it’s a horse that’s been beaten quite heavily. 

Another relevant issue is the fact that these meme posts receive a lot of up-voting over other student posts that could be getting more attention - which seems a bit unfair to your fellow classmates that could benefit from you answering them. 

I want to stress that our sub is more of a hub of information and discussion about our school. It is why more things were added to our sidebar. It is why the FAQ thread was created. If you’d only like to do memes, then you have a few options:

1) **You can start a chatroom on our sub**. Whether on mobile or desktop, that’s been a new feature on Reddit for quite some time. 

2) **You can join our discord**. If you’re familiar with the platform you know we have multiple channels on there for a variety of things, some being particularly memes. Our discord link is stickied and also on our sidebar. 

3) **You can go to other meme subreddits**. This isn’t to say I’m against memes. Once again, relevant school humor is fine. Just an onslaught of these posts that add nothing to the discussion serve no purpose. And if all you want is memes, there’s other communities just for that. 

Someone had mentioned in a previous post that we create a CSULB subreddit just for memes. I have nothing against that idea - but I am not going to create a subreddit just for CSULB memes. Nor do I believe our other mods will as well. If any one of you want to do that, all the power to you. I already mod multiple communities and have my own priorities as well. Creating another community from scratch about memes I’m not particularly interested in is not something that I would even have time for. 

Our community is a really chill one. And I am proud of that. 


**If you came here to share something because it’s the Sunday post, then please go ahead by all means.**

I want to let you all know that I hope you have a wonderful day. If you have any suggestions about things that should go in our sidebar, any information pertinent to you all, then do not hesitate to message us mods.

I know sometimes we do not immediately respond - we do have lives outside of Reddit and while we do try to respond, we sometimes can’t immediately do so for one reason or another. 

If you’d like to see some sort of weekly threads or have an idea for something, please comment or vote accordingly. 

Once again I hope you’re all doing well and have a great Sunday. (:

**Edit**

Just a reminder while I remember this, **October 7th** will have the Long Beach marathon come around the school. 

So if you want to come to library that day or any part of school, please plan accordingly as traffic will definitely get backed up in multiple areas. 

A **Chat room** for our sub has been created. Join if you’d like. "
9k66gn,9,2018-09-30,"Hitting bottom non stop, not sure how to recover from this...",xyno19,problemgambling,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/9k66gn/hitting_bottom_non_stop_not_sure_how_to_recover/,"Before I get into my story, I realise that gambling might not be my biggest issue, however I would still like to discuss how its destroyed my life in the past 4-5 years. I apologise for the lengthy paragraphs, as I know no one gives a fuck, but I need to vent about this somewhere otherwise I will end up going mad. I realize that gambling is a just a symptom for a much bigger issue residing inside of me, that I just do not know how to fix. Everything I have tried has failed, its been 3 years now and I am still failing over and over. I think about suicide.... maybe not daily but at least 5 times a week that dark thought pops up in my head, and this is going to sound scary, but I've gotten used to it. Just standing in front of a traffic light, waiting for it to turn green... sometimes stupid thoughts like this one just pop up in my head ""kill yourself now, jump in front of a bus, save a lifetime of bs and suffering"".

&amp;#x200B;

To an outsider looking in... my life might seem not that bad. Sure, I've had to struggle, but then again, most of us have suffered, so in that regard there is nothing special about me. I guess my troubles began back when I started my university education. It never felt like the career I chose was as prospective and realistic, and to this day I am still unemployed with no job, no hope.. nothing really. Its ironic because I majored in IT and Management, which according to so many people is the best thing to study for a job in our current digital age. Finally, I hate the country that I've chosen to move to for my education and it is perhaps one of my deepest regrets to this day.. I really should not have moved to the UK (London) . This doesn't mean that I love the country where I came from, but I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this is depressing because I have two prestigious degrees from universities that are ranked top 10 in the world, but no one will hire me. I have gone to 100s of interviews, done those aptitude tests and tasks. It seems like whenever I end up going in for a personal interview, something about me makes them never contact me again (I'm starting to think I am retarded, must look weird to people..). Otherwise why is it that everyone in my life, even the god damn weirdos have jobs! While I am sitting here, typing this up while ripping my last hairs out wondering what is wrong with me. The more time flows, the more difficult it is for me to even be considered for any ""beginner"" job positions or internships as I've now crossed into the ""mature"" applicant category, and no one wants to hire a 25+ loser who has a malfunctioning brain in his head. Believe me, I have tried. I've even applied for UNPAID jobs, and even there I got rejected. Thats how bad it is, people don't even want me to work for them FOR FREE.

&amp;#x200B;

This has greatly affected my self confidence and ability to even imagine myself in any sort of... lets just say ""balanced lifestyle"". There is nothing I can do but move on, and imagine that ehh maybe its not me and its them, but after 100s of cases like this I'm starting to think that people just dislike me and think of me very badly. I don't look bad, some might even say I'm ""attractive"" but that again depends greatly on your taste. I am 26, even though I look like I am 18-19. I realize that one day this might play in my favour, as I will remain looking slightly younger for longer, but at the same time this also means that whenever I go anywhere to meet people who are my age or older I am shunned and laughed at behind my back because I look like a freaking boy. I know people who are much dumber than me, who get much more respect based on just the fact that they look older and wiser...

&amp;#x200B;

My living situation? I stay at my gfs parents place, they let me live in the room rent free (which is great) but again, it is not good for my mental health as... it just doesn't feel right. Again, I cant do much about this situation, as even if I got a job cleaning toilets or flipping burgers at local McDonald's (who's to say they would even hire me) I would still be unable to pay for rent in this extortionate city I live in. My own parents are baffled by my situation and can't even understand how I've sunk so low. My own brother thinks I'm a retard and avoids talking to me or even treating me like a normal human being. I have deleted all my social media, facebook and instagram (properly deleted, not deactivated). This means that I have lost all 800+ people on my friends list, but I don't really feel sad about it. Yeah, some photos of me and my ex from happier times, random good memories all lost forever, but I just felt like a new beginning would be nice for me. I fantasize constantly about killing this person that I am right now, and starting a new, almost like a fresh save file in a video game. I know how ridiculous this sounds.... The only social profile I keep active at the moment is linkedin, and even that I was planning on deleting as soon as I get my final rejections from the jobs I've applied for. There is no point for me to keep these active as I just do not talk to anyone, and I do not want to talk to anyone at the moment as I just feel like a weak pointless human being.

When it comes to gambling.. I had my bouts of luck once in a while, but otherwise I've just lost everything down to pretty much 0. Just counting up, last year I lost around 17k, the year before that 9k, the year before that 4k. This year I have added to that loss around 15k more or so. Inbetween each massive pattern of loss I have tried to quit, but due to my issues have crawled back and lost even more. Gambling has made everything.. much worse than it is. Not only have I lost my security, but I have also made myself feel like a neverding loser. It was a great escape for when I was feeling dwn and was winning, but now... its just loss after loss after loss after loss. Sometimes it feels like I wake up just to suffer through the day doing pointless tasks... P.S. I am that idiot who buys lottery tickets and scratchcards whenever I'm low on cash hoping for that ""big win"" when in reality... I know the odds are so ridiculous that even if I bought tickets for the rest of my life I would still never win anything.

&amp;#x200B;

All i do nowadays is go to gym and try to starve myself to lose excess fat, since I've decided to at least solve one of my self confidence issues. I'm not a drinker (I avoid going out or drinking, and tbh don't even have any friends to do this with anyways). I acknowledge that I have smoked bit too much weed over the years, and this could be a very big reason as to why I am failing at everything too, but I do not want to blame all of my issues on a plant, when in the end it is me who's made all the moronic decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to do, my final option would be to just move back home and beg to work for my dad (which honestly I dread doing as that would mean I have 100% given up on everything and was unable to do anything myself). Thankfully, I haven't experienced full on homelessness yet, but at this point if I continue down this path I feel like that day might come very soon.... Again, apologies for the long rant. Hopefully this wasn't a boring read, would love to hear others experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

Editing this post to say that I do have things in my life that I love doing.. one of them is music (I have a strong musical background, have been producing for many years now and have done some very promising tunes), but sadly this hobby doesn't offer me much in terms of monetary gain or security.... I would love to make tracks all day, but sadly have been unable to focus much on it due to my other overarching problems..."
9k6cpu,0,2018-09-30,The biggest frustration in BfA (and why this game will die within the next two years),Alianos,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9k6cpu/the_biggest_frustration_in_bfa_and_why_this_game/," 

\*“WoW will die!”, “Lol WoW was dead since BC”, “Lol you played BC? Vanilla was best, game is dead since”, “anal \[Dirge\] xdd”\*  
The death of World of Warcraft has been prophesied since it was launched. I’d bet even in the beta, people would argue that this game was going to die before it came out. Yet, it didn’t. The Expansions came and went and even though the Sub numbers dropped, it survived. I was one of the people who laughed at those Doomsayers. “Just don’t play the game then.” was my usual response. I always believed that negativity would never change anything and I still believe that. 

Then BfA came out. I am not going to repeat the issues people have with the game right now. They are substantiated and every player can feel them, from the ultra-casual to the ultra-hardcore. But we had issues before, every expansion had their parts where the playerbase was in uproar. I can still remember endless whining that Legendaries were the worst, that Artifacts were the worst, that AP was the worst. Why is BfA different? Why can’t I be the one anymore that laughs at the constant posts made on the forums? 

&amp;#x200B;

Because Blizzard doesn’t listen anymore. Worse, if they are listening, they are ignoring us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Blizzard, and I don’t know the reason, has become immune to critique. All the issues that are becoming so apparent now, have been documented for months, have been reported by the beta testers and Blizzard only ever doubled down on their ways. My old quote  “Just don’t play the game then.” just doesn’t work anymore. If everyone who was annoyed at the game stopped right now, there would be no game to return to anymore and I don’t want that. 

So here I am going to lay out why, if Blizzard doesn’t drastically change their approach to this game in the very near future, WoW is going to die. 

First of all though, why are they not listening anymore? Only Blizzard really knows, since they haven’t told us anything, but I think there are reasons. 

Just look at Youtubers like HeelVsBabyface, a guy that I think many of us have encountered over the years. In my opinion, he is the personification of the angry forum nerds. He has been ripping into the game for years now, he stopped in Legion, but now he’s back with a vengeance. If you watch the man, you’d think WoW is the worst game in history. “WARFRONTS are a Massive Dumpster Fire !!”, “BLIZZARD what are you DOING !!!???“, “Why does Blizzard Struggle to Tell Good Stories?”, BLIZZARD hit the PANIC BUTTON !!”, “The Open World is under threat from BLIZZARD !!” are just the most recent titles of his Channel concerning Blizzard. I’d like to say that these are only clickbait, but they’re not. He just rips into the game, does not offer any kind of constructive criticism and reaches a huge audience with it. 

Do I think he is responsible why Blizzard ignores us? No. Not solely. But when you’ve listened to a vocal minority for years and you rightly realize that they are idiots, maybe you just stop listening. What you’ve done so far might’ve not always been good, but millions of players still played and had a good time. So just keep doing that. If you worked 20 years in a job, would you listen to the new intern who constantly just tells you how shit you are at what you are doing? Probably not.   
Blizzard probably expects all of us to be this vocal minority now. Just tearing into the game they spent a good part of their life making. 

The Q&amp;A streams they have are a prime example of that. They never cover any issue the community is actually concerned about. Is this intentional? Maybe, but maybe not. Maybe they have just become so immune to bad criticism that they cannot see real, constructive criticism anymore. This subreddit regularly offer alternatives, different approaches and yet, silence. 

This is the most frustrating part of BfA. Not Azerite Armor, not Rep Grinds, not badly tuned M+ affixes, but the fact that Blizzard has become this entity, that you can not talk to, that you can’t make suggestions to, that does not offer logical reasons for their actions. All we can do is observe and hope for things to get better. 

This is not how you hold a community. This is not how you retain sub numbers. But in the end, maybe Blizzard just doesn’t realize, maybe they have created a bubble that they cannot look outside anymore. I always thought “Surely they must watch Youtubers and what they have to say.” but maybe they just don’t anymore. Maybe they just watch Taliesin and Evitel, who are masters in defending them and think “This is now the public opinion.” 

Maybe I am completely wrong, maybe I am just making this up, but there is also no evidence against it. Blizzard will not read this post. I could print it out and send it to Anaheim and they’d probably just throw it in a bin. 

We don’t know. But if they continue like this, the game I love, that we all love, will die.

9k6daq,6,2018-09-30,My [24M HL] girlfriend [23F LL] of 3.5 years suggested I should seek 'fulfillment' elsewhere,TellMeHowToReddit,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/9k6daq/my_24m_hl_girlfriend_23f_ll_of_35_years_suggested/,"When we started dating, we had been friends for quite a while and when we finally got together: it was a dream come true. Starting out with a deep trust and appreciation of one another is something I'd always wanted. This was three years ago, and the start of my first actual relationship. Even though I'd had girls be interested in me, this is the first time I'd felt in a good enough place emotionally, ""compatible"" enough, and in stable enough living conditions to go for it.  

When it came to intimacy, I honored her wishes that everything advance at her pace. Not that I would have felt comfortable ""pushing"" her in the first place. I made it clear that I had no expectations, so, most of the time, it was her pushing the boundaries. On days when she took erotic/asthaetic pictures of herself to post online she was especially enthusiastic about pushing for more, sometimes even making me drop what I'm doing and saying that she needed me right then. Having been a virgin before her, and to be honest, sort of repressed, it really helped me acknowledge myself as a sexual person, that it's okay to have sexual desires.

One persistent issue was penetrative intercourse, which is painful for her. Over the three year period that we've been together, we've only tried it a handful of times. Not having it is not really an issue for me, but I suggested that she could ask her obgyn about it, to which she replied that she's never seen one. And that she doesn't intend to see one ever. Since I'm not a woman myself, I'm not quite sure how big of a deal is, but it did concern me.  

After some time we decided to move in together, putting an end to us only being able to meet on weekends. Not out of nowhere, mind you. We'd been living together for 6 weeks before as she had an internship in my city. 
This, however, led to a gradual decline in our sex life. At first, it showed as her not initating much anymore. I try to pick it up, perhaps sometimes too persistently. Then she gets herself a toy. A week in between sex turns into two, which turns into months. Eventually, trying to initiate just makes her depressed, angry or grossed out. Talking about it proves difficult as well, as even that was has the same effect. She says she's just not a sexual person, that she's always felt uncomfortable with anything sexual.  
  
I felt like a rug had been pulled from under me. I felt sick to my stomach. Like I'd been a rapist all this time; And simultaneously like I'm not ""good"" enough.
Afterwards she made it clear that it was always consensual, but that I shouldn't try to initiate anything anymore. She wouldn't either.
Trying to talk about it after that mostly lead to us both getting pissed off or in tears, but also sometimes in sex, which is the most confusing part about the entire ordeal.  

Basically anything I express that's of sexual nature is making her uncomfortable. Talking about her fantasies or why she's not attracted to me is a no-go too.
At this point any hint of me having a libido or any suggestion such as using weShouldTryIt or going to couples counselling will just make her sad or annoyed.
Even though we're still very much in love in every other aspect, even non-sexual physical closeness, it's taking a toll on the relationship. She thinks that she's ""ruining me"" and I'm thinking that I'm not good enough or that she'll eventually find someone else she's more compatible with and will drop me.  

Recently, she's been saying that I should just find someone else to fulfill my desires. Not just once, multiple times.  

This devastated me. Makes me feel like she just said ""You will never be good enough"". And even if I remotely considered it a possibility, I don't think I could go through with it.
I also believe that she wouldn't be able to deal with it either: She had a dream where I did just that, leaving her distraught when she woke up. She insists that it was because she ""didn't like the girl"".  

I feel so lost right now, like I don't know anything and that I'm misinterpreting everything, all the time. I'm struggling with my self-worth and am plagued by thoughts about how this makes me an egotistical, sex-obsessed nightmare of a boyfriend.
Worst of it all, I don't have anyone to talk to IRL.  

I'm at my wits' end and don't know how to frame the issue in a way that's conducive to real discussion. Any advice on how to approach the issue more delicately? How to talk about it in a way that's less uncomfortable? Or should I just infer she's asexual or simply not attracted to me and drop the issue?

***

tl;dr: After moving in together, sex life slowly ground to a halt, especially since she got a toy. She says she's not a sexual person and that I should find someone else for it. Discussing anything sexual makes her uncomfortable. How do I constructively approach the issue?"
9k6f4r,2,2018-09-30,After 8 years she decides she doesn’t love me any longer,Bardocklives,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9k6f4r/after_8_years_she_decides_she_doesnt_love_me_any/,"Well I guess I’m writing this to vent a little.  I apologize if this is all over the place. This has been hard on me.  We have been together for 8 years and a couple of weeks ago she told me she loves me but not in love with me, that classic line. 

A little background. I’m a 40 year old guy, she is 30 years old.  We met online with MySpace yes MySpace. She lived in a different state at the time and she moved down to be with me after we first. I was a good looking guy when I was younger. I’m going to be honest I’m about 120 pounds over weight and pretty much all I eat is junk food. Nothing never healthy. I do have a membership to planet fitness but I hardly go.  During the break up she texted my that she doesn’t want to worry about my health any longer. 

At the present moment we still live together.  We have a lease the ends in January, however I will move out next month because honestly its hard to see her and what we had. Yes , I still love her with all of my heart. 

I go over in my head only if I had done things differently.  She had always told me if we didn’t get married she would leave me.   I always laughed at that and said no you won’t.  Yes I would love to marry her even now but honestly I never married her because technically I was still married to my ex.  Well me and my ex had both moved on, she had a new family but our problem was we I guess we’re both lazy and never filled out the paperwork.   I always told my girlfriend I don’t feel like I’m married and honestly I didn’t feel like I was, I wasn’t in my heart.  She always said it doesn’t matter what you feel it’s what’s on paper. In retrospect I should have listened to her.  If I had married her when I could have would she have stayed with me? Damn. 

We moved around a little in the same state following her college and her dream of what she wanted to do.  I didn’t mind I could always find a job in the field in what I do.  But here is where things get complicated I guess.  About a year ago she found a internship in a different state, so we moved. She ended up getting employed there in about 3 months. 

She loves her job, however on my part I couldn’t find a good job and the jobs I did find paid a lot less of what we were used too.  Because of this my credit is horrible now and my paychecks are basically covering my car and my half of rent.  The reason I bring this up, is this reason why she doesn’t love me any longer because I can’t provide or maybe it was the cause that tipped everything over. I don’t know. 

Again this is for me to vent. She sleeps on the couch now and I’m sleeping alone in the bed. This is what kind of hurts me the most. I miss waking up and seeing her next to me asleep and her hair all wild and everywhere    That would put a smile on my face.  Hell, I’m getting all teary eyed now writing this.

I’m 40, honestly I don’t feel my age.  Not at all.  I like watching anime playing ps4 games when I can.  I do like staying at home. Another issues maybe she likes to be active go out, go to the beach.  I like the beach but I don’t swim.  Another comment she mentioned in the break up, I won’t do 50 percent of the things she wants to.  I don’t swim so I can’t go scuba diving or go jet skiing. 

What caused all of this?  All of the sudden and this is coming out, she recently turned 30. Is this a tipping point for ladies?  It’s going to be hard for me to start over , I think is this why I don’t want her to go.  But in my heart I love her not because it’s convenient "

9k7js3,101,2018-09-30,[Wedding Invitation],paulattema,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/9k7js3/wedding_invitation/,"Dear Dr. Jordan Peterson, 

Before you became an online sensation, I was a high-school boy with a history of depression listening to hours of your lectures on religion during study hall. I didn't have a hard life. My family was middle-class, I was in private school, and my teachers said I had a lot of ""potential,"" whatever that meant. 

My depression started early on, in 5th grade. My memory of its origin is foggy. I just remember it grabbing me and not letting go. For a whole year, I felt mostly shallow emotions. The only deep emotions I felt were anxiety and a certainty that this was life for the next 70 years. I was never suicidal. I never thought of that as a solution. The only thing I was determined to do was to stay alive, miserable as I was, and put on a fake smile for my family until my life came to a natural end. This was a hard place to be at a young age. This spell of depression left as mysteriously as it came. I just felt like the whole atmosphere around had changed, and had become tolerable again. Through this whole phase of life, I had a strong faith that guided me. I never doubted and had kept reading the Bible through the ordeal. This was about to change. 

From 7th to 9th Grade, I went from slightly doubting aspects of religion, to secretly denouncing my faith all together. I was hurting and this time it was worse. I had nothing to cling to during this battle. The ground itself was possibly unstable. 

I continued this way throughout most of high school. I didn't let anybody know, eventually telling my best friend. He told his mom and she started questioning whether we should continue to hang out as much. This was hard. I was a high school boy without a god, without many friends, and without a girlfriend, which I thought was the most important. 

Senior year, things changed. I started working at a local gas station. I started saving. I started being recognized at work. I felt like my life had some stability to it. During that Winter the store was being remodeled. It closed and I worked at a different Casey's on the weekends and at the Iowa House of Representatives on the weekdays as an intern until spring. During this time, something happened. I had a manager named Rachael at the old store, four years older than myself, mature (emotionally, physically, and spiritually), and very choosy when it came to men. Unknown to me, she had been praying for the right man to come along. She kept herself pure and waited. During the 3 month remodel. My crush for her began to develop, until I became more and more certain that I wanted to pursue her. 

The only problem was that she viewed me as a child. She saw that I was hard-working, yes, but I was loud, obnoxious at times, and very reserved when it came to sensitive topics. I didn't open up to people and used humor as a guise. I had been through some hard shit, but I wasn't about to tell anybody that. 

That's where you come in. Months before I started liking her, I started pursuing religion again. Pure rationalism never led to anything of value and I recognized that. I still don't have all the questions about how religion relates to science, but I understand that there must be a balance. Anyway, I started listening to your lectures and learning more about your perspective. I found your views more palatable than those expressed by hard-line fundamentalists. I found it easier to begin with the basics and work my way up from there, instead of accepting everything hook, line and sinker without any consideration. 

Somewhere in the middle of all this, I read 12 Rules for Life. It fit perfectly with your other videos, and helped me progress forward. I started by telling her that she was beautiful. I invited her to my graduation party, she went, then received one of the most heart-felt thank-you cards ever written. She invited me to her church's ""tent revival."" I went and walked her home afterwards. Unknown to me, she had always dreamed that she would meet her future husband under the tent and that he would walk her home. However, she was still unsure. She didn't know what I was looking for. I was a high school boy for goodness sake. I brought her flowers that I had picked and arranged myself. I talked to her every chance I had, and started flirting with her at work. She still had questions. She actually talked to another guy for a week during this, not believing that I was what she needed. I still had a silly side, I controlled it more. I became more sincere. I had always been honest, but now people started believing me. 

During this time, I was preparing to move 1.5 hours away for college. During orientation, I felt lonely. I felt empty. I felt depressed. I had bought a house with the money I saved from work. I was nervous. How was I going to find roommates in time? Should I go for Political Science or something else? Why am I here? Is there a God? My conclusion: there has to be a God if there is to be meaning at all. Nothing in this present world is stable. Not relationships. Not school. Not work. Not Family. Not life. Through this period of sadness, I read your book. It took my mind off of the present trouble, and also gave me some long term solutions. 

I texted Rachael during orientation. I complimented her. She didn't know how I was feeling. Your book helped me man up. It convinced me that I shouldn't leave my hometown without at least getting an answer from Rachael. I pushed on. I answered her questions. I showed her my more genuine side. She said yes and we started dating. We were a perfect match. We're getting married now. On September 28 of 2019. Its in Iowa and I know you are busy. This invitation is more symbolic than anything. You had such an impact on me and made me accept responsibility. It wouldn't be right if you weren't thanked for that. 

Sincerely, 

Paul Attema

9k8ww5,82,2018-09-30,How I went from 161 to 175,lsat716,LSAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/9k8ww5/how_i_went_from_161_to_175/,"Hi everyone! Someone asked me yesterday if I could detail the ways in which I was able to improve my score by 14 points, so I thought I would write out the gist of my study plan. I'm not sure if this will help anyone (and I'm still pretty fuzzy on how exactly I got the score I did/my heart hasn't stopped pounding since 8 am yesterday) but I figured I have gained so much from this subreddit that I wanted to be able to give back whatever I could :)

**Score Progression:** I took my diagnostic on May 31, when my Testmasters course's online access opened. It was PT 62 and I got a 161 (20/27 RC, 16/23 LG, and then 15/26 on one LR and 23/26 on the other). The way the class was set up required that I complete several (I think 7?) lessons and the accompanying homework in order to take the second practice test, so it was about 3 weeks until I took my second test. I think having that time to learn how to diagram logic games and learning that I actually needed to read the question stems was really beneficial, especially because I wasn't doing practice tests at the same time. It put the focus entirely on drilling questions and not on scores on timed sections or full tests. Because of that, my score went up to a 170 on my second test (PT 63). I took 14 full tests over the course of the summer and beginning of the school year. During the latter half of the summer, I took one practice test per week (on the weekend) because since I had extended time (I have narcolepsy), it was basically impossible to come home from working full time and take a 5-section 1.5x test. This was my progression from test to test: 161 (PT 62), 170 (PT 63), 168 (PT 70), 170 (PT 73), 170 (PT 78), 168 (PT 80), 175 (PT 59 but this one was done in sections while I was moving into my dorm), 170 (PT 66), 172 (PT 67), 173 (PT 75), 173 (PT 76), 173 (PT 81), 168 (PT 82), 174 (PT 83). 

**Section Progression:** From the beginning, it was clear that my biggest problem was going to be Reading Comp. I had basically nailed down LG by my third practice test and was getting -0s on almost every test (although on sections with several substitution problems, sometimes that didn't work out). LR was slowly improving as well. My main problems in RC were main point questions and questions that required me to infer what the author's perspective on something were. I was also not great at the analogy questions where they ask you to apply the reasoning from the passage to a different example. By the time I took the test, I was getting around -4 on RC, -1/-3 on LR, and -0 on LG.

**Materials I used to study:** Testmasters Online Course, Powerscore Logical Reasoning Bible

**Testmasters Course:** I really enjoyed this class and felt that I learned a lot. One thing I really appreciated was the structure. I don't think self-study would have worked for me because on huge endeavors like this, it can be really difficult for me to figure out where to begin, and having the guidance through the whole process was helpful. For example, I see a lot of people trying to figure out which PT to use as a diagnostic and which PTs to save for later or if there is a recommended order and that was all figured out for me. The order in which I listed the PTs before were the order in which they were presented to me, and while I could have gone out of order for any of the PTs after the 6th one (the first 6 are set in stone), I trusted that they placed them in the order they did for a reason. Additionally, every PT had an experimental section already in a random slot in the order, and doing full 5-section tests where I didn't know which section was the experimental made it a lot more realistic. On top of that, there were hundreds of questions to drill by type for each homework assignment and having all of that available without having to go through old practice tests and do them section-by-section myself was immeasurably helpful. I really only had two problems with this class, the first being that there was a ton of focus on formal logic at the beginning (which I think is really important) but it was never quite made clear that there are only a few formal logic questions on each test whereas I thought every question was a formal logic question and got stuck trying to diagram every question as such. I wish that had been made more clear, but it's such a small thing that it didn't detract from the overall experience.  Additionally, having the question types categorized by number wasn't super intuitive for me because it required me to read a question stem, translate that to a number, think of the rules associated with that number, and then switch it back to actual applications. 

**Powerscore Logical Reasoning Bible:** I bought this because I was frustrated at the rate at which my Logical Reasoning scores were improving (also because I would have felt like a fraud if I didn't use a Bible at some point in my LSAT experience). I found the way in which questions were categorized a bit easier and a nice supplement to the Testmasters class because they actually explained what the question type was in the name (for example, a ""Strengthen"" question rather than a Type 2 Question). By the time I picked up this book, I was almost done with my studying, so I found it more of a refresher than instructional, but the method of drawing an arrow from stimulus to the answer choices or vice versa in order to signal whether the answer choices had to be based off information in the stimulus or could contribute new information was really helpful. 

**Study Schedule:** For the first 2 weeks after my diagnostic, I did LSAT work full time, but once my internship started, I only worked about 3-4 hours a day. I did practice problems on the train in the morning, at Starbucks for an hour before work, and then again on the train ride home. I would also work after dinner if I wasn't asleep. Once I got to school, I took practice tests and sections every minute I wasn't in class, eating, sleeping, or in my occasional ""put me out of my misery"" scheduled friendship appointments. On the Saturday of the real test (I took it the following Friday), I took a PT (for my third day in a row) and dropped back into the 160s for my first time in a while. I figured I was burnt out and gave myself Sunday and Monday off and then got a 174 on Tuesday, which was a big confidence booster. I started taking PT 84 on Wednesday and scored my first two sections and they were the best they had been (a -1 on RC which was a miracle) so I just stopped taking the test and treated the first 2 sections as a confidence booster.

**Tips:** 

* Reading Comprehension
   * I read each passage twice, the first for understanding and the second for structure. It made it much easier to answer the questions and my scores dramatically improved once I started focusing on structure.
   * I also started drawing lines between each paragraph and summarizing what the author was trying to accomplish with each paragraph as I was reading (with a few words in each section). I got that from one of the threads on this subreddit and my scores instantly started to improve in RC.
   * At the end of my first read-through of the passage, I closed my eyes for a second and thought about what I remembered them talking about the most and what all of those things were meant to get across. This helped a lot with main point questions because otherwise, I would wind up digging myself into a deeper and deeper hole of reading through the choices and checking back with the passage and trying to evaluate which part of the argument was more important, etc.
* Logical Reasoning
   * PREPHRASING. For those who don't know, this means basically reading the stimulus, looking at the question stem, and trying to guess what the answer is before looking at the choices. This is by far one of the most useful things I learned throughout this study process.
* Logic Games
   * I drew my diagram once per game in really dark pencil with all of the global rules and then for each question (and new local rule) I just wrote new options to test them out in light pencil so I could easily erase in between each question. It saved a lot of time to only diagram everything once, and it ensured that if I accidentally tried to erase a global rule, the dark pencil made it much harder to do so without realizing.
   * The day I realized that the substituted rule can't overcorrect for the original rule was the day I started getting substitution questions correct. What I mean by that is even if an answer choice seems to work in locking the correct possibilities in place, it could still be wrong if it's too restrictive. Just because the original rule meant that A was in slot 1 and B was in slot 7 and the substituted rule also does that, it doesn't make it right if that new rule also locks C into slot 4.
* Overall
   * I found blind review wasn't helpful for me, so after scoring my test, I would write down the questions I got wrong (just the number) and go back through the test, stopping at each incorrect answer and writing out why each of the wrong answer choices was wrong and why the correct one was correct. I could usually figure this out by talking it through to myself which was also a good exercise in processing all of the information.
   * Give yourself breaks. Almost every time I took a few days off of drilling/taking PTs, my next PT score went up by several points. It is so easy to get burned out but taking breaks when I felt like I needed them allowed me a couple days to get excited about taking my next test and everyone performs better when they are excited to tackle the questions.
   * Be cognizant of how you're spending your time! Doing only LSAT stuff for months will make you hate the test so fun is important. I didn't drink (except for wine with dinner a few times) during my 4 months of studying and it really sucked but I had a much clearer mind and now I have such a low tolerance that I can spend less money on alcohol. Win-win situation.
   * Simulate test day conditions! I did a 5-section test with a 15 minute break for every one of my practice exams which built up my stamina. I used an online proctor (either the 7sage or TestMasters ones) and started using a watch 2 weeks before the exam on my PTs to make sure I could move the bezel fast enough and that I was prepared. A lot of people I know didn't use an official proctor while studying, using their iPhone timers instead, and many of them said that screwed them up and made it easier to get distracted.

That's all I have for now in the longest post of all time but feel free to ask questions or message me if you need anything! thank you all for everything and I wish everyone luck with their admissions process :)"
9k9l9b,2,2018-09-30,Question on the Lassonde Internship Program,hackmystack,yorku,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/9k9l9b/question_on_the_lassonde_internship_program/,"For the Lassonde Internship program, I know that you must have 9 credits left towards the Honours degree upon enrolling in the EECS 3900. Are they referring to the Cumulative Credits Taken or Cumulative Credits Passed in the transcript? I have more Cumulative Credits Passed than Cumulative Credits Taken since I earned some transfer credits when I transferred to York.

And does the “9 credits left towards the Honours degree”, mean that I should have max of 111 credits before enrolling in the EECS 3900, so that when I complete the 9 credits after internship, I would total to 120 credits on the dot? Or would it be alright to exceed 111 so as long as I do at least 9 credits and be on full time after the internship? Cause I won’t be graduating with 120 anyway since I need to take more courses just to satisfy my degree requirements hence exceeding that 120 credits (so I think I’ll reach 140 credits to the very least before graduating)."

&amp;#x200B;

So we have a problem, my Interns phone is an LGV10 and roughly about late Aug this year the GPS stopped.  

&amp;#x200B;

We keep getting error ""GPS Signal not found. (11)""

&amp;#x200B;

Things we have done and to keep in mind:

\-She hasn't ever spoofed or use a VPN (nor does she know how to or what it is)

\-Settings have been given permission to use location under all 3 settings of it being device, network and high proximity

\-App has been uninstalled and reinstalled 6 times (latest try was Sept 30) with no luck

\-GPS works in other apps such as Maps, online, etc.

\-Account works great on the iPad and such (we sign in within the same town so chances of it being hit for spoofing are 0)

\-Phone is up to date

\-Turned it into airplane mode and off 

\-WiFi is always on

\-And yes we tried turning it on and off again.  Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Has ANYONE ever had this problem with this phone cause all the other phones we all use (google pixel, iPhone 6-8, Galaxy S9, Moto G) are all fine.  We ruled out the GPS chip with Google maps working and allowing a location find via a website and it worked.  I already submitted a ticket to Niantic but yeah.  Any help would be great."
9k9zad,1,2018-09-30,Need advice on what to do for my future,RT_Frank,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9k9zad/need_advice_on_what_to_do_for_my_future/,"Some background info about me:

I am 23yo and graduated from college a little over a year ago. I decided to take a gap year before applying to various things. Since I was in Pre-Med I am currently applying to various medical professions such as MD (including accredited Caribbean schools), DO, and pharmacy.

However, I've never really cared about any of these professions. I've done pretty decent in school and have done lots of volunteering, shadowing, etc. but none of these piqued my interest in any of these fields. 

But during my gap year, I got a job at a technology-centered medicine company. I can't emphasize how much I love this job. Everything from the people, to the things I do, to the career. 

Unfortunately, it is a small company that is growing (as in they have made sales/contracts but the income is kinda low) and I'm not getting paid the best, only 15/hr currently (started as unpaid intern). It's kinda risky to put all my eggs in a growing company especially compared to med/pharm school, but I just don't feel right with those schools. 

Luckily, the company has been hiring and I am in very good terms with my boss and the owner of the company. But they know my plans to go to further schooling so they've always seen me as temporary. My current plan is to garner as many acceptances from these schools as I can to use as leverage to advance me in this job. Whether this means securing a high position or if it means letting me go part-time to get a Master's, I am not sure. 


What should I do? Should I keep my current plan and see where it leads? Should I forget about the company and just focus on advanced schooling? Or should I forget about the advanced schooling and focus on getting a Master's or license to help me advance in the company?"

I've been lurking this sub for awhile now, and the information on here has been a huge help to me as I've begun entering the workforce. I have an interview for an entry-level sales role at a tech startup tomorrow, and I was hoping to get some advice.

For background, I just graduated from UNC-CH where I studied Media and Journalism with a concentration in PR, political science, and a minor in business journalism. I have had a bunch of great internships throughout college but all were essentially marketing focused. I really enjoy marketing and initially was what I planned to go into, but after working this summer where I shadowed several sales reps and execs at a startup, I realized I like the goal-setting/gratification part of sales and I think I would flourish in a more competitive, challenging and fast-paced environment that it offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had two interviews so far with this company and they have gone well, but the guy I'm interviewing with tomorrow would potentially be my boss so I really want to make a good impression. I've ran into the question of why I am switching to sales-focused positions as opposed to marketing, and I would love some advice on how to effectively frame it. Additionally, when I'm nervous I can ramble and talk waaay too much, so tips on staying calm and collected would be great too :) The interview is via Skype.

9kagyo,7,2018-09-30,I went to Rwanda this summer.,NeoDuckLord,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/9kagyo/i_went_to_rwanda_this_summer/,"During the summer I was a volunteer for Challenges World wide as a business consultant in Rwanda. I had not done anything like this before so was unsure what it would be like. I really did not know anything about Rwanda before going there and like most people the only thing I did know about the country was there was genocide there. Having never done anything like this before I was also worried about staying with a host family and living with them for 10 weeks. I would not say I am a fussy eater but other people have said I am, so I was kind of concerned about the food as well.
There were 18 volunteers from the UK on the program and we were all partnered with an in country volunteer (ICV) to work with at a business. Each pair then spent the first half of the 10 weeks getting to know the business and drawing up an analysis which we then used to formulate a plan to help them grow. 

Some basic facts about Rwanda:


 It is located in Central East Africa, land locked and one of the smallest countries in Africa. The climate is temperate to subtropical and it has two rainy and two dry seasons a year. There are four official languages which are English, French, Kinyarwanda and Swahili. In terms of economy it is listed as 140 in terms of GDP and is heavily reliant on agriculture. Rwanda is sometimes called a Country of a Thousand Hills, because of all the hills. For more information please consult Wikipedia as I just did. 


Living in Kigali


Kigali is the capital of Rwanda and is located in the centre of the country. As the trip was primarily to work in businesses in the city, it is where I spent the majority of my time; I only left the city on 4 occasions. When arriving my first thoughts were of what a beautiful city it was, it was far more green than I had imagined and really clean. It was the rainy season when we arrived, even so the weather was nice most of the time, T-shirt and shorts nice, although the in country volunteers did not think that was necessary. When it did rain though, it really rained. There were quite a few lightning storms and if you were caught outside in the rain you got soaked in seconds. 


The city was also a lot safer than I expected. For the first few weeks it did help to have an in country volunteer to get around the city, but after a while I felt comfortable getting around by myself. Not a lot of people seemed to walk around a lot in the city which is how I mostly got around. Although the volunteers were not allowed to use them for safety reasons a lot of local used motorcycle taxis as a easy cheap way of getting around. These motorbike drivers were apparently drunk quite a lot and although all the ICV’s said they were perfectly safe and used them often we did see a lot of accidents whilst out there. I never saw I crash myself but others saw them crash into parked cars, hit by taxis and run down by buses, so they most probably were not the safest things ever. 


The buses in Kigali were not like they are in the UK. There is no schedule for a bus, they leave the station when they are full, completely full. This means that you can wait at a bus stop for half an hour without your bus coming and then 3 will come at once. There were two types of buses, one was just like a normal bus in this country, just way more packed, and the others were mini buses. All you needed to use the bus was a pass that you needed to keep topped up, when you found a bus with space it was a good way to get around and much cheaper than taxis.


From where I was staying the closest bus stop was a 30 minute walk. From there it could be up to a 20 minute  wait for a bus and then 15 minutes to the stop closest to the office of the business I was placed at which was a 5 minute walk. I did this trip for the first 2 days of my placement before being shown I could just walk 30 minutes the other way from my host home to get to the office. After a while and checking a map getting around the city was quite easy. It also felt very safe to walk around no matter what time of day. There were a lot of armed police around, normally standing in the shade as they apparently had long shifts. 


For 9 weeks I was placed with a host family in the Nyarutarama, which is a nice part of the city where a lot of the embassies are. Every UK volunteer was placed with an ICV and because the house I was staying in was big enough there was another pair as well. The family we stayed with was a mother, a daughter and three brothers. I think the dad worked for the UN and was away in Madagascar whilst we were there. The host mum did not speak much English but all the children who were aged mid teens to early twenties spoke good English as well as French and Kinyarwanda. 


When we first arrived they had some friends around, they were just sitting in the living room playing Fifa. The family was very friendly, welcoming and accommodating. I am vegetarian so they started adding vegetarian options for me at dinner. It was a nice place to live. They watched a lot of western tv and film so that was nice. They also watched a lot of Anime, too much Anime, and those shows are really repetitive. The location of the house, although a 30 minute walk to a bus stop, was quite central, so fairly close to everywhere in the city. A lot of other volunteers had a lot longer journeys to their businesses each day. We did have a curfew which was mostly stuck to, but our host family was very relaxed about enforcing it. This is also different from other volunteers’ experiences, some host families were really strict about when you could leave and had to get home by so I think I got quite lucky with that.


Food in Rwanda is one thing I did find very challenging. The Rwandan diet is very carb heavy, lots of rice and beans. A normal breakfast in the host home was sliced bread with butter, lunch was a buffet style meal with things like rice, chips, sweet potato, some green been carrot thing, beans…. and dinner was much the same. There was normally a meat dish as well. I was not a big fan of the food, maybe I am fussy; I did lose weight whilst in the country. The family were really nice and tried to add things for me such as tofu and they made me soup, I really appreciated this. Restaurant wise the city had some really nice places. 


Kigali Maintenance made Easy


The business I was placed with was Kigali Maintenance Made Easy (KMME), a small maintenance company that would come to your home or business and make an evaluation of the property. They would be able to give all the ways in which they could improve the business. 
The two owners were guys in their late twenties or early thirties. Both were very friendly and eager for our help. The ICV spent 4 weeks asking questions, watching them work and getting to know the business. In this time we filled out an analysis that we had been given. We then presented to all the other volunteers and staff and made our suggestions. For KMME we try to focus on getting them to start doing proper accounting, hiring an office intern and coming up with a marketing plan. We spent the next 4 weeks trying to implement the suggestions. 


I had never done any business consulting before and this was what I was most nervous about before going. Every Wednesday all the volunteers spent training at a hotel in the city. This was really useful and made the consulting possible. It was actually a lot of fun working at KMME as everyone was so friendly. Implementing the changes was challenging and honestly I do not know how much difference we made in the long term. We did achieve some goals and the owners were very eager to take on board what we had said. It was a rewarding experience; I just wish I had been better at it.


Whilst I was working with the maintenance company, other volunteers were working with a variety of different businesses. Having listened to two presentations on each placement I should be able to remember more than I do but I know there were people working in tourism, a distillery, a chain of cafes, something to do with bananas…. a language thing and something to do with clothes. I don’t know, but it was a whole variety of things. A maintenance company really did not sound like the most interesting company on paper but it was a great place to work and the people I worked with were really friendly. 


After the training on Wednesdays we would have committee meetings. I was part of the impact committee so we organised events to try and leave a positive impact on the country. One project was planting vegetables in people’s gardens in a village outside the city, to try and promote healthy diets. For the second event we went to a school outside the city and taught the girls to make reusable sanitary pads. From this I learnt I was not good at gardening or sewing. Despite that both events seemed to go down well especially the trip to the school.
Genocide


In 1994 between 500,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed between April and July in Rwanda. The genocide was the result of years of tension and a myriad of historical issues that I am not really qualified to go into. This is however what most people think of when they hear about Rwanda. The impact of the genocide can defiantly still be felt to this day even if it is not dwelt on as much as you might thing. It was not really discussed much with the ICVs, who would have either have been very young when it happened, or not born. At the host home the subject only came up once or twice and not for long. This might have been different for other volunteers. 


As a result of what happened every last Saturday of the month is a community event called Umaganda. This was where everyone would come together to try and achieve a goal as a community. I was there for two of these. The second one was when we went and planted vegetables in the village. For the first the host mum took us to where people were working together to cut grass. I mostly just stood around because if I had tried cutting grass the way they did I would have lost a foot. Someone sweeping up the grass did mess up their pile and let me sweep it up again so a picture could be taken, so really I did not help, made a mess if anything. After that was all done we sat in on a meeting where they spoke about matters in the community. The ICV I lived with helped translate what was going on. Whilst others were cutting grass I did speak with a man who explained how it was important  to help all those who were involved in the genocide, no matter what side they were  on, to come together as a community.


We also visited a church where a lot of people died as well as the museum in Kigali. Both trips were really moving and it was hard to imagine that everything we were shown there had happened in the country we were staying. The country has moved on from the genocide, but it is still something that shapes and effects people’s lives.

Conclusion


Despite not really knowing what to expect I had a great time in Rwanda. The work was challenging but rewarding. It was also a really fun trip; the country has a lot to offer. If I was to go again I would definitely try and see the gorillas, Rwanda has the highest population of mountain gorillas in the world. They also apparently have a good safari you can go on. I would really recommending going to Rwanda if you have the chance.

Thank you for your time and attention. It means a lot to me.*

*ahem...drumroll, please...*

-------------------------------------------------------------

Who would have thought that an invasion by demons- or giant human heretics, whatever- would actually hold some *hope* for a devout woman of The Benx? Not [Inspectrix Misha Bhush](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b7/1c/1c/b71c1c239165c3bfb00fbe81b9fad132.jpg). She's been devout, despite her doubts- at the least Supreme Inquisitor Fesshi says that even the faithful need not worry that their confusion and doubt is abnormal, so long as they discuss it with their Inquisitors rather than hiding it away. And Misha *has* shared her doubts. 

&gt;*If we vyde truly are the blessed daughters of the Lord of the Stars and under His protection, then why are not all of us endowed in the same fashion? Why is my phallus not large and thick?*

Her Inquisitorial voice of reason, her eventual medical prefect and Eparch of Students at the Nichea Seminary, Inquisitor Dhorn, told her when she was nine and learned that she was different from the other girls that unfortunately, not all vyde got to share in the blessings that the Slayer of Demons had gifted to them. Sometimes, the Holy Code that underlay their bodies and which was at the back of every copy of the Sole Book was corrupted by the Kassites and their demon allies. Misha was not alone in having been visited upon by the Demons even before she was born, her genome warped to give her the outward genitalia of a woman. It was a disappointing fact, but one she had had to struggle with all her life, and it clarified many things when Dhorn told her of this. She only hoped that with The Benx's benediction she might be able to receive all the gifts He had bestowed upon her. 

So far, she hasn't had much luck. Surgery prefects told her that it was ""unprecedented"" for a vyda to enlarge her endowment beyond what she was born with, and that even if it was doable, it would be an experimental and expensive procedure that needed to be approved by the General Synod of the Superintendency of Health Inspectorates before going forward. Yet more displeasure and disappointment, for Misha needed every Imperial Bill she earned from emasculating or defeminizing the child-diddlers of her sex at the clinic in Dumhsar. Her family had relied on her for the past eight years for their sustenance. Her mother couldn't work in a factory, and she didn't want to put her six little girls through any of the labors she heard others endure to ensure that the utilities kept flowing and the Free Imperial City of Nichea didn't send police to raid their home for tax evasion. They were supposed to have gotten a pension more than sufficient for that purpose when her uncle/stepfather Jyjho was killed by the Heretics when they attacked his Army unit's camp, but it barely paid for all the food they ate each week. So no experimental surgeries, surgeries that might end up being denied to Misha anyway...

All in all, Misha is starting to wonder if she should just give up. She's approaching thirty, and the odds of her being married and keeping her place as an Inspectrix are slim. While vyde certainly can have kids with each other and have their own jobs, she knows many of her counterparts in the Nichea Health Commissariat don't see her that way. Though they don't come right out and say it, she's sure she knows what they're all thinking: *You're a slut that the prefects indulge because you're so smart and determined, but soon enough one of us is gonna mark you and that'll be that.* All her life, Misha has seen women demeaned and humiliated, and left mostly unable to expand their intellects. Should that turn out to be her fate...she doesn't know what she would do. She knows she'll miss going on nightly trips to indulge her tremendous hunger for what she doesn't currently have, and certainly her independence. And what will become of her family then? 

But then the Vespalians broadcast their intent to find their ""hostages"". Then they engaged the Navy over Alpha World and wiped it from the skies, to rain down on the planet below. And then, they landed, they bested the Army and made the Empire surrender for the first time in its history, and healed those injured from the falling ships, which allegedly blew up half of Benx City. Misha herself watched as they cloned arms and reattached them to their eventual owners, and offered sincere apologies for those killed in the wake of the fighting- thankfully a group bereft of her friends and family, though watching the hills over New Nichea ignite into flames definitely made her think some of them might have perished. High Inquisitor Bak might say they're really eight-foot-tall Vempa- demons who take on the form of humans to deceive them into following Orora's edicts- but as far as she can tell, they're as human as that usurper is. And- dare she say it? 

They might be able to get her the penis she wants, and *needs*, to live a fulfilling life as the vyda she *is*. 

**Appearance and sexual preferences**

Like most vyde's, Misha's height falls within the standard distribution of heights for women. She is five foot three and wears an FF-cup bra, and endowed with a vulva topped with a half-inch clitoris as well as breasts that are sometimes too prone to lactation. When she orgasms, her vagina squirts semen. 

She is a vyda-obsessed gynephile who almost exclusively sleeps with other vyde. She measures her partners' pricks in various states of arousal and rates them before carefully, almost scientifically, sucking them off in most encounters and proceeding into a wild romp. While she does have the ferocious sexual appetite of most Benxborian vyde, this is countered by her force of will, honed and sharpened by her learnings in the Imperial seminaries, and shaped by her desire to get a penis to more fully enjoy that appetite lest she end up being marked by one of her coworkers. And of course, as a sizequeen, she will mock and demean those who fall below her high standards of being at least 8 inches in length. She also hates cum facials or external cumshots in general, for obvious reasons. 

**Prompts** (Either females or vyde are cool with me for all of these unless otherwise explicitly specified in the individual prompt.)

* Night of the Falling Spaceships

Or of the intercontinental blackout. This takes place as the Benxborian Imperial Home Fleet's defeated remnants take their time dropping to the planet below, sliced and diced and blown apart by the Vespalian Space Command. Between all the pieces of spaceships, large and small, raining down on the Holy World, many people will survive, though some will die. You won't be one of them. You'll just be one of the passersby in the heart of the city of Nichea as the debris makes landfall, and along the way you run into a health inspectrix running to shelter just like you are. She's scared that her friends are in danger, and needs some comfort. Comfort you're more than willing to provide. 

* Just Another Day At The Clinic

The Dumhsar Vyda Reformatory in the eponymous middle-belt suburb of Nichea has seen a lot of crazy things. Vyde pedophiles screaming and pleading their innocence, blubbering and crying as they try to get out of the impending surgeries and hormone injections or extractions awaiting them. Vyde threatening to blow the place up if they or their friends/lovers aren't released from their ""wrongful"" ~~incarceration~~ treatment. But not a firefight between nine-foot-tall armor-wearing ~~demons~~ ~~aliens~~ heretics and six-foot-tall Divine Legionaries in the service of a ~~hero and reformer of the Empire and the Church~~ racist usurper in the front lawn. It's a firefight the Vespalians are going to win. In the wake of all that mess, the Vespalians take off their helmets and try to comfort the stunned staff of the reformatory. Including a curious Misha, now wondering what the oddly helpful, all-(apparently) female ~~harlots~~ warriors are packing. She'll pass it off to her colleagues as ""learning about our enemies"" but we all know she's after more than just knowledge. 

Anyone with a girly face is welcome. 

* A Day Spent With Friends Is Always A Day Full Of Fucking

Despite Misha's doubts about her colleagues, she has made some close friends among them- no girlfriends, if ever, because of her all-too-obvious differences from them. Eventually she gets back in touch with one, or more, of her friends after work's done at the reformatory. And as always with all conversations involving Misha, she wants to ""investigate"" their genitals. 

* A Bargain With The ~~Devil~~ Queen Mother of All Demons...Or Two...Or Ten

After the Vespalians move on from the reformatory and things go back to something almost normal as they begin their occupation of the planet, Dumhsar begins to accept its' regular influx of vyde with a strange fondness for diddling children and to process them back into something almost fit for civilized living. But one particular vyda, her cock above average, catches the eye of Inspectrix Misha as she tries to figure out if this child molester's perversion is so intense that she needs to be emasculated, or just medicated and partnered with a firm adult spouse. Knowing this, and eager to return to business as horrifically usual or at the least avoid getting her ovotestes reduced to just ovaries,  the molester makes a deal with Misha. Simply put, as long as Misha keeps her away from the scalpels, she'll plow her as much as she wants. 

*Her* way. And this molester plays rough with everyone.

* Really Getting Around

You're a vyda in medicine doing an internship at a Nichea Commissariat facility before moving on to becoming a full-fledged Inspectrix, and whatever your field you end up doing a stint at Dumhsar Reformatory. The pedophiles being treated here aren't your main focus, though. Your eyes are all on the highest-ranking female Inspectrix not working in a spinster clinic anywhere in the Empire, Misha Bhush. The rumor mill says that she insists she is a vyda whose Holy Code was demonically corrupted, and is a *massive* slut otherwise. Due to your studies you haven't really had the time to stick your cock in anything other than your hand lately. Time to see how many loads this slut Misha can take, and if you can mark her in the process. 

* The Milk of Human Kindness

Being a Vespalian soldier on a planet of troglodyte, anachronistic pygmies has proven to be mostly void of harm, but dangerously variable. One day you're lasering down some idiotic young hermaphrodites or old men for rounding up women and girls and planning to sell them off into sexual slavery, the other day you're handing out food to all the starving, impoverished families in another neighborhood with poor drainage, and on yet another day you're helping out with the medical tent and healing a couple hundred someone's illnesses. Compassion fights in you with contempt at the sight of these pathetic beings, and though you gripe about it every day with your colleagues, you also have to admit something else is waking up in you in reaction. 

Maybe it might be how so many of the Benxborian women you've rescued from the gangs have kneeled and called you, regardless of your gender, their ""lord and master"" and offered to do anything for you, or how in the poor neighborhoods a herm can stick out her dick to a dozen women and walk away with a dozen babies on the way and a fat wad of ~~child support~~ cash in exchange. But you're gonna find out just what that feeling is when a Benxborian doctor stops by your tent, asking if you can get her the penis she says she was denied because of genetic defects. Your nation has defied genetic destiny, though, for millennia and has instructed you to demonstrate that to the locals. So yes, you can. 

She'll be *very* grateful. 

* O Benx, Give Me Strength 

Misha's finally stepping off Alpha World for the first time in twenty-nine years. She's almost through with all her medical schooling, and excelling in every class. The only thing left is to do some work on behalf of her fellow clerics at large, and that requires heading to another system. The Veriadu system specifically. It's a bit of a warzone, what with the heretical Republic occupying it and backing some heterodox (heretic really) Metropolitan who claims that Sappha of Dinabho is a Holy Saint and Orora is her goddess, while Bak's band of criminals and warmongers attacks them and troops loyal to the rightful Emperor, Arktus II, try not to get wiped out in the crossfire. Specifically, Misha has to go visit a reformatory for non-vyde and work alongside Sapphist staff. Regardless of whether or not either she or they have a wang, they'll definitely want to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh with her and convert her to Sapphism. It's gonna be a fun*, tease-loaded time.

* One Of The Benx's Chosen Vydacows

Misha's finally gotten her cock thanks to ~~heretical sorcery~~ Vespalian medicine, and is now happily plowing everything in sight that's of age. Unfortunately, she's happily plowing everything in sight that's of age and doing little else of value, and that sent her grades plummeting like the wreckage of an Imperial cruiser. She needs a new way to make money, at least while she's on her sex-bender. Hopefully she can get off it and back into school. But in the meantime she has found a way to make money, by moving outside of the Nichea city limits to a ranch where hundreds of horny hucows are daily milked. Misha will be spending some time in the stalls too- either alongside or on top of them.

**Adjunct**

I go to bed between 1 and 2 in the morning on most nights and live in the eastern United States, am a college student and ~~a wage slave~~ employed. That being said I will do my best to keep up with you, and even then, if you can only respond once or a few times a day (or week) that's fine with me.

[These are my kinks.](https://i.imgur.com/pj51VEb.png) In ""A Bargain With The ~~Devil~~ Queen Mother of All Demons...Or Two...Or Ten"", we can explore Misha being dominated and degraded. Also, apologies if I distressed any readers unduly. I enjoy exploring the situations I place my characters in but they haven't touched on pedophilia before. I endorse the Benxborians' measures against the child molesters they find in their midst, and that's about all that I endorse their Empire doing. 

When responding to the other prompts, though, I expect you to respect the kinklist. Flouting it with any other prompt will get you blocked.

*ahem...drumroll, please...*

-------------------------------------------------------------

Who would have thought that an invasion by demons- or giant human heretics, whatever- would actually hold some *hope* for a devout woman of The Benx? Not [Inspectrix Misha Bhush](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b7/1c/1c/b71c1c239165c3bfb00fbe81b9fad132.jpg). She's been devout, despite her doubts- at the least Supreme Inquisitor Fesshi says that even the faithful need not worry that their confusion and doubt is abnormal, so long as they discuss it with their Inquisitors rather than hiding it away. And Misha *has* shared her doubts. 

&gt;*If we vyde truly are the blessed daughters of the Lord of the Stars and under His protection, then why are not all of us endowed in the same fashion? Why is my phallus not large and thick?*

Her Inquisitorial voice of reason, her eventual medical prefect and Eparch of Students at the Nichea Seminary, Inquisitor Dhorn, told her when she was nine and learned that she was different from the other girls that unfortunately, not all vyde got to share in the blessings that the Slayer of Demons had gifted to them. Sometimes, the Holy Code that underlay their bodies and which was at the back of every copy of the Sole Book was corrupted by the Kassites and their demon allies. Misha was not alone in having been visited upon by the Demons even before she was born, her genome warped to give her the outward genitalia of a woman. It was a disappointing fact, but one she had had to struggle with all her life, and it clarified many things when Dhorn told her of this. She only hoped that with The Benx's benediction she might be able to receive all the gifts He had bestowed upon her. 

So far, she hasn't had much luck. Surgery prefects told her that it was ""unprecedented"" for a vyda to enlarge her endowment beyond what she was born with, and that even if it was doable, it would be an experimental and expensive procedure that needed to be approved by the General Synod of the Superintendency of Health Inspectorates before going forward. Yet more displeasure and disappointment, for Misha needed every Imperial Bill she earned from emasculating or defeminizing the child-diddlers of her sex at the clinic in Dumhsar. Her family had relied on her for the past eight years for their sustenance. Her mother couldn't work in a factory, and she didn't want to put her six little girls through any of the labors she heard others endure to ensure that the utilities kept flowing and the Free Imperial City of Nichea didn't send police to raid their home for tax evasion. They were supposed to have gotten a pension more than sufficient for that purpose when her uncle/stepfather Jyjho was killed by the Heretics when they attacked his Army unit's camp, but it barely paid for all the food they ate each week. So no experimental surgeries, surgeries that might end up being denied to Misha anyway...

All in all, Misha is starting to wonder if she should just give up. She's approaching thirty, and the odds of her being married and keeping her place as an Inspectrix are slim. While vyde certainly can have kids with each other and have their own jobs, she knows many of her counterparts in the Nichea Health Commissariat don't see her that way. Though they don't come right out and say it, she's sure she knows what they're all thinking: *You're a slut that the prefects indulge because you're so smart and determined, but soon enough one of us is gonna mark you and that'll be that.* All her life, Misha has seen women demeaned and humiliated, and left mostly unable to expand their intellects. Should that turn out to be her fate...she doesn't know what she would do. She knows she'll miss going on nightly trips to indulge her tremendous hunger for what she doesn't currently have, and certainly her independence. And what will become of her family then? 

But then the Vespalians broadcast their intent to find their ""hostages"". Then they engaged the Navy over Alpha World and wiped it from the skies, to rain down on the planet below. And then, they landed, they bested the Army and made the Empire surrender for the first time in its history, and healed those injured from the falling ships, which allegedly blew up half of Benx City. Misha herself watched as they cloned arms and reattached them to their eventual owners, and offered sincere apologies for those killed in the wake of the fighting- thankfully a group bereft of her friends and family, though watching the hills over New Nichea ignite into flames definitely made her think some of them might have perished. High Inquisitor Bak might say they're really eight-foot-tall Vempa- demons who take on the form of humans to deceive them into following Orora's edicts- but as far as she can tell, they're as human as that usurper is. And- dare she say it? 

They might be able to get her the penis she wants, and *needs*, to live a fulfilling life as the vyda she *is*. 

**Appearance and sexual preferences**

Like most vyde's, Misha's height falls within the standard distribution of heights for women. She is five foot three and wears an FF-cup bra, and endowed with a vulva topped with a half-inch clitoris as well as breasts that are sometimes too prone to lactation. When she orgasms, her vagina squirts semen. 

She is a vyda-obsessed gynephile who almost exclusively sleeps with other vyde. She measures her partners' pricks in various states of arousal and rates them before carefully, almost scientifically, sucking them off in most encounters and proceeding into a wild romp. While she does have the ferocious sexual appetite of most Benxborian vyde, this is countered by her force of will, honed and sharpened by her learnings in the Imperial seminaries, and shaped by her desire to get a penis to more fully enjoy that appetite lest she end up being marked by one of her coworkers. And of course, as a sizequeen, she will mock and demean those who fall below her high standards of being at least 8 inches in length. She also hates cum facials or external cumshots in general, for obvious reasons. 

**Prompts** (Either females or vyde are cool with me for all of these unless otherwise explicitly specified in the individual prompt.)

* Night of the Falling Spaceships

Or of the intercontinental blackout. This takes place as the Benxborian Imperial Home Fleet's defeated remnants take their time dropping to the planet below, sliced and diced and blown apart by the Vespalian Space Command. Between all the pieces of spaceships, large and small, raining down on the Holy World, many people will survive, though some will die. You won't be one of them. You'll just be one of the passersby in the heart of the city of Nichea as the debris makes landfall, and along the way you run into a health inspectrix running to shelter just like you are. She's scared that her friends are in danger, and needs some comfort. Comfort you're more than willing to provide. 

* Just Another Day At The Clinic

The Dumhsar Vyda Reformatory in the eponymous middle-belt suburb of Nichea has seen a lot of crazy things. Vyde pedophiles screaming and pleading their innocence, blubbering and crying as they try to get out of the impending surgeries and hormone injections or extractions awaiting them. Vyde threatening to blow the place up if they or their friends/lovers aren't released from their ""wrongful"" ~~incarceration~~ treatment. But not a firefight between nine-foot-tall armor-wearing ~~demons~~ ~~aliens~~ heretics and six-foot-tall Divine Legionaries in the service of a ~~hero and reformer of the Empire and the Church~~ racist usurper in the front lawn. It's a firefight the Vespalians are going to win. In the wake of all that mess, the Vespalians take off their helmets and try to comfort the stunned staff of the reformatory. Including a curious Misha, now wondering what the oddly helpful, all-(apparently) female ~~harlots~~ warriors are packing. She'll pass it off to her colleagues as ""learning about our enemies"" but we all know she's after more than just knowledge. 

Anyone with a girly face is welcome. 

* A Day Spent With Friends Is Always A Day Full Of Fucking

Despite Misha's doubts about her colleagues, she has made some close friends among them- no girlfriends, if ever, because of her all-too-obvious differences from them. Eventually she gets back in touch with one, or more, of her friends after work's done at the reformatory. And as always with all conversations involving Misha, she wants to ""investigate"" their genitals. 

* A Bargain With The ~~Devil~~ Queen Mother of All Demons...Or Two...Or Ten

After the Vespalians move on from the reformatory and things go back to something almost normal as they begin their occupation of the planet, Dumhsar begins to accept its' regular influx of vyde with a strange fondness for diddling children and to process them back into something almost fit for civilized living. But one particular vyda, her cock above average, catches the eye of Inspectrix Misha as she tries to figure out if this child molester's perversion is so intense that she needs to be emasculated, or just medicated and partnered with a firm adult spouse. Knowing this, and eager to return to business as horrifically usual or at the least avoid getting her ovotestes reduced to just ovaries,  the molester makes a deal with Misha. Simply put, as long as Misha keeps her away from the scalpels, she'll plow her as much as she wants. 

*Her* way. And this molester plays rough with everyone.

* Really Getting Around

You're a vyda in medicine doing an internship at a Nichea Commissariat facility before moving on to becoming a full-fledged Inspectrix, and whatever your field you end up doing a stint at Dumhsar Reformatory. The pedophiles being treated here aren't your main focus, though. Your eyes are all on the highest-ranking female Inspectrix not working in a spinster clinic anywhere in the Empire, Misha Bhush. The rumor mill says that she insists she is a vyda whose Holy Code was demonically corrupted, and is a *massive* slut otherwise. Due to your studies you haven't really had the time to stick your cock in anything other than your hand lately. Time to see how many loads this slut Misha can take, and if you can mark her in the process. 

* The Milk of Human Kindness

Being a Vespalian soldier on a planet of troglodyte, anachronistic pygmies has proven to be mostly void of harm, but dangerously variable. One day you're lasering down some idiotic young hermaphrodites or old men for rounding up women and girls and planning to sell them off into sexual slavery, the other day you're handing out food to all the starving, impoverished families in another neighborhood with poor drainage, and on yet another day you're helping out with the medical tent and healing a couple hundred someone's illnesses. Compassion fights in you with contempt at the sight of these pathetic beings, and though you gripe about it every day with your colleagues, you also have to admit something else is waking up in you in reaction. 

Maybe it might be how so many of the Benxborian women you've rescued from the gangs have kneeled and called you, regardless of your gender, their ""lord and master"" and offered to do anything for you, or how in the poor neighborhoods a herm can stick out her dick to a dozen women and walk away with a dozen babies on the way and a fat wad of ~~child support~~ cash in exchange. But you're gonna find out just what that feeling is when a Benxborian doctor stops by your tent, asking if you can get her the penis she says she was denied because of genetic defects. Your nation has defied genetic destiny, though, for millennia and has instructed you to demonstrate that to the locals. So yes, you can. 

She'll be *very* grateful.
