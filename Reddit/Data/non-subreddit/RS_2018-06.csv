Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection that is causing me major neck stiffness and pain.  The ER doc did not prescribe me the needed dose of antibiotics because the bloodwork was going to take a few days and he wanted to be conservative in prescribing anything.  The bloodwork came back positive.  So, I will be talking to him again tomorrow or next week and asking for more antibiotics.

This neck pain is debilitating to the point where I am on the verge of copping dope to help, which I don't want to do.  I need to prepare for the internship and it's just not happening.  I am assuming that I am red flagged as a pain med seeker, as I have been to the ER for an overdose in the past and due to the fact that my PCP knows about my opiate addiction history unfortunately.

I want to ask the doc for pain meds during the next conversation.  How do I approach this?  Be polite and ask when I ask for more antibiotics?  Or is there simply no way, no point in trying?"

Perhaps coup is a better word.

Martial Law is coming.

 Be at peace \- it will be the white hats utilizing the special laws that allow civilians to be courts martialed,  thus circumventing the corrupted  \(in\) justice system and subjecting rogue civilians to military law instead of the standard,  corrupt, compromised  legal system of the USA.

This will allow for a swift round\-up of many bad actors: child and human traffickers, hit squads of MS13, treasonous current and former politicians, and Clowns in American / No Such Agency plants in media, key antifa  and  BLM terrorists \(and those funding them \- is that William ""Bill"" Reeves and wife Debbie Berger? Just wondering. Maybe it is the Bishop Estate?\) \[dig\]

The internet will go out, the media will be off. Cell phones down. It must happen fast so black hats cannot warn each other or escape. We want to avoid SpecOps having to go and get them... think of it as a nationwide raid, so the bad gals/guys can't escape.

\[Anderson Cooper may I ask, how long did you ""intern"" at the Clowns IA?\]

Mockingbird

Properties in Hawaii, Florida, CA and more will be swarmed and seized, their prisoners and sex slaves freed, and the dissolved bodies discovered.

Doubt?

 Follow the EO's, see the adaptations made  re:  martial law, courts martial and  civilians.

 How else can a housecleaning happen with such widespread corruption?

Civilian courts martial, which requires martial law.

 In order to leapfrog the corrupted judicial process, martial law provides for civilian courts martials. See recent Q drops and read the EO on it. Coincidence? No, its a precursor, setting the stage.

Perhaps limited scope \(critical ports of entry, MS13 strongholds, selected private properties, all air traffic grounded\) , perhaps nationwide. SA deployed their NG and went martial.  POTUS authorized NG deployed last year.

Remember who fought hard to prevent the NG in their state from being used?

Port of entry states?

Hawaii test of emergency system.

Oregon test of emergency system.

California or FL next?

Increased  domestic mil activity esp at night . 

DO NOT BE STOKED INTO FIGHTING

There are those in managed opposition for the DS, who would wage ***a war for your mind*****.** They have been setting the stage  to set good people against the good military, with alarmist reports that the Deep State will try and overthrow the government, or ' come for your guns'. So, when martial law happens, they would have you fantasize Red Dawn, and fight against our own military. 

DO NOT. 

The military is one of the only uncompromised sectors. 

Their presence is also to mitigate DS sponsored uprisings.

Soros, CF, Muslim Bros, Rothschild minions \- they  will not go without a fight \(unless they can get to China and continue operating\).

They are sore losers. When they lose and we win, they will try and scorch the earth.

They will do this partly through inciting rebellion.  Love your children \(even the teenagers!\) and just watch from the sidelines. Fear is the enemies friend \- show it love when it arises in you when the storm comes, talk to it. This is the calm before the storm.

Fight fire with water.  Distilled, water preferably.

Distillery \- do I  mean the false front of Dave Stone and Stone Harbour LLC in Hawaii?  I wonder how might a false distillery relate to HRC and child trafficking?

8nojzg,9,2018-05-31,How to work longer hours? [X-post r/Entrepreneur],thecoldernorth,StackAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/StackAdvice/comments/8nojzg/how_to_work_longer_hours_xpost_rentrepreneur/,"Hello r/StackAdvice

I'm 22 years old and a year deep into co\-founding a tech startup and just about finishing up school. This summer my co\-founders and I have an office space and decided to pay ourselves to cover rent \+ food. This way we can stay 100&amp;#37; focused on the company since we are in a bit of a time crunch before our next sales cycle.

I want to work longer productive hours. Previously, the tech co\-founder and I worked a full time internship alongside our startup and we could hit 90 hour weeks easy. But when it was time to work on our startup, we were already depleted and tired. This resulted in a bunch of shit code that ended up breaking frequently and was nearly impossible to maintain.

Now we work 8 hours a day 7 days per week grinding out code at 80\-90&amp;#37; productivity. More recently we have come across some issues that have taken us 50\+ hours and tremendous mental energy to solve. By the end of the day my brain is gassed and I start making extremely basic mistakes. I know I won't make any meaningful progress after that point and might even dig myself deeper in bugs, so I call it a day. I want to extend my productivity so we can get more work done each day and roll through our development plan faster. It's a game of attrition after all.

I want to bump up my 50\-60 hour workweek to 70\-80 hours while retaining my productivity, no point in working 100 hours a week if you're unhealthy, sleep deprived, and working at 50&amp;#37; mental capacity.

I am doing the following already:

Nicotine

Caffeine \(2\-3 cups coffee a day\) \+ L\-theanine

Creatine

Exercising

Eating well

Sleeping 7\-8 hours

We try to stay away from harder stims \(adderall\) unless we know something has to be handled right fucking now. Also, I'm a non\-responder to modafinil and I have the genetic report and anecdotal evidence to prove it.

Can anyone recommend something that will help with that extra little bit of mental energy?"
8nor2o,9,2018-05-31,"First time apartment shopping,need help!",lirazmir,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8nor2o/first_time_apartment_shoppingneed_help/,"Hi, some details before I start:

I'm in the USA.

My current internship pays me $22/hr and I will most likely work 45hr/week

I am looking for a 1br apartment at a 3 month lease this summer.

Okay, so I have never rented an apartment and am forced to do so for this internship. I have been looking around at apartments and it is very rare that I find a good complex that also offers leases at 3 months. Also, those that i have found are exorbitantly expensive due to the short term lease agreements \(ranging from $1000/mo to $1500/mo\). I have found one at $700/month but it is not in what looks like a safe area and I am reluctant to sign a lease here. Furthermore, none of these apartments are furnished so I will have to lease some furniture \(I just need a bed and table\) and costs for internet and power are not included \(I am thinking both of these shouldn't exceed about $120/month\). Also, all of these complexes charge app fees and admin fees which total to about $200 and I am reluctant to apply now because what if I get rejected, will my app fee go down the drain? 

With my current pay I can afford these apartments but I will have very little money saved up at the end of the internship. Also, I have been looking at local craigslist and Airbnbs and haven't found anything reasonable that I can stay at for 3 months. My only other option is for me to stay at an extended stay motel which costs me about $1200 a month.

My question is: is it worth it to shell out the extra money and possibly spend half of my summer paycheck on just housing related costs just so I can live comfortably, or should I bite the bullet and go cheap here? Also, are there any other ""hidden"" costs I should be aware of when leasing an apartment or just living alone in general."
8nov26,1,2018-05-31,Looking for rational voices on FP,intenselotad,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8nov26/looking_for_rational_voices_on_fp/,"Hey all! I'm hoping to get some perspective from people who ""get it"" on my issue with my FP.

I had a crush on her for a bit, and she's a charismatic person, so as we got closer last spring she became my FP. We started dating over the summer, but things went poorly as I didn't know I had BPD and she was dealing with significant depression. She couldn't give me the attention I needed and I became pretty miserable. We dated for 6 months before I broke up with her in December. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but she really really was withholding affection and I couldn't stand it. Knowing that she was there but choosing to ignore me made me want to die.

After that, things were pretty hard. At first I was at an internship that I adored &amp; kept very busy, so I was mostly okay. But as soon as I got back to school, things got really bad again (you all know). I was tearing myself apart because I felt so guilty for missing her. 

See, all my friends never liked her. They tell me that she's abusive and manipulative. Sometimes I can see that and sometimes I can't. I barely know how to talk about her in a way that isn't constantly excusing her and painting her in a positive light. When I do switch on her and get mad, I feel like I'm making it up for attention (which is something I do if I don't control myself). 

3 months after the breakup I caved. She had suddenly started liking my posts on tumblr. That tiny hint of her being in my life after full no-contact broke the dam. I followed her again on tumblr, and a few days later she messaged me. Immediately, it felt like a huge crushing weight was being lifted off of me. I could breathe again. She was back in my life! She missed me! She still had feelings for me! I was on top of the world. She came up to visit her friends at the college (she used to go to the same school as me but left after last year) &amp; we had sex. 

But then... things started to feel similarly to before. She was always leaving my snapchats on read, not asking how i was after i asked how she was, ignoring me for days, all of that. The kind of stuff that we're WAY more sensitive to. I thought that now that I had the language to talk about it, I could help her understand how that hurt me. 

Instead... it kind of got worse. We barely talked for the last few weeks. Right now I send maybe one snap a day (primary method of communication) &amp; its often something that's also posted on my story. She replies maybe 10% of the time. 

During this time where we weren't talking, I got frustrated. I think that was probably a reasonable frustration. I realized that we need to either be emotionally connected or not - we can't keep jumping back and forth on it. Now, she's up at the college for her friends' graduation. I wrote a bunch of letters before settling on a pretty neutral one that basically just said ""when you switch from saying 'i love you' to ignoring me, it really hurts and we need to pick one."" But then I went to give it to her &amp; she was showering me in affection and kept kissing me and saying she loved me. I knew she was worried about the note. I ALWAYS cry whenever I even kinda start talking about emotions, so I was crying big-time. We talked for a while and I left feeling so, so in love with her. I wanted to tear the letter out of her hands and tell her that she was perfect. 

She's been doing stuff with her friends and I told her to enjoy herself and not worry too much about the letter. I drive home tomorrow (where we'll be about 30 minutes from each other instead of 3 hours). I don't know what she's going to say, because she seems to be in a phase where she's very affectionate. I KNOW that it will go back to a phase where she's very cold. But I can't make myself feel that and actually use that as a rational factor in my decision-making. It feels like I can only love or hate her at one time. As soon as she pays attention to me it's love. Then it's misery and crying that turns into hate. Then she talks to me again and it repeats.

That's not healthy. I know it's not healthy. I don't know if she's abusive but maybe she is (she's done other things that are really hard to talk about for me, but my friends are really reliable and rational and tell me she is a bad person). I've kept this whole reunion a secret from them, because I know they'd be mad at me.

TL;DR FP/ex is very hot and cold. When she's affectionate, I'll do absolutely anything for her. I don't know how to assert myself and take up space. My friends think she's abusive, and they don't know we're talking again.

Any advice or thoughts is appreciated, even if you only read a little bit of this. Thank you!!"
8novan,2,2018-05-31,21 M4F An Open Letter to a Penpal,penpal4jenny,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8novan/21_m4f_an_open_letter_to_a_penpal/,"Like the tittle says, this is an open letter to a penpal. Not a roleplayer, not a chat partner, a penpal. I want to find someone who I can share longer more complete thoughts and fantasies with, but not have to worry about being available at the same time. We'd both send each other a long\-ish message or two a day. No sweat trying to reply quickly.

So, a bit about me. I go to school for computer science and I have a internship in that area too. I like to bike a lot. In fact when I got my job, I had to chose between buying a car, or a nice bike: you can guess what I bought. I  play the drums, and I also rock climb, but that's the first of my hobbys/sports that gets the ax when I start to run out of free time. From a more dirtypenpal aspect, I consider myself to be in like the 80th percentile for kinky. I have more kinks than the average bear, but if you came looking for snuff fantasies I suggest you move on. I'm a fan of cum play, sluts, watersports, incest, anal \(giving and receiving\), spit, slapping, and dirty talk.

As far as limits go, I'd say it's more context for me than actual limits. I don't like noncon. I think fantasies and acts are so much better when they're shared, I mean, that's why we're all on here to begin with isn't it? You can convince me of pretty much any kink except maybe scat if it's cast in a positive light where everyone is into it.

I'm not too sure what else to say about myself. Being that it is an open letter, I usually try to end with a question so that you don't just read my message and say ""okay, and how do I reply."" So, if you found this interesting, message me, and tell me whatever thoughts you had about the above text and answer this question: What do you typically do when you get home from work/school, and if it's not the same thing, what do you wish you did? Feel free to answer that as naughty, or nice as you want, that's kinda the nice part about getting connected in this context, nothing is off the table to begin with.

I hope to hear from you.

edit\* I always forget to put this on this style of post, but feel free to message me any number of hours or days after reading this."

Maybe it's pertinent for you guys to know that when we were growing up no one ever expected it to go this way. I was a really troubled child and really difficult. No one ever thought I was going to finish high school. I did but had some more tough times afterward. Then I kind of got my shit together. I moved to a bigger city and started college. I went the full four years and never took a break. I graduated this past December, moved to an even bigger city and landed two awesome jobs.

I went through two crazy heartbreaks during that time. I've since realized that it's been extremely good for me to be alone. Even though I always had my own life: going to college and having a plan for my future, being in clubs, having internships, preparing for my future regardless of my relationship status.

My sister went to college for two years in a bigger city. She dropped out because of heartbreak, started drinking and moved back home. She's better now about alcohol but she hasn't gone back to college and still lives at home at 32.

She's also been through a divorce. Her ex husband was in the military and for whatever reason guys in the military propose like there's no tomorrow which is pretty much what happened. But he was extremely unfaithful, so, divorce. Also, I don't know why but his family hated her.

She's already dating someone new and he's also in the military. Also, he's younger than I am. I think he's 23. She's not doing anything with her life, she just works for a moving company in our super small hometown. And posts sappy instagram posts about loyalty and finding real love.

I'm worried she's just waiting for him to propose so she can move out of our parents house and in with him and call it a day and just morph into a relationship blob with him, if they're not already. She has no hobbies that I know of.

I want her to find happiness from within and through things other than guys and relationships. Also, this new guys family hates her too. It's like she's dating the same guy, except significantly younger. And, I don't know him but based on the things I've ready in this sub... the age and maturity thing worries me. Honestly, \~I\~ wouldn't even date a 23 year old.

My family hasn't talked about it much and I'm not able to go home much but I was actually seeing a guy for a little bit that shared the same name as my sisters new guy. But we were exactly the same age. My mom asked almost immediately how old he was and when I told her she said she appreciated that we were the same age. So I get the hint she feels some type of way about it.

It's just weird that I'm the one in a good position worried about her. I didn't really expect this and I haven't prepared myself for a discussion on how to help her. I don't want her to keep getting her heartbroken, she needs to learn how to be by herself and be alone and be happy. I also think she needs to date men and men with good relationships with their families. I also have a history of dating men with poor relationships with their families but the last guy I was seeing had a good one and it really showed me the value and importance of it. I don't think my deal\-breakers need to be hers but I'm worried about her long\-term happiness and how she's spending her life. I want her time to be hers, not given to some guy.

I've talked about it with my aunt recently over drinks and she agreed that she doesn't know what she's doing and she needs to get her shit together. But we didn't talk about helping her or saying anything.

My questions are: Is this any of my business? Should I bring it up? How do I bring it up? Is she even aware of what's going on? Should I talk to my mom and brother about it first?

TLDR  
My sister relies too much on guys for happiness. I feel like she's just waiting to get married so she can call it a day on ambition. I want her to create her own happiness so she'll always be ok."

*****************

This all happened five or so years ago while I was working for a proprietary trading firm. The company is a multinational and it had opened a new office in my city a couple of years before I joined them. For those who don't know, most prop shops (as I understood it) have a very high turnover rate. Just toss everyone in and keep those who stick. The company I worked for recruited every three months. It had space for about 120 traders but the office was never full. Out of the twenty or so who were hired every quarter, only about five managed to make it beyond the three month internship period, and of those, only one - or sometimes none at all - made it past the additional three months probation period. The company was operating in my city for two years before I joined and there were only about four people who I could have called permanent. Everyone else, about another ten, was either on their internship or on probation.

The Setup.

I and about twenty five others were recruited straight out of university. The internship period paid really well for a first job, about twice as much as any other entry level position in other financial institutions plus bonuses once we went live (regardless of whether one is on internship, probation or permanent), and I was really excited.

I first came across my boss, a really decent Indian guy, at a industry day held in our university. That was where they administered the IQ tests and I passed. The office, similar to other mid-sized operations, had a pretty flat management structure. Us traders were at the lowest level, the HR/Ops manager was above us, and the Office Manager was, well, the head of the branch. The boss gave time off pretty much whenever you asked for it as long as the day's objectives were fulfilled (that was his policy).

However, the HR/Ops manager was his opposite, and then some. This lady was a Grade-A bitch, and I mean that sincerely. Let's call her Gabby.

The Instigating Event

I first met Gabby when I went to their offices for my final interview. I was registering at the front desk when she marched from her office demanding some documents from the receptionist. The receptionist wanted to finish up with me first but she was ordered off to file storage. Our exchange went like so:

Gabby: You're one of the new ones?

Me: Yes. I'm really excited.

Gabby: Don't be. you don't look like you'll make it.

Me: Why?

Gabby: You're too soft.

A pause.

Gabby: Buut... I can put in a good word for you, if you give me a little something. ( a bribe).

Me: Haha. Very funny.

Gabby: I'm serious. Give something and I'll make it very easy for you. Otherwise I'll make sure you don't even get into the interview.

Me: No.

Gabby: Stupid idiot.

Right to my face. And she kept her word. She made me sit in a hidden corner of the waiting room where no one would see me easily, but I could hear the conversations at the desk. The only reason why I got an interview is because apparently I had impressed the boss at our previous meeting that he came to see why my CV wasn't there. Gabby said that I hadn't sent it in. The receptionist stated that she had seen it somewhere. Then I walked up to the desk at the same time the receptionist said, ""Here it is. It was in the trash..."" and everyone stared at Gabby.

From that moment of humiliation onwards, Gabby had a raging hate boner for me. You see, Gabby was a micromanager, more of a nanomanager really. She made us have to request access if we wanted to access sites other than those on her approved list, and for traders who gain info from wherever we could find it, her list was woefully inadequate. She would call meetings at the most inopportune times - but only when the branch manager was not around - and in her lengthy meetings, you could never leave to check on your positions. She had this annoying habit of taking my lunch and when I confronted her about it, she essentially told me to go fuck myself. That I could live with. I just started bringing in two sets of lunch and kept on doing the job that I loved.

Gabby was married with two kids, and she was pretty. I guess she liked the attention because she would have a stream of guys picking her up at the office for two hour 'lunches' and when she left for home some evening. But not on Thursday. Thursdays were the days when her husband would come pick her up towing their kids along. I think they went to have a family dinner or something.

The Mistakes Gabby Made: Round One

Our manager left about two months after I joined. I think he returned to India to get married or something but still stayed with the company. Wished him all the best. None of the other permanent traders had the experience corporate required to take on a management role (5 years at least) so they had to shop around. In the meantime, Gabby became the de-facto head of the branch despite the fact that her knowledge of futures markets was rudimentary at best.

Her first mistake was when she delayed my promotion from internship to probation. I am an excellent trader, and was easily top five in my group. Of the 26, she promoted the twenty she liked, kept me and another guy in internship, and fired four.At around the same time, another recruitment drive happened and another twentyish interns were hired. I knew this was our beef rekindled and remixed, and I was actually surprised she held onto it for so long. It was also pretty unusual since the last thing my former boss did before he left was to promote me from the simulator to a live trading account. But I kept my head down and continued learning, often going back to my former boss and the permanent employees to get advice.

Another three months go by, and in the next evaluation I was shocked that I was still not brought up to probation, despite the fact that all of the new recruits of the second group had been promoted and I was easily the best and the only one trading live. I knew I was good at the job. The permanent guys all said so. The group I initially joined with was frequently asking me for advice. To their credit, a few of them were good, but most of them were still on sim, and as a rule, no one advanced to probation while still on sim. However, you could go live while on internship if you were good which is what had happened to me. So I was a live trader and making good money but I was still on internship and passed over twice. I couldn't let go of that.

I decided to talk to Gabby directly. I approached the senior guys and made my case, though I was careful not to put her in bad light. They agreed to help me and so they did. about a month after the she passed me over the second time, she gave me my promotion and I was now on probation. At this time, she was still unsure of her power and was still afraid of the permanent traders. Those guys were like gods.

Two months after my promotion, another evaluation and recruitment drive. I was not promoted. The group I started out with was now permanent, despite having only two of them trading live. The group I was currently with on probation were all promoted to permanent status. The group behind me on internship was all promoted to probation, and another group was hired. I let it go hoping she had got it out of her system. Sadly, she had not.

Round Two

Three months go by. I'm trading live and loving it, though still on probation. An evaluation comes up again and I'm not promoted, despite the fact that, contract to contract, I was almost on a level with the permanent employees. The group that found me on probation was advanced to permanent status to a man, and none of them were live. the group behind me caught up to me and a new batch of newbies were hired as interns. I couldn't let this one go either. I approached the original four permanent employees who were now my very good buddies and planned to do the same thing as last time. Only this time, it didn't work. Gabby had grown into her sadistic power and flatly refused to even consider my promotion even after she was presented with evidence that I was worth it. Her argument was along the lines of, ""I'm the boss so I can do whatever the hell I want.""

But I wasn't having that, so I contacted my former boss for help. At the time he had been promoted to head of operations, Africa. He was actually quite surprised, given my performance, that I was still on probation. Needless to say, the order came down from on high and Gabby looked like she was shitting six pineapples simultaneously as she handed my letter. And I thought that was the end of it. How wrong I was.

On the next recruitment she hired this girl, let's call her Sue. Sue was an intelligent person all round, but she didn't have the emotional quotient to handle the market (trading, as I was taught, requires two mental aspects: IQ and EQ. You can't improve IQ, but you can boost your EQ to deal with the numerous stresses that accompany the career). Sue had more than enough of the IQ part, but EQ, not so much. No worries, you can work on that.

Just to recap: The office now had about seventy employees. Of these, over thirty were permanent staff (me included) but only eleven were trading live. Another twenty or so were on probation, but only three were trading live. None of the interns were live. The office needed to stay profitable if it was to stay open which means that the money the fourteen live traders were paying the salaries of everyone in the office, rent, supplies, health insurance, pensions etc etc. Needless to say, corporate was not seeing a lot of returns from our branch, and as I came to learn later from my former boss, were considering shutting down the branch and costing us our jobs. But I digress.

The Last Straw

The Grade-A Bitch Gabby took advantage of an inconsolable and desperate Sue to try and get me for sexual harassment. This is how it went down. Remember all those people still on sim? Well, they all came to the eleven of us for trading advice and we did what we could to help them. We divided up the sim traders into groups and I was mentoring about four people. Sue was one of them. As any trader will tell you, the period before profitability is usually one of losses (unless you're really good) and is filled with stress and fear (hence the need for high EQ). It's normal, and you get through it.

Sue was going through such a rough patch one evening. We were going over her trades (bad trading day all around), when she just burst out crying. I know how it feels. I had shed my own tears as well. So comforted her the best I could. I held her hand and patted her on the back awkwardly (to this day I still don't know how to comfort someone) until she quieted down. What I didnt know was that Gabby had seen us.

As I came to learn later, she approached Sue the following day and made her an offer. Gabby would make sure Sue kept her job and would get her a lot of money if she stated that I had sexually harassed her. Sue took Gabby up on the offer and what followed was a nightmare.It started with a formal reprimand from corporate, a hearing in which I wasn't present to defend myself (because Gabby 'forgot' to send me the summons).

Apparently she lobbied quite viciously to get me fired. The only reason I was able to keep my job was that my former boss came to my defence. Despite his help, I lost my quarterly bonus (about US$100,000) and half of my holdback (about US$400,000). I also had to attend seminars which essentially involved watching the same film on sexual assault in the workplace (three hours long) until I stated, in writing, that I was an abuser and it would go on my record. I knew that if that happened, Gabby would have the ammunition she needed to ruin my life forever. So every day, I got into the office at seven in the morning, watched the three hour film until ten. Refuse to acknowledge it, then get to work, leave the office at 11:20 in the evening, rinse and repeat. For almost seven months. It was tiring, and torture, and Gabby never let me live it down.

All of the people I had been mentoring were transferred the day after my reprimand. A day after that, Gabby informed me via letter that my clip size had been cut from 1000 to 20 contracts. Yeah, I had to admit, I was bloodied. I was down, but the bitch didn't know that she should have ended me.

The Revenge

Step 1: Ruin Gabby's Career.

I started compiling all the shit that was happening to me in the office. It started when I realized that when I went out to lunch, someone would open my desk drawer and mess around with my notebook, where I jotted down my trading ideas for the day. The only person who had a key apart from me was Gabby. Apparently she had mastered my lunchtime routine for the entire 45 minute break and would open my locker when I was out smoking. She would then copy down my trading plans for the day and give them to Sue. I even saw them at it once, but they didn't see me. I documented it. I let it go on for a while so that I could establish a pattern via Sue's trades. I then approached two of the permanent traders who were closest to me and told them my plan.

Remember when I said almost no money was reaching corporate? and that there were only eleven live traders? The situation had only gotten worse. The office was now full but we had less that fifteen live traders. Live trading could only be approved by Head of Operations (my former boss) and he was a strict one. Now imagine that my earning capacity had been cut by over 90%. My two friends agreed to my plan and they slowed down their trading by around 50%. This essentially put the branch in the red and three weeks later, we were told that Head of Ops and other head honchos were coming down. The next phase involved getting Sue into a corner. Pleas, a tear or two, and revealing that I could prove she had been stealing my work were enough to get a written statement from her that Gabby had orchestrated my whole sexual harassment thing.

Step 2: Ruin Gabby's Marriage

It took only a little investigation on my part to realize than all those men who visited the office were actually Gabby's lovers. She would leave for two-hour 'lunches' with her phone turned off. I took advantage of one such period. Gabby left and I snuck into her office to find her Facebook profile open. Everyone knew she was always on there and it was a sore point because she had banned it for the rest of us minions. I got into her Messenger, and voila! Explicit texts, nudes, rants about her husband and his inadequacies, the six guys or so she had cheated with, all of it. I copy pasted the data into her private email which she was logged into as well (always clear cache, you guys) and sent it to my private email, then deleted it from her sent folder. Now I had the ammo on my phone ready to send.

Step 3: Ruin Gabby's Relationship with her Kids.

Now, I'll say right off the bat I'm not proud of this step. but to bust my justice nut, it wasn't enough to just send the info to her husband. So I waited for Thursday when I knew he would be passing by the office with the kids. The Pro Revenge gods saw fit to bless me that day, because it was the same day that Corporate Head Honchos were ridin' into town.


Thursday.

I was at the office at seven as usual with all my documentation from my appointment letter to the numerous rejected requests for promotion, sat through the three hour sexual harassment video (yes, I was still doing that), and waited for the Moment. The guys from corporate, my former boss included, arrived and went straight into a meeting with Gabby. I was quite certain that they would call me in to know why I had been attending a sexual harassment awareness class for almost a year, and I was ready for them.

I was called in after lunch, at about two. The question was asked and before I could answer, Gabby jumped on the bit like I knew she would. She went on a long rant about how I had been insubordinate, and how I liked to touch the female employees. I could tell from her grin that she thought she was winning.

And then I pulled out Sue's letter, and the grin curdled on her face. Sue was hurriedly called in and she backed my story. She said she was sorry. She was fired on the spot and told to go wait at the receptionist for her final check. I felt no sympathy. I was on a roll.

Next I pulled out my analysis of my trades and told them how Gabby had been breaking into my locker and stealing my notes for sue. Gabby denied it. Sue was called back in. She denied it. My former boss logged into the company network, pulled Sue's and my trading data. He compared the positions taken by both of us with my notes. He said it was true. Sue was fired again. They told me they would refund my confiscated bonus and holdback, with an extra 50 grand. That was fine by me. The justice was enough.

And then I spotted Gabby's husband heading into her office as usual, their two kids in tow. I pulled out my phone, grinned at her and said,

""You're husband is here.""

She turned around and saw him. She excused herself for a minute to tell him to wait.

My former boss said, ""Sure.""

I pressed send.

TL;DR. Grade-A Bitch tries to ruin my career because I humiliated her, I burn her life to the fucking ground.

EDIT: As for the aftermath, Gabby's husband absolutely lost his shit. Her office was glass-walled and the rest was open-plan so we could all hear what they were shouting about. He finally left with their kids in tow (sorry little ones) Gabby followed him still shouting at him. Then she saw us all standing around and the look on her face was priceless as she was wondering which aspect of her life to try and salvage. She let her husband go, but about an hour later she had been fired.

My favorite boss stayed behind since there was no one left. He stayed for a month training the lady who had been with the company the longest to take over as manager. She is easily the most brilliant mind I had ever met. Unfortunately the branch was still struggling with so many employees who were not generating income and they had to shut it down. But they transferred all the performing employees to their other various branches in London (2 branches) and India (9 branches). So I guess no one undeservedly lost their jobs.

I still stalk Gabby on Facebook. There have been a lot of ""I'm single because I'm too awesome"" posts of late. I almost feel sorry for her, but I remember the three-hour video and I stop being foolish. From what I could see on LinkedIn, Sue bounced around from firm to firm until she found a position as a research analyst. My favorite boss is still at the firm. We talk from time to time.

I took a break from trading for a while. After all the shit that went down, I needed a break so I didn't take them up on their offer to relocate to India. Went to work with a buddy of mine who has a consultancy. When I feel ready I'll go back to the market. For me at least, there is no other job as challenging and satisfying.

Wow. That was long. I think though that's the end of my ProRevenge :)

EDIT 2: Wow! This blew up! And gold too! Thank you kind strangers :). I'll try and get to all the messages in a bit. I'm glad you all enjoyed it. I did too. Well, the revenge part anyways :)

EDIT 3: So a few guys have stated that my story is bullshit on account of some claims. I will address the most common ones.

1. Guys have gone through my post history and have found another post I made on AskReddit where someone had asked when the last time I yawned was. It's a bit long and ridiculous. If you read it and honestly thought that it was actually true, I can't help you. You can choose to believe that I'm a footless, noseless, 80-year-old Vietnam vet or a young man trying to make his mark. It's your choice.

2. Others have found another post on AskReddit where someone asks people who like their jobs what they do. I said that I write papers and it's decent money. And that's true as well. I've been writing since my first year of college. I love doing it. I can write all day and then some. That job got me through college and I made enough to properly supplement my student loan. Do I still write? Yes. I do it because it's challenging, and as I said in that post, I learn something new every day. In fact I'm still writing now because my gig at the consultancy is not full-time. You can do more than one thing at a time, you know.

3. Yet other people have tracked down a random comment I made on a funny comment. I wrote something along the lines of 'I laughed so hard I was almost reprimanded at work.' And they ask, how can you say you write from home and you're still at the office? Yes. I can write at home and go to the office. It's what happens when you have time on your hands. I'm not a one-dimensional person whose job is their identity. And neither are you (hopefully).

4. Another guy found a comment of mine where I stated that I'm African. For some reason s/he didn't believe that Africans engage in financial markets or something? Idk.

5. By far the biggest reason is the fact that I'm active on the r/mensrights sub. And its true. I am. After I was falsely accused, of course I went digging around the internet looking for answers. It made me think. And as far as false accusations are concerned I fully support the MRA position. I am not ashamed of it. I'm not here to change your mind. And I definitely hope that you never have to go through what I went through. People have committed suicide because of that shit. It's not something to joke about.

6. Lastly, to the person who doesn't believe that one can make that much money straight out of college: Yes that much money.

Whew. Got that off my chest. Oh, and another person wondered how HR could end up as head of the branch. I think I specified earlier that she was HR/Ops. The Ops part should have qualified her to be branch head if she wasn't utterly incompetent.

In the end, though, I guess you just have to choose whether to believe or disbelieve.

8nq3ps,7,2018-06-01,Feeling like a train that was derailed at high speed.,OceanidNomad,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/8nq3ps/feeling_like_a_train_that_was_derailed_at_high/,"I’m (28/F) a Masters student and I’m in the process of writing my thesis... I’ve been in this process for the last 2 years. Because of this delay, I feel like an absolute failure. I don’t know what I’m doing it for anymore and I think I’ve lost my mojo. 

In the past, I always moved forward. Fast. I was always on the lookout for the next big challenge.  Growing up on a small Caribbean island, I felt my life out in the great big world couldn’t start fast enough. Despite my fear of failure and general anxiety when it comes to having to perform in any way, I picked a competitive and intensive Bachelors program. I love to learn. I traveled solo and worked for two years after graduating, and then picked this Masters program thinking it was exactly what I wanted. 

I snoozed through the first two semesters, but  my grades remained good. My internship was uninspiring, though with a good organization, so people (family and the like) were all very impressed. I didn’t and don’t believe I deserve the praise, or the good grades. Whenever I try to tell people (mainly family) that I feel like I’ve lost my way, they point to my “achievements” and say that I’ll just get through it like I always have, but I don’t believe it this time. I also can’t take pride in these achievements: I always either forget how hard I worked for them, or write it off as luck or something. 
It’s obvious to me now that this program isn’t for me. It’s interesting, sure, but I find a whole lot of things are interesting. I’ve pushed myself into this direction academically, because I thought it had the right mix of practicality and ambition, and just enough overlap with my own interests to convince myself. My true interests lie in a completely different field. 

I feel like I’ve run into quicksand at full speed and failed to realize what had happened in time to stop myself sinking further. I think, with the way I’ve handled stress on previous occasions, this could have been expected. For the first time in my life, I have no idea how to proceed. 

I’ve changed thesis topics twice now. This time I managed to swing it in a way that it matches my true interests more closely, even though it’s in a different field (my supervisor and coordinator are absolutely fantastic). 

Still, by now it’s gone on so long that I just don’t believe I’ll ever finish it. On top of that, I feel guilty for whining and think I should simply get on with it. I truly believe I’m weak. Friends who have been more understanding have only said I’m doing right by myself to take time to figure things out, but I just see myself as a massive failure hiding behind anxiety or whatever. 

Funnily enough, if a friend came to me with these issues, I wouldn’t dream of thinking they’re pathetic or calling them weak. I don’t actually think that of other people. Just me. 

Have any of you gone through this? Any tips or insights to share from your experiences? 

Tl;dr I’ve been writing my Masters thesis for two years, changed topics twice, but can’t seem to finish it. I’ve stopped believing I ever will and hate myself for it. "

I have a final Partner interview involving a case study, towards the end of next week. Without getting too much into detail, these are the facts:

* The case is going to involve technology (technology strategy intern role)

* I have no idea how to structure cases


The main problem above is, I don't know how to structure a case.

**What I have done**

I've done a lot of research involving cases. I've looked at *alot* of examples. I've written a sample case above, and I'm wondering if this is the right way to structure the case.

Here's an example of a case I did: [CASE LINK](https://imgur.com/a/P66n96n)

Questions

* Is the above considered a complete case? If not, what am I missing? EG: a ""Recommendations"" section?

* Is it ok if I don't specifically mention the framework that I'm going to use? I don't really know much frameworks but I do know what to look out for in terms of markets, competitors, etc.

**I am willing to hire someone if they are interested in going over some technology cases / prep with me**

Looking for any and all advice!!!

8nr3ob,1,2018-06-01,[26/m] My girlfriend [27/f] is impossible to communicate with,throwz7816,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8nr3ob/26m_my_girlfriend_27f_is_impossible_to/,"Hi. I am (26M) in a relationship (27F) and not sure what to think or do anymore. I am going to wrap up 6 years of my relationship as compressed as possible. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I fell in love with a girl even before I even knew a spec of her personality. She was gorgeous and I needed 8 months for enough confidence to approach her. I then did and we started dating. I was completely love struck and we lived on a cloud for about 1 year.  She was genuinely nice most of time so it was all good. However, she did have this -to me- irrational reasoning going on. I was in the middle of my engineering degree, and worked my ass off, for which she had little understanding. I always had trouble making sufficient time and she really disliked it. She had very few friends too so she was mostly just sitting at her home waiting for me. 

I tried talking to her, but she was always so unreceptive to my views. It made me doubt my own opinions. I am sure they’re not all right, but sometimes they must at least be somewhere in the middle of what the other person is thinking right? I wasn’t out with my friends or anything like that, I was literally working for either school or my student job. This nuisance for me, and big deal for her, kept on for about 2 more years until circumstances dictated we moved in together. She hated it at home, and if we lived together she could apply for an internship in our student city. And so it went, i subconsciously got guilt tripped into this, I didn’t dare say no. The apartment we chose was also optimal for her and not for me. The engineering faculty was a 30 min bike ride, whereas hers was 10 min walking distance. But, it was all good because she had a pseudo-medical condition forbidding her to ride her bike. 

Living together was hell. She always came back home stressed and very short tempered. She takes her parents for granted and can be very bitchy and unrespectful to them at times, and it felt like I was getting this treatment now. She slept very light and was REALLY unfriendly in the bed at night. It made me sleep on the coach voluntarily. I felt like I gave a lot and she took it for granted. This was the first time I started looking at other girls. I was 22 and also losing my hair. I felt some kind of urgency to it, as in, I need to decide if I want her for the rest of my life - otherwise I need to find another ASAP.  

After living together for 5 months we got into separate apartments again. I loved her to death, but I just needed some space at this point. We continued to see each other daily. I had to. She couldn’t be convinced I still loved her. As much as I tried to explain, she was again not receptive. The relationship had become such a drag at this point. I was constantly forced into a defensive position, making me go crazy and I really felt like the bad guy here. In her defence though, I am terrible at making small talk and mostly live in my own world. I was, especially at that time, also very self-involved. Probably got some narcissistic behaviours as well, so that doesn’t make me a ray of sunshine either. But I did everything for her (except for making enough time). I really loved this girl so much, for a reason I didn’t know. 

I started going out again, pushed by my existential crisis induced by hair loss, I also started talking to other girls. I became unfaithful, while knowing she would never do the same. I loved her, but I didn't feel really guilty either. I would only cheat during ‘mini-breaks’ or during huge fights. But that’s a very sad excuse.  We started breaking up for real, getting back together again, rinse repeat. I was an asshole to her. Not sure what I wanted. Didn’t want to be with her, but also couldn’t stand the thought of not ‘having’ her anymore. She didn’t deserve this. I guess I was full on narcissist at this point. The feelings between us remained very intense. Both love-wise and hate-wise. Fast forward 2 years, we are at a point where the frustrations at both ends are terrible. I worked on myself and my narcissistic tendencies. But we have complete different views on what goes wrong. I was a very apologetic guy at first, but I stopped doing that and things took a turn for the worse. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore. Our goals aren’t aligned, and she can never take some responsibility that she also might be wrong. I literally always, minus 3-4 times in 6 years, make up. If I try to explain what’s bothering me, I end up being in the wrong. It drives me crazy and makes me doubt my views, because I know I am not a 100% mentally sane guy either. We are both faced 180degrees from each other when it comes to our problems. But I love her so much. She still is skeptical that I really love her, and to be fair after what happened, I understand why she’d think that at his point. Some times the prospects of being with someone else seem so appealing. But I would miss her so much. It’s been 6 years, we do have very special feelings for each other. I never met a girl like her, and I still can’t pinpoint why.  Some times I think I am just afraid of being alone and balding at the age of 26. That I won’t find someone else anymore. But I do feel a lot of love and pain when I think of losing her. I am genuinely happy when I see her. Until she misinterprets a stupid signal and I am forced into defending myself until she becomes approachable. She’s not a bad girl by any means. I just can’t seem to make it work… I am a pretty analytical guy but I am and have been absolutely clueless in about these affaires.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. And thanks for reading. Any opinions, advice, or even judgements because of my unfaithfulness are welcome. 

TL;DR: inability to communicate makes me doubt my own views and is driving me crazy. I feel guilty but I am not sure if I should. "

Kent u de conceptregiovisie van de Treant Zorggroep? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.   
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u van de plannen, zoals beschreven in de conceptregiovisie van Treant om de acute, complexe en klinische zorg in de toekomst te concentreren in een interventiecentrum in het hart van de regio?  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals u weet is de organisatie van de zorg in de regio primair de verantwoordelijkheid van de zorgaanbieders en zorgverzekeraars. Het is dus niet aan mij om te bepalen of Treant wel of niet over zou moeten gaan tot de bouw van een nieuw interventiecentrum. Wel vind ik het uiteraard belangrijk dat Treant alle betrokken partijen goed betrekt bij zijn plannen met betrekking tot het zorgaanbod in de regio en hier goed over communiceert.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Treant heeft mij laten weten dat het voornemen om een interventiecentrum te bouwen te maken heeft met het feit dat het ziekenhuis zorg verleent in een regio waarin sprake is van bevolkingsdaling, ontgroening en vergrijzing. Oost-Groningen en Oost-Drenthe zijn zogenaamde krimp- en anticipeerregio’s waarin ten gevolge van de genoemde veranderingen in de bevolkingssamenstelling de zorgvraag sterker verandert dan in andere regio’s. Treant is van oordeel dat concentratie van acute, complexe klinische zorg een manier is om deze zorg toch in een dunbevolkt gebied te kunnen behouden. Ook hoopt Treant op deze manier een aantrekkelijke werkgever te blijven voor medisch-specialisten en andere zorgprofessionals.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Naar mijn mening is het, meer nog dan in andere regio’s, belangrijk dat zorginstellingen en zorgverzekeraars in krimp- en anticipeerregio’s tijdig nadenken over de consequenties van deze veranderingen in de bevolkingssamenstelling voor de zorgvraag van de toekomst, en dat zij proberen het zorgaanbod in de regio hier zo goed als mogelijk op aan te passen.

Wat is uw reactie op de twee opmerkingen in de Regiovisie ‘voor de spoedeisende zorg en intensive care verandert er wat Treant betreft niets’ en ‘een belangrijke kanttekening is dat nieuwe landelijke veldnormen samen met een chronisch tekort aan medisch specialisten in Noord-Nederland gevolgen kunnen hebben voor volledig behoud van de Spoedeisende Hulp afdelingen op alle drie de ziekenhuislocaties van Treant’? Deelt u de mening dat dit weinig zekerheid geeft over het openblijven van de Spoedeisende hulpen op alle drie de locaties in de toekomst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De concept regiovisie van Treant is niet alleen een concept document, maar ook een visiedocument. Er is nog geen sprake van definitieve besluitvorming over alle onderdelen van deze visie, hiervoor moet nog een besluitvormingsproces worden doorlopen. Daar wil ik niet op vooruit lopen. Wat de spoedeisende zorg betreft moet overigens hoe dan ook aan de 45 minuten-norm voor de spreiding en beschikbaarheid van deze zorg worden voldaan.    
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gezien in de conceptregiovisie staat aangegeven dat over de afdelingen verloskunde en kindergeneeskunde later een besluit wordt genomen, deelt u de mening dat deze afdelingen essentieel zijn voor &amp;#40;het behoud van&amp;#41; een volwaardig &amp;#40;basis&amp;#41;ziekenhuis en dat concentratie van deze zorg onwenselijk is en een voorbode tot het sluiten van andere afdelingen van een ziekenhuis?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Inmiddels heeft Treant zijn voorgenomen besluit met betrekking tot de klinische verloskunde en klinische kindergeneeskunde bij Treant gepubliceerd. Daarin heeft Treant aangegeven het voornemen te hebben om deze zorg te concentreren op de locatie Emmen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Tegelijk met mijn antwoorden op deze Kamervragen stuur ik ook een brief aan de Tweede Kamer met betrekking tot dit voorgenomen besluit van Treant, waar ik graag naar verwijs voor mijn standpunt over dit voorgenomen besluit en de acties die onder meer de Inspectie Gezondheidszorg en Jeugd i.o. en de Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit naar aanleiding hiervan namens mij hebben genomen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ervan uitgaande dat over de concept regiovisie zal worden gesproken met belanghebbenden in de regio, waaronder huisartsen, patiëntenorganisaties en inwoners, hoe wordt gegarandeerd dat de meningen van deze groepen belanghebbenden serieus worden geworden en worden meegenomen in de uiteindelijke definitieve regiovisie? Hoe wordt gegarandeerd dat deze groepen belanghebbenden niet eigenlijk voor een al voldongen feit worden gesteld?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Treant heeft laten weten sinds begin 2017 zeer regelmatig met de betrokken partijen binnen het ziekenhuis en in de regio overleg te hebben gevoerd, en zich ervan bewust te zijn dat dit soort veranderingen alleen verantwoord door te voeren is in goede dialoog met alle relevante partijen. De kunst is iedereen te betrekken en een stem te geven. Daartoe organiseert Treant in juni bijvoorbeeld ook een bijeenkomst met verschillende stakeholders.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Dat laat onverlet dat het uiteindelijk aan Treant is om &amp;#40;in overleg met de zorgverzekeraars en andere partijen in de regio&amp;#41; een besluit te nemen over het zorgaanbod, en dat er bij veranderingen altijd partijen zullen zijn die niet tevreden zullen zijn.   
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vindt u het realistisch om nog voor de zomer te komen met een definitieve regiovisie waarin alle belangen van alle partijen zijn gewogen en zijn meegenomen, terwijl buiten het ziekenhuis tot op heden niemand betrokken is bij de ontwikkeling van de conceptregiovisie van Treant?  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op de vragen 2 en 3. Ik vind het juist heel positief dat Treant een concept visie heeft ontwikkeld op de ziekenhuiszorg in de regio en hierover tijdig het gesprek aangaat met alle betrokken partijen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Waarom is er al een keuze gemaakt voor één van de drie geformuleerde scenario’s in de concept regiovisie voordat er met partijen buiten het ziekenhuis gesproken wordt? Was het volgens u niet netter geweest om andere partijen ook een stem te geven in deze ingrijpende beslissing?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op vraag 5.   
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u ervan dat Treant aangeeft 15 miljoen euro te moeten bezuinigen en daardoor veel verpleegkundigen te moeten ontslaan &amp;#40;er zullen 93 banen verdwijnen&amp;#41; maar dat Treant tegelijkertijd wel een nieuw interventiecentrum wil gaan bouwen? Hoe verhoudt dit zich volgens u tot de opmerking uit de concept regiovisie: ‘goede zorg kun je alleen blijven bieden als je voldoende gekwalificeerd personeel in dienst hebt. De gevolgen van de krappe arbeidsmarkt ervaren we nu al en wordt de komende jaren alleen maar groter’? Is het niet verstandiger om voldoende personeel te behouden dan een nieuw gebouw neer te laten zetten? Is daarbij al enig inzicht in de kosten die de bouw van een dergelijk nieuw interventiecentrum met zich mee zal brengen? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vindt u het logisch dat Treant pleit voor een nieuw interventiecentrum maar de haalbaarheid hiervan nog niet heeft onderzocht? Wie zal dit haalbaarheidsonderzoek &amp;#40;onafhankelijk&amp;#41; gaan uitvoeren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vindt u de wens van de bestuursvoorzitter van Treant om het nieuwe interventiecentrum binnen drie tot vijf jaar te realiseren ook niet erg ambitieus? 3&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
8, 9 en 10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie mijn antwoord op vraag 2.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Treant heeft mij laten weten dat het verdwijnen van 93 van de circa 3000 arbeidsplaatsen binnen de ziekenhuisgroep niet te maken heeft met de bouw van een nieuw interventiecentrum, maar met de ombuigingsmaatregelen die het ziekenhuis moet nemen om weer een financieel gezonde organisatie te worden. Hierop is een sociaal plan van toepassing, waarin staat beschreven dat er geen gedwongen ontslagen zullen vallen. Treant zet in op zoveel mogelijk behoud van medewerkers door tijdelijke contracten niet te verlengen, en waar mogelijk een nieuwe functie binnen Treant care aan te bieden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Verder heeft Treant mij laten weten de plannen met betrekking tot &amp;#40;onder meer&amp;#41; de bouw van een interventiecentrum eerst intern en extern te willen bespreken en pas daarna, samen met het Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis Assen, de haalbaarheid van het interventiecentrum te willen onderzoeken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u ervan dat Treant haar belofte schendt dat er drie volwaardige ziekenhuizen in Emmen, Stadskanaal en Hoogeveen zouden blijven bestaan. 4&amp;#41; 5&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is mij niet duidelijk naar welke uitspraken u verwijst. Treant was voornemens om in de jaren 2015-2020 &amp;#40;aldus het beleidskader waarnaar u verwijst&amp;#41; op alle drie de locaties onder meer klinische verloskunde aan te bieden. Op dit moment, dus enkele jaren na het uitbrengen van het beleidskader 2015-2020, heeft Treant naar eigen zeggen echter onvoldoende kinderartsen om op alle drie de locaties goede klinische verloskunde en klinische kindergeneeskunde te kunnen waarborgen. Voor mijn reactie op het voorgenomen besluit van Treant om deze zorg op één locatie te concentreren verwijs ik u graag naar de brief hierover die ik vandaag, tegelijk met mijn antwoorden op deze Kamervragen, naar de Tweede Kamer stuur.

8nt02z,77,2018-06-01,"Goth Ninja RPG Retrospective, Or How to Have Fun with Fashion",Thonyfst,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8nt02z/goth_ninja_rpg_retrospective_or_how_to_have_fun/,"When I started out in MFA, there was one post in particular that changed how I approached fashion. It wasn’t a Killshot restock post, nor was it a MFA uniform guide, or a boot conditioning album. No, it was something considerably more ridiculous than that. [It was this three part Goth Ninja rpg guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/153mk1/goth_ninja_rpg_strategy_guide_part_i_general/) from /u/GarleyCavidson. And even though I didn’t start buying “goth ninja” clothing for several more years, that guide always remained in the back of my mind when I started to really get into fashion.

It’s frankly embarassing how much that guide set the course for how I dress today. I’ve learned so much since then, as have fashion communities in general; I’ve experimented with a lot of brands and styles, yet I still like to go back to this guide every once in a while and just skim it. I think it’s one of the best examples of how fashion advice can still be fun and not be limited to “how should I dress for this internship interview/first date/first job out of college/wedding?” Still, I think there are a few points to keep in mind while reading it.

First: goth ninja was used as a catch-all term for avant-garde fashion, and it’s still liberally used whenever someone wears all-black clothing. It never meant much to begin with-- it was just in good fun. You can have two drastically different outfits from two drastically different users, and newcomers will still refer to them with that same vague term. That’s the problem with trying to classify fashion into groups; style names have always been arbitrary and will vary from person to person. If you’re genuinely interested in these brands, I wouldn’t use the term goth ninja except as a joke when discussing it with others.

Second, a lot of users took issue with the original thread, for various reasons. Some hated the term, finding it cringe-worthy; others couldn’t believe people actually dressed like this, finding that cringe-worthy as well. There were other issues, with SZ users complaining that their images were being used without their permission or that now they would be flooded with clueless MFA users. And all of them were valid concerns, in some part. But the guide was always tongue-in-cheek. It was made by someone who enjoyed the style but was having fun with it and wanted to develop their own understanding through a different lens.

Finally, despite all these caveats, the guide still *worked*-- at least for me. It introduced me to a world of fashion I didn’t even know existed before, for better or for worse, depending on your feelings toward this small subset of fashion. It was an entertaining way to explain a trend, and it inspired me to have more fun with clothing. 
/u/GarleyCavidson later updated his guide with [a more serious and thorough look](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1rd421/goth_ninja_guide_20/) at some of the different trends that fell under the avant-garde umbrella. While the post shows its age with some of the specific brands and references, it’s still a good introduction to the avant-garde world and the different relationships between the brands if you're interested in that world.

But what if you aren't interested in this ""goth ninja"" trend? What can you take away from that guide? 

Fashion can be *fun*. Internet fashion can become so caught up with tiny details (are my pants 1 cm too long, is this invisible scratch enough for me to send this shoe back, do I look tall enough from this angle) that it can become very easy to lose sight of fashion as something to enjoy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be by classifying yourself into some rpg class. But if you’re like me, and you grew up playing rpgs, then it can be entertaining doing it. Play with fashion and how you view it. It’s a lot more interesting that way.

And so, without further ado, some new pics with new class names, for the 2018 ~~Goth Ninja~~ **Fashion RPG** patch. Take nothing seriously, even the fits. Post fits of your own, with your own dumb class names. They don’t need to be goth ninja/avant-garde; they just need to be yours. It’s all just fashion anyway. You might as well have fun.

All images and class names are either from the user themselves or something I chose with their permission.

8nt6xb,11,2018-06-01,How do y'all deal with roommates,tr44e2,entj,https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8nt6xb/how_do_yall_deal_with_roommates/,"Feel like my personality type has been an important factor in my irritations lately, so I figured I'd give it a go here.

I'm soon to be entering my last year of college. I transferred to school here, and am finally coming into my own with regards to developing professional skills and managing my time effectively. I work through the school, and because my hours are capped, it only partially offsets my rent for the semester, but my boss is a professor who gives solid career/academic advice and is really understanding when I get busy. Everything is great on that front.

However, at home I have 4 roommates. We each have our own rooms. Three of them are doing unskilled labor in retail and one is a professional software developer. I get along with all of them on a friendship basis \(two of them were my friends before I moved in.\) However, I do the lion's share of the cleaning and do all of the DIY fixing around the house. After me, the software developer does the most. Other than him and I, nobody cleans the kitchen/does the dishes/takes the trash and recycling out. And he helps fund any DIY fixing that I do \(supplies for holes in the wall, tears in the screen door/windows, etc.\) Two of them also disproportionately create more trash and recycling with the amount of takeout and beer that they consume. The last one likes to cook because he is following a specific diet, but always leaves the kitchen in complete disarray when he does. There is still a pot with burnt meat on the bottom on the side of the kitchen sink \(I tried cleaning it by boiling vinegar in it and was only able to lift half of it, told him to do the rest\) and a pan with bits of stir\-fry that have become moldy in it. They've been there for months now. I've had to do deep cleanings every couple of weeks because of how filthy the space becomes. We have two full bathrooms. 4 of us use one, and the other guy uses the other. The sink will not drain in his bathroom, it is revoltingly filthy, and it has a horrible odor. I also clean our bathroom.

I spend well over 40 hours a week studying and working. I get to do the majority of it from home, which is nice, but perhaps it makes me more sensitive to things being filthy in the common areas. I've been overlooking all of this and making time to clean up after them, but now one of my roommates is championing the idea of having a sixth person move in with us. 

This sixth person lived with us before and moved out a month after I moved in to move to a cheaper cost of living area. He is also a filthy individual and has been known to eat peoples' food without asking, a behavior that really amps me up because I meticulously plan everything that I want to cook for the week in an effort to spend less time on it and simultaneously be healthy. The software developer and I were vehemently against this, as nobody is performing their household duties and we would not like to deal with the burden of yet another, and made it clear enough, but the other roommate still felt it was okay to go through with telling him yes anyway because we have a spare room and a majority \(note: the people who don't give a shit about the condition of anything in this house\) was okay with it. He even wanted to make a concession for this guy on the rent, and clear out a space that we use for storage so that he could work there \(I've tried getting people on board with helping clear out that space so that we could all use it, but to no avail\) even though we've been doing an even split for nearly a year now.

This whole thing really rubs me the wrong way and I probably should have made that even clearer. I thought just saying no to the whole thing was enough for it to be called off. I have a friend in the area who is in the same year as me and has the same major \(it's really nice to bond over this!\) and she's looking to live off campus. She asked me if I wanted to leave a few months ago, but I felt just happy enough with how things were, but now that things are being shaken up, I've reached out to her again and we're looking for places. She's currently doing an internship overseas, so it's up to me to find a place that works for both of us, but at least I know that she needs a place even more than I do and is very clean and reasonable.

TL;DR: As ENTJs, do you guys think it'd be worth it for the peace of mind to spend more on rent for a year to live with less people / whose interests align? I'm trying to graduate with the highest grades possible so that I could be an eligible candidate for top grad programs, and am doing pretty damn well at it as it stands now. But it could be done with less stress and I feel that I'd have a good portion of excess time, especially as I take graduate\-level courses this year, if I didn't deal with this nonsense. My rent is dirt cheap right now and my commute is great for the price I pay, but I have an electric bike that gets me around easily to areas that are not as easily accessible, so I feel like the whole area is open to me. And most of the furniture and kitchen appliances here are mine, so it's not like I'd even need to buy anything to make up for what is currently shared."
8ntp3h,30,2018-06-01,Creepy TP - Part1 (an opinion piece to pass the time),tuckerm33,TickTockManitowoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TickTockManitowoc/comments/8ntp3h/creepy_tp_part1_an_opinion_piece_to_pass_the_time/,"I promised last week I was working on a piece about TP and that I would post it soon.

Here it is.

His testimony never sat well with me.  He has too much to say.  There is way too much detail, way too much self reflection and it is loaded with large amounts of self importance.  It feels like he really wanted everyone to come away with the sense that he was the most important person in her life.  I think he wanted to be the most person in her life, but I don't believe he was.  He used his testimony to tell a story that painted him as Teresa's hero and protector.  When I read his testimony, all I keep thinking is , this guy was a creeper.

This all comes from TP's testimony from day 1 of the Avery trial, straight from the transcript, word for word.  I encourage anyone to read and verify, but I promise you I have not edited the words or the context of them.  What I did do however is present the testimony in a more flowing order.  It really tells a more accurate story.

One of the things that always stood out to me was that When TP was asked simple questions,  he routinely offered very lengthy answers.  He provided information beyond the scope of the question and often finished with some kind of closing remark like, ""that""s why"", but his ""that's why"" is often in summary of some tangent that he went on about and not about the actual question asked of him by KK.

I'm not surprised that KK let TP go on and on the way he did.  TP was KK's biggest character witness for Teresa, even bigger than MOK and his crying routine about the blue ribbon.  There is a big problem with TP's testimony however as it would serve to be a character builder for Teresa.  The problem I see is that TP's testimony is really all about him and not much about Teresa at all in the end.

I don't minimize Teresa's talents.  I'm sure she was fine photographer in her own right.  I just don't think that her talents were really what TP had in the forefront of his mind.

Let's dive in.

Example 1

Kratz to TP \(asking TP about Teresa\)

* Q. Was she technically good at what she did?
* A. Yes. The university \-\- I also went to school, but not here in Green Bay. They teach you the book. And how should I say, you should know the rules before you know how to break them. And that's part of out in the field. And that's why I think the internship program is a good program. Because it has \-\- In many different fields, people come out and see what it's really like in everyday life and not so much how the book says it. But you have got to know the book, but you have to break the rules when you are out there.

*""And that's why I think the internship program is a good program.""*

No one asked him that.  Instead of pointing out her actual technical skills, he's offering an assessment on the internship program.  He may be vaguely eluding to the idea that she had good technical skills because of the school, but all I get from that answer is that he really likes the internship program.  He never once talks about Teresa at all.  It's almost like he's priming the pipe for another intern to be sent his way.  Don't believe me though, read it in his own words.

Two paragraphs prior in the testimony:

Example 2

Kratz to TP

* Q. Can you tell the jury how you first became knowledgeable about Ms Halbach?
* A. Through an internship program through the university.   She approached me to do an internship through the university and I took her on as an intern. And from there on, through the internship program which ends when she graduates...

Wow, that's a tongue twister right?  What kind of answer is that?  An intern from the university internship program which is doing and internship program from the university so she can graduate using the internship.

Word count:  Internship 3 times, Intern 1 time, university 2 times program 2 times and just in case it wasn't clear which university, Kratzo helps him out:

* Q. What university was this?
* A. University of Green Bay.

 \- \- \- \- \- \- \- 

Great, OK, so far we know that TP likes the Internship program and that he likes to break the rules when you're ""out there"", whatever that is supposed to mean. Break the rules how?  He's taking wedding photos and family portraits.  My bet, he's not talking rules of the craft such as developing pictures and darkroom techniques.  No, he's talking breaking ethical or legal rules such as taking nude photographs, though this never is brought up during the trial curiously. 

This was perhaps part of the gentlemen's agreement and though Kratz probably sold it to Strang and Buting as a concern to keep it out of the trial for Teresa's family sake, it was bs.  It was not to protect Teresa's image.  My guess is it was really to protect TP himself.  TP didn't want LE coming around his studio and digging in to his business.  Strang and Buting got played on this one.

Example 3

* TP:  ""As far as working for me, or I should say really with me, she was a go\-getter, like I said, she had that passion. And I looked and as a \-\- when you are a staff photographer for someone, you have got to abide by their ways of doing things,their policies, because you are working for them, so you have to do stuff their way.""

He makes it sound like this is some high pressure job working for Hollywood elite and millionaires. Staff photographers, which he wants to imply they are, are those that work for newspapers or magazines and take pictures of current events, people and high profile locals.  TP took pictures of weddings, families and nudes. It was not exactly the high demand red carpet lifestyle that he seems to want to make it out to be.  Perhaps he never became the type of photographer he wanted to be, but he certainly was not leading a glamorous life in Greenbay.  Either way, how is this about Teresa?

Example 4

* TP: ""So, yes, I did mentor her in a lot of different areas. Thirty\-eight years of Experience, and I wanted to share that with her, because I could see that she was, basically, like me when I came out of college \-\- school. I was eager. I had the passion. We had a lot of similarities. I graduated from \-\- with a degree in photography.  I was the \-\- also worked the photo school newspaper and she did. And I worked at many different studios before I moved up here in the Green Bay market. So we had that same background. And I think it's a duty for any of us to share what we have learned, our experiences with someone up and coming.""

Wow!  This sounds like something someone says after a first date doesn't it? ""OMG, we have so much in common, I hope he calls me"" /s    This guy has it for her bad.  Are you seeing it yet?

OK, here's where we are at now.  TP see's something special in Teresa we have learned. Something he hasn't seen since,  well, himself he says.  He went to school in WI too he says, though not Greenbay like Teresa did, which he seems to lament.  Other than which school they went to, they have soooo much in common.  

 \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- 

So he takes her on as an intern and shows her the trade.  It's his duty he says.  I guess there is some sort of photographic oath? Thirty\-eight years of experience and he just wanted to share that with her.  This just screams of an excuse to be around her all of the time.  He probably told his wife that too.  ""But honey, it's my duty to share myself with her and show her things I know"".

There was a big problems for TP. Graduation was quickly approaching.  He was about to lose Teresa when the program ended.  He had been slowly working his charm on her, at least he believed, but he needed more time to seal the deal, \(in his mind\).  He had to think quickly.  He had to find a way to keep her around. But what could he do??? Hmmmm Ureka!

Remember TP's mantra? ""You have got to know the book, but you have to break the rules when you are out there"".  He's about to break them real bad, morally.

Example 5

Kratz to TP

* Q. I think you mentioned that you had seen something in her that actually made you offer her a job; can you tell us what that was?
* A. Well, you know, in this field, you see \-\- and I have worked with other interns and some of them do have the drive, the passion, the want and knowing that \-\- Being a photographer, a lot of people think it's very easy. It's a lot of hours. It's a lot of dedicated work.  And she had that and I haven't seen that many people in a lot of years. And I was impressed with that. She knew the responsibility, the sacrifices it took. And she was eager to learn. She was consistently asking questions and from \-\- doing different projects and so on. So I was very impressed with her and that's why I asked her to stay on.

Ramble much TP?  Holy crap. this guy is suddenly stumbling and talking in half sentences like when your wife finds a phone number on a piece of paper in your pants pocket in the laundry and without warning she demands, ""Who's phone number is this""!?

I'm sorry, but TP is way over selling this here.  He knows the only reason he offered her a job was to keep her from leaving.  He was an old creeper and he had the hots for young Teresa, period.  At this point in the testimony, I imagine TP is thinking, ""Damn it Kratz, we didn't rehearse that question you asshole.  You caught me off guard you""!

 \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- 

So, TP asks her to stay on.  He gives her space in his studio, gives her keys to the place, let's her use all of the equipment and let's her take nude photos of people.  This guy would have done anything to keep her from leaving like... not even charging her for the space she was using.   Seriously, if you are his wife, are you buying this crap?  Would you put up with this crap.  I doubt it.

Example 6

* TP ""we did something that no one has done before. She started her own business, not be in competition but complimenting each other.  So she worked out of my studio; she used all the facilities of the studio, but she ran her own business through that \-\- through  my studio.""

Something that no one has done before?  Really?  Two people in one rented store front.  Is that really the first time anyone ever thought of something like that?  I know I am being a bit sarcastic, but it's for a reason.  This guy is full of himself I can barely keep down my lunch as I type this.  

If no one can see that this guy was in love with Teresa, they are blind.  He basically bribed her to stay.  He didn't want her to leave.  He couldn't let her go.  I think he believed that if he had more time with her, he would be able to win her over and have a chance to be with her.  That was his end game, though I don't think he really thought it out very well.

He had the hots for her and probably imagined kissing her and making love to her and all sorts of consensual things, but he was delusional if he thought it was ever going to happen.

8nu6xx,25,2018-06-01,I accidentally came out to my little sister,Tara_ntula,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/8nu6xx/i_accidentally_came_out_to_my_little_sister/,"I don’t identify with my bisexuality very much. I’ve only dated one person in my life, my current SO, and he’s a cis guy. I didn’t fully accept I was bisexual until two years in the relationship. I’m planning on marrying the guy so there’s really no way to really “act” on my bisexuality.

In addition, while I’m sexually attracted to women more than men, it’s harder for me to develop crushes on girls. For these reasons, I kinda stay away from including myself in the LGBT community and keep my sexuality to myself unless they’re close friends.

I made it back home yesterday to take a summer internship. My 17 year old little sister asked me if I wanted to go to the pride festival next Sunday in my home city with her friends. Her friends are pretty cool so I had no issue with being sort of a chaperone. Then she said, “unless you’d feel awkward there”. I thought she meant in a...homophobic way but she meant hanging out with kids. I can’t really remember what I said, but she basically picked up that I wasn’t saying something so after some badgering I told her I like girls.

She awkwardly asked me what type of girls I liked and then made a comment about how she should’ve known because I listen to Hayley Kiyoko (*eyeroll*). She’s accepting but I can’t help but feel it was a mistake. I feel almost guilty  identifying with bisexuality due to my only experience being with men. and I definitely do not ever want my parents or other family members knowing. A cousin of mine is dating a woman and my grandparents have basically disowned her. I’ve had aunts and uncles who have actively described homosexuality as “wrong” and “nasty”. My parents would still love me and “accept” me but they are Christians and I know their true feelings about homosexuality even though they have tried to “get with the times”. Speaking about it to one family member instead of just keeping with friends feels...wrong? Like I made it more real than I should have.

I don’t know if this is the right place to post this or if posts like this are even allowed. If not, I’ll delete. I just needed to vent somewhere because I’m feeling really uneasy for some reason."
8nuaft,8,2018-06-01,I [19/M] keep hurting my long-distance girlfriend [21/F] by causing pointless fights.,ldandinter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nuaft/i_19m_keep_hurting_my_longdistance_girlfriend_21f/,"To start off, my girlfriend and I have been together for around 5 months and we are an interracial couple, with her being indian and me being white. This is important to the story, I promise.

When we started dating everything was pretty good, there have definitely been a few bumps along the way but I feel as though we've bounced back from the majority of them pretty well. It should be noted that this is both of our's first relationship, we've both only been on a couple of dates otherwise. Despite overcoming a lot of struggles, one struggle that still remains for us is that because she's indian, her father expects her to marry indian and uphold the values of indian culture. We both met at college last year and I know she loves me, but she has said many times that I won't be introduced as a boyfriend to her dad unless things were engagement-level serious. I have tried my best to approach the situation with love and tenderness, but it just hurts a bit when she's met my parents, my friends, and even my grandparents have expressed interest in meeting her, but on occasions where we see her indian friends out, she'll introduce me as a ""good friend"". It should be noted that I have met all of her siblings as her boyfriend and she's even offered to let me meet her dad as a ""friend"", so she definitely is trying her best, I just don't know how I should feel about this.

She recently left at the beginning of May for an internship that's 2,200 miles away, and it has definitely put a strain on our relationship. For me, what's most important is physical touch and quality time according to my love language profile, and I feel like I've not been getting either of those and have become numb to it. It should also be noted that while she'll only be gone for 2 more months and will be back for the fall semester which starts in August, she graduates in December and plans to move 150 miles away, at the closest, while I still have 2 to 3 more years in school. She does her very best to call whenever she can, but because she's working an internship full-time and I'm just working my normal job and taking a few classes, I'm expected to be available 24/7 and she gets upset with me when I'm not, albeit she does see the hypocrisy in this situation and has apologized. The issue is that when she gets home from work and is ready to relax and talk, it's the end of the night for me due to time zones, and I'm usually very tired while she's wide awake, and she gets upset with me for falling asleep/not having enough energy to talk about super in-depth topics. This has led to many fights, where I'm practically half asleep after working all day, and she'll be upset because she wants me to open up about things that I have no interest in telling her. We really, truly do strive for 100% honesty, but there's certain things pertaining to finances/career planning that just stress me out way more talking about them with her cause she views every single thing I tell her as a problem for her to fix despite me telling her that if she wants me to tell her these things, I just want her to listen, and it pisses me off majorly. It's especially annoying when I just want to hear about her day and hear her rant, but she just keeps thinking that I'm holding something back when I'm not. This all came to a head last night when I said goodnight early as we were having a pretty fruitless conversation, and then blew up about the topic later on via text. I gave her the option of ending it and then she turned it back to me and said that I was just scared to end it, which if I'm being honest I'm considering just because I keep causing these huge fights and hurting this woman who I love with all my heart, and I keep pushing her farther and farther away. I truly don't think I'm mature enough for a relationship at this stage of my life, but I'm so scared to lose her. She's the most amazing woman I've ever met, and she really is that, a woman. Poised, gorgeous, sexy, intelligent, smart, caring, kind, loving, and always forgiving. I just know that I would never forgive myself if I let her get away, but I feel like she deserves so, so much better.

TL;DR: Long distance is putting a serious strain on my girlfriend and I's communication, causing countless fights where I keep hurting her and pushing her away."
8nuajc,30,2018-06-01,Creepy TP - Part2 (an opinion piece to pass the time),tuckerm33,TickTockManitowoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TickTockManitowoc/comments/8nuajc/creepy_tp_part2_an_opinion_piece_to_pass_the_time/,"We left of in Part1 where TP had marveled over the fact he invented a new business model.  He let Teresa run her business from his store.  It sounds a bit derivative to me, but who know, maybe TP was the originator behind the idea of sharing business space with a friend and sharing contact to turn a profit???

 \- \- \- \- \- \- 

It sounds like life was grand for TP.  He had a nice, pretty and attractive young graduate spending almost everyday with him, sharing the same space with him, bumping elbows with him, going to weddings with him, taking nude photos with him, developing nude photos with him.  He had built quite a need for Teresa to spend a lot of time with him.  He probably saw her more frequently than anyone else she knew. He was loving it.  I bet this guy was up 5:00am every day and down to the studio by 7:00am whether he had a gig or not.  He couldn't wait to see Teresa.  

I have a feeling this didn't last though.  I'm guessing Teresa got bored.  Teresa wanted more out of life than just spending all hours with TP.  Teresa was a young girl with young girl problems and young girl needs.  She wanted young men and parties and freedom.  She started spending less time with TP and less time at the studio.   To me it sounds like TP was a bit resentful of Teresa's distancing.  Don't believe me though, read it in his own words.

Example 7

Kratz to TP

* Q. All right. We have learned that Teresa Halbach drove a 1999 Toyota RAV4 SUV, picture's in front of you. Would you look on the back; what exhibit number is that?
* A. 05 CF 381, Exhibit 5.
* Q. All right. Have you ever seen that vehicle before?
* A. Oh, sure. She was working with me when she purchased it. Actually, I took that picture. And she was happy as a lark to have her first car. She used to have a beater that was an older car, not a beater. And now this allowed her freedom to go. Yeah, she was very happy with that car.


Even with her first real car, this guy wants to make himself part of that happy moment in her life and at the same time give himself credit for taking the now famous picture of her.  He finishes with ""Yeah, she was very happy with that car"".  That wasn't part of the question TP.

Continue....

* Q. Now, as part of that business, as part of Teresa's photography business, were you aware of a particular client that she serviced, which was Auto Trader Magazine?
* A. There was a time when she had told me about, that she had picked up a client, which was Auto Trader, and she would be running around taking pictures of cars, yes, I was aware of that.

*Do you notice a little hint of resentment in his words and tone here?*  ""Running around, taking pictures of cars"" for that....place.  He definitely has no love for Auto Trader, but is it because of the subject matter, cars, or because of the fact that this side job took her away from the studio and therefore him too?  I feel like there's a lot more he wants to say and he just needed the opportunity.  Luckily, good old sweaty K hooks him up.

Example 8

Kratz to TP:

* Q. All right. And had she ever asked your opinion or advice about working for Auto Trader or that kind of photography?
* A. I don't think she asked my advice, but I think I may have suggested something to her. Her photography business was picking up for studio wise a lot. And it seemed like when she \-\- It seemed when she first started with Auto Trader was just on Mondays. Mondays we're typically closed in the industry, because we worked a lot of Saturdays.    So, it seemed all of a sudden that she not only had to do Auto Trader on Monday, but possibly Wednesdays and some Saturdays. She was constantly telling me that she was running doing Auto Trader. And I could see that she was starting to burn the candle at both ends.  And at one time, I sat her down and I said, gee, you know, you are running here, you are running here, you're running and I didn't want her to get to a burn out point. So I just asked her, how is Auto Trader, is it a good client, blah, blah, blah.  We never talked on how much she was making, or whatever. That \-\- that was never discussed. I mean, that was where  we drew the line in our business end of it, but I was more concerned about her well being of running, of the constant running. She was constantly running and that's what she enjoyed. So that was the only time I really had any discussion with her about Auto Trader.

Holy crap right?  Please tell me you see this.  Concern my ass.  This is not TP concerned about her running around and burning any candles.  This is TP being pissed because she's never around anymore.  This guy sleeps and then wakes up simply to go to the studio and see Teresa.  He probably scheduled Saturday weddings purposely just get her to go with him and hang out together.

He was OK with her doing AT on Monday's because they were closed anyway.  That was his family day.  He had to keep the family happy anyway so that was a good day to do that, although he probably hated Monday's with a passion and couldn't wait for Tuesday's to roll around and see Teresa again.  

Suddenly her schedule changes and she's not there as much.  Her schedule is unpredictable.  She just comes in once and a while.  He never knows if she's going to be there or not and he's pissed.  He can't handle it.  He misses her.  He needs to say something to her.  Teresa didn't ask for his advice he said, but I bet he gave her a piece of his mind.  

* TP ""but I think I may have suggested something to her"" he says.  
* TP: ""She was constantly telling me that she was running doing Auto Trader""

This sounds like the kind of conversation you have with someone when you're first dating.  You see each other all the time and it's new and fun, but then the newness wears off and then one of them starts coming around less and calling less and makes excuses.  This sounds like that.  It seems she was suddenly avoiding him and putting him off and he knew it.  He decided to confront her and I bet he lost his top. 

* TP: ""I sat her down and I said, gee, you know, you are running here, you are running here, you're running and I didn't want her to get to a burn out point. So I just asked her, how is Auto Trader, is it a good client, blah, blah, blah.""

Another red flag for me for two reasons. 

**First reason:**  

First he originally says, ""I may have"" suggested something to her, like he can't really remember if he did or not, but then he turns around and says he sat her down.  Also, notice how everything else in his testimony is filled with needless details and ramblings and gloating about how much they had in common and how much he did for her.   He goes on and on when he's bragging about himself or cherishing the things he loved about Teresa, then suddenly he can only muster a ""blah blah blah"" when telling the jury the story about what may have lead to Teresa's possible demise? 

That is deceit.  That means there is more to that story that he doesn't want to share.  Blah Blah blah means he yelled at her and scared her.  He tries to make his testimony sound like a caring friend, but his words paint a different picture.  I think he blew his top and told her off.  

Something like; ""I've done everything for you and you treat me like this?""  

A jealous obsessed stalker.  Don't believe me though, read it in his own words. Let's play word count again with that paragraph.

Running: 7 times  Constantly: 2 times  Constant: 1 time  

This guy is angry folks.  I can almost see his hands waving and hand pounding the counter as he's repeatedly yelling at her running running running running running running running.   \(seven times\)

**Second reason:**

Right after the ""Blah Blah Blah"", he quickly changes the subject to something completely unrelated and irrelevant.  He talks about whether they discussed how much money she made.  What the hell does that have to do with anything?  Remember, the question Kratz asked him was if she ever asked TP his opinion or advice about working for Auto Trader or that kind of photography. That's it.  I mean, even the relevant part of his answer is over the top.  A simple yes or no would have been sufficed, but he goes on and on about her running around and never finishes the story.  Surely Teresa must have had a response to his unwanted advice.

I wondered why Kratz urged him to talk about that in such detail because really I didn't see how the question is really relevant at all without knowing what Teresa's response to that was.  What does the jury care about what TP thinks of Auto Trader?

I realized later that it was because Kratz was trying to lay the ground work for implying to the jury that Auto Trader was a dangerous job and then lead that into Steven Avery being dangerous.  Strang objects to that later on when Kratz actually tries to cross and the judge sustains.  

In summary, I theorize this: 

Teresa approaches TP for an internship.  They develop a friendship.  He develops deeper feelings for her and falls in love with her.  He offers her a job and work space in his studio to keep her from leaving after graduation.  He convinces himself she has feelings for him too.  

She uses his studio and equipment for free to get work and build a client base.  Things are going great but then he gets a over zealous one day, get a little too close perhaps or admits to her that has feelings for her.  He gets rejected of course ,but plays it off cool at first.  

The problem is Teresa is creeped out now.  She feels awkward around him now and and starts avoiding him.  She takes on the side work at AT to supplement her income.  First only Mondays as he says, but then she increased her work to include Wednesdays and then Saturdays.  

Saturdays was his time.  That was their wedding days.  He knows he's getting put off and he gets angry because he feels used.  He credits himself with her success and thinks she's ungrateful for all things he did for her, she would be nothing if it wasn't for him and his generosity and guidance.  

It strikes me that when asked about November 1st by Kratz, TP goes on and volunteers information for the whole week up to Thursday, the day he called KH.  He wasn't asked where he was on Monday.  It's certainly convenient that the studio was closed on Mondays.  He could have been anywhere.  

Kratz created such a smoke screen for TP by making him out to be a huge positive influence, friend and roll model in Teresa's life, that no one thought to ask him where the F&amp;#37;$K he was on Monday.

The last bizarre thing I will mention:

TP's ultimate dismissal of Steven Avery as a concern to Teresa's disappearance.

Eample 9 

Kratz to TP

* Q. Let me ask you this, Mr. Pearce, are you familiar with the defendant, Steven Avery?
* A. As far as familiar with him, as far as what?
* Q. Have you heard the name before the 31st of October?
* A. Just one time and I think it was the spring, late spring or early summer, Teresa had mentioned to me, she said kind of matter\-of\-factly, you will never guess whose cars I was taking pictures of. And she told me the name and it didn't ring a bell. She actually had to remind me or say, oh, that was the guy that was wrongfully convicted and so on and so forth. 

First of all, Kratz's question of ""October 31st"" shows a slip up and deceit.  Supposedly no one knew that Teresa was officially ""missing"" or that she had been to Steven Avery's property until November 3rd, so why is Kratz implying TP heard Steven Avery's name on October 31st?

Also, TP's use of the word ""actually"" is deceit too.  He knows his story sounds fishy.  He knows everyone will know it's bullshit that she would have had to remind him who Steven Avery was.  His picture had been all over the news and the papers for a couple years at least.  Using the word actually is something liars use to persuade people into believing them.  The fact is, if you're telling the truth, you're not concerned with convincing people to believe you.

TP also seems to downplays any suggestion that Teresa was afraid of Steven as well.  It's funny how the entire county seems to hate Steven Avery and wants to see the guy rot in jail, but TP doesn't.  No.  He seems to want to separate himself as far away as possible from the name Steven Avery.  Never heard of the guy.

Why would that be.  It could be because he's afraid if he admits he knew of Steven Avery and if anyone catches on to the fact that he was obsessed with Teresa, well then that would just look bad,  I mean, it could look like TP maybe did something to Teresa in a jealous rage, found her appointment book in her RAV4 and devised a plan to plant the RAV4 at the ASY.   Of course, that's a crazy idea.  

I mean after all, he barely even knew who Steven Avery was right?  I'm sure LE checked all of TP's whereabouts on Monday and researched his appointments on Tuesday and Wednesday....."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8nvye7,1,2018-06-01,Artist for a text game,Evan67,ArtistLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/8nvye7/artist_for_a_text_game/,"Hi!

I'm a full\-time software development intern and computer science student. In what little free time I have I'm creating a text based adventure game in a **medieval setting.** I've felt a great deal of inspiration from recent decision tree based games like ones developed by TaleTellWorlds etc. I'm currently in the process of finding a writer for the story, I have the software framework prepared, all that's missing is artwork! I have got permissions to use several pieces that would make a beautiful background/setting, but what I need are portraits of characters to display next to dialogue boxes! Now for the questions weighing on your mind:

1. Compensation?

I cannot promise you fame nor fortune, but I can promise you your name on the credits page of a text game that WILL be completed. If said text game ever makes a dollar I promise you a piece of it. Naturally you will still own these portraits but I need permission to use them in the game. I would never use anything in the game without your express permission. 

2. How do I decide who to hire?

Message me or reply and I'll respond with a more detailed email outlining what I'm looking for. I'll have everyone send me a sample and we'll go from there.

3. What will the sample be of?

I'll need a portrait of a medieval character. I need the image to comfortably fill an eighth of a 1920x1080 screen with good quality. It can be any character you want: peasant girl, knight, king, baker, etc. Just whatever you are feeling. It can appear animated, doesn't really matter, but if we decide to use your artwork I'll need more characters made in the same art style so keep that in mind I suppose. I'll want it submitted as a .jpg

Thanks!

Here's the thing, I love Seattle but I can't handle another year of overcast skies and rain –– I'm dreaming of moving somewhere like Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin, or Miami but I haven't managed to have much luck when I apply for entry-level agency positions in these cities.

The way I see it I have a few options: work a couple years at a Seattle agency and then seek to relocate once I have more career experience, keep applying for positions at agencies in different (sunnier) markets until I finally get an in, or.... move to one of these cities and work an average job (hotel, Starbucks, etc.) -- now with the ability to network and interview in person, and possibly have a better chance of landing a position (that's a big risk though...).

Any tips?"

8nwgwp,3,2018-06-01,21 M4F An Open Letter to a Penpal,penpal4jenny,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8nwgwp/21_m4f_an_open_letter_to_a_penpal/,"Like the tittle says, this is an open letter to a penpal. Not a roleplayer, not a chat partner, a penpal. I want to find someone who I can share longer more complete thoughts and fantasies with, but not have to worry about being available at the same time. We'd both send each other a long\-ish message or two a day. No sweat trying to reply quickly.

So, a bit about me. I go to school for computer science and I have a internship in that area too. I like to bike a lot. In fact when I got my job, I had to chose between buying a car, or a nice bike: you can guess what I bought. I  play the drums, and I also rock climb, but that's the first of my hobbys/sports that gets the ax when I start to run out of free time. From a more dirtypenpal aspect, I consider myself to be in like the 80th percentile for kinky. I have more kinks than the average bear, but if you came looking for snuff fantasies I suggest you move on. I'm a fan of cum play, sluts, watersports, incest, anal \(giving and receiving\), spit, slapping, and dirty talk.

Speaking of dirty talk. I have a few gwa posts in my history if that's your thing.

As far as limits go, I'd say it's more context for me than actual limits. I don't like noncon. I think fantasies and acts are so much better when they're shared, I mean, that's why we're all on here to begin with isn't it? You can convince me of pretty much any kink except maybe scat if it's cast in a positive light where everyone is into it.

I'm not too sure what else to say about myself. Being that it is an open letter, I usually try to end with a question so that you don't just read my message and say ""okay, and how do I reply."" So, if you found this interesting, message me, and tell me whatever thoughts you had about the above text and answer this question: What do you typically do when you get home from work/school, and if it's not the same thing, what do you wish you did? Feel free to answer that as naughty, or nice as you want, that's kinda the nice part about getting connected in this context, nothing is off the table to begin with.

I hope to hear from you.

edit\* I always forget to put this on this style of post, but feel free to message me any number of hours or days after reading this."
8nwpgg,46,2018-06-01,Any advice to people starting over in a city without connections?,skypeaks,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/8nwpgg/any_advice_to_people_starting_over_in_a_city/,"Hey everybody! Alright so I'll just write a bit about me so the question at hand makes more sense:

I'm 19 years old, grew up in Argentina, and since age 16 I've been working on music one way or another. Some years of experience from there, mostly working on my own home studio, but still, a lot of artists, projects and learning in mixing and production in general. Hip-hop mostly, [this is my mixing magnus opus so far haha.](https://youtu.be/BKeJoLymt1I)

2018, I move to Spain (Barcelona) and even though I know some people in here that work in music, I cannot seem to find a break and cut myself a way into any type of work.

I'm not talking about a paid job or anything; I just want to get any sort of opportunity to learn. I'm interested in proper recording studios, and maybe even radio broadcasting or post production for other media (Did some background sounds and general production for a videogame in Argentina too)

I know it's a hard thing to do, to make a way for myself in an industry like this one, but I know there's things to do, and I know I have potential and maybe even some, talent?

Thought I had gotten an internship in a recording studio in the city which seemed pretty amazing, and where they worked with a lot of bands and cool artists, but as days pass I'm not sure I'm gonna get it. The studio owner seems to be predisposed to give the internships to students of his in this cool-ass private school, which costs A LOT of money to enroll in, and even though I wish I could do something like that, money in that outrageous capacity does seem to end up being a problem.

So yeah, the only thing I'm sort of asking for around here, is maybe some advice from people who were once in my place. New city, new country, new people, full of ways to go, but not being able to break in anywhere. I sent emails to studios, I searched for internships around, and I'm asking to people I know for maybe some opportunities. But it's hard, and I miss home and I'd really like some advice on how to go from here.

Thanks and bye!"
8nx9rb,2,2018-06-01,"I [22 M] lived with my Mother [50 F] my whole life and was great, now she treats me like crap and I might have a falling out.",Sir_Deeviant,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8nx9rb/i_22_m_lived_with_my_mother_50_f_my_whole_life/,"Hey so I've been living with my mom my whole life, and  for the most part it was pretty good. She was very sweet and supported me all the time, we often spent a lot of time together at home or out in the town. When I was 8 my brother (now 14) was born. He's the best brother a guy like me could have asked for, I care about him like he was my son. We all got along so well, I did great in school (just recently graduated college) and my brother is doing well too. For years it was just us three, no father, and we were the happiest family on the block.

But recently that's changed.

It started out as some mild criticism a few years back, ""You could do more around the house, you don't need me to tell you to do things anymore."" You know the works. No big deal, I can put in sometime to help the family. I'm a man now!

Over the years though, it's escalated to the point where I get yelled at for something almost everyday. Either something I did or something I neglected to do. Like ""Why did you eat the pasta without asking me?"", ""Why did you lock the door when I went out to the store?"", ""Why do you never come out of the room and talk to me?! I have to come in here if I want to talk to you!"", ""Why don't you just get off the computer and go to the movies?"", etc. etc. etc.

There are also times where she'll say something negative about men (she clearly doesn't like them) whenever I  or my brother is around. Frequently talking about how guys only care about sex, or how if we want to keep a woman happy and get the pu$$y we have to make a ton of money and spend it on her (as if that's all we are good for).

I recently had an interview for an internship (didn't get) and she made a comment on how she didn't think I'd get hired despite my qualifications because the next candidate was a pretty girl in a short skirt.

She also has the tendency to preach the same life lessons over and over and over, almost every day. Things like working hard, or the reality of finding a job, lessons I have learned years ago. I tell her I get it, and I'm not sitting on my ass doing nothing, but it's the same song and dance day-in and day-out, and it's so frustrating to be preached to like she thinks I still don't get it.

My mood has obviously taken a dive, but my mom always says that it's because I ""spend too much time playing on the computer"". She even says I'm an addict and compares it to her addictions. She's a smoker, and had previous alcohol problems (which she got over many years ago). I will admit I play games for  longer than the average person, and have been playing them my whole life (I'm big on RPG's) but I am in no way an addict. I've got a fair collection of games and don't spend absurd amounts of money on them, I don't always play for long hours, and I can and have put them down during important times like school work or even preparing for hurricane Irma. I don't ""need"" to play games like a smoker ""needs"" nicotine. But to her, it does not matter. Sometimes I can be working on my computer all day with YouTube on the side as background noise to keep me focused. Then I take one hour or so to play a game for a break, and that just so happens to be the time she walks in my room, and she yells at me about how I spend too much time playing games and I need to be an adult, etc.

Thing is, that playing games a lot is the worst thing I do. In order to compare, everyone else on my block is at BEST a dropout and at WORST a junkie who broke into our house and stole my laptop. Nobody, in the neighborhood, except for me, has graduated high school, much less college. I even managed to juggle a part-time in between school for a few years. I don't drink or do any drugs, I rarely go out just so I can save money. I never refuse to do anything she asks me to unless I'm too sick or tired.

But apparently, I'm still a child to her. ""If I want to be treated like an adult I need to start acting like one.""

Hell, I remember a time when I walked in on an awkward talk between her and my brother, and I backpedaled out because I wanted nothing to do with it. She started an argument over that 
and I made a face that said, ""WTF is wrong with you?"" and she pulled one to make fun of me like she thought I was acting retarded, and yelled at me for that too.

It's gotten to the point where I expect her to yell at me over ANYTHING, I can't even fucking eat some cookies or frozen shrimp without her getting mad.

Hell, the only times she says anything supportive are during events (i.e graduation) or after a fight when I just end up breaking down or leaving the house just to calm down. There are even times when I just ask her to stop and I don't want to argue with her and she just KEEPS GOING. If I leave the room she just follows me. If I say I don't want to talk she keeps yelling anyways. One time I left the room three times and she kept coming back and pinning shit on me and starting more fights.

It's not just me either, even my brother admits he feels like crap too. He just doesn't fight it like I do. It's like he gave up, though there are times he starts crying too. He's the only reason I'm still sane. Dude's a legend, 14 and he's more emotionally stable than I am, smart as hell and learning to code, and he says I was what made him who he was. He says I'm like his dad. I swear to god if it wasn't for him I don't think I'd even be here typing this. If anything happened to me it would destroy him, and I can't live with the thought of him being hurt like that. She doesn't give him as much crap as me, as far as I know, but she still does.

It feels like nothing I do is enough for my mom. Like all I am is just a fucking tax that has to be fed AND paid for.

Despite it all I still care about her and I think she still cares about us, though it's hard to convince myself of that from time to time. While what she says hurts, she isn't trying to hurt us. She *thinks* she is helping, but really she's just making us feel like crap, especially me. The worst parts is she is EXTREMELY stubborn. She will not ever believe she is in the wrong no matter what we say unless one of us has a breakdown. And even then when it seems like we've convinced her and she says she'll change, she never does. We've even mention how it's similar to how she says she'll ""totally quit smoking"" or ""totally go on a diet"" but never does, or only does so for a week tops despite how much we say we are worried about her health. Just today I left practically crying and before I close the door she ranted saying ""Yeah, it's all my fault!"" I considered not coming back for the night because I was worried she was going to either yell at me or try to console me like she always does, but I've got no money and nowhere to go. (She ""consoled"" me when i came back, didn't say anything about being sorry if she made me feel bad, even started preaching again).

If this keeps up something is going to happen, I don't want to end up doing something drastic, but I can hardly take it. A part of me just wants to drive away and not look back, but I'd just be running away from the problem and I can't leave my brother. We've been talking to her for years but nothing has changed no matter what we say. She has NEVER even hinted that she might feel she might be why we feel bad about ourselves, more often she'll blame the games we play.

I wouldn't call it abuse, she isn't trying to hurt us she's just stubborn in her ways. All she ever had in parenting was herself, my grandmother was too scatter-brained to help, and I was the first child in the family, so no sibling help.

I just don't know what to do. Should I seek a professional? Should I say something else? Should I just leave? Please I don't want this to all fall apart.

**TL;DR** Mom suddenly starts yelling and belittling me over everything, and is too stubborn to see she is hurting me. Likes to blame video games for the problem. Younger brother is affected too. I don't want family to fall apart, what do I do?"

I started searching for internships/co-ops in September (as early as I could) and I've been to all the career fairs. I have reached out to everyone in my family and every person that could possibly get me into an interview (also worked closely with my universities career services program). I've sent out so many applications... I never would have that that it would be this hard to find a job!! I always thought that school was supposed to be the hard part haha.

So far I've had 2 companies call me back. The first wanted me to interview, and even gave me a second interview for a process engineer co-op. The both of them went really good and they seemed like they wanted to hire me, but a month after my second interview I found out the owner ended up hiring his nephew.. (of course)

I got a phone screen 2 weeks ago for a HVAC Engineering internship... Which is awesome but till I get a job offer I'm still on the look, and I'm super anxious because were in the 2nd week of summer and I have NOTHING!! 


At this point I'm just looking for ANYTHING that would offer me valuable experience.. pipe-fitters helper/apprentice, working turnarounds, scaffolding, general laborer, anything!! I don't care how much the pay is or how hard the work is, I'm just looking for experience within a refinery or anything that relates to chem engineering.. 

Any help, advice, or words of encouragement anyone could offer would be much appreciated. Thank you!

#Q&amp;A



**Q:** When will [insert game name here] be cracked?





**A:** STOP! r/CrackWatch members are not psychic. Games get cracked by completely **[ANONYMOUS SCENE GROUPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene_)** who don't disclose their progress or plans to the general public so **NO ONE** knows **WHEN** and **IF** a certain game will be cracked.



&amp;nbsp;



**Q:** What are all these NFO thingies? Where do I download?





**A:** NFOs are text files included with game releases which contain information about the releases. r/CrackWatch only informs which games have been cracked. To download look for the releases on [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/) or torrent websites. Useful websites can be found in [The Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/7gyt85/crack_watch_beginners_guide_to_crack_watch/) and on [WebOasis](https://weboas.is/).



&amp;nbsp;



**Q:** WTF is Denuvo?





**A:** Denuvo is a Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology used to protect games from being cracked. Games that have Denuvo are harder to crack and usually take much longer. See [Pinned Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/6ybxhv/crack_watch_games/) for a list of Denuvo games.



&amp;nbsp;



**Q:** An update is out, but it includes the base game as well! Can I only download the update without redownloading the entire game?





**A:** Yes. [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/) is your friend.

8ny02q,0,2018-06-01,The US should not (and never have) exist.,PolarBearCubGamer,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ny02q/the_us_should_not_and_never_have_exist/,"I am so tired of this damn country:

- The shooting of innocent minorities and other people such as Daniel Shaver by psychopathic, highly-armed bureaucratic police officers and other government officials.

- Acceptance of politically-corrupt politicians (most politicians, if not all, are corrupt not just in the US).

- Worthless wars in the name of ""preventing communism"", ""defending democracy"", and most FAMOUS ""defending our freedom"". Poor men fighting the rich men's wars simply because of **profits** (Vietnam, Middle East, Angola, ""Banana Republic"" business, ""War on Drugs/Terrorism"").

- Overbearing **patriotism** right from the start; kind of a expected, forced patriotism even though some people are starting to wake up against it.

- Conservative vs liberal games. Both parties are more similar than different, yet even those on the center-left or center-right consider themselves to be ""totally different"" from their slightly off-centered opposing parties.

- Capitalism (especially ""crony capitalism""). **Countries work best, at least economically, with mostly socialism with a fair bit of capitalism within their systems (Nordic countries, for example), not more (or pure) capitalism nor communism.** 

- With the above, the idea that capitalism is the ""best economic system ever"" and also the idea that you can't succeed if ""you don't pull yourself by the bootstraps"" (which plenty of people are figuring out that they can't). This holds an extremely-narcissistic view of other humans regarding them as worthless or weak simply because they couldn't ""succeed"" (whatever that means), removes much of morality from the human conscience. Baby Boomer generation is a prime example of holding this idea, even though economic conditions are much poorer now because of absolutely corrupt government.

- Medium-to-large-sized corporations not paying their workers a livable wage simply because the CEOs are psychopaths (or extremely narcissistic) enough to **hoard almost all profits to themselves and their shareholders only**. People then look down on low-skill or low-wage workers as not ""working hard enough"" or ""stealing benefits off of my tax dollars"" because they need the extra government check to simply survive!

- People entering in a **""dick-measuring contest""**: ""I work 24 hours a day and you're complaining about working 10 hours only??? Stop sleeping and work harder!"" or ""My son studies for 2 hours for each final and you need 30 hours for each? My son is so much smarter!"" This causes extremely-narcissistic comparisons between others and causes many to not consider the various factors and circumstances (most of which are probably hidden) that goes into each comparison.

- Acceptance of an extremely controlling (and authoritarian) government (other parts of the world are quickly turning into this, as well) as part of a functioning society. Example, many of the laws enacted nowadays have almost no semblance to general human moral conduct or logical reasoning, and plenty of them have to do with non-secular reasons (like religious reasons). **This is why the US has the highest prison population/total population ratio of all the world's countries as well as a prison system designed to create new laws to further oppress people** and put more ""police force"" into action. More ""police force"" equals more arrests which equals even more new, bullshit laws to be made....and a vicious cycle ensues.

- **Acceptance of extreme violence and hate against other countries** (goes with cult-like patriotism) such as the missile striking of Syria, the funding of ISIS, the funding of Israeli troops against Palestine, and many other examples.

- Not a **conspiracy theory** at all (rather a truth). ""Big Pharma"", ""Big Food"", and ""Big Sugar"" are spreading false lies about medical research and nutritional info (false statements such as ""fats are bad for you"" or ""sodium intake grants higher risk of heart disease"" or even the sugar craze that was born in the late 50s). Also the still-unsupported claim that GMOs are fine for implementation as well as the various processed chemicals and hormones that go into the food and water in which we consume. The scientists of these institutions are purposely paid to spread around false information to the general populace, in order to convince consumers into buying their products for long-term and become more unhealthier. **For profit**.

- Unfounded denial of **global warming**. Again there are other deniers in other countries as well, but just because we are in a global cooling period (due to natural occurrence of patterns) doesn't negate the fact that industrialized humans are having an extremely-negative impact on the environment (ocean acidification, generally decreasing ice sheets, extreme pollution, chemical-infused rivers/lakes around many countries...just to name a few effects). 

- However, it is true that politicians are using a verified man-made phenomena such as global warming in order to **bring supporters/profit to their cause**, and this is completely unethical to do. This is also the same reason why many people, especially alt-right-wing supporters, use the popular ""global warming is a myth"" in order make others seem non-credible (even those alt-left and alt-right are mostly non-credible themselves...the irony).

- The US government wanting to implement social credit and other ""crediting"" strategies in order to effectively control the US population better (many other countries adopting this too).

- The US's military spending budget is mostly **unnecessary**. They spend a minuscule amount on education, medicine, and social services compared to their military industrial complex. They already have enough equipment and I understand that they need to feed soliders/military personnel and refuel tons of craft and vehicles, but $660 billion (looks to be much more than that) is too much for this country (and is quite debt-wracking). **In comparison, Russia spends only $66.3 billion for their military.** Remember the *Big Stick Diplomacy* by no other than Theodore Roosevelt himself? The US is building up its military reserves to basically ""Keep Up With the Joneses"" (its neighbors being other large-scale countries).

- **Many more** to list, but I will keep it short for now...

I am basically a junior university student studying an engineering degree (do a few internships and jobs first) and then plan to move out of the US within 5-years because I don't see this country ever going in a good condition ever again. I plan to also take the TEFL to teach English in a country that demands it (most likely Japan, Korea, or Thailand) while opening up a foreign construction engineering firm on the side. Now, I know that many of the points above may extend to general industrialized countries (such as global warming, profit racketeering, corrupt government), but never have I ever seen a power so large and economically-powerhoused as the US not being able to care for humanity, much less even its own citizens. These are the list of reasons why I believe the US should not (and never have) existed."

#Q&amp;A



**Q:** When will [insert game name here] be cracked?





**A:** STOP! r/CrackWatch members are not psychic. Games get cracked by completely **[ANONYMOUS SCENE GROUPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene_)** who don't disclose their progress or plans to the general public so **NO ONE** knows **WHEN** and **IF** a certain game will be cracked.



&amp;nbsp;



**Q:** What are all these NFO thingies? Where do I download?





**A:** NFOs are text files included with game releases which contain information about the releases. r/CrackWatch only informs which games have been cracked. To download look for the releases on [CS.RIN.RU](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/) or torrent websites. Useful websites can be found in [The Beginners Guide](/r/CrackWatch/comments/7gyt85/crack_watch_beginners_guide_to_crack_watch/) and on [WebOasis](https://weboas.is/).



&amp;nbsp;



**Q:** WTF is Denuvo?





**A:** Denuvo is a Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology used to protect games from being cracked. Games that have Denuvo are harder to crack and usually take much longer. See [Pinned Post](/r/CrackWatch/comments/6ybxhv/crack_watch_games/) for a list of Denuvo games.

As background, I recently had to leave home for 3 months for an internship, meaning I had to leave my gym behind for that amount of time too. It’s out of my price range for me to get a new membership at a Krav Maga gym near my current location as I’m on contract at the gym back home so I’m still paying for my membership there. I’ve only been at that gym for about 6 months.

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations as to what I can do in the meantime with just a normal gym membership in regards to training and keeping myself at least active / in good shape so that I’m not just stagnant until I can get back to my gym at home. 

I’m more so interested in knowing any specific types of training I can do that will help me not plateau (for instance, I know I have to get my cardio in, but was wondering if there’s any specific type of work out that will benefit me more to do now for when I get back). 

Thanks! I appreciate any ideas / help."

So, I'm not looking for a roleplay partner or a chat partner. I'm looking for a more conventional penpal. Someone who I can write long thoughtful, and complete messages to once or twice a day. And, while I'm making demands, I don't just want a penpal, I want one who likes ageplay too. Get it, because that's the poing of this subreddit.  
Like I said, I want to find someone who I can share more complete and thoughtful messages with. Not an RP response that went up until I was waiting on your character to react. Not a quick chat response that I rushed out to not keep you waiting.  I figure we can tell each other anything. Anything from how our day was to the naughty roleplay we did the a redditor the other night. I want to get to know your kinks, your fantasies, and importantly you.  
So, a bit about myself.  I go to school for computer science and I have a internship in that area too. I like to bike a lot. In fact when I got my job, I had to chose between buying a car, or a nice bike: you can guess what I bought. I play the drums, and I also rock climb, but that's the first of my hobbys/sports that gets the ax when I start to run out of free time. From a more dirtypenpal aspect, I consider myself to be in like the 80th percentile for kinky. I have more kinks than the average bear, but if you came looking for snuff fantasies I suggest you move on. I'm a fan of cum play, sluts, watersports, incest, anal \(giving and receiving\), spit, beast, slapping, and dirty talk.  
Speaking of dirty talk. I have a few gwa posts in my history. Some of them even line up with this subreddit. Feel free to talk a walk down my history.  
For limits I just don't like noncon or violence. Things are so much better when everyone enjoys them.  Also, you'd probably have trouble convincing me to do scat.  
So, as an attempt to get people to be interested, I figured I'd share a little fantasy with you, as I would do many times with a real penpal.  


&gt;Matt was laying in his bed, his mind racing as the whether or not he'd actually get to play tonight. It'd been a little while since his Anne, his mom put him to bed. He was promised though. Promised that his 12 year old cock could fuck pussy again.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thing is, Anne wasn't a big fan of birth control, and now that Matt's little cock was starting to shoot, they couldn't fuck anymore. What kind of mother would let her son go sex starved. Especially now that he's hitting puberty. That's why Anne drugged her 10 year old daughter Sarah.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Hey sweetheart"" Anne said slowly opening the door to Matt's room. ""Your not asleep yet are you?"" She followed up in a hushed tone.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Mm\-mm"" Matt said, already climbing out of bed, excited to get his dick wet again. Not to say he wasn't fucking. Anne was more than happy to supply her ass and mouth for his little boy cock, he didn't realize how lucky he was. Still, any good boy deserves a good cunt.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Come on"" Anne said, taking Matt's hand. She led him down the dark hallway, the two walking quietly. Anne slowly opened the door to Sarah's room. Her pink nightlight gave the room a cozy atmosphere. There Sarah was, passed out drooling on her pillow. Anne had the good sense to put her to bed naked, making this whole thing easier. Matt looked up at his mother with excitement.  He stepped towards his little sisters bed and started climbing up.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Hold on dear"" His mother stopped him. ""Let me get her ready."" Anne positioned Sarah's body so she was face down with a pillow beneath her thighs. ""Now I have to get her cunny nice and wet okay?"" Matt nodded and his mother tucked her head between Sarah's legs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The room was silent but for Anne's licking and Matt's excited breath. Matt stripped out of his PJ's and waited kneeling at the edge of the bed, butt naked and soft cock hanging freely.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Okay darling."" His mother said, moving away from Sarah's cunt. Matt scooted over between his sister's legs and looked up at Anne helplessly. ""Oh, your still soft."" Anne took Matt's hand, and he opened his palm as she spat into it. He brought it strait back to his cock, lubed it with his mom's spit and started stroking it vigorously. Anne watched with pride.Then, Matt stopped scooted forward and with more help from his mother, he slid his little cock into his sisters hole.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Careful, she's still virgin"" Anne warned. Matt didn't know what that meant and immediately pounded away. The room was filled with the soft sound of the little bodies clapping together and Matt's labored breath. It didn't take long. Maybe three minutes or so of him fucking, Sarah sleeping and drooling, and Anne intently watching. Matt came, emptying his little balls into his tight sister.

Feel free to write me back with anything. You can tell me about yourself, tell me what you thought of the quick writing, share a fantasy, add onto that one. I don't care.

Also, feel free to respond even if this is hours or days old. Not worrying about timeliness is kinda the point of this."

As far as limits go, I'd say it's more context for me than actual limits. I don't like noncon. I think fantasies and acts are so much better when they're shared, I mean, that's why we're all on here to begin with isn't it? You can convince me of pretty much any kink except maybe scat if it's cast in a positive light where everyone is into it.  
I'm not too sure what else to say about myself. Being that it is an open letter, I usually try to end with a question so that you don't just read my message and say ""okay, and how do I reply."" So, if you found this interesting, message me, and tell me whatever thoughts you had about the above text and answer this question: What do you typically do when you get home from work/school, and if it's not the same thing, what do you wish you did? Feel free to answer that as naughty, or nice as you want, that's kinda the nice part about getting connected in this context, nothing is off the table to begin with.  
I hope to hear from you.

8nz9he,1,2018-06-02,One Mormon’s Case Study in Alienation,mangajohn,u_mangajohn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mangajohn/comments/8nz9he/one_mormons_case_study_in_alienation/,"When  I was young, I felt a certain friendliness toward Baptists. The only  problem was that I didn’t actually know any. As a young Mormon boy in  the Salt Lake Valley I didn’t really know much of anyone who wasn’t,  like me, Mormon. Or, to be more particular, a member of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints. Sure, I had friends who belonged to  other faiths, or no faiths, but I didn’t realize that until I was a  little older.

I  remember learning about baptism in Sunday school. My young mind,  grasping for common ground with the rest of the world, settled on the  aptly named Baptists. I knew nothing beyond the informative name, but  that was enough. We had one thing in common, I thought, and so they were  okay by me. Growing older, I was surprised to learn that my affable  feelings were not always returned. Generally, evangelical opinions  toward Mormons have been [chilly](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/).  To many of them I was a young, deluded cult acolyte who believed in a  “different” Jesus. It was my first taste of being on the outside. The  broader American religious community, by and large, didn’t really want  me. I was weird.

This  isn’t a sob story or an appeal for personal sympathy. It feels  important to explain that up front. And to whatever extent it feels like  one, I promise on my honor \(I’m an Eagle Scout, of course\) that there  is a point to it all.

As  a young adult in 2008 I watched with interest as Mitt Romney campaigned  during the Republican primary. But I was more interested in the  country’s reaction to a Mormon candidate than Romney himself. At the  time a Mormon was the Senate Majority Leader — democrat Harry Reid.  Mormons had served in presidential cabinets and other high political  offices. The 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City had introduced millions to  my state and religion. Still, to watch the 2008 campaign one might think  that most Americans had never met or associated with a single Mormon;  and maybe they hadn’t.

As  late as 2012, during Romney’s second attempt at the White House, the  American National Election Survey reported that 53 percent of survey  respondents indicated that they did not know any Mormons personally,  another 13 percent said they knew only one. With those numbers, it isn’t  a huge surprise that barely half of survey respondents agreed that  Mormons were Christian. When asked about perceived commonalities between  their own beliefs and that of Mormons, 39 percent of respondents  reported “nothing at all.” Meanwhile, 33 percent responded “a little,”  21 percent “a moderate amount,” 4 percent “a lot,” and 3 percent “a  great deal.” I was shocked to learn that 72 percent of Americans thought  I had practically nothing in common with them. I grew up on *Star Wars* and *The Karate Kid* like everyone else. I didn’t feel so different.

During  these two campaigns the world was inundated with reports on Mormon  beliefs. Some were positive, some were negative, many were riddled with  inaccuracies, half\-truths, and over generalizations. I couldn’t blame  most of them. Completely capturing the complicated and nuanced social,  historical, religious, and political structure of any cultural group is  probably impossible. It is hard to be on the inside looking out with  perfect accuracy. And although I think it was ultimately a positive  experience for my church, being examined by the masses for good and for  ill was an unsettling and strangely personal sensation.

I  have wondered if Muslims feel similar as pundits, reporters, and the  public attempt to boil their culture down to 140 characters or less, not  always in flattering terms or with pure motives. I have wondered if  they feel the same sense of discomfort and grief when they read hateful,  mocking Internet commentary by strangers who seem to think they have  “figured out” a couple billion people with a several thousand\-year  history. I have tried to remember my own experience while thoughtless,  reckless, and divisive political figures cast Muslims as global and  domestic villains to serve political ends, counting on the public’s  unfamiliarity and filling the void with suspicion and aggression. I have  tried to remember that most of us probably don’t know as much about  Islam as a handful of politicians and talking heads would like us to  think. I have remembered that every Muslim person I’ve met has been  thoroughly decent.

During  the 2012 presidential campaign I was attending law school in Colorado.  At this point I had already graduated from the University of Utah, the  state’s flagship university. Having grown up in a generally conservative  community, the U was a new and interesting environment with a  saturation of liberal ideas less common in Salt Lake suburbia. That  said, I hesitate to describe it as a “breath of fresh air.” I wasn’t  escaping anything. I loved my home, church, community, and my family. I  did not, and do not, disagree with their fundamentals or foundational  decency. I didn’t feel sheltered, cloistered, or naive. I was not  bitter. I was just interested. There are a lot of positive things to  learn from people of all political, religious, and racial stripes. There  were just more different people at the university, and that was good.

At  the same time I felt the religious skepticism again. A liberal watering  hole in conservative Utah, the U was the counter culture. While acting  as the political counterweight to the rest of the state, it was often a  cultural and religious one as well. I found myself experimenting with a  new political voice, including certain progressive ideals. But I found  myself conflicted by the cutting, sometimes sneering, criticism of my  dearest beliefs by new allies. Some were mocking and unconcerned with  the truth. Some criticisms, however, the church had earned through past  and present [mistakes](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/come-join-with-us?lang=eng).  Both tempted me to retreat to the relative emotional safety of  wholesale political and cultural conservatism. I resisted the impulse,  but I no longer felt I could be completely at home on the other end of  the spectrum either. The political left felt increasingly like an “all  or nothing” club. They didn’t really want me either. I was weird.

In  Colorado I had a new experience. No longer was I surrounded by the  liberal counter\-culture of a religious and conservative state. I was now  surrounded by the liberal mainstream culture of a city that built its  streets without measuring the distance from a central 19th century  Mormon temple.

For  the first time, most of my associates and friends were not especially  familiar with Mormons. They came from many different backgrounds and  harbored different beliefs. Although I suspect some of my peers had no  idea what to do with a skinny Mormon guy who didn’t drink alcohol at  their slosh ball outing in the park, sooner or later I became less of a  novel presence. Soon I was a classmate and friend instead of a token  representative from some less\-familiar religious group. Many probably  never knew nor cared whether I was Mormon. Others, maybe, reevaluated  how “weird” they thought Mormons were. Maybe not. Despite inevitable  differences, we had more in common than not.

Still,  I was occasionally confronted with face\-value skepticism. I was  silently “de\-friended” by one classmate soon after she posted a social  media rant railing against Mormons. During an interview for a legal  internship most often populated by liberal\-leaning attorney hopefuls, I  was, probably unlawfully, asked whether my Mormon faith would interfere  with my ability to represent defendants charged with crimes. I highly  doubt anyone else had to navigate that question. Still, this internship  ultimately led to my first job out of law school, and the interviewer  was an extremely talented attorney who I respect and like immensely.  Either way: she was initially skeptical of my ability to afford clients  the presumption of innocence instead of immediate judgment because, she  apparently supposed, that’s how Mormons are.

I  lived in a strange political and cultural crossroads, and it wasn’t  always comfortable. I was too liberal for many at home and probably too  religious and conservative for those at school and work. I still, in  some ways, live there.

What  I learned was, like the religious right, a large portion of the  political left is uneasy about Mormons. Their brand of skepticism  extends to a great many religions, but Mormons seem to occupy a special  “weird” place in the American imagination. We are an eternally fresh and  low\-risk punch line. Even after the 2012 Romney campaign, after being  immersed in information true and spurious about the LDS church, the  number one word Americans used to describe the religion was “cult,”  according to a Pew Research Center [poll](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/14/attitudes-toward-mormon-faith/).  And although feelings toward all religious groups appear to be warming  since then, public opinion on Mormons still rounds out near the [bottom](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/),  with Democrats having slightly less warm feelings toward Mormons than  Republicans. When an article is printed that concerns my church, no  matter how innocuous and no matter the angle, I approach the comment  section with apprehension. I have learned from experience it will be  composed of a patchwork of all the cheapest mockeries, assumptions,  generalizations, and false doctrinal explanations by anonymous trolls  who claim to know everything there is to know about this weird “cult.”

But  in many ways, this has been a healthy rejection. It helped me — a  white, middle\-class man from a homogenous community — understand how it  feels to be in a sometimes maligned and marginalized minority. This was a  sensation I had little hope to really understand otherwise. Seeing my  religion through America’s skeptical eyes helped me understand a  fraction of how it must have felt to be Muslim while a major party  presidential candidate expressed support for keeping tabs on American  Muslims in a special [database](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-muslim-registry/story?id=43639946).  It made me wonder how it must have felt to be a Muslim when that  candidate won and continued to bang Islamophobia like a marching drum.  It helped me understand how it must feel to be a black American who can  quite inoffensively be choked to [death](https://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-garner-was-choked-to-death-for-selling-loosies)  for selling tax\-free cigarettes without major public complaint, but who  can’t take a knee during the anthem or otherwise peacefully protest  discrimination on the street without [CVV Dumps](https://bingodumps.com) offending white America. It  made me sympathize with a [financially charitable](https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/01/31/colin-kaepernick-usher-million-dollar-pledge-charity-donation)  football player who was driven from the NFL for protesting societal  prejudices while the league happily continued to employ domestic  abusers. The public simply took too much offense to the former to be  profitable, not so much the latter — even as the current administration  and conservative media did moral gymnastics to humanize a torch\-wielding  mob chanting “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville. It made me  imagine how it feels each time a Christian baker determines it would  break his or her religious spine to just make a gay couple a cake. It’s  not hard to understand why so many Americans feel isolated,  marginalized, under attack, and misunderstood.

I  wonder how much good it would do the Republican Party to find common  ground with Muslims, a traditionally conservative religious group,  instead of using them as a boogeyman to fire up the GOP’s white,  Christian base. I wonder how many enemies the party created by labeling  them enemies preemptively? How many global and local opponents have been  forged by self\-fulfilling prophesy?

\- Director Zinoviy Demchyzhyn of Kiev

----------------------

# A New Era, A New Generation

**\[19/11/2174\]** \- Rostyslav's retirement had been the spark for many of his colleagues to finally lose confidence in their own administration skills and knowledge. For the most part, the State administration halted entirely, running on autopilot while the Directors who wished to see their succession safe, and according to protocol see to the training and candidacy of the next generation. It is here where the United Directorate academic capability and almost world\-renown efficiency and effectiveness comes to shine.

There were a few of those who still remained adamant that their ability to perform effectively and efficiently. Their decisions to withhold candidacy training and expenditure were met with some questioning critics by the academic elite of the United Directorates; namely, the Academy, the various universities of Ukraine and Russia, and a majority of the tech firms in the State's capital of commerce Zaporozhie. They, as well as the rest of the State, are fully aware of the encroaching age threshold for many who considered retirement due to old age being one of the primary concerns. Prime Director Mykhaila Kozelovchenko, the official head of state for the entire nation and director of Poltava the capital, is the most adamant of those who persist, and will remain so. It had been unknown as to what caused her recluse in the first few months of this sudden change in the State administration, but it was the proposal to overhaul the State ministerial administration by the newly appointed Director of Permais'k that forced her hands. As it stands, Director Mykhaila is adamant to rally the elder generation of Directors to maintain their posts.

However, her endeavours are a bit too late. Already the eastern directors had given up their titles, retiring to their homes pre\-Directorship. Here is a list with summaries on the recent events that lead to their succession:

1. Director Lev Kryvoruchko of Luhansk: Once apprentice and intern of the previous Director Ruslan Sokolov of Luhansk, Lev rose like a meteor through the political ranks, launched from the foundation he forged, the Elysian Committee. With Ruslan receding to his position as Senior Director of the SDB, he applied for candidacy, and found himself accepted. An expansionist at heart, what with his foundation the Elysian Committee in charge of the Eastern Frontiers until the establishment of Borisoglebsk, Lev is adamant to see the State's western flank secured and emerge from the war with Zhytomyr, and perhaps even Lviv and Barychaw in tow.
2. Director Zinoviy Demchyzhyn of Kiev: Formerly Director Yelyzaveta Chumak of Kiev's psychologist and years before, a student, Zinoviy applied for candidacy after his patient had announced full retirement from the political scene after further psychological damage of administering a state at war. Close associates with the public workers' unions organization, what with this influence as one of the more successful psychologists in charge of the many industrial zones of Kiev, Zinoviy's motivation lies deep into the establishment and pursuit of expansion on workers' welfare.
3. Director Snizhana Bajak of Permais'k: A shrewd politician and a lifelong critic of Director Trokhym Kravets' of Permais'k and his paranoia\-driven governance, Snizhana is devoted to reversing the various rudimentary fail\-safe laws and State\-directed procedures to allow for greater commercial growth. In a way, Snizhana is a complete antithesis to the paranoid Trokhym. In a way, she's the kind of person to be adamant to see her bills pass, rather than letting them fade and die, regardless of the cost.
4. Director Yuri Pavlyuchenko of Uman': Just like his predecessor, if not greater than, Yuri was a military man. Serving alongside his men in this recent conflict, Yuri exhibited a distinct capacity of field command, unbound by ethics and willing for experimentation of new procedures. A distinct believer of the supremacy of the United Directorates, based on its technological advancement and cultural preservation on levels nonexistent elsewhere in the post\-apocalyptic world, Yuri believed that it is the task of the United Directorate academic elite to educate and enlighten the world, regardless of their consent. Thus, he supported the Europite\-United Directorates War to the full.
5. Director Kazymyr Pawlyszyn of Donetsk: A Polish migrant from the fall of the Kingdom of Poland, he was one of the few to be accepted into the State thanks to his academic background in reverse\-engineering the German war industry. Succeeding the previously largely status quo Aleksandra Orlov \(who did so due to her own concerns about her ability and mismanagement of her family\), Kazymyr is often nicknamed the Immovable, for the spark of technological advancement still burns bright. He is well and fully aware of the technologies lost in the City of Zhytomyr, and like Mykhaila, is determined to retrieve it.
6. Director Kyrylo Shulyayev of Lubnyy': After Rostyslav's announcement of retirement, he left the Assembly in chaos because of the lack of preparation he had done to ensure succession. For the first time it the Director\-to\-be isn't trained by his predecessor, but with the Assembly itself. Well, him alongside the array of candidates for Lubnyy'. Kyrylo is a young graduate, fresh from the Academy, with a thesis one would thought to be unremarkable compared to the works of other Director candidates. But Kyrylo exhibited a capability of a shrew tactician and politician, exploiting various loopholes and opportunities without remorse or regret. As a child of a mother whose life was scarred by the Belarusian Incursion, he is a man who would do well for retribution against the Europites.
7. Director Mykyta Karaszkewyc of Kharkiv: One of the more earlier of the generation to achieve Directorship, Mykyta was similar to Yuri; but as Yuri belonged to the grunts of the Army, Mykyta was one of the cadets, and now a commanding officer. Naturally this put him at odds with the more brash and selfless Yuri, but Mykyta had greater talent in the administration of a state, and now with a year of experience compared to Yuri. Nevertheless, both had similar goals: to ensure the successes of the current war, and further ensure the independence of Ukraine from foreign hands.

As for the resisting elder generation, they are but a minority now with a great number of their colleagues retiring due to various causes. Nevertheless, their hold is receding; with the academic elite against their decisions, and the general populace behind them, one would wonder how long would Mykhaila remain incorrigible in her decisions. On her side are Nikodim Kuznetsov, de facto military commander of the Eastern Militias and holds a bastion of loyal forces in the north and east, Vladyslav Andreichenko, official admiral of the United Directorates Defense Fleet, and Dmytri Vyhovsky, who remained a valuable liaison with the network of alliances beyond State borders. For the mean time, the younger generation recognized the need of cooperation, and so did the elder. One would wonder how long that would last. 

For the first time, the Assembly has transformed from a unitary council of one decision, and one purpose, to one of a splintered house. The road ahead will be a treacherous one, what with a war to continue, or to halt. A united vision, splintered.

I'm a CS major and rising Junior. I am questioning whether I may have bitten off more than I can chew for the upcoming fall semester. Right now I have the following schedule:

It's 15 credits but I am worried it might be too much technical/math courses without the typical buffer class like geology or a humanities. I'm highly interested in all these classes and my internship as they all relate to the field I'm interested in (except for 355).

Let me explain my situation a little bit. In April, I paid $4000 for a 2010 Chevy Impala. This was actually way below the book value, and the car is really nice with new exhaust, tires, etc. 

Anyway, I was involved in an accident, and the front fender and passenger door got messed up. The inner and outer ball joints also needed replaced. The insurance would not help with these repairs, since it was deemed my fault and I only have liability. To make it at least drivable, I had to pay $372 to get the inner and outer ball joints fixed. The car, however, is still not street legal with no headlight or mirror.  

Here is my current situation: 

I live in an apartment with a roommate. Usually rent, electric, and gas are about $350 each after split, but I am going to up it to $400 for June, July, and August because we could be running the air more. 

I pay $64 a month for liability car insurance, and $101 a month for my phone contract I can't get out of. Then for miscellaneous things like gas, groceries, or whatever else, I calculated in $300. This brings my total living expense to about $866 a month. I currently have $1300 in savings. 

Here is where things get a little complicated. I am currently working an internship in my field that goes from May 21st to August 10th. This pays $18 an hour on a semi monthly basis, so after taxes around $1220. This means for June and July, the monthly income will be around $2440, not including the hours I worked for May or August because I am not sure how  to calculate that. Subtract $2598 for June, July, and August bills, and that is $2282 of a nice savings cushion for when the internships is over. 

I received an estimate to get the damage fixed, which was around $1576. I don't want to buy another car, and I want that cushion above for when the internship ends in case I have trouble finding a job, and I would prefer to make it non wrecked and street legal again so I can drive it for a long time. I graduate in May, and I would hopefully have a full time job by then. Making this repair would drain my $1300 in current savings. My father has also offered to chip in $800, making my half around $800 as opposed to the full amount. I have not decided if I want him to do this, just because I am too proud to be frank. 

What do you guys think? 

Note: This is a full time internship, and the $2282 does not include the $1300 I have currently. 

Edit: I could go back to my student assistant job at uni, but its minimum wage and probably around 20-25 hours a week. "
8o1pal,2,2018-06-02,I [22/m] put more effort into my relationship than my gf [20/f] does. Any insight? (LONG),ricktickattack,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8o1pal/i_22m_put_more_effort_into_my_relationship_than/,"My gf and I have been together for about 9 months. She means the world to me and I put so much of what I have into the relationship. I think it's important to state this is the first mature relationship either of us have been in. However I'm not sure how much effort she'd put in for me in the longrun and don't know how to approach her about this. I'll try to play it fair.

We are about to go long distance as she is moving 4 hours away for a two month internship. I already booked a couple of trips to visit her over the summer \(granted, based on my work schedule the trips are only like two weeks apart from each other\). She also had plans of going overseas for a week with her family early/mid August. Yesterday I learned that she is going directly from her internship to Europe, making her time away about 2 and a half months. Not even from an obsessive standpoint, but since I realized our time apart would be a tad longer I proposed I could visit again. At this point she realized how much effort I was putting into seeing her, with all the money and transportation. She was really taken back and I could sense it was a lil unsettling for her. Granted, I see how it's crazy considering I'm only a recent college grad and she has another year. Financially we're both on the same foot. While we're discussing the effort I'm putting in, she suddenly said ""Honestly, if our roles were reversed and I were in your position, right now I'd probably just say 'Aight, see you in August...' I mean maybe I'd visit you once."" HOLY SHIT this caught me off guard. We're in about the same place, and from what I'm hearing I'm not worth as much of the effort. A couple minutes later she's going on saying it doesn't mean she ""loves me any less"" or that I'm not ""worth the effort,"" but how am I supposed to take that from what you just said? In the end of that discussion, I thought that a third visit is probably not for the best, especially since I should get used to her being away since she'll be studying abroad in France for three months in the Spring semester next year. I have to be mature about this.

So yeah, she'll be going back to college and I intend on seeing her whether she visits me or I visit her. I wouldn't be worried about that situation, an hour is nothing to me. In the past when discussing how we'd go about seeing each other once the semester starts for her again. I'm able to drive, so driving down to visit her isn't a problem. My girlfriend doesn't drive, so at one point I proposed she could simply take a couple quick trains up to visit me, and she was so dead against it. It's such a simple path and I know she's taken it to an extent before. Again, this is another instant I feel I wasn't worth the effort. If she were to come up she'd want me to go out of the way to drive down, pick her up and drive back to my place. And the same thing bringing her back. Four hours of driving, not to mention expenses.

Expenses aren't the most important aspect of the relationship to me as long as they're wisely used, but my gf doesn't seem to intend investing her time the same way.

After the internship discussion, she was telling me how I invest so much time into her and she wants me to focus more on myself. She's an important part of my life, of course I'm going to invest in her. At the same time, I DO AGREE that I should invest in myself a little bit more. On a side note there's a lot I complain about on my end that I don't take action about, so yeah. I deserve to be a lil selfish if that makes sense.

But at the same time it's not natural for me to be selfish, just based on my family dynamic growing up. There was always an aspect of give and take in my family, and that's the kind of relationship I'm used to. I don't always get what I want by I'm mature and fine for the most part because of that. Looking at her, I feel she's a lil more used to getting what she wants, whether it be through her family, or to give her credit, through her own hard work, which I totally respect. Looking at her family dynamic, I feel she takes a lil more than I do in my family and that's something she's used to. In that sense, I feel that's a possiblility in why she \(might possibly\) feel she doesn't have to give back as much and put in as much effort with some things in the relationship.

Another aspect of the relationship I feel drained about sometimes is affection. Honestly I'm the more affectionate one in the relationship, that's something that's very clear which I acknowledge overall doesn't necesarilly have to be an issue. However, I'm always vulnerable about my feelings regarding how I love her and issues I may be having in life, but over time she has increasingly shown less affection back to me. It might be becoming one\-sided. I was abroad on a college trip for a couple of weeks and she didn't seem to miss me all that much. I knew communication was gonna be slow and awkward the a lack of connection and being seven time\-zones away, but I wish she was a lil more interested in what was going on during my trip.

I'm not worried about her leaving me. She hasn't spoken once about breaking up with me. She only wants the best and we still add things to do on our to\-do list. I honestly know she cares. If anything, part of me feels she's really comfortable in her position. I'm not asking for my gf to baby me, I just want the same treatment back. I love her. She says I'm worth the effort, but saying it and showing it are different things. A relationship is a two\-way street, and I shouldn't apologize for any effort or affection I show. How should I talk to her about this?"

8o1y79,4,2018-06-02,My parents are ruining my life. I need help.,Calebcoffing97,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8o1y79/my_parents_are_ruining_my_life_i_need_help/,"I’ve been at college for a couple years now (just finished my sophomore year) and have begun to realize the extent my parents’ abuse has/continues to affect me.  Growing up I was under this impression that my parents were infallible human beings and because of this I believed everything they said was true and everything they did was justified. My parents created unrealistic expectations for both my brother and I that we were hardly ever able to achieve and if weren’t able to reach them then we were berated no matter how close to it we got. My brother and I are both extremely successful academically and extracurricularly. They always claim any of our successes are “because of how they raised us” and “we wouldn’t be where they are without them.” They would sit us down for HOURS lecturing and screaming at us to the point where we’d be in tears which then my mom would always say  “Stop being a bunch of pussies, I’m the only woman in the house but i swear i’m the only one with a dick”. She also created the term “right-fighting” which was used anytime we corrected her for being legitimately wrong about things or actually were able to defend ourselves in explaining our actions. My parents were also huge factors in forcing me to go to a college I have now come to hate and be miserable at, and  also forced me into a major i hated and until recently just changed which was met with ridiculous ridicule and lecturing. Now I could go on and on about all the epiphanies I’ve had about how abusive they’ve been to me but it has done nothing but intensify in the last months in the absolute worst way. This is a bit of a complicated situation but I’ll try to keep it short. So basically I got scholarships refunded back to me from my school in the form of a check which was sent to my permanent address which is my parents’ house address. This was a check for just under 17k mind you. I never was able to see the check but my parents told me they were going to keep the money and control how it was spent on my schooling and insinuated that the check was made out to them and they were allowed/justified in doing this. Of course I argued this for a long time but there was little I could do. I recently got accepted into a prestigious internship in Washington D.C. for the summer and needed a bit of money to help finance it so I basically went to my mother and groveled for the money which she replied “It’s all gone”. When I questioned her about where it had gone she could only stammer and not come up with a straight answer which is very unlike my mother. Now to digress a bit, I had to withdraw from my classes my first semester of my sophomore year due to extenuating mental health struggles and move back in with my parents for a few months (which was a terrible decision). They would lecture me for hours three to four times a week vilifying me for my mental illness, my withdrawal from courses, saying I’m lazy, entitled, selfish, and using my mental illness as an excuse, etc etc. Then they forced me to take out several thousand dollars in loans this last semester because my mental illnesses rendered me a “flight risk” and they didn’t think I was worthy of having the money I EARNED spent on my education. Anyways fast forward I searched through my parents’
banking documents (we have a joint bank account through USAA which has been terrible in other circumstances) to come to find they had spent ALL of my school money. I then later found out they also forged my signature on the check to deposit it into my account and transfer it into theirs. I have since gotten legal advice and confronted my parents about the issue and requesting they pay me back in loans or else I can take legal action against them (forgery is a felony punishable from 5 to 8 years). My mother replied basically saying that spending the money was justified because of all the expenses they’ve spent on me in the last couple years since I have been in college (which they have provided little to no help to me because I never ask them for help knowing they’d hold it over my head like in this instance) and saying that “it broke her heart I felt this way.” Since then I’ve been trying to get everything in order to take them to court (which they have no idea of) and my parents have been texting me almost nonstop “reminding me how much they love me” and that “my brother and them miss me so much” and asking “when are you coming to visit” and I’ve been ignoring them for the most part because I just do not have the mental or emotional fortitude to deal with them. And today my dad texted me 

“I am worried for you. Why have you not replied to any of your Mom text messages. It is really upsetting to me and your Mom that you are running and not talking to us. 
Please son you are breaking our hearts and your brothers. He is missing you something terrible. We are missing you and love you very much son. You will forever be welcome here. We may disagree on somethings but we are and will always be proud of you.”

And I literally do not know how to respond. The emotional turmoil they’ve put me through is unbearable. When I stayed with them because of my deteriorating mental health they pushed me to being suicidal, which I still struggle with. Now they’ve stolen money from me rendering me financially insecure and unsure if I can continue my education and they filed this money incorrectly on my FAFSA making my Estimated Family Contribution more than my tuition costs so I’m eligible for absolutely zero financial aid and they refuse to attempt to fix it. I’m at my wits end with these people. I want nothing to do with them but I have no idea how to properly handle this situation. I’ve broken down almost daily due to the mental and emotional stress this has been putting on me. Sorry this was a lot but I have no idea where to turn to and after discovering this subreddit and resonating with it so deeply I felt it was best to post this here. I’m not specifically looking for advice or anything. I just needed this to get out. But any advice or words of comfort and encouragement would be appreciated. Thank you."

Especially the latter keeps happening a lot, I already had two interviews for position as a HCI research and despite them going well the only project they could offer me were essentially web dev positions with little or no UX nor HCI.

8o2jsm,5,2018-06-02,Big life changes,misfit_girl,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8o2jsm/big_life_changes/,"Hello all, I am new here. I've been reading posts the last few days and decided I would go ahead and join and share my story a bit myself. I am a 31 year old HL female and with a 41 year old LL male for the last 8 years. We've been married for about 3 1/2 years. Actually, I think for some time I may have also been LL myself due to depression that I've been working on and getting better with over time. So the HL has really increased much recently. We are married, and he took an internship in another state. We decided to do a LDR for the year and the plan was that he was going to move back. Well, he ended up taking a job for the upcoming year in another state again, and the expectation is that I come with. 

I think that the year being apart has really magnified our issues, including the DB issue. We had not had sex in a year. It was only recently, like literally a few days ago that we had sex and it was basically because I had to say ""so are we doing this or what"" and he agreed. It was pretty awkward. And over the years I've felt very self conscious about initiating because of the amount of times I've been turned down. Also because I am literally the only one who does initiate at all. I think I only recall one time where he initiated first, and he was high, and actually come to think of it I had nagged all night long prior to that. 

Anyway my situation feels complicated because not only is there a DB, but there's this huge life change of potentially moving across country, and leaving my family, friends and potentially my career behind for him. (I am licensed in my current state and it will be a long process to transfer my license to work in another state). 

I feel a bit lost and sad. I really care about him, and I do love him. But I think I am realizing that him and I are really best friends, and there is really no romance/intimacy there. I think for a long time I felt like that was enough. But now I have been yearning for more. I feel guilty for these feelings because of everything we've been through. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here other than maybe support and if someone has gone through a similar situation...how did you know you were making the right decision to leave vs. stay?

8o3vpm,2,2018-06-02,Need to vent [Warning: long text],PeasantsYogurt,helpme,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/8o3vpm/need_to_vent_warning_long_text/,"Hi everyone, I'm a 23 y/o looking for advices I guess, but mostly here to vent.

I come from a kinda shitty family, my father's a on\-and\-off drunk, my mom's a workaholic teacher. Living in the countryside in a small village 10km away from civilisation I've never been able to experiment much outdoor social life until I was 20 so I basically wasted my teens away playing video games and not taking care of myself.  Most of my pre\-college life consisted of getting picked on by others for being the son of a notorious alcoholic/an overweight ugly guy/a dumbass and getting into fights.

There goes, 2 years into college, I'm 20 and meeting my current group of friends , awesome people, we're all kind of misfits and outcast \(I've had some friends before, but we wouldn't get along that well, mostly we wouldn't pick on each other\). They show me what life really is at our age, you know smoking, drinking, skipping classes to play video games, etc... \(I'm in France so we don't pay university and most people end up skipping classes all the time\). Keep in mind I've always been a decent student, never among the best, but always in the better half of the class, so I've never had problems.

After 4 years in public universities, a degree in web and a 6 months internship, I decide that I'd hate working in that field so I decide to take a student loan to afford a private school to work in 3D art. First year goes well, I don't socialize much with people over there, mostly upper middle class 18\-19 guys with rich boys problems, stuff like ""Oh no.. I only have one year left of students vacations and I have only been to 8 differents countries, what a shame, I feel like my youth is ruined"". So yeah, I don't pay a lot of attentions to these people and find a couple of friends there. Everything's fine, I don't have a lot of time because I have 5h of commute everyday and no money to rent a place but, whatever you know, I like what I do.

Second year comes in and life catches up to me. A thing I haven't said is, of today I'm still a virgin, 23 y/o slightly overweight \(not that bad really but could definitely be better\) socially awkward virgin. I never paid much attention to the fact I never had sex, mostly cause part of me didn't realize how much my life sucked compared to that of the rich kids who basically got to live a life aside from the school \(10am\-5pm schedule allows for plenty of time\). Back to the school. Work gets harder and we're supposed to be working a lot on our time \(which I don't have. I'm waking up at 5:30am and am back home at around 8PM\). Now since I have a student loan I know I can't fuck up and need to find a job right after so I just starts working more and more, sleeping less and less. Now, most of you probably know what sleep deprivation leads to. By January I start to suffer from on\-and\-off depression, anxiety and insecurity kicking in and as the days go by I'm becoming more and more of a mess.

Socially speaking, I'm hanging on to my band of outcasts, but as our schedule are kinda different I tend to not be able to hang out with them except for the week\-ends, when we often end up throwing a party at my best friend's place, otherwise I can go weeks without meeting them. I start drinking even more than before at these parties but I swear I have it under control. At school, a good third of students left or got cut after the first year, as there are fewer students we tend to bond more and even though I know I can't really be friends with most of them I can atleast be friendly. Anyway, here comes a girl I didn't really talk to in first year, but we get closer, close enough that I start having feelings for her, but you know, insecurity and anxiety tend to make me think I have no chance, so it makes me kinda miserable.

Anyway, time goes by, I start thinking about leaving the school as my undisclosed feelings for the girl, let's call her Chloe \-nope not her real name\- and the long commute make me feel like I'm starting to lose my mind, but at that stage I know that if I leave the school, first, there's no way I'll see Chloe again, two, I'll have to work ASAP to pay loan, third, bye bye 3D. I have thoughts of ending my miserable life, one day, I was drunk again, I even launched my car at 110kmph in a tight turn thinking if I make it it's ok, if I don't, whatever. Chloe eventually get closer at a party, she starts telling me about her love life, how her ex dated her just to bang her. I make up a story about my ex \(when in truth I never had a girlfriend\), we feel bad for each other and for the next couple of months we're great together. Still not dating, but definitely more than friends imo. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago, Chloe throws a party at her house. I make myself essential, preparing food, setting up the tables, socializing with her friends more than anyone else. At the end of the party, we're 3 people left, Chloe, me and a friend. The guy is to take off in less than a hour, I am to take off in two. So we stay up until the guy leaves, and then she invites to go to her bed and we sleep together, when she made it clear before the party that she'd rather have people sleep on the couch. My drunk heart is racing, overanalysing everything that happened that night and ending up to the conclusion, that perhaps she actually does like me. I take off in the morning, since it's my father's birthday I wanna be home early to not give him more reason to get drunk. Chloe and I text a lot that day when we're not sleeping.

Next day is a national holiday but we for some reason have class, since there's no public transportation I give her a ride, she keeps telling me how grateful she is, etc.. etc... The whole week goes great, and I wish I could confess my feelings but the timing sucks: two of her friends broke up, and a 31 y/o guy is hitting on her \(she's 19\). So I wait. Then all I know is all of a sudden she starts criticizing every single thing I do or say, she stops initiating conversation and if I start talking to her she's ending it bluntly. Both confused and angry, I try to ask her why she's acting like that,but it goes like ""Yeah I'm sorry Chloe, for some reason I'm taking everything wrong this week, so don't blame yourself if I'm mad"". Next friday we all go the bar as we always do, relax, drink a beer. I leave early to catch my bus, and on the way I send her a text ""Wanted to apologize again, don't want make you feel like I blame you"" and she answers with ""You don't owe me"" which I still don't understand to these days \(even asked my friends about what it could mean\).

So yeah it's been a shitty week, and it made me fall from the highest I've ever been in my life back to one of my lowest points, sorry for the very **very** long rant, but I guess I had to take it off my chest. I'm aware this may seem like stupid highschool problems to most of you, because it kinda is.

Obligatory, sorry for my english, I'm not used to writing such long posts."

The issue is, after just buying such a nice desktop, I don't have the budget for a laptop that can handle android dev.

I just graduated hs, and I have several goals I need to have done by the end of August, as I intend to apply for the Google (and/or other) internship. Namely;
* Deploy my app to store (Ready within the week), maintain
* Finish full UI/Unit testing
* Convert to Kotlin
* More as time allows, learn popular libraries etc

Once classes start, I won't have nearly as much time to work on Android dev. While normally getting these tasks done would be no issue, and they are not particularly challenging, my parents had a sudden mid life crisis and decided to sell everything and live in an RV. I have a few weeks until then, but I will not be able to use my desktop in the RV, and do not leave for college in another state until August 13th.

This means I'll need to get a lot of the work done without my desktop. I got my laptop specifically for taking notes - a Lenovo Yoga Book. Not even close to great for programming. I can't even really install Ubuntu on it to speed it up, because the special keyboard doesn't have a Ubuntu driver (Hacky, but could use an ext keyboard).

What's my best option if I have to rely on the Yoga Book for android dev? Struggling w/Android Studio, using VS Code as an editor and doing compilation/debugging over Bash, or something else? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

First question is if its dumb to buy such and expensive watch at this age 20. Being a business student and always wearing business casual or professional, I want a nice simple dress watch. I already have a movado automatic but want something more professional.

I like the tanks aesthetic but am hesitant to spend 2,550 on a quartz movement. I also feel like the Cartier brand will draw more attention. I know I need to get the watch for me and not to impress others but brand recognition is a major factor for me. So will the Cartier turn more heads?

The JLC reverso I want is 5,300 dollars and a manual winding watch. I love the history of JLC and I love the idea of reversing the watch and engraving something special. My only fear of not getting it rn is the cost and that nobody will know what a JLC is. If you have a JLC, does it turn heads or fly under the radar? I am a lot more comfortable in the below 3000 range. What are the best new luxury watches I can get for under 3000?

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Detective John Jones looked through the glass divider that separated interview room from observation. The young man handcuffed to the table inside looked apologetic, and he was. John had a secret, another face that watched the world and aided it. He was J’onn J’onzz, the Martian Manhunter. The city had recently come to a sense of unity in standing against his presence. They preferred the Titans, not a visitor from a world long dead. This young man saw J’onn differently.

His real name was Jason Hart, a once undercover DEA agent, no doubt stricken from records. J’onn had seen 21 Jump Street, and though the situation was much similar, Jason’s story was fraught with a bizarre origin of stress, heartbreak and a faulty attempt to make a superhero. Jason had a brother once, a young man who looked to the stars, to the heroes, and saw hope and inspiration. Jason had similar ideals of heroism, seeing glory in the cosmos. Jason’s memories were open to J’onn, a book unknowingly made public. Martians adhered to many strict protocols regarding their telepathy, but skimming the surface often gave away enough information.

In 2014, Jason’s brother would overdose on Xanax, unprepared to handle the stress of college. A fracturing event with unseen ramifications, the Hart family would never be the same. Jason was desperate in life, he was a college student, a promising athlete at the start of his time in college. He was a perfect candidate for a new program, utilising the college students to do the DEA’s dirty work, become interns in a manner of speaking. Who better to manipulate into doing your dirty work than the desperate and the remorseful.

J’onn had recently gained a new and unloved opinion of Government Agencies, and this only compounded on that.

As the years rolled on, and Jason become further twisted by the mentalities of others, his ideals of heroism twisted further. If people like Batman could beat villains into submission and get away with it, so too could he. The DEA enjoyed this idea, they could wind him up, point him at the enemy and sit back as their clapping monkey got to work. No culpability if done right, able to deny any connections as and when needed. He was the perfect little soldier, for the most part. A lot of drug related crime dropped around the college.

As time went on, Jason became unruly. He found the DEA limiting, problematic, preventative. They parted ways, and Jason graduated from New York University. Hatchets do not always stay buried, and so Jason found himself becoming something different entirely. He needed to protect the people from the rampant problem of drug control. He had to protect them from themselves, keep life untainted by the devil.

Which is ultimately how Jason was in the position he was in, staring down a believed Colombian Drug Lord, dressed in red and purple spandex while a bright blue cape flowed behind him. The Protector, as Jason penned himself, stared at the Drug Lord with intent.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Mauricio Cristobal had been a Drug Lord of renown for three decades by now, working his way to the top with slow care. Having the ability to control fire was the most valuable tool in his arsenal- alongside wit and whim. Being unpredictable could aid, so long as you didn’t change your mind too often. Mauricio had always been involved in the cartel, born into, his parents bled for it, and when they didn’t, they paid the price. Mauricio didn’t mind, having nobody to hold over your head left you harder to touch.

The Cocaine business boomed under his supervision, and he had to admit he delighted in it. It fuelled him, gave him reason to fight and a way to fight. He was the indisputable hero in his eyes, even as the villain of his own story. Every line he took to gave him at least a day to burn away- and he did many lines. Mauricio had come be called Snowflame by those who served under him, and those who worked with him in some way. Others called him ‘The Snow Devil’, as far as translations could go. He was not loved.

Mauricio found himself in the United States more often than Colombia in his later years. His empire had grown rapidly, and sometimes his personal presence was needed. The US Government had developed a love-hate relationship with him, some of them coming to him for their bumps. Others seeking to pull him down. It caused a lot of rifts, and he delighted in taking full advantage of it. It was one of these days that had brought Snowflame to NYC, sitting in the back of a nightclub called ‘Batmick’. Across from Mauricio sat a sweaty man, obese. He claimed he absolutely needed what Snowflame had to offer, and would help with whatever they needed.

These suckers were perfect…

&amp;nbsp;

The Club was always a hotspot of activity in the night, filled to the brim with at least a thousand people, triple on the weekends. It could support such a huge capacity because it was huge. The colours of choice were a royal purple, with the sofas and seats matching the tables. It was only ever broken up by black or the occasional white. The bar ran in a circle in the center of the room, confining staff inside of it, able to see the entirety of the club. There were two men behind that holding weapons of their own, three near the back door. Snowflame was seated in the VIP area to the far right. They all stared at Jason, waiting for someone to make the first move.

Jason had, amusingly, made the worst intro possible- crashing through the glass rooftop. When that hadn’t budged, Snowflames men had dragged him from the rooftop and down into the club. And now two more people were holding him by the arms. Jason was stuck, and was slowly debating how exactly to get out of this situation.

“So.” Snowflame started. “You must be one of those Teen Titans. You’re not a good one, clearly.”

“I wish.” Jason shrugged. “I’m The Protector. I’m here to bring you to justice.”

Laughter rippled through the Cartel members, Snowflame smirked and wiped his nose. “I’m going to turn you to ash.”

Jason swallowed hard. He needed to get out of this situation fast. He’d geared up well enough, with a lot of homemade items on his person. Jason took a deep breath and pulled his arm forwards, hard. He took hold of a home made flash grenade and ripped it free, throwing it into the center of the group. As best as he can. He span his head away and turned. The sudden flash of light was all he needed to break free of the grip. He slammed his fist into the side of one of his captors heads and sent them to the ground.

“GODDAMNIT.” Snowflame called out, catching fire- but still blinded.

With the group distracted and him unblinded, he darted- bullets began to shred to where had been, vision still blinded from the flash. Jason awkwardly rolled over the surface and grabbed a bottle from one of the shelves, hitting one of the cartel members across the head and knocking them down. He reach for the other, wrapping his arms around their leg and pulling it out from under them and then slamming his elbow into their face repeatedly until unconscious. With three of the cartel members down, and the rest regaining their vision, Jason felt pretty trapped.

“FIND HIM.” Snowflame roared in anger.

Jason was trapped. The remaining Cartel members began to move through the club, keeping their barrels pointed ahead of them. Jason grabbed a small blade from his belt and sliced through the material of his cape, ripping a piece of it off. He ripped whiskey from the shelf in front of him and stuffed the torn fabric into it. Jason took a lighter from his belt and clicked several times, until a spark caught the cloth, lighting it. Jason glanced into a reflection, and tossed the molotov into the area of the Cartel. The fire spread rapidly, and they bounced for cover. Jason moved, sliding over the other side of the bar and then over the counter.

Outside of the club, Jason could hear the sirens of the NYPD. He had to move fast if he wanted to take down Snowflame, they’d likely be burnt to a cinder. Jason peeked over the bar at Snowflame. Jason crept forwards, rolling behind a sofa. Snowflame was angry looking, and clearly walking around the club in search of him. Jason crept slowly around the outer edge of the club- that was until the front door burst in.

A swarm of black rolled in through the doors. Snowflame turns and darts towards the back door. Jason followed, leaving the police and the remaining cartel members to it. The shouts followed him through the back door and into an alleyway. Snowflame splayed their hand and pointed it backwards, allowing a gout of flame to tear the distance. Jason leapt to the side behind a car, the flame melting the surface of it. He needed to think fast, to find a way to take Snowflame down without becoming ash. He left the cover and rolled forwards haphazardly, ducking beneath another pillar of heat. Jason darted forwards again and tackled Snowflame. The two hit the floor hard and Jason moved forwards, punching Snowflame across the jaw. The Colombian grabbed Jason by the face and began to burn it, eliciting a scream of pain from Jason. The Protector rolled off, but Snowflame kept their grip.

“You shouldn’t have come here!” Snowflame hissed.

Jason looked up at Snowflame and bit through the pain as best he could. He slammed his head forwards, colliding with Snowflames face. Snowflame slid off of Jason, slumping to the floor, unconscious. Jason panted, cheek burning. Footsteps approached rapidly.

“STAY WHERE YOU ARE, YOU’RE UNDER ARREST.”

J’onn watched the memory of events playing through his mind and sighed. The kid was the victim of others through and through. But he’d require aid from another. Someone who was, understandably, bizarre. J’onn pulled his phone from his pocket and dialled through the numbers, calling up someone who could be a far greater help than J’onn could be. Psychic powers only went so far, and the League couldn’t interfere with Police Activities.

J’onn now only had to wait.

It would be about twenty minutes before his person of interest arrived, bursting through the door of the interview room with all the energy of a rabid llama. The detective within and Jason looked to the man. J’onn could never understand the mask, nor the wings. But they were always effective- in some way- at their role.

So my story starts with this.


I'm an American and I wanted to spend a year in Europe before I was 30. I had an interest in French so I started taking classes for about a year but I didn't have any definitive plans.


Looking for ways to practice French I ended up I meeting this Morrocan girl on a language exchange app. We had a fair bit in common as we both wanted to get into the IT industry and seem to have a lot of the same worldview.


She seemed perfect, almost too good to be true. Always so sweet and encouraging, she even told me she loved me fairly early on, which I thought was bit weird but I thought maybe it was a language or cultural difference. The reason she told me she was learning English was because she wanted to study in America.


Eventually we started to like each other but I put the breaks on the relationship because she was living in Morrocco and I was in America and it wasn't clear if we would ever meet IRL, which I thought would be important to building a trusting relationship. Since it's hard to really know someone if you aren't around them in person.


We kept in touch but didn't talk too often. A year passes and I got accepted into a school in Paris and so did she by coincidence. So I moved and a few months later she also moved to Paris. However she told me she had a boyfriend, which I accepted since I didn't want to move further into a relationship with her until we met in person.


I was also super busy with exams when she first arrived so we didn't make plans to meet immediately. When I was finished we started to make plans to meet for the first time on the weekend. We agreed on a time and place on a Sunday. Sunday morning comes and I send her a text asking how she was and she replied saying she was good and everything. I then send her another text message confirming the time(4:00pm) and place of our first meeting


She didn't reply to me until 9:00pm and just said ""sorry I'm busy today"". I was pretty angry because we had been talking for over a year and she just flaked on me right when we could finally meet in person without a good explanation.  So I told her that I was upset to which she first said that she had homework, but then she changed her story to her phone not working, because I thought it was strange that she couldn't just cancel the plans and reschedule rather than leave me waiting all day for her.


So that left a really bad impression so I just stopped talking to her for awhile. A few months later she texts me out of the blue and says she was sorry. So I decided to give her a second chance because of our history together.

So she told me she was lying about having a boyfriend and just wanted to make me jealous, so she was actually single and but we ended up dating anyways.

The first 3 weeks seemed perfect, we hung out all the time talked a lot, and again she started to tell me things like ""I love you so much"" and things like that.

But then I started noticing some weird things, like first she told me she didn't use facebook but then when we were hanging out I saw on her laptop facebook and a message from some guy, but quickly closed it. Bizarrely within the same 5 minutes she got a call from some middle aged American guy who she said she met on the same App we did but that he was just a ""friend"".

Then she started being very unavailable. Particularly over weekends. I would send her a text message and I wouldn't get a reply for days. After a few weeks of her disappearing over weekends I got upset and told her she couldn't just ignore me for 4-5 days at a time. And I'm introverted, I don't even need to talk to her every day or anything, but I'd expect at least a reply from her within a reasonable time frame.

Initially she told me it was her phone that stopped working and that's why she was absent with messaging, I gave her my phone number, email, whatsapp, and facebook and told her to let me know if her phone wasn't working. But again the behavior has continued, being completely absent over weekends.

She then made another excuse that she wasn't replying to me on the weekends because she was living with her Moroccan cousins and didn't want them to know she was dating a boy. Again,  I found this strange because she should still have some privacy in her home, and she is 24 years old living in France.

Now she has moved and lives alone and the behavior has continued, with no good reason as she has several ways of getting a message to me. I've expressed to her that she can't do this. And what's worse is when we hangout she always seems in a bit of a hurry, we never spend more than an hour or two together at a time. I'd say we average maybe 2-4 hours of time together a month and maybe even less time talking on the phone or communicating now.

Another strange thing is her social media is extremely sparse, she doesn't have any photos of herself on facebook, but I know she gets lots of messages from people on it. I've never met any of her friends or family she has here so I have no way of snooping or verifying the type of person she really is.

The last time I saw her was a little over 10 days ago, and the last time I saw her on a weekend was over 2 months ago. Again, I find this extremely strange because she is in an internship and works Monday-Friday so you'd think she'd be mostly available on weekends, but she always seems to have an excuse. 

I sent her a text message on Friday and still haven't heard from her and it's now Sunday evening. When we are actually together she tells me she loves me and really always wants to be with me but can never seem to make the time for me. We've talked about it, I asked her to stop acting like this a few times but nothing is changing.


I don't know a lot about Moroccan culture, but I know they are conservative and don't have as much ""dating"" as in Europe and the west. So I don't want to dump her if I'm just over reacting to some cultural differences, but this just seems really strange. Is this normal for Morroccan girls? I'm extremely close to dumping her. I feel like she might be using me for something or maybe even a green card.


**TL;DR:** Morrocan girlfriend has been ""busy"" for 8 weekends consecutively and rarely has time for me nor good explanations for her lack of availability."

I should be pleased to attend an interview at any time which is convenient to you.
Yours sincerely, ""

Hi
Here is my application letter, I would be very grateful if you could help with a mistake that I missed or if you can suggest an improvement.
(I know it's far from perfect as an application letter, but it's for my first job so I can really say much more)

Many Thanks"
8o8uev,11,2018-06-03,DAE's Nparent try to control when you could sleep?,RadioactiveSprout,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8o8uev/daes_nparent_try_to_control_when_you_could_sleep/,"I've been having sleep issues this week and this morning when I woke before sunrise, I was thinking about the way my Nmom would try to control my sleep. 

Throughout my childhood, she never let me sleep in. By 9am she would generally come, open my bedroom door saying that I needed to wake up or I'd ""waste the day and have trouble falling asleep at night"". It didn't matter how late I'd stayed up the night before or if I didn't even have any plans for that day-- she would never let me sleep in.

I remember as I neared the end of my freshman year of undergrad, after finals I was going to my parents' home for a week or two before going to the other side of the country for an internship. Nmom had told me many times that after her undergrad finals she would go home and just sleep for a few consecutive days. So, I mistakenly thought I would be given this same grace period of a few days. Nope. I think the latest she let me sleep in once was 10am but I think that was more because she was busy that morning than because she was being kind.

And the part that really frustrated me, was she wouldn't let me go to sleep early to catch up either. Once I became a teenager, she made it clear that if I wanted to go to sleep before her it was not because I was really tired, but because I had become a cruel, selfish person that ""no longer cares about family."" Even when I was eventually diagnosed with a slew of diseases, it didn't matter, I had become ""so selfish, hardly recognizable as my daughter"" and clearly the illnesses were ""just anxiety you need treatment for,"" not something that I actually needed to rest and recuperate from.

I've been NC for several months now and in PTSD therapy the entire time. It's just wild that I keep realizing ways in which she tried to control or hurt my body.

8o8x4n,6,2018-06-03,My bf of 4.5 years broke up with me over the phone,issue4325,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8o8x4n/my_bf_of_45_years_broke_up_with_me_over_the_phone/,"Apologies in advance, this is long and complicated since I am still in shock.

We have been together since our senior year of high school and the first three years of college we were long distance. Even though it was tough we made it work and after he graduated a year early he started grad school at the same school I was at. I was so excited to be in the same town as him but things weren’t as great as I was expecting.

I’ve since found out that I have mild depression. I began struggling at the beginning of last year. I became disinterested in things, irritable, gained weight, and my sex drive was nearly gone. I know it was really hard to be around me but I couldn’t dig my way out of that pain and I didn’t ever consider that there was anything wrong with me. We still had good times and often I would be in a good mood. But I know the times when I was not doing well I made it hard for him. Yet, he never said anything to me about his feelings, so I didn’t know that anything was wrong.

Last September my younger brother attempted suicide, and I just about fell apart. My bf and I had just began getting used to seeing each other regularly and I did not handle that trauma well. Part of the reason it hurt me so bad was because a lot of my brother’s symptoms I saw in myself, and that was terrifying. I knew I needed to go talk to someone and get some help, yet I didn’t. I don’t think I was in a place where I was really ready.

Over Christmas break my family and my bf went on a trip abroad. I was pretty much at my worst, I had gained all this weight and was so unhappy with myself. I had a breakdown and I know it was terrible for everyone. I wish I had taken care of myself but I think I had to hit rock bottom. When we got back from the trip my bf was very distant. I knew I had hurt him and that I probably seemed crazy to him. He told me he needed to talk to me and I assumed he was going to end things. When I got to his house he was acting normal and joking around with his parents and I was super wary. Then after his parents went to bed he sat down and said that he’d noticed a lot of changes in me in the past year and that he thought I needed to do a lot of work on myself because he was really unhappy with our relationship. Even though it was so hard to hear all the points he made, I knew he was right, and I sat quietly and listened to his feelings. I told him I had made a counseling appointment for that week when got back to school and that I knew I had some work to do. It was so hard to do that but I didn’t want to lose him.

Counseling was eye-opening to me. And I had multiple reasons for being there. A lot of my own issues stemmed from my family situation, as my dad is a covert Narcissist and is emotionally abusive at times. Then I had all of my own struggles, as well as the grief I needed to process from my brother’s suicide attempt. It was so hard talking about things after being raised in a household where it wasn’t always safe to share my emotions. But I put in the work and it felt so good. I also began taking care of myself; walking and eating better. Since January I have lost 32 pounds and I feel so different.

But it seemed like the healthier I became, the unhappier my bf was. We mostly had normal days and many good times together, but there were several instances where he really hurt me. A week before Valentine’s Day, I told him I thought of a gift for him and how excited I was. He admitted he forgot it was coming up and I told him not to worry since he still had time. It was our first one together since our very first one in high school, and I bought him a nice bottle of scotch he likes and he didn’t get me anything. We cooked dinner together but I was really disappointed. My birthday was only five days after that, which know it difficult gift-wise, but he asked for ideas and I gave him two small ones. On the day of my birthday, I woke up to two rejection letters from my top two prospective grad schools so I was already pretty bummed. Then I barely heard from him all day except a quick happy birthday text. I had told him I wanted to go out to dinner that night, nowhere fancy, just wanted to spend time together. It was past dinner time and I asked him if he still wanted to go, and he said no that he had a late lunch. I asked if he wanted to do anything and he said sure but that he was going to the gym first. He stopped by after that and I told him I was pretty disappointed and he got defensive and said he didn’t know we had made any concrete plans and that he was just about to ask to come over before I asked him. I told him there wasn’t really any excuse and that I didn’t want to have to plan every detail of my birthday and he admitted he messed up, about that and Valentine’s Day. I told him we need to communicate better and he agreed. He didn’t even bring my gifts over with him though, and I didn’t get him until a few days later when I went over to his apartment.

Things got better after that, I continued with my counseling and was making huge strides. I felt so much more even and composed. He seemed to notice and told me he was proud of me. But I also noticed he would avoid talking about things in the future and would sometimes get short with me for asking him questions. I started to put up some boundaries with him about how I wanted to be treated, like asking him to be honest about his feelings if I felt he wasn’t, or letting him know when something he did/said bothered me.

I finally got an acceptance letter to a really good program across the country that I never dreamed I would get into and I was so happy. He was excited for me too and we talked about how perfect it was for me and how he couldn’t wait to visit me. Meanwhile he got a summer internship for a company in a town only a few hours from our hometown, which is where I would be staying from the summer. We talked about how fun that city was and all the things we could do when I visited.

In April my kitten I’d had for almost a year passed away and I was heartbroken. He was really upset too, we both loved that cat. He was really supportive and helped me a lot during that time.

In May I graduated from college and instead of walking, I decided to have both sides of my family stay with us at the beach to celebrate. My school was massive and the graduation venue was so full there was spillover in the parking lot, so I was glad about the choice I made. I was really excited for the party and my bf agreed. Then a few days before the party, we were at his apartment cooking dinner on my last night before I went back home, and I asked if he was still planning on staying both nights at the beach house with my family and I. He hesitated and said he didn’t know. I asked what was up and he said he didn’t really want to stay there since it didn’t sound like fun to him. I asked him why he didn’t tell me that earlier, and why he told me he was excited to stay, and he said it was because he didn’t want to hurt me feelings. I told him he didn’t get to assume my reactions and that he should just have been honest with me, I would have understood, even if I was a little hurt. He apologized and told he he’d do better.

Two weekends ago it was time to move him in to his new apartment for the summer for his internship, and I drove up with him and his parents to help. He and I went up to his apartment in our college town to pack up the night before. We cleaned his apartment together and I helped get things ready for the drive the next day. When his parents came the next morning everything went well and we drove few hours to the new apartment. It was a quick move since he didn’t bring much and we had lunch together before I left with his parents. I told him I was proud of this job he got and that I knew he would do great.

On Memorial Day it had been about a week since I’d seen him. Things were normal that morning, he was telling me that the company VP was throwing a party for all the interns at his river house that weekend and he was excited for it. Then I mentioned I wanted to find a weekend to come visit him, maybe at the end of June. He said “yeah idk” and I got the feeling he didn’t want me to visit. When I told him that he just said that he was sorry. I asked him to be honest with me and tell me if he didn’t want me to visit and he didn’t answer. Eight minutes later he asked if he could call. I said sure, and when he called he said he said this was difficult for him but he had to do it. I knew instantly he was breaking up with me, and I asked if he was really doing this to me over the phone. He said yes. I don’t remember much else. He did say that he loved me and he would always treasure our time together. I told him he needs to find time to come home so he could look me in the eye and do this the right way. He said the soonest he could was in two weeks. He told me he loved me again and said goodbye.

I am shocked. Even though I knew he probably wouldn’t want to go back to long distance in the fall I thought we would sit down together and end things on a mutual, respectful note. I never thought he would even be capable of doing this to anyone, but especially to me. Looking back now I can see that he was pulling was at the beginning of this year. But not once did he mention he wanted to break up. He never told me how he was feeling. He didn’t even answer me when I asked him to be honest about his feelings, he just called me and dumped me over the phone.

I can see the pattern of avoidance now. He avoids conflict. He said he was just tired of being in pain and wanted it to end and that waiting two weeks until he could come home next was unfair to me because he’d have to pretend everything was fine. But now I can see he’s been pretending for months. So I don’t buy that excuse. He said being upfront about his feelings is important so he had to do it that day, but he hasn’t been upfront this entire spring, so I know that’s a lie. I just can’t believe he did this. I feel betrayed, like I am worth nothing more than a phone call to him. This has ruined any chance of an amicable end to our relationship and any chance of us being able to remain on good terms in the future. He said maybe in a few years when I was done with school we could see how things are then, but does he really mean that? You have to know when you dump someone on the phone that you’re burning a bridge, right? Did he really think I would ever trust him again? I have lost all respect for him, which is so hard because I always thought of him as a good person. Even though he can be a dumbass sometimes and hasn’t always made the best decisions I always respected his values. I just don’t know what to do right now.

He is coming home this weekend like I asked him to and I’m honestly surprised. I know I won’t get any closure because of how he went about this, but I want to tell him how I feel, how what he did to me made me feel. Maybe it won’t do anything, maybe it won’t make him feel any remorse. But I feel like I can’t move on until I get these feelings out. I am in so much pain. Our breakup was always going to be difficult for me, but having it happen like this feels like a huge violation of trust and boundaries. I don’t know how someone could do that to another person. I know he was having a hard time, but he had so many chances to end this over the past few months, he should have sat me down and been honest about his feelings. I would have been sad but at least I could accept that. Now I feel like I am rethinking everything, all his words and actions and intentions. Was anything even real? How can you care about someone and do that to them?

Am I just overreacting? Is it acceptable to break up with someone over the phone after 4.5 years? I know he was about three hours away but we saw each other just the weekend before. I think maybe me asking him to be upfront about whether or not he wanted me to visit him this summer triggered something in him and caused him to do it right then (not saying it’s my fault) but I just think that’s so messed up. Now that I am healthier I can see all the unhealthiness in his behavior.

I guess what I need help with is, how do I begin to heal from this? I know I probably need to find a counselor here in my hometown for the next few months before I leave for grad school. I know that even though I had my own issues, his ultimately caused this and that it’s not about me, but it’s still hard to go through. I just can’t believe that this is going to be my last memory of him. Everyone has been telling me I’m better off without him and he doesn’t deserve me and logically I though that’s true now, but I feel like everything has been ripped out from underneath me, because just a week ago we seemed fine. I just feel so discarded and empty. What are some things I can do to make this easier for myself?

Tl;dr: my bf dumped me over the phone after 4.5 years together. I need help processing this and understanding how to begin to move on.

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

------------------------------------------

***Some final notes!***

* I only write here on Reddit, through the PM's. Not chat. Don't send me chat invites.

* Yes, this is F4F. Guys, respect that. Today isn't your day.

* My message length varies, but you'll never get anything less than 4 lines out of me.

* I can write in first or third person, with a slight preference for third."
8o9fzn,25,2018-06-03,Sadbreath's Guide to the MPH: Picking a school and competitiveness supplement,SadBreath,publichealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/8o9fzn/sadbreaths_guide_to_the_mph_picking_a_school_and/,"The feedback to the initial guide has been great. I've been getting a lot of questions about specific programs and opinions on different schools and competitiveness. I'm by no means an expert on the quality of MPH educations or an admissions officer. You're best served by talking directly to current students and the student support offices instead of an anonymous online person. That said, there are general guidelines and tips which I've observed.


**I have a specific field I want to pursue, how can I figure out what schools are relevant?**

If you have access to literature search engines or know someone who does, you're in luck. A rough way to understand the research output of a school is to do a literature search on the topic. For instance, someone messaged me asking about mental health departments,. So I open up Scopus and search for ""mental health"" articles since 2015. To reduce the number of bench science/psychology articles, I cross-reference with the term ""public health."" [I then pull up the affiliated institution list for the authors.](https://imgur.com/a/PVn4Wgw) 

Some caveats; some schools will be split apart; Emory is separate from Rollins (its public health school). JHU is split into JHU, JHU-Medicine, and JHU-PH. It is also only a rough approximation and doesn't give an indication of the quality of research, but you can look at a specific school and sort by citations to get a better idea.

So, we find a good starting point. If you're interested in mental health, U-Toronto, King's College of London, Harvard, JHU, Emory, Columbia, UWash, UCLA, UCSF, etc. all have comparable research portfolios in Mental Health. This corresponds to more faculty and classes for you to take, and more money which they can use to hire research assistants. On the bottom end, you see UKentucky, MUSC, Baylor, Miami, etc., and if you're interested in Mental Health, you may not find too much opportunity there.

Again, this is one data point to help you start your search, there are other factors besides research portfolio which are important in school choice. See the primary guide for more information.

**I don't have experience, should I wait? What do I do?**

Most public health schools require experience for the MPH. But be loose with your definition of experience. Volunteer work, part-time jobs, internships, student organizations can all count if they are framed correctly and were adequately extensive. You will likely clear the hurdle for your application to be reviewed, but may be less competitive than those with extensive work experience. 

You can also consider getting a similar degree, such as the MSPH, MSH, and MS variants. They are different between schools and may have more a focus on research in a specific area than practice, but almost always will have the same core classes, and will graduate with the same hard skills.

If you are not in a rush to get through schooling, you can always try to get more experience before applying. This tends to be difficult though, as most positions require some experience or an MPH. The two most common are in advocacy and working with disadvantaged populations in a non-profit (patient navigators, condom distribution, etc., family planning, etc.). Many students also go into AmeriCorps and Peace Corps. Some have experience in backend roles like medical coding, EHRs etc. But public health is broad, and any tangential health-related experience can work if you go into with the right frame of mind. 

I got my start doing address corrections and data entry at the local health department and proposed and helped out on analysis of gentrification effects on disease after reading an article in the paper. I also volunteered at a senior home on the weekends and did some work with Habitat for Humanity. I applied and got into the MPH out of my undergraduate without any gap year.

**My grades are less than 3.0, am I competitive?**

If you have a strong mission statement and experience, yes. If you can talk to professors you want to work with, they can make sure your application gets reviewed. Once you pass a lower benchmark, your GPA does not matter as much as your experience and personal statement. If you have research, you should be a very competitive candidate."
8o9h5k,2,2018-06-03,I [M26] am having such a hard time with my SO [F24] feelings,Pabloud7,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8o9h5k/i_m26_am_having_such_a_hard_time_with_my_so_f24/,"My SO and me have been together for 20 months. After being together for 4 months we had to be in a LDR for 2 months and we had no problems dealing with it because we knew there was a plan ahead for us in the near future. I went to Prague \(where she lives\) and we lived together for 7 and a half months. Everything was amazing with her, very passionate and happy and we enjoyed our sex life and company very much. We even had plans for the future she used to tell me I was ""the one"" for her \(I think the same way, but I couldn't propose her until our future could be more clear\). I also didn't really get used to the country, and I didn't have enough money to enjoy life there, so I often used to say that I didn't want to go back there anymore. In October 2017 she began doing her PhD in Prague \(it lasts 4 years\), just a month before I had to go back to my country.

Eventually, I had to return to Chile \(November 2017\) to finally get my degree. And we have been in an LDR again for 6 months. In the beginning things were similar to our first LDR, she was missing me very much, whereas I was enjoying my country with my friends and working on my thesis \(I also missed her obviously, but not as intensely as her\). We used to communicate by Skype once per week \(even though she wanted to call more often, but for me was kind of tiring\). In February she bought flight tickets to come to Chile on June 21st and we were very excited about it! I started to plan my future and think about studying abroad in a European country \(but not Prague\) to be closer to her. She used to ask me to do it in Prague but I didn't want to. I also also have to say that sometimes I didn't behave as the best bf because I was stressed or busy and she needed so much attention.

4 months passed like that and I began to realize she was getting more distant. We used to chat every day, but I realized some days we were only saying ""good morning"" and ""good night"", that we were beginning to grow apart... Until one day, she went to a conference in Germany and she met lots of people and had very much fun. We talked about it and I couldn't avoid feeling really sad... I was feeling I didn't fit in her world anymore, that she didn't need me in her life. I told her how I felt and she said something had changed in her, that she felt different towards me and that she kind of got used to be without me, but that she still cared a lot about me. And that broke me, it triggered a lot of insecurities in my head, thinking about if she had met somone more interesting... This also led to lots of jealousy and a controlling behaviour from my side. After this I even told her I was considering moving to Prague and find a job there after getting my degree \(around July 2018\), but she wasn't very excited about the idea, which affected me even more and more...She thinks I will be disappointed about the country again and I that will suffer. At the same time, because of her PhD, she will have to go constantly to conferences and even to do internships abroad for 3\-6 months. And she realized she wants to enjoy her PhD as much as possible. Things turned around and she was the one having fun, while I was the one needing much more attention.

Things remained like that, until one day she got very drunk with her colleagues and her best friend told me about it. I got crazy when I heard it, because she didn't use to drink that much, so it was a strange situation for me. I couldn't avoid asking that friend if she thought she had cheated on me, and in case it happened, that if she could please let me know. On the next day my gf got to know about that conversation I had with her friend, and she got very sad and disappointed at me. She felt the trust between us had broken and I felt very ashamed by my behaviour. Only on that occassion I realized how much pain I had caused, and since then \(end of April\) I have behaved much better. I know she is faithful and all of this doesn't concern another guy...but maybe she feels attracted to someone else and she is confused about it.

However, things changed after that event and she grew even more distant. She wasn't lovely anymore when chatting, she wasn't as excited as before with our calls. She even told me she didn't feel those passionate and romantic feelings towards me anymore...I have felt terrible during the last weeks, because I was trying to be as lovely as possible to her, but I wouldn't receive even a honest ""I love you"" if I didn't write it to her. She has also been thinking about not coming to Chile and she has even told me she feels she only wants to be my friend. I have tried to convince her to please come to Chile \(we would be together for 1 month and a half\), to at least try and see how she feels while being with me, but she says that I would be disappointed by her, because she feels she will not want to be intimate with me while being here. That being said, a few days ago I asked her if she wanted to break up, and told her I wasn't sure we could still be friends after breaking up while being distant, and she couldn't do it. Personally I think she is confused and afraid because she has told me she suffered very much during the first months of our LDR, and if things go well and we have to separate again she may suffer even more...but at the same time it seems she doesn't want to lose me.

What do you think about all of this, am I interpreting it correctly? Do you think things could improve if she comes? That her feelings could come back? Do you think these problems are mainly due to the distance? And on the other hand is it possible to lose all those strong feelings in just 2 months? We have been waiting for so long to meet again, that I can't imagine if she decided not to come and try it...at least we could break up in person if things don't work out.

Sorry for the long post, but I really needed to include as much details as possible. Thank you very much for reading!!"

Long time lurker here-making my first post, and i need advice with salary negotiation.


I just graduated this week with a BS in manufacturing engr. I am currently a part time intern, almost 2 years, at manufacturing company in milpitas california (high cost of living). My managers are currently trying to get approval to get me hired as a full time salaried employee. Everyone in the company enjoy my good work ethics and person, but I am still waiting for them to get approval from headquarters.


As this will be my first real job straight out of college with little experience and most training will be on the job, I do not know if I should negotiate my salary or not. I am getting mixed reviews if it is reasonable and I need your help.


Here is a few catch that might help with my negotiation: 

* over a year with the company, and i understand most of the systems
* manager left the company and i do most of the reportings (go to personish within the department)
* long commute hours ~1:20-1:45hrs each way
* overall, i have a feeling that they do not want me to leave or find another job 


I do not know how much they salary range will be (guessing 68k-72k), so any advice would help and i greatly appreciate it.

**Weekly Character Discussion: Taylor Hebert (Skitter)**

**Cast page description:**
&gt;The protagonist.  A bug controller, she wears a black spidersilk costume with gray-black speckled armor panels.  If you've forgotten who she is, you have a problem.^^[[1]](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/cast-spoiler-free/)

**In-depth:**
&gt; A 16 year old native of Brockton Bay, Taylor gained the power to control arthropods and other simple lifeforms, sensing what they sense to varying degrees.  With a wide range (spanning nine to fifteen hundred feet around her) and the power to individually control each insect, she relies on versatility and strategic thinking to seize the advantage in battle.Her powers manifested in January 2011, triggered by a bullying campaign by her former best friend and two other girls.  She found a measure of escape with her dream of becoming a superhero, but things didn’t quite work out that way.  She’s now one of the controlling powers in Brockton Bay, a villain warlord in charge of the Boardwalk, with a small contingent of followers working under her, and leader of the Undersiders.

&gt;In civilian guise, she’s skinny to the point of being scrawny, with glasses and long curly hair she maintains as a desperate grasp at a single feminine feature.  Her gawky or nerdy appearance is marked by a wide mouth and large eyes.

&gt;As Skitter, she wears a costume of black spider silk and gray armor panels, a yellow-lensed mask that features a mandible-esque design around her jaw.  Her hair blows free.  Depending on the situation and the state of her costume, she occasionally wears a skirt or shawl of black spider silk with ragged or torn edges, for protection, concealment, and to offer more surface area for her bugs to crawl on.  When battle ready, bugs crawl over every surface of her costume, including her hair and mask.  The carapace-like panel of armor at her back serves as a utility compartment, holding her weapons and various items.^^[[2]](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/cast-spoiler-free/cast/)

**Notes:**

* First appearance: [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/)

* PoV - Taylor: [List](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)

* General affiliations: Originally a budding hero, Skitter became a villain sometime into her well-paid internship in The Undersiders. Later, she left the group after some modest accomplishments, and became a hero with the Chicago Wards. Later, she resorted to vigilante acts of inter-species terrorism.

* Powerset: Pretty weak C-Tier power, can just control bugs more or less. 

* No Feats Thread this week as Skitter had very few notable achievements.

8oaajw,1,2018-06-03,EdgeRouter X traffic shaping question,Jullernaut,Ubiquiti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/8oaajw/edgerouter_x_traffic_shaping_question/,"Hey,

i am trying to use a EdgeRouter X as a switch to shape network traffic.
My network looks like [this](https://imgur.com/LchM2OT).

The problem is that the DSL connection is so asymmetrical, that if a download takes a lot of bandwidth
the ACKs congest the upload link of the FritzBox and make VOIP connection go laggy (ACKs have the same Priority as VOIP in the FritzBox QoS and you can't fix that easily).

So my solution was to use a EdgeRouter X between the FritzBox and the rest of my network to limit the Upload to 50% of the DSL connection for all PCs.  
That fixed my VOIP problems, but now i connected a NAS to the FritzBox and want to allow the full bandwidth between the EdgeRouter X and the FritzBox, if the destination is inside my home network.  
And that doesn't work so far, i only get ~900kb/s between my NAS and everything behind the EdgeRouter.  
  
My config looks at the moment like this:  

    All interfaces in one bridge group and the interface connected to the FritzBox has a traffic-policy for outgoing traffic.
     ethernet eth0 {
         bridge-group {
             bridge br0
         }
         description Fritzbox
         duplex auto
         speed auto
         traffic-policy {
             out intern
         }
     }
    [....]
     traffic-policy {
     shaper intern {
         bandwidth 1000mbit
         class 2 {
             bandwidth 1000mbit
             match LAN {
                 ip {
                     destination {
                         address 192.168.178.0/24
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
         default {
             bandwidth 50kbit
             ceiling 100
         }
     }

My idea was that the default should apply to everything where no class matches, but so far it looks like the class is always used?  
Is there a way to show how often a class is matched?  
Or is there i better way to do what i want?  "
8oaush,3,2018-06-03,My Best Friend (19M) Has Relationship Issues With His Girlfriend (19F),Baunfire,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8oaush/my_best_friend_19m_has_relationship_issues_with/,"Buckle your seat belts boys and girls cuz it's story time \(Sorry if this is kinda long\)

Ok so for the past year my best friend from high school has had many fights with his girlfriend and has considered breaking up with her multiple times. The fights started in high school when they started dating, and everytime he tried to talk to her, she would just try to avoid him for a period of time until things settled down. These fights usually left him depressed and often left unnecessary hassles in our group of friends. For example, we were planning to go to Mission Peak on a hiking trip, but they had a fight the night before and he got so depressed that we had to cancel the trip.

Things started getting worse when they both started university and had to a long distance relationship. The same thing happened and they had many fights and grew further apart since they were both busy. Now in the summer, they both have internships in the same area and are living together, but guess what, THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING. Nothing had changed, she still tries to avoid talking about serious issues and nothing has been settled.

Even though he was considering breaking up multiple times, he never did. He said that he found it very hard to let go since he grew up with her in elementary school and only started dating in high school. 

I don't know what to do. I've given him advice, but I feel that my words don't have that much meaning since I'm just an outsider in their relationship. I'm honestly just worried about them so I can here on reddit. What do you all think and what should they do?"
8oav5n,5,2018-06-03,"I [22M] just graduated college and am trying to find employment, gf [23F] of 2 years is making the process harder",w3nch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8oav5n/i_22m_just_graduated_college_and_am_trying_to/,"some background: My girlfriend is a year older than me, and graduated a year before me with a 4 year degree in nursing. She's very much the go-getter type, works hard and takes initiative. She then took the NCLEX (nursing certification), and found a good paying job within a few months. She worked hard in school/job hunting and I'm incredibly proud of her. She's been working for close to a year.

Some background on me: I just completed my senior year of college, and I'm taking a single summer course to finish my degrees in biology and chemistry. I'm currently studying to take a pharmacy technician certification exam. I have long term plans to get into a pharmD program, but I want to work for a year or two before that.

The issue started about 6 months ago, maybe a bit more. The gf starts expressing concern about my career, with reason. At that point, I didn't really know what I was going to do after college, and hadn't started down the pharmacy route yet. I started applying for jobs early, looking for internships, calling medical companies, all that good stuff. I didn't have much luck. I landed a temporary internship for this summer, but nothing permanent, since most employers are looking to hire in the next month or two, not 6 months down the line.

The nature of my gf's career path is fairly linear. She knew exactly what she wanted to do since high school. Nurses are in high demand, and the whole education -&gt; job process was very streamlined for her. Her school set her up to take the NCLEX, and then she applied to the hospital that was ""paired"" with some of her college nursing classes, and immediately got the job. Again, I'm very proud and happy for her, but the process was fairly simple (not easy; simple).

The problem is, her concern for my career quickly turned into condescending berating. As graduation nears, I'm studying my ass off and trying to finish my degree, while also applying to a metric fuckload of jobs in my free time. Meanwhile, the gf is giving me the ""you need to get serious about your career, jobs just don't fall in you lap, you need to take initiative, XYZ have jobs already, why don't you?"" talk every week. She got offers for 2 out of the 2 jobs she applied for, so in her mind, the fact that I don't have a job means that I must not be trying. She can absolutely not be convinced that I am in fact trying to find employment. It's like she forget that I'm a full year behind her, and acts like I've been unemployed for the past year, instead of in school.

It doesn't help that her whole nursing class have jobs, and multiple friends of hers (who have computer engineering and comp sci degrees) found employment a few months before graduating.

She brings this up on a weekly basis. I think she thinks she's somehow being helpful, but adds absolutely nothing except stress to my job hunt. Stuff like ""yeah me and my nursing friends were talking about you not having a job, and their boyfriends make X thousand a year. I was embarrassed."" Shit like that. Repeated comments like those make me feel like she's just shitting on me with her friends about my lack of work.

I'm basically in the mindset that I've been unemployed for a year and a half, and then I remember that I HAVEN'T EVEN GRADUATED YET. Like yeah, ideally I would have a job lined up right out of college, but with the gf breathing down my neck, I feel like I'm literally the only guy on the god damn planet who isn't working for NASA 5 minutes after he gets a diploma.

I've talked to my gf about this multiple times with multiple different approaches. Sometimes she gives a half-hearted apology, sometimes we fight, but it never changes anything. To her, hard work=success, so no success must mean I'm not working hard enough. We don't live together, so she doesn't see how many hours I put into the job hunt.

Currently, I'm finishing up my summer class, and I have an interview lined up. I'm about to take (and hopefully pass) my pharm tech certification exam, and I'm getting some call-backs from my applications. Things are looking up, and I'm confident I'll find work soon. I'm positive my gf situation will improve once that happens.

What I'm worried about is, will I get support from my girlfriend if I ever get laid off? If I don't get into a PharmD program? If anything  career-wise doesn't go my way immediately? I'm wondering if the way she acted with this particular hurdle is indicative of how she'll act in the future when things don't go perfectly. Maybe I'm being dramatic about the situation, but the way she's acted about the whole thing took me aback. I know it stems from her caring about my financial stability and well being, but honestly she did nothing but add a fuck ton of stress to my life. This is not usual behavior for her, purely this specific instance.

I'm not really sure what question I'm trying to ask, but have you had any similar situations? What would you do in my shoes? I know it's vague, but general advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance :)

TL;DR Not yet graduated, haven't found a job. Successful girlfriend thinks this is outrageous."

I am curious to hear from students who applied to their program. 

- **Do candidates who have an undergraduate GPA below 3.0 even stand a chance?** 

- **Would it be wise to take a GRE exam even though they do not require?** 

- **Or would it be wise to take some non-degree seeking courses just to show I can handle their courseload?**

**Additional Details:**

I majored in EE &amp; CpE, I am interested in pursuing my MS in CS. My undergrad GPA was low because of my family hardship, which eventually affected my mental health due to a lot of responsibilities and too much traveling. 

Apart from my GPA, I do have 5 internships ranging from small startups from big companies and a National Science Foundation Undergraduate Research under my belt. Currently, I work for a big company. My management seems pleased with my work performance and I may be able to obtain letter of recommendations (from my management and clients that I am supporting). "

My question is:

1. Anyone with tips and tricks on landing this TechX internship? I try to contact every recruiter on LinkedIn that is working at Tmobile near me trying to get in touch with the main recruiter or someone in charge of this internship?

2. If I end up with the sale job do you think they will less likely to give me the internship position since I will be working for them during the whole screening/interview process?

3. Anyone know how long the screening/Interviews gonna take? or a timeframe or scheduled job fairs in DFW relating to this internship?"

I have a rash on my face that just won't seem to go away. It's been a tumultuous and difficult few months. I've started to see a therapist because these changes have been affecting my day-to-day life.

Now the interesting thing is I've begun to have intrusive thoughts about having a child to give me purpose. I dont want children now or ever, but I'm in such a difficult place right now that I'm desperate for anything to make me happy. 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thinking? I know rationally a child will make me even unhappier, but my mind is grasping at anything it can. It's scary because I know rational me would laugh at the idea, but rational me is not here right now and I just want her back."

&gt;Matt was laying in his bed, his mind racing as the whether or not he'd actually get to play tonight. It'd been a little while since his Anne, his mom put him to bed. He was promised though. Promised that his 12 year old cock could fuck pussy again.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thing is, Anne wasn't a big fan of birth control, and now that Matt's little cock was starting to shoot, they couldn't fuck anymore. What kind of mother would let her son go sex starved. Especially now that he's hitting puberty. That's why Anne drugged her 10 year old daughter Sarah.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Hey sweetheart"" Anne said slowly opening the door to Matt's room. ""Your not asleep yet are you?"" She followed up in a hushed tone.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Mm\-mm"" Matt said, already climbing out of bed, excited to get his dick wet again. Not to say he wasn't fucking. Anne was more than happy to supply her ass and mouth for his little boy cock, he didn't realize how lucky he was. Still, any good boy deserves a good cunt.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Come on"" Anne said, taking Matt's hand. She led him down the dark hallway, the two walking quietly. Anne slowly opened the door to Sarah's room. Her pink nightlight gave the room a cozy atmosphere. There Sarah was, passed out drooling on her pillow. Anne had the good sense to put her to bed naked, making this whole thing easier. Matt looked up at his mother with excitement.  He stepped towards his little sisters bed and started climbing up.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Hold on dear"" His mother stopped him. ""Let me get her ready."" Anne positioned Sarah's body so she was face down with a pillow beneath her thighs. ""Now I have to get her cunny nice and wet okay?"" Matt nodded and his mother tucked her head between Sarah's legs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The room was silent but for Anne's licking and Matt's excited breath. Matt stripped out of his PJ's and waited kneeling at the edge of the bed, butt naked and soft cock hanging freely.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Okay darling."" His mother said, moving away from Sarah's cunt. Matt scooted over between his sister's legs and looked up at Anne helplessly. ""Oh, your still soft."" Anne took Matt's hand, and he opened his palm as she spat into it. He brought it strait back to his cock, lubed it with his mom's spit and started stroking it vigorously. Anne watched with pride.Then, Matt stopped scooted forward and with more help from his mother, he slid his little cock into his sisters hole.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Careful, she's still virgin"" Anne warned. Matt didn't know what that meant and immediately pounded away. The room was filled with the soft sound of the little bodies clapping together and Matt's labored breath. It didn't take long. Maybe three minutes or so of him fucking, Sarah sleeping and drooling, and Anne intently watching. Matt came, emptying his little balls into his tight sister.

8ocqoi,0,2018-06-03,Depressed Undocumented soon-to-be 21 year-old didn't want to go to church,HauntingContribution,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8ocqoi/depressed_undocumented_soontobe_21_yearold_didnt/,"My mother wants me to invite a few of my friends over for my 21st birthday. She's more excited for it than I am. I legitimately feel nothing but sadness over the fact that I'm a year older. It feels like I've wasted over 2 decades. Though in more of a short-term point-of-view, I just find it hard to reach out to others.

I came to the States when I was 3 years old. Even though I didn't have a choice in it, the current Administration makes me feel like it's my fault. This summer I have an internship at a large international company. I'm hoping they'll offer me a full time position so I can get sponsored but even if I do get sponsorship it'll take five years for me to gain my residency. At 26 years old after more than a decade and a half I might get chance at being at a legitimate American. Then, I have to worry about ensuring my parents get their status, too. It's funny, I'm a little jealous of my siblings having U.S. citizenship just because they born here. Frankly, I'm a really envious of everyone else having U.S. citizenship just because they born here.

The liberal people who know about my status are, as expected, supportive as much as they can be. The same applies to the conservative people that know but that's because they view me as one of the good ones.

During my sophomore year at college, I was diagnosed with Depression which explains a lot of the way I am. Over the last few years, I have become so goddamn apathetic and lethargic that it is struggle to even type these words out. My peers and teachers see me as intelligent and hard working. One schoolmate called a workaholic but I only sunk myself into my work to ignore the emptiness. This last semester I started cutting class and arriving late so often that my grades dropped yet I still managed to pass. I half-wish I failed so I could wake the fuck up. I just don't see the point of going to school.

I'm only attending school so I can get job, so I can sponsored, so I can get citizenship, so I can keep on working, so I can eat until I retire, so I can die in some amount of comfort. It all seems pointless. Nothing brings me joy. Video games, television, and the internet only help bring the days to an end a bit quicker, books have become bland, piano lessons turned frustrating, acting class has become a chore, and my computer science major is mind numbingly monotonous.

I decided not to go to church with my family today so I can do literally nothing. It's a shame I'm such a coward, I could have used this opportunity to kill myself.

I'm sorry for not going to church today, mom."
8odqoc,52,2018-06-03,Can someone please be a mother to me? I just need someone to tell me they're proud of me.,DepressedHermit1,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8odqoc/can_someone_please_be_a_mother_to_me_i_just_need/,"Four years ago, I was a really bright, happy person. I was living with friends in a city far away from my Nmom, finishing up college as one of the top students in my department, working a teacher assistant job on the side. I had a position with Teach for America all lined up for when I graduated. Everything was going really well, until my Nmom realized that the job was in another state. Then everything got ruined.

My dad's health was really bad and he needed to have heart surgery. My Nmom told me that if I didn't come home and live with them, she would purposely neglect my dad and let him die. She was dead serious about this. She threatened me over and over, holding his upcoming surgery against me for months. My memories of this time are a bit vague because I've blocked them out, but at one point she tried to choke me while saying, ""I don't care about your happiness, I just want you to obey me!"" I was only 21. I had just found out about narcissism and didn't know how to cope with her behavior. I cancelled my job contract and went home and immediately fell into a deep depression.

Again, my memories of the past few years that I've been at home are really unclear. There was lots of screaming. There was lots of stalking, invading my privacy, making scenes at my jobs so that I would be fired. There's been so much abuse. I have it all written down in my phone, but the list has 251 entries (I made a new entry every time she did something abusive) and I don't want to read it. The point is, it's been bad. I was suicidal for two years. I could barely get out of bed in the morning. I hardly showered or brushed my hair. I went from a popular, intelligent go-getter to a completely worthless person. I did not do anything at all. I lost my will to live.

I've been battling depression for so long, and it's finally abated for the past 6 months or so. I'm still living with my Nmom, but I feel a lot better. Recently, I've been trying really hard to improve my life. I really want to use my degree to work in publishing and have been applying to positions, but so far nothing has worked out for me. I've only been job searching for a little over a month, so it's okay, but I am starting to feel worried and discouraged. I've also started a book blog and am working on making a book instagram so that I can show that I'm actively interacting with books, promoting them, and writing. I only have teaching and some admin experience on my resume, so I'm trying whatever I can to make me a more attractive candidate for editorial/publishing internships. I've also been doing free proofreading for college students' essays and am looking into getting a professional writing certification.

I think I'm doing a lot and I've been really proud of myself. I haven't done anything at all in such a long time so I'm happy that I'm putting in effort towards a goal. But of course, my Nmom is tearing me down. She just told me today that she thinks I should stop job searching because ""clearly [I'm] not getting anywhere; [I] don't have what it takes"" and started a fight with me about what a failure I am and how I need to ""be realistic"" and go back to school to get a different degree (which is financially impossible for me). It really hurts. I'm trying my best here. I don't expect her praise, but I want her to at least leave me alone. Yet she can't even do that.

I know it's pathetic, but can someone please give me some praise? Can someone tell me that I'm doing well and everything will be fine as long as I keep trying my best? Can someone please give me some maternal love? I just want someone to sincerely tell me that I'm doing a good job. I feel really upset after talking to my Nmom."

I think it's fair to say Midoriya is one of the unluckiest protagonist ever, even after he inherited One For All, he still encountered countless predicaments, but there's one thing he always has—support. While Midoriya himself has impostor syndrome, everyone else are always very supportive, especially All Might and Gran Torino, they both approve him being the ninth holder, that is until the Internship Arc.

For the first time ever Midoriya met someone completely opposes and rejects him as the successor of All Might, Sir Nighteye not only denies all his hard work, he even said Togata is a far worthier person to succeed One For All, and despise Midoriya's frustration, it was proven to be true, where Togata managed to hold of Overhaul and his comrades all by himself, Midoriya was easily defeated by Overhaul due to his lack of combat training and experience, in the end he can only relied on Eri—the person he supposed to save—to take down Overhaul, and saved by Aizawa.

Nighteye's death is the straw that broke the camel's back, if Togata succeed One For All, everything would've been fine. Regrets and frustrations finally devastated Midoriya, he had a mental breakdown and essentially given up, thankfully Togata was manged to remind him the obvious, that he already did everything he can, and **he** is the one who saved Eri and defeated Overhaul. However we then saw Midoriya wasn't able to get out of it, and Bakugou's mocking definitely made things worse, if it wasn't Aoyama stopping him, Midoriya could've killed himself by practicing 100% Full Cowl.

And the Cultural Festival Arc is the first time Midoriya get to know how the villains are formed, before he only got a glimpse of it with Kota, but the fight with Gentle made him see what turns people into villain first hand, and if he really wants to become the greatest hero, he need to realize that even villains need saving, because some of them are just the victims of this unfair society."

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

------------------------------------------

***Some final notes!***

* I only write here on Reddit, through the PM's. Not chat. Don't send me chat invites.

* Yes, this is F4F. Guys, respect that. Today isn't your day.

* My message length varies, but you'll never get anything less than 4 lines out of me.

* I can write in first or third person, with a slight preference for third."
8oe87g,7,2018-06-03,Career direction as a mechanical engineer - ADVICE NEEDED,agrajsobti,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/8oe87g/career_direction_as_a_mechanical_engineer_advice/,"I am a mechanical engineer and am having an incredibly tough time figuring out a direction to my career. My story goes like this:

I have always been interested in physics and how things work. As a kid I used to enjoy tinkering with toys, modifying them, creating small fun toys with motors and propellers etc. Owing to my interest, I decided to pursue mechanical engineering for my undergraduate degree. I completed my degree in engineering in India, through a well known private university. During the course of my degree, I did two internships which did not add much of value on my resume or exciting stuff to talk about on interviews. 

Anyways, I got a US greencard through my grandparents when I was a junior in college. I have also been passionate about aircrafts and wanted to further my studies in aerospace engineering. Thus, I decided to pursue my master’s in aerospace engineering in the US. Did not sit for job interviews in my college and applied straight for master’s applications. 

Got an admit from UCLA in aerospace engineering. Moved to LA. Family moved to NY. Failed to secure a summer internship for a wide variety of reasons and unfortunate circumstances. Made it even harder for me to secure a good full\-time job. Switched my degree from from aerospace to mechanical engineer, in hopes of better career prospects. Still no luck. Graduated with a 3.89 GPA, moved to NY to live with family while doing my job search. Was jobless for 4 months. Got a job through a family friend in the HVAC industry in NYC. Pay is low given my qualifications and am not satisfied with the job at all. There is nothing I am interested in at my job. It is a monotonous 9\-5 job with a regular strenuous commute of 1 hour each way. Now, 6 months into the job, I am already burned out and fed up of the negativity and politics at my workplace. Have been applying for jobs on a daily basis, wish to work in a company of my interest \(aerospace/product development/any core mechanical job\), but no one would even call me in for an interview.

So here are my options right now:

1. Recently started to practice my coding skills \(Python &amp; Web Development\) to open up more options \(I enjoy coding\). Who knows maybe look for jobs in the software industry next?

2. Keep applying for engineering jobs in my field of interest and keep my fingers crossed. Not much response from online applications.

3. Start my own business – can be anything as long as it is economically viable.

Summary: Basically a dude, passionate about physics &amp; dynamics gets a graduate degree in mechanical engineer from freaking UCLA, ends up with a dull low paying HVAC job in NYC.

Guys, any input from you people would be appreciated. Feel free to throw questions at me. In a mind\-boggling dilemma right now ☹ Thank you very much!"

8ohcs9,22,2018-06-04,Dream job is now out of reach.,Wokati,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/8ohcs9/dream_job_is_now_out_of_reach/,"The last few weeks I was waiting to know if the position I really wanted was going to be open. 

It was just my dream job, was ready to move to the other side of the country to get it. Previous guy was going to retire. I already knew it was going to happen, have been checking for that offer regularly for a year.  

But they have a procedure, need to try to get the position filled in intern before opening it for outside applicants. Had to wait a few weeks to apply.

They often have trouble filling this kind of job so I knew there was a good chance for me to be able to apply. 

I knew of course that it could still be filled but still... couldn't avoid hoping.

Well, got the news today, they found someone in intern, I can't apply. 

I knew it could happen, but I didn't think it would be so frustrating. I thought I could accept not getting it but apparently not since I'm crying now.

I hate that I didn't even had a chance to try. I was just able to wait and hope, well now it's over, there is nothing for me. And I couldn't do anything about it.

I have no idea what I'll do now.

It's just awfully frustrating."

I’m coming out of a terrible average, below 1.0, but two years later I’m around 2.5. I failed school a few years before and decided to come back and kick ass, which I’ve been doing. I’ve got a steady upward trend going back 4 years and into community college, I’m making better grades in my classes every semester, but my GPA is hard to move because I’ve accrued like 130 bogus hours, and it’s hard to make the meter tick a lot. 

I’m halfway through a degree and really focused on hydro and how to incorporate computers (aced 3 of my GIS classes) into my tool belt. I’m dying to find any experience I can, but was told I can’t apply for internships until I’m about to graduate. 

So I’m just wondering if GPA is a deal breaker for most employers? Obviously it couldn’t hurt to have high grades. Have you ever been questioned about it? Thank you.

8ohsyh,2,2018-06-04,Civil engineering: PHD or masters?,Yayomfg,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/8ohsyh/civil_engineering_phd_or_masters/,"Hey everyone,

I am going to be a junior as an undergrad at a top 3 Civil Engineering University, gpa is around 3.3, gone up past 2 semesters hoping to get above a 3.5 by the end of college, for grad school. I am trying to figure out if I want to do a PhD or just a masters. My original plan was to do a masters in construction management, my school offers a great one year program if I can get into it and then go on and get a PhD somewhere as long as I get into a top program ie UT Austin, Berkeley, Georgia Tech, Stamford, UIUC etc... However, I am currently working as an intern for a large construction contractor(Kiewit, Skanska type) and am loving what I am doing. I believe if I work for them I could easily move up and be a superintendent/general superintendent by the age of 28-30, and PM by 35, I have had an internship prior to this in CM for a small firm and am confident in my ability to move up. However, if I go down the PhD route I know the work I would be doing would be completely different. If I went down that route I would want to get a Masters in CM(my school’s one year program most likely), a PhD in Civil and a masters in CS(am completing a minor in CS currently) as well as an MBA eventually. Main objective through PhD route would be to start my own construction consulting company(3D modeling and scheduling etc...) and then potentially go into academia. 

TLDR,

Masters: Work for large GC as Field engineer, Superintendent, General Superintendent, PM and move up from there.

PhD: Start my own company and go into academia.

Looking for both financial benefits of both as well as career fulfillment. 

Would appreciate any advice you guys have!

Thanks in advance.

Hey guys, 

In preparation for our episode rewatch this week I wonder if anyone is knowlegeable about pinnig threads? When I came to post my review a day later, the thread was already buried and I felt like that hindered the discussion? A mod needs to approve of this right? Let me know if you guys have any ideas on how to make the thread stay more active during the week.

In any case, here is my review of last week's 3 episodes! 


Feel free to copy this template if it's helpful! :) Episodes 1-3:

Plot/General Feel: The pacing is so great. The connections are amazing. Every character interact and the show feels so cohesive. The actors are top notch and on the top of their games. There is at least a 50% focus on the medicine. I don’t think Shonda could have predicted how well the 5 interns would balance each other out. When they are together, I love the 5 of them so much. They bring out the best in one another. The supporting characters: Derek, Burke, Bailey and Richard are really interesting characters and are a great addition to the MAGIC dynamic. I have very little to complain about the pace/general feel/plot/music. A great introduction to the show with balanced screen time so we can get to know these characters well enough even after only 3 episodes.

...

Main Characters:

...

Meredith:

It was a good introduction to Mer - but I can’t help thinking that she was already too much of the Sun. The hot, best neuro surgeon already super into her, George was already in love with her, Alex flirted with her, and the biker guy was into her. I mean, OMG, we get it, Mer is the sun and the guys are obsessed with her. She got to take care of an actual patient in the pilot, she figured out the medical mystery and got to scrub in with McDreamy on a “rare” brain surgery. Ah, she also figured out what Alex's patient had. It wasn't that obnoxious at the time because she was the protagonist. I don't know if it's bias but she was not the character I was cheering the most though, she seemed to have everything going on for her as the next Ellis Grey. Not a fan of MerDer but will elaborate more on them later. My favorite Mer scenes are definitely with the 5 interns. I love her with Cristina and forgot how much I loved her slowly soften up to roommates Izzie and George Ellen had some really good acting overall. Her voiceover was on point. Great chemistry with AGIC from the start. I just did not like her acting around Derek. It was good on the first scene where they sleep together. But after the surgery - ""man that was such a high"" looking at Derek with puppy eyes. She seemed high on weed, not on adrenaline like she said. Her acting was not as nuanced as some other cast members, including Dempsey.

...

Cristina Yang:

Great introduction to the character – feminist and badass from the start – except when she’s putting Izzie down for being emotional/a model. Showed her softer personality very early on after forgiving Meredith for ""stealing"" the surgery and helping Izzie fix the dead guy for the parents. I really liked Cristina and Izzie’s interaction – their differences are fun to watch. People keep talking about Mer/Cristina but we saw so much humanity from Yang with Izzie. I love how she convinces Iz to do the organ surgery by explaining how people are going to live because of those organs and show that she didn’t just care about the surgery. Cristina was a jerk when she called off Mer in front of other interns but she always comes around. I was rooting for her character from the start although a little too cold hearted at times. Sandra Oh: Nothing to say other than: perfection at making Cristina ruthless yet endearing. Cristina has some really harsh and cold things and Sandra is able to still make her likeable.

...

Izzie Stevens:

I have a really soft spot for Izzie and these 3 episodes really show me why. That and the amount of hate the character gets. Izzie was the real underdog of the 5 interns. She was made fun by Cristina and Alex for being too pretty/a model. Got blacklisted by Bailey right in the Pilot for nothing. I had no problems with her having to do rectal exams. It would have been fine if she wasn’t so dismissive giving the other interns something to do and having Izzie ask: what about me? “Oh honey you are stuck doing rectal exams”. I really relate to Izzie and I know a lot of doctors do too. She is the heart. She’s emotional and she gets attached to the patients. I’d be exactly like that. My best friend is not a surgeon but works with cancer patients and in the first year of residency she got so depressed that she almost quit medicine. Izzie bring a very human touch the show and I appreciate that a lot. Katherine Heigl showed a strong presence from day 1. Very nuanced/realistic acting and she could convey a certain insecurity but with a strong will to fight to be recognized as more as a pretty face. That's not easy to do in 3 episode and not a lot of scenes. I love how Katherine can portray a mix of insecurity, emotions and a strong fighting instinct – I would have loved to have seen Izzie prove to people that yes, she could be a surgeon and care too much for her patients.

...

Alex Karev:

Not much to like yet. I mean, he complimented the other 4 main characters but he was very sexist and a total jerk. There was very little redeemable about him other than some funny 1 liners. He’s completely irresponsible as a doctor too, first with the pneumonia patient and then with the bike guy. He is so charming though. But definitely not much to root for yet. Justin Chambers does a stellar portrayal of the charming jerk. Specially knowing early Alex is the opposite of real life Justin. George O'Malley: Geeky, Dorky and Awkward. Had a very sensitive/unassuming personality and was a nice addition to MAIC. 007. Wow, crazy how it came full circle for him. George was a good foil to Alex on those first episodes. I like George. I find him realistic even though yes, the “Bambi” nickname was spot on. I would have loved to see him grow into his own self and kicked ass as a Trauma surgeon with April. I think April and George could have been great friends. I LOVE his scenes with Mer and Izzie and Cristina and Alex. He’s the “weaker” one emotionally of the group. TR Knight has underrated and really good comedic timing. I watched with my friends and they would laugh by just seeing things go wrong for George onscreen. If we compare George with Glasses, it becomes clear that TR was able to convey natural and nuanced comedy - as opposed to in your face/campy.

...

Dr: Bailey:

Gosh I loved the Nazi. She is such a great teacher and you can tell that she really just wants the best for her interns. She represents strength, a woman who is not sorry to be a boss. She’s funny and her chemistry with MAGIC is great. I love her small interactions with the head of departments too. We can see she was already super respected. I love her speeches. Chandra Wilson nails it. She’s def. one of the top 5 actors to grace Grey’s Anatomy.

...

Derek Sheppard:

I actually think he would be a very interesting character if he wasn’t so obsessed with Meredith from day 1. Gosh, chill man, give the girl some space. I find Derek a likeable flawed character as a friend, mentor and doctor. However, Derek is at his worst when his obsession/jealous/knight in the shining armor mentality with Meredith after 3 freaking episodes. I realized why I could never like MerDer – there’s no build-up or tension. It’s in your face cannon instead. I love his contrast with Burke – he has an optimistic and more extroverted nature. As for Patrick, I think he’s always been a stellar actor – the writing of his character was just flawed from the start. I mean they managed to make Derek irritating by episode 3. I do feel bad for the character because it seems like again, he’s a prop to show viewers how Meredith is the most special woman in the world that this hotshot, beautiful neurosurgeon falls for her so fast.

...

Dr. Burke:

I’ve always loved this character. I think he really embodies the surgeon personality. I didn’t realize he was still not into Cristina in the first couple of episodes and that made me appreciate that pairing more since there’s at least some development. I love how he comes out as cold – colder than Derek but he’s able to show a much softer side with the dead patient. I find it cute when he’s the only one not to treat Izzie as a crazy person and tell her she was saying goodbye in a sympathetic way. It made me remember how Burke and Izzie had an interesting friendship/dynamic in the first 3 seasons. He is the one person that has never judged Izzie. Isaiah Washington is stellar. He gets the surgeon personality to a T. He’s literally “surgical” in his portrayal of a cardiothoracic head. The competitiveness and arrogance is there, of course, but he shows a spiritual and caring side early on too and Isaiah’s portrayal makes him likeable to me.

...

Dr. Richard Webber:

He got the least to do in these 3 episodes. I don’t have much to say other than that. I like his interactions with Meredith as it sparks a curiosity about their past early on but again, not much to do yet. James does the job but there’s not much to say from the first 3 episodes.

...

Top performances for me are from Isaiah, Chandra, Katherine and Sandra."

I have been tasked with creating a mobile application which acts as a personal assistant in finding gifts for friends and families. I need to make it able to generate user profiles with interested in products, make predictions on what products the user profile would like and accept user feedback to improve the predictions.

  I started reading “Python Machine Learning” by Sebastian Raschka and Udemy courses regarding Machine Learning. However, this may sound stupid, but I am not sure in what environment to work in? They linked me to some Amazon API s for ordering products and chatbot frameworks such as Amazon Lex, but I am not sure where to integrate them? Could not find a starting point on the internet regarding machine learning for mobile apps. Some suggestions I have seen is Tensorflow Lite and the company I am working for also mentioned IBM Machine Learning in the past.

   Could someone guide me in the right direction? I am a bit overwhelmed and not sure where to start and I would really appreciate some help.

8oirtb,0,2018-06-04,A post no one cares about,the_raw_dog1,barstoolsports,https://www.reddit.com/r/barstoolsports/comments/8oirtb/a_post_no_one_cares_about/,"So i finally did it. This past Friday I deleted my Barstool app and unfollowed the chunk of personalities on Twitter. I never really cared that they were doing more blogs about non sports shit. Ive mainly just been interested in their opinions on whatever cause they were funny. But the focus that's been put on creating in house content to push blogs has finally put a bad taste in my mouth. Originally I was interested to read how the guys I've been reading ever since Babydick gate interacted in the office but they are really trying to make themselves into the story and it got a little much when riggs wrote a blog about an intern moving his clubs. The final straw was Tommy Smokes ""week in Barstool HQ review"" blog. I mean you guys are writing about it ALL WEEK. You're talking about constantly on the radio but you deemed it necessary to nix Friday night confession and replace it with a blog that's just essentially one long masturbation session. The company is undeniably losing its teeth quicker than charlie in Mac and Charlie die. The past two years anytime anyone criticized them for being sexist racist or homophobic my response was ""well they're really not that bad anymore"" when finally I realized ""well of their not that bad then why do I still read it?"" About 8 years ago I started reading a website called Barstool sports and the other day I stopped reading a completely different site that just had the same name. Anyways, if your still reading at this point you're a fucking psycho"
8oj1it,26,2018-06-04,"Thoughts after finishing Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (#s ""Spoiler content here"")",Slimdicknick,books,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8oj1it/thoughts_after_finishing_infinite_jest_by_david/," After spending two months reading this mammoth book I have so many mixed emotions that I really want to describe, but don't necessarily know how to. I really loved the way Wallace just drops you into the world with little explanation and seems to have already set up inside jokes or references with himself, leaving the reader wondering if he'll ever clue you in on the secret. And there is a lingo and slang to this world that you aren't clued in on until maybe half way through that turns into a series of vocabulary based epiphanies on their own. I loved how he fluctuates between being so cryptically vague about what you assume to be important plot points while also spending several pages describing minutia that other writers would only spend a paragraph on. Sometimes plot revelations are single sentences in a sea of over-description and I think that plays directly in to what Wallace meant for people to take away from Infinite Jest.

As I came to the end of reading it this morning I started to generate a weird anxiety about all the loose ends left untied as I felt the amount of remaining pages dwindle. I started to do the obsessive-compulsive thing I do with any entertainment and start to wonder, ""What does it all mean? What is this amounting to? Did I waste time if there is no bombshell epiphany in the final pages of this thing I've loved reading?"" And then it dawned on me that the end isn't the point, but rather what you get out of the experience. I know that sounds insanely trite, but its just one of those things I feel everyone needs to be reminded of from time to time. 

This hit me in such a profound way given my current circumstances. Not trying to go into a huge sob story, but basically I found myself strongly Identifying with Hal's entire anhedonia episode in which we finally hear his perspective on loss of drive and internal purpose. For the past 6 months I've personally gone through the toughest college semester of my life, lost two grandparents, broke up with my girlfriend, got passed on by several summer internships and jobs, and due to financial/family reasons have to give up a sport I truly loved, boxing. Again not trying to search for pity, but once I put it into perspective my lack of drive or will to enjoy things in the wake of all that makes a lot more sense. Not to mention that all of my close friends are all in different states following their passions with jobs, internships, and projects while I'm stuck at home feeling like a leech on my family while I study for the MCAT in August. And while being told by my family I'm allowed to relax and watch tv or play video games every now and then, all entertainment feels hollow while the weight of my ambitions crumbling if I don't score well on the MCAT and follow through with my dream of becoming a surgeon. I'm finding myself in some way in the shoes of several characters throughout Infinite Jest. I feel the helplessness and insecurity in trying to avoid the Disease of my anxiety the way Gately does, the crippling analysis paralysis that afflicts Hal, and, in a weird way, the need to exert some kind of control when I feel like the universe is against the way Lenz does. But not in the murdering street animals kind of way, obviously. 

But to bring it all together I want to thank Wallace for making me realize life and the things we find enjoyment in shouldn't be graded on some kind of cosmic grading scale of worth. The message I get from Infinite Jest's obtuseness and commentary on our ravenous indulgences in entertainment is that people find all kinds of deep personal meaning in the things we choose to care about. No one movie or book is the epitome of entertainment and its about the meaning ascribed to each individual. We become addicted to the escape from our troubles and afflictions in a myriad of ways and need to find a balance between doing what makes us feel happy/safe and what needs to be done to better ourselves. 

If nothing else, this beautifully odd book was an amazing piece of literature that challenged me, made me audibly laugh, and struck heartstrings I didn't know I had anymore. I finished it a few hours ago and I'm already missing the unique vocabulary, writing-style, and dozens of inside jokes Wallace develops with you along the way. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in reading it, but if you plan to I would suggest dedicating time to not read something else along with it, as this book can be headache inducingly dense at times. But it is so very worth it. Sorry about the super long and self-indulgent post, but I just felt I needed to talk about my love for this book and at the same time get a break from a bout of loneliness."

The Girls in Engineering (GIE) Program is looking for three (3) undergraduate interns for the 2018 summer. The pay is $14.50 per hour for 30 - 40 hours per week from July 2nd- July 24th from 9:00am-5:00pm. Interns will work with the lead teacher and lead to assist middle school students in programming and robotics projects, demonstrate computer science and engineering concepts using provided materials, and assist in setup and take down of classroom materials/computers for projects. If interested please apply through the Employee Request (ER) System with the ER# 7677.  

Edit: the original post said they wanted female interns.  That is incorrect.  If you are a man who wants to help low-income girls realize STEM fields could be in their future, I encourage you to apply."

(#4), The Games We Play (#5), Santeria (#7), 'Hard Piano' (#8) and Infrared (#10). Their other song 'Get Out' earns this week's highest re-entry at #20.

CHVRCHES is one of the three artists in the top ten as their songs 'Graffiti' and 'Graves' chart at #3 and #9 respectively.

Ariana remains strong in the Pusha dominance as 'No Tears Left to Cry' charts at #6 on its sixth week.

Panic! at the Disco takes this week's biggest gain as 'High Hopes' increases 21 spots to #15. Unfortunately for Xtina and Demi, their duet 'Get in Line' is this week's biggest decline as the song loses 41 spots to #46.

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

I feel like I haven’t learn anything new, I tried to learn something but I just can’t concentrate cause I’m too busy and stressed about all the things my boss asks me to do. 

I have three bosses, two of them already crossed the line... they ask me too much, sometimes they don’t even thank me, and some of their feedback it’s not about my job... but it’s about my personality.

I wanna cry so much, but I don’t want my family to see me like this.

I’ve been looking for another job since last summer, went to a lot of interviews but I haven’t found one... so I tried to survive with what I have right now.

I used to enjoy my activities at work, but I don’t feel motivated anymore... there’s an intern that does them... so now my bosses ask me for some lame activities.

I feel terrible. I hate my professional life.

8oklkt,28,2018-06-04,GUE Rec 2 report - LONG!,LordElrond91,scuba,https://www.reddit.com/r/scuba/comments/8oklkt/gue_rec_2_report_long/,"Yesterday I, along with my girlfriend, finally finished our Rec 2 course!

I’m writing this report especially to fill the lack of course reports regarding entry level GUE classes, since everyone who approach this way of diving seems to arrive from a much higher level of experience than us.

Instructor: Massimiliano (Max) Lorenzoni, an Italian guy from Turin who teaches on the side of his day job and has a small shop in his home city. He’s an RB80/C2/I don’t know diver who teaches up to Rec 3.

Background: In August 2016 I was headed to Santo Domingo, so I decided to get my open water certification beforehand. In February, after a brief Google search I found Scubaboard… Reading it, it was apparent that “diving” wasn’t limited to PADI resort dive centers, but there were different school of thoughts and philosophies behind choices… 

Fact 1: If you read an afternoon a diving forum without knowing everything, you WILL stumble on someone mentioning GUE, and you won’t see many divers discounting GUE training. It may not be your taste or your style, it may be expensive, there are instructors teaching for other agencies that are as good or better than GUE instructor (I feel that Andy Davis or Trace Malinowski could be in that category, for instance), but you are basically guaranteed quality instruction on agency name only.
Fact 2: It seemed to me that progressing in (open circuit) diving we have to choose two paths: dir-like or sidemount. The latter was attractive to me because, as a traveler, you can basically create your familiar twinset out of thin air, with just a stage kit… The problem was that even if I knew the best sidemount teachers’ names (and I didn’t), it’s a fiddly system not usually taught to beginners…

To make a long story short, I searched for the nearest instructor, entered his shop where he was very kind in explaining what my certifications allowed me to do and what skill I would learn (and why it was more expensive blah blah fuck off I know, I’m here because I want to learn in the best way I don’t care about money). 

From March to June 2016 I did my Rec 1 course. I did 8 open water dives and I don’t know how many pool sessions… after the end of the course he made us come back to work just on back kicks, to give an idea. Max was nice, kind and very thorough, schooling us on every detail, answering every question and striving to make us autonomous divers as much as he could. 
We didn’t have to buy ANYTHING for our course. No mask, no fins and obviously no booties since we did our course in drysuit. This was a constant of our interactions with him. He sells Halcyon, DUI and Santi but won’t give you grief about anything, no matter what/where you buy (respect 2! I bought very little from him since I absolutely hate Halcyon branding and he was not competitive on Santi prices). The only (light hearted) jokes about my strokery are about the wireless pressure sensor I keep in my right post =D

Recreational diver 1 is exhausting. There is a whole new world of skills to learn, you are on loaner gear that you don’t know how to use, you don’t know what action bring the consequence you want and every process of gearing up and de-kitting was slow and painful. Instructor was there to show you how to do things, correct your mistakes and to pass on every little personal trick to smooth out the process, but that was no valet diving… We had to earn that wonderful feeling of weightlessness… but we were hooked!
All in all it was a great experience.

After the course we regularly went to dive one or two times a month and gradually bought all of our gear. Having our own kit made a tremendous difference in ease and comfort, hence my suggestion to every diver who like the sport to bite the bullet and buy the kit… It’s expensive, but the absolute comfort is worth it.

The skills we learned in the course gradually became ingrained. We had the mental image of how we should look, and progressively we gained grace and control… Fun fact: at dive 10 or so I was at 3m, neutral, motionless and in trim (one of those rare moments that become more frequent the better understanding you have of the underlying causes) where a girl doing his last OW checkout somehow lost her group and came spinning on 3 axis towards the surface… 

The following year after 20 or so dives we felt the need of a second level ticket… We booked boats to go diving answering “what kind of certification do you have?” with “open water” and we felt a hassle… Sometimes we were refused diving, sometimes boats had to go in spots with 60ft diving just for us, often we were assigned our own dive guide (that sometimes saw us lucky, getting very respected instructors as no extra charge private guides with detailed feedback!) etc. etc. where saying “advanced” we would have been good to go with the largest groups.

We came back to our original instructor and arranged the course on 6 days. 

We were explained what we would learn: 
- equipment
- use of 30/30 as breathing gas
- rescue
- navigation
- precise, controlled speed ascents with only instrument reference, with stops and in gas sharing
- perfectioning of posture, buoyancy, positioning and kicks

Since we had logistics nightmares (my gf started working as an orthopedic intern in Switzerland and my instructor was very busy with his day job), plus storms with 2m waves just when we planned to dive, the course dragged along for almost one year, so I write here about topics instead of “day 1” “day 2”

Navigation: we were taught how to run a reel, the basics on how to tie off, how to do search patterns in clear water (squares and rectangles) and in low visibility with a spool, how to read and navigate with a compass, how to measure distance with kicks… This part took us about two days, and I found it a pleasure, especially running a reel =D

Rescue: diving physiology, what happens to the human body in hyperbaric environment, the various effects of high pp of various gases (narcosis, oxygen toxicity, CO2 retention, helium effects), the basics of decompression and standard gases… We were asked to do multiple body recovery drills each from a few meters, keeping the ascent in control with a clear 3m stop. At this stage of my diving experience, it’s NOT easy, but not impossible either… Trick is to be slow and anticipate, since we had to manage 4 air bubbles (i.e. empty wing doesn’t mean wing that stays empty throughout the ascent!)

Max taught us how to treat a panicked diver, how to dekit in water a diver with standard gear (mentioning that in real emergency you just cut the harness, as you often read online) and how to bring him up a ladder.

Use of 30/30 and ascents: I think it’s the equivalent of PADI AOW deep dive. 

Instructor taught us why, when and how to use 30/30, how to use, integrate into checklist and manage a suit inflation bottle, GUE 30/30 or 32 tables that were introduced in Rec1. Diving to 30m is not a problem, the fun and learning experience was on ascent… We left a little distance from the shot line and ascended in blue water with the required speeds and stops, so from 30m you go to 15m then a stop every 3 meters maintaining team formation, then the same sharing gas. 
The last dive the bastard surprised me asking to shoot a bag while gas sharing in blue water. I use a 1,8m slim Halcyon SMB… I never needed to shoot it unless as a drill, so I bought a longer SMB since if I shoot it, I NEED it to be seen. When I need to exercise during courses I borrow my girlfriend’s 1m one. That time, since it was unplanned, I had my own SMB…
You can imagine a green and inexperienced diver shooting a fairly large bag from 10ft while gas sharing. I kept general position in the water column and control over the long hose I was donating, but the bag was only half full =(

Ascent while sharing is in my opinion the most important improvement I took out from the course… Now we are able to function as a decent team and have few problems staying in formation. If someone told me that a few days of lessons could teach me this, I wouldn’t have believed him.

Btw, seeing how comfortable is a 7ft hose is in giving me working space, I don’t know how you are supposed to do things with the OOG diver glued to you!

Equipment: we were introduced to the use of primary light and doubles…

I bought myself a nice, powerful primary light from Gralmarine just a couple months ago… Goodman handle+ canister FTW. You keep your long hose under the battery pack, the light is very small and leave your hand free and while it’s not narrow and focused as a Focus it’s immensely powerful… When I’m looking at a wall or at something from short distance I activate both beams (150w of led power) and I have a square meter of bright colours in front of me. When water is muck I just don’t dive =P

I was taught how to manage the light cord, how to store it in a temporary hold with the back loop, how to use it during rescue etc. etc…

About doubles we had mixed experiences… The first time in the pool I was massively overweighted (steel plate, steel 12+12 flat bottom doubles and no undersuit), so I was very uncomfortable, then I went diving on a Sunday and tried both 12+12 round bottom and 12+12 flat bottom in sea water… Both me and GFbuddy found the round bottom 12l difficult to dive… We had a 3kg V-weight, no tail weights and with our body conformation we had a center of gravity too far forward even with fully extended legs so we were unable to stay motionless. 8,5L doubles and 12L flat bottom were perfect…

To do half an hour at 30 meters in single tank don’t leave me with a gas reserve I like, so learning to dive in doubles is a useful part of this course especially with the perspective of more advanced instruction… It’s just the standard…

Having almost 6000 liters of air was useful in the last experience dive, since I was unable to clear my left ear… I absolutely didn’t want to push and rupture an eardrum, but I wanted to complete the class and not waste a 12+12 of triox! I signaled to the others and did a very slow descent... Without such an ample reserve to guarantee me an hour of time to solve a possible reverse block during ascent, I would have called the dive.
We didn’t learn how to do a valve drill yet, our instructor will teach us that in the next months.


Fundamentals: 
The part about fundamentals of diving is a refinement of what you learn in Rec 1 or (I think) Fundies. Instructor continuously gave us feedback and corrected our mistakes… Work for me was on the frog kick, since I used to do almost a modified frog instead of a full, powerful kick with glide phase. Elena had to be corrected on trim (she dropped his knees) and back kick.

In both Rec1 and Rec2 we touched little the topic of flutter kick, I need to ask on this since I want to add a nice flutter kick in my toolbox for narrow or crowded situations!

Extra:
Checklist/GUE EDGE is much more clear now, since the basic equipment check we learn in OW becomes a more structured checklist for account for all the basics of a dive.

Scooter: as a nice extra, we learned how to use DPVs both on the surface and underwater. Max absolutely loves scootering, so he integrated a bit of scooter use in our course – how to be towed, how to adjust the tow cord, how to steer… Usually during shore dives we scootered to deeper waters then tied them to a dive flag to do skills.

Conclusions:
It’s a wonderful class under every aspect. Where in Rec 1 you learn to survive, and every step is painful and exhausting in an unfamiliar environment, during Rec 2 you learn to do things underwater… Your actions become more routine and you start being more aware of your team and your surroundings. All said and done cost was around 1000€, including gasses and boats.

DIR system isn't stupid... In R1 you use only part of the set, in R2 you complete it, and many things find their reasons. Why you do a longhose deployment check before splashing? Because you can be, like me, the fool who stows the light cord trapping the longhose!
I sincerely don't know if there are ways to dive better or that fit me more... We will see! I have everything to learn at this moment and don't exclude any future change!

Now I have in my pocket an AOW ticket that opens me up every common tourist boat and a much more refined and wide skill set to use.
Since I have a ton of new spots to dive, I don’t plan on seeking out more instruction till 2020, then R3, then in 2022 I hope to take Tech 1 and get my ass handed to me… What I think I need to search is some group that does drills and exercises, since those guys can be amazing in the water and I want at least part of that precision.

8om7r7,12,2018-06-04,Trash Man (me) presents an outline of his future that will affect his activity here.,CRN110,DDLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/8om7r7/trash_man_me_presents_an_outline_of_his_future/,"Caution: This is a long post. A very bad TLDR is present at the end.

Despite vacations coming up, I as usual will be a very busy person. Due to the state of education where I live, going abroad for university to pursue a bachelor's degree or more is the best option for students. But for that, you need to be exceptional in academics. Moreover, you need to give certain tests to assure that you're worthy, known as SATs, which I'm sure some of you heard of before. I'm supposed to give them in a whole year later, but I'm giving them this year only. I have these vacations to study through 3 huge textbooks ~~almost as thicc as Monika~~ which will require a lot if my time. Moreover, I may have to seek internships, also taking up time. As far as what the community demands, I'm already a part of a mod project where I'm a writer, so there's that. Additionally, all this time leaves barely any time to be here except skim through stuff, let alone take care of myself at all.

Some of you may have noticed that my commenting levels and quality went downhill, which is indeed due to studies and such.

I'm thinking about leaving, since I really need to focus to keep up my results in my academics and take care of my health, both physical.... And mental too especially. I may skim through the subreddit sometimes when I have time, but even after 2018, when I've given my SAT, I'll have to prepare for school exams, organised by a renowned British university, for, I believe, 9 subjects, if I'm not wrong. Each subject has at least 2 papers, if not 3, and the whole exam schedule spans over a month, or maybe more. These exams are very important, so they require a lot of study time.

After these, I'll probably be retaking my SAT, to ensure my best score is sent for university admission. I'll also have to prepare for my SAT II, which is a much harder and different type of test, also required by universities in the US.

Bear in mind, that I'm only going to be 16 when 2018 ends, and I have to go for college in 2022. A lot of you may say that I'm worrying too early about it, but I have to re-enforce what I said about local education here and it's global value. So, I have no choice.

I feel that throughout my time here till now, I haven't been an important and well known person, occasionally talking in comments with the well known people. I've felt that to be a good thing, as my exit, will not impact the community much, if at all.

So if you do see a gradual decrease in activity of commenting, and maybe later upvoting, which I don't think anyone will notice anyway, know that this is the most probable reason, rather than something morbid, at least, that's what I hope remains the case.

Oh well, who knows how many of you read through this whole useless post from a useless writer like me, but to those who did, sorry for taking so much of your good time, thank you for spending it here.

Finally, I'd like to make a request. If someone does end up making a bot to tag people, then it'd be neat to have me in the taglist for note worthy posts here ~~and all Monika posts yes~~. Sure, if that's too much to ask for, which I really think is from me, then just forget about this whole request.

8on35q,235,2018-06-04,[M]y week of handjobs,jrr_throw1,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8on35q/my_week_of_handjobs/,"So this story takes place when I was 27, and had been entering my groove both in my career and in my personal life. I was single, and had already had a first love and a couple of rebounds, and was now looking to step up.

There was a girl I had my eye on, her name was Carly. Carly was your typical former cheerleader type, bubbly and always smiling, small perky tits and a tiny ass. She was an assistant in my workplace, and we'd hung out as a group, flirty here and there and I was chasing her kind of hard. She was aloof and liked the attention, I don't think she was short on getting attention from men.

But, this story isn't about Carly.

This story occurs during a week long camping trip, when a bunch of work colleagues and friends decided to hire out a cabin and make a week out of it. There were 14 of us, 3 couples and a bunch of singles. Me and 2 other guys and about 5 girls all from the office or friends of friends.

The setup for the cabin was kind of weird, but it had a bunch of couples rooms but only 2 rooms with a pair of single beds in them. So a total of 4 single beds and a bunch of 'couples' rooms. 

The mix of people were a bunch of graduates and interns, and a couple of us more senior (i.e older) people. My good friend mark and his girlfriend Stella were going, along with Carly and a friend of hers and a bunch of others.

I drove out there a little late on the first day and unfortunately all the beds and rooms had been taken. The two other guys, I knew one of them well, he was a grad but the other guy I'd only seen him a couple times before. They took one of the single bed rooms, the coupes all took couple rooms, Carly and her friend Jess took another couple room, two of the single girls snapped up the other single beds and I was left having to share with one of the other latecomers (although she got there before me) who was another intern at work called Rebecca, or Bec for short. I'd seen here a few times and hung out at the bar when she was there but never really said anything more than ""hey"" to her.

So Bec was 21. She was kind of chubby, very curvy but also you could tell she was a bigger girl. I admit at the time I always thought she had an extremely cute face and smile, and great blonde hair, but yeah, compared to express cheerleader Carly she would be considered by most far far less attractive.

So I get to the room, put my stuff in a section and let Bec know ""well, guess we're roomates for the week. Hope you don't mind, I fart alot in my sleep."" That was my attempt to break the ice, and she appreciated it and gave a little joke back. We settled in our stuff, who's side was whose, general rules and all that, then went to hang out with the group.

It was pretty late so we had a few drinks and then crashed. It was weird bit having bec sleeping beside me felt kind of nice, like I'd missed having a woman by my side, and listening to her breathing was kind of cute in a way.

Anyway, next morning was all activities and drinking. Hikes, bit of a swim, starting a fire, all that. Some people brought weed and the two other guys had mushrooms which they kept saying they were going to take and everyone kept telling them not to, that old cat and mouse game they did for attention. Me, I started to work on Carly.

That first day I went hard after Carly, but her friend kept running interference. I'd get a few quiet moments with her, but she liked the game and the attention, and would pout her lips and run off with her friend while I kept fantazising about slamming that pussy from behind.

So dinner and drinks came and went and it was back to sleep, no action with Carly on that day. But little did I know what would await for me that evening.

So again Bec and I fell asleep on our designated sides, but in the middle of the night, half asleep we kind of stirred in unison and almost instinctively I grabbed her and manhandled her into sleeping with her head on my chest and my arm around her. Just like a normal couple would. I didn't even think and to my surprise her hand went instinctively to my cock and wrapped around it. At that my cock got rock hard, and groggily woke up and Bec started stroking my cock. I finally got my wits about me and leaned over and kissed her, she kissed back, and then I tried to start to move in a way that said I wanted to fuck. She stopped me and whispered ""shhh, just relax"" and she put my hand on her round ass and started going to work on my cock with her hand. She'd wet her hand with saliva and mixed up slow strokes with hard ones. It was an absolutely amazing handjob and before I knew I erupted all over my shirt and self. She giggled, got up and grabbed a towel, cleaned me up and said I guess you can't sleep in that shirt anymore, and we both resumed our snuggling position and fell asleep together with her hand still wrapped around my used cock.

At morning my cock stirred again, and Bec was right there. Stroking and massaging my balls, using spot for lubrication I just lay there and let this chubby yet cute girl empty my balls.

After that second handjob bec got up and we went off to join the group.

That day was weird. I resumed my chase of Carly, and Bec hung out with the people she was closer to. She briefly smiled and chatted, and most people though we were becoming just good friends because of the time spent in the room. Nobody suspected the handjobs, as everyone thought I was there for Carly. 

Anyways, the day was still uneventful and I started to note that Carly was being a bitch and really just playing me. Hey be a sweetie and get me a drink, oh I'm so tired let me lay my feet on you, that type of stuff. Before I would have taken it all as a sign that she was interested, but with my balls taken care of they weren't as appealing anymore. And to be honest, I was kind of looking forward to going back to bed again.

So, night two comes along and I don't want to presume so I go to bed normally, in a new t shirt and shorts and onto my designated side. Bec crawls into bed in her t shirt and I catch a glimpse of her panties which were cute and kind of looked at her gorgeous cute face and thought ""damn, she's actually kind of a stunner"".

As we settle down, both on our sides, Bec simply said ""so you want to get another t shirt dirty again tonight?"" Followed by a cheeky smile. I said ""not really"" and she said ""well?"" It was my moment to act. If I kept the shirt on she would get the message. Instead, I took off my shirt, my shorts and lay in bed fully naked.

At this point I expected Bec to undress too, completely sure we would be fucking, but she didn't. She stayed dressed, positioned herself on my chest and hand went straight to my cock.

I'm rock hard again, confused and wondering what is going on as she starts stroking me. Then she starts whispering into my ear. ""Want me to take care of this hard cock for you?"", ""A man should never go to bed without his cock being serviced don't you think?"" And it went going as she started stroking and using her spit covered hand again. I could only mumble a few yes and oh wow but she was a total pro. Then she took it up a notch. ""Bet you wish you could bury this hard cock into Carly's tight pussy don't you? Would you give her ever last drop of cum deep into her pussy? You think she's a slut and would take this deep into her throat, good girls love getting throat fucked."" And all manner of depraved stuff. Needless to say, I exploded to a chorus of ""that's a good boy, let's empty you nice and hard"".

I was spent. I lay there and Bec got a towel and cleaned me up. I did nothing but lay stunned until again, she resumed her position on my chest and hand wrapped around my cock. Then we both fell asleep.

By the next morning she had emptied me twice more, and I was getting addicted.

That day was another weird one, talking to Carly, everyone asking how it was going with her and that she likes me and I should make a move. All that. Yet I found myself noticing Bec. The whole day. Her curves, her smile, her gutteral laugh like she didn't care who judged her, as opposed to Carly who was all pouty and boring. I like to think it was also at that moment that I went from being a boy to a man. Noticing Bec and her curves, yes she was considered big or ""fat"" to this superficial bunch, but I kept thinking about how that body was a body built to fuck. And I wanted it.

That night there was no pretense. I got in bed naked. Bec straight back with her hand on my cock. I told her ""you're gorgeous, I want to fuck you so hard."" And her response was ""but what about this massage oil I got today at the store, it'll make it far easier and nicer when I drain your balls."" She pulled out a plastic bag wrapping this massage oil and poured it onto my rock hard cock. She then proceeded to give me an out of this world handjob, lubed up to the max, it was like fucking a tight wet pussy, expect it was her hand. Her dirty talk was going to new heights too ""you can use this hand whenever you want, it's just here to make your cock happy."" ""Imagine fucking that slut Carly and fuck my hand instead"" ""I'm going to make sure your balls never ache again from not releasing cum."" On and on. After unloading again I finally asked ""what the hell bec, this is amazing, do you want me to do something for you in return?""

And she said ""hmmm, maybe, but not right now."" I asked why she loved giving my handjobs and she said she got really turned on by JOI videos (jerk off instruction) and little did I know but she was getting off herself on the handjobs and would finish herself off in the shower every morning or sometimes in between handjobs whilst I was sleeping.

So this went on for the rest of the week. I lost count of how many times Bec made me cum, but it was alot. On the final night I said in a silly way which came off I suppose kind of cute ""oh man I don't want this week to ever end."" I think it made her happy, and she showed it by swallowing my last load of the week.

The week ended and everyone went back to their normal lives. Nothing happened with Carly and I think she either got disappointed in me that I didn't make a move, or started getting attention from someone else so she didn't need the attention from me anymore.

About 2-3 weeks after the trip, after going back to normal me getting back to my routine, I actually felt that i missed Bec. It was weird and I wanted to see where these feelings were coming from, was I just getting horny again, or was this more? So I took a chance and messaged her.

""Hey""

""Hey you""

""Can I take you out for dinner?""

""I'd love that.""

""Awesome.""

But that, is a story for another time.

8onl14,3,2018-06-04,Am I jumping into a new relationship too fast?,Serenabell,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8onl14/am_i_jumping_into_a_new_relationship_too_fast/,"So I was dating my ex on and off again for almost 3 years (I will call him J). We go to different colleges, so we were doing long distance for basically half of that time if not more. Even though I loved him and when we were physically together it was good, the long distance was really difficult. We went through a lot of challenges, including him cheating on me. After that happened, I decided I wanted to be in an open relationship, so we did that for a while. 


This past semester, I ended up hooking up with a friend of mine (I will call him S), and seeing a lot of things in that relationship that were missing with J. I started to realize something I had known for a long time, which was that I couldn't see being with J forever, and although I loved him, it wasn't the right relationship for me. Finally, about 2 months ago, I ended things. Although S and I didn't make it official until this past week, I was basically with him right away after breaking up with J. 


It feels like it is really fast to be with someone new after being in a 3 year long relationship. Though I am over J, and feel that S could be the right person for me in the long run (which I never felt with J), I worry that I am making a mistake by being with someone so quickly. So many people say that you should be alone after a breakup, and that especially in your 20s it is important to be happy by yourself. Although I feel I have found a lot of independence and confidence in myself, and I will be alone and abroad this summer, I still am concerned that I ""should"" be taking time for myself by truly being single and that I ""shouldn't be"" with someone else so fast. 


I am worried that I will lose myself a bit in this relationship because I have done that before, and that I am doing something ""wrong"" by not taking time alone. S feels like he could be the right person for me forever, so is it bad if I am never single again? Then again, I am going abroad for the next 2 months to do an internship, so if I find some independence through that and still talk to S pretty often, is that enough? I would love any thoughts or opinions. I know this is also a good problem to have, and I feel really lucky to have people who care about me so much. Thanks a bunch for any thoughts. "
8onp0r,18,2018-06-04,"I (21f) am planning to move out soon and my parents (43f, 59m) are on the verge of cutting all contact with me because of this",Throwaway18283848589,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8onp0r/i_21f_am_planning_to_move_out_soon_and_my_parents/,"So long story short (as short as I can make it), I've been renting my parents investment house for the last 2 years, along with my partner and housemates we have found along the way, and now after being told several times that they want to sell the house over the last two years (including the week I moved in), I've taken action and started looking for places. At the moment it looks like I've found a place and will be moving out on the 18th of this month.

They did not take me telling them that I was looking for a new place well about a fortnight ago after the week before my mum told me she was looking to sell the house I'm renting and offered to sell it to me for over 600k. I earn less than 50k a year and only just started at a new intern job that won't last past early next year. My partner and I have no deposit either. She was very upset when I refused her offer and told me never to buy her a gift again (I had just delivered her mother's day gift to her as it had come in the mail). Anyway, after I told them I was starting to look for a new rental my mum went on at length about how I was dooming her and my dad to squalor and filing bankruptcy, how I am a bad daughter and haven't been the same since I met my partner and moved out initially at 17 after high school. My dad threatened to stab someone with a knife. This isn't the first time they have threatened, physically harmed, or belittled me.

The reason why they are so upset is because my parents are currently in debt for several reasons including their new business, and want me to stay on indefinitely until they can find a buyer for their house (either one of the two they own) so they can pay their mortgage. This could be anywhere from 1 week to 2+ months. I've only been told this as of last night when I went to pay the rent and told them I had sent in an application along with me partner and one friend. Since then my dad has basically told me if I don't do as they say and stay on, they will cease all contact with me.

Despite how they have treated me in the past, I feel guilty that I would be the cause of their downfall if it were to happen. My younger brother still lives with them as well and I don't want to ruin my relationship with him either as he would inevitably take their side in this.

What should I do? I'm at a complete loss. I don't want to be estranged from my family forever, but one of the housemates we had has already moved out and the one that isn't moving with us is looking to leave soon as well. We won't be able to continue at our current rental (my parents place) for much longer and my parents haven't even moved to put one of their properties on sale.

**TLDR;** I'm looking to move out of my parent's rental soon and they want me to stay on indefinitely until they sell one of their properties. If I don't they will be cutting all contact with me."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8oo3l2,1,2018-06-05,IBS and internship,ibstest98,ibs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/8oo3l2/ibs_and_internship/,"Hello all. I am making this post to let off some steam but also get advice. 

I am a 19 year old computer science university student and I am finishing my exams next week. The week after that, I begin my internship that I am so thankful to have. After interviews and stress I got an internship offer, and I have mostly been confident about it. But now that the date is coming close, I am getting really stressed. Like alot of you, I have IBS D and I am worse in the mornings. I still don't really have a good routine for my mornings, sometimes I don't eat at all. This probably won't cut it, as I will not have to wake up at 6am and drive an hour commute. I already know that the first day I'm gonna have to take immodium \(which I don't really like doing, but whatever\). What do you eat for breakfast?

Part of me is relieved that I will be working in an office environment. Last summer I worked a minimum wage gig at an amusement park and they don't even let you leave your position there to use the bathroom \(which was pretty much torture\). I know I will just be an intern, but I am just stressed about everything. Using the bathroom during meetings, being embarrassed in front of other interns for using the bathroom all the time, etc. I should be stressed about my skills, but all I am thinking about is using the bathroom. 

In terms of medication, my GI prescribed Viberzi, but I stopped taking it. It was causing so much gas and didn't really stop me from going when I am anxious. He explained how my body was in this constant fight\-or\-flight mode when I am stressed and Viberzi couldn't really do anything about that. So now I just take immodium when I am expecting to be stressed. 

I know everything will probably be OK and I just need to relax. But my anxiety is at 100 right now and I can't think about anything else. I don't know how to handle it either. If anybody has any advice or has gone though a similar situation, I would love to hear about it. "
8ooefe,86,2018-06-05,"My gf[21F] of 2.5 years makes me[21M] feel really terrible about sex. What can I tell her to stop, or is it hopeless and should I end it?",piloti123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ooefe/my_gf21f_of_25_years_makes_me21m_feel_really/,"Basically, my gf has an extremely high sex drive, and views sex and something deeper than just a physical act, and often wants it to be very long and deep and meditative.


I on the other hand, do not have a very high sex drive. I would be satisfied if we had it once or twice a week.
 

Throughout our relationship, everything has been extremely perfect, we both share the same goals and views about life, and we have fun all the time, and we talk all day everyday. 

Unfortunately, she has tried to break up with me 5 times now, and has always gone back on the decision. She says it's because I don't share the same views about sex as her, and she wants to have a tantric deep connection with someone. I have really tried my best but I honestly have no idea how to give her what she wants. 

The most recent time she tried to break up and went back on it was about 2 weeks ago, but said she didn't want to have sex with me anymore, and wanted to be celibate. She has said this multiple times already throughout the relationship, but we have continually done it and she seemed into it.

Tonight we were talking on facetime as she is at an internship across the country, and I asked her why she kept going back on her breakups. Every time she would want to do it I would feel heartbroken and all the usual emotions one would feel in that situation, as did she. 

She said it's because the compromise is worth it, as being with me and having a family together and whatever else we planned was more important than her sexual desires, but then she started talking about how she only wanted to have sex if it was for making children, and didn't want to do it anymore. Then, because I am visiting her in a month, she said I hope I am on my period when you come so we don't have to worry about sexual things.

This obviously makes me feel awful since I love her and do my best to fulfill all her desires, but I can't because it's just not my personality to be a sexual animal who can go for hours under candle lights and scents and what not. Also, I feel like it's pretty rude of her to assume I don't have needs or wants just because I am not at her level of extreme.

Not sure what to do, we've had many talks about it but she still manages to say things in hurting ways regardless of how much I tell her its weird to tell your boyfriend you don't want to have sex anymore.

I truly love her with all my heart and think we would have a perfect future together, but this attitude and intensity about sex just makes me feel awful, and it makes her feel awful as well. Any advice or insights would be amazing. 

Thank you.

TL;DR: GF has an insanely high sex drive and wants deep tantric things to occur, I have tried to give her what she wants but its not enough because it should come from within me to love sex like her. She says she never wants sex again, and I do not know what to do at this point."
8oox3k,6,2018-06-05,Master's student in urban planning who can't find an intership in the field,pugile,urbanplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/8oox3k/masters_student_in_urban_planning_who_cant_find/,"Hello and thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. 

It's my first time posting and I'm in a bit of a jam. I'll get straight to the point:

I've completed my first year in my master's degree in urban planning in Montreal (in French) and I cannot find an internship in the urban planning field. I applied to over 30 summer offers prior to May and received no responses. My grades are high (GPA &gt;3.5) but I entered the master's degree right after completing a bachelor's degree in geography (also in Montreal) and therefore have no experience related to geography or urban planning whatsoever.

I suspect the issue is that I've been working as a janitor for almost 4 years now to pay for school and it's reflecting poorly on my resume. Prior to this job, I have no white collar work experience to speak of.

I wanted to know based off you in the community 

1) If any of you had a similar experience? If so, how did you overcome it? If the answer is to keep trying, trust me, I will!

2) If there's any advice you can give me in relation to what kind of jobs prior to entering the field you suspect made your resume better? If they were white collar jobs, please tell which ones they were. I feel like I need something to make my resume stand out so I can enter these elusive internships.

3) Is my assessment completely wrong and there's something else I should focus on doing to improve my chances of getting an internship? 

Maybe I'm worrying too much and the internship will eventually come but I'm trying to get my foot in the door make my degree worthwhile. If I can't even get an internship in the field I don't see how I can get an actual full-time job.

Thanks again for taking the time.

F, 19",apretentiousredditer,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/8op0cr/long_distance_abuse_f_19/,"I've known Ty ever since I was 15. I met him through a Facebook group chat and within months I had a crush on someone who lived in Europe. I knew we couldn't meet, but I still confessed to him anyway. He said no and told me I would find better so I went on to have another boyfriend while being friends with him. 

Ty had a lot of issues, and I was there for him when we were 15, even after hearing how he was raped, beaten, bullied for being bisexual and just being himself. But I had to delete my account for personal reasons. I tried to keep in touch with him but he barely responds on other platforms.  

I was left watching his videos online of his gameplay, supporting him and tweeting occasional teases. He has a girlfriend in the midst of it so I back off. We lost contact. 

Flash to last year in August, he messages me. ""Hi. Sorry for not talking to you for a while. How are you? ""

I respond that I'm doing terrible but that I was still alive and kicking. Then he goes on to tell me the situation that he has been in the rough, that he's been cheated on by his girlfriend, that he's been on drugs, that he's been homeless. A lot of stuff. 

I comforted him and we talked. Then he begins the flirting by saying he couldn't recognize me from my pictures because I've grown prettier from when I was 15. I have the lowest self esteem so this made me feel pretty chipper. 

We flirted our way to being mutual, but I told him o didn't want to date and call anyone my boyfriend. He respects that and we go on by just talking. He was able to meet my family online though and we talked a lot about the future. 

We even sexted a lot because he liked me dirty talking him even if I wasn't used to dirty talking to anyone special. I was more used to dirty talking strangers because it was easier. 

Ty used to be very suicidal and he still was. I didn't blame him because of everything he's gone through. However he started bringing this up more when I talked about how I didn't want to be in a relationship. He told me he hated it and that I was leading him on when the truth was I was just scared and that I just had anxiety issues. And he knew this. 

Over the flirting and talks of plans of him saving up to come see me, we became very argumentative and we would have fights. He would tell me I wasn't appreciative enough of his efforts, he told me I wasn't even trying. I thought this was a result of us not being in a relationship.

My hunch was right because one time he said I was saying I was available to other people and he tried to kill himself. I was on a trip with my classmates to shoot some footage for our documentary but I left because there was no signal there and I needed to text him. He wasn't replying and I left so many messages about how much I love him and how I belonged to him. I texted his brother how he was, and he told me Ty was passed out on the couch. Sleeping with no weapons or anything.

A week after that, I said yes to being his girlfriend in November. We were very sweet still, but he was still telling me lots of things that I wasn't able to do. 

I covered this up by satisfying him sexually, sending nudes and whatever I can. We would video call and he'd masturbate while I watched. Eventually, I showed my pussy because he asked me to, even if I wanted to save it. I became  very sexual and slutty. 

By December, I was so anxious because I imagine us not being together or breaking up in the following year. I told him I wanted to continue being with him in 2018. Although he comforted me and told me stuff like ""we can't break up, I'm going to marry you"" he also made it a point that I was silly for being anxious and that I should brush it off. 

January enters in and we were still together and I was relieved. On my birthday that month, it seemed like he almost forgets it. He's been working and doing all he can for our relationship so I understand. He sends me a video before my birthday ends which makes me think that it was planned all along. 

February and March comes around... He is incredibly frustrated with me. I don't sext as well as I used to, I wasn't showing him enough appreciation, there always seemed to be something I wasn't doing. I told myself it would try harder but with his response, I was discouraged. 

I opted to break up with him but like the times before that, he told me he was going to kill himself. So I stayed. But I was crying more times than not, because everything felt so bad and I just wanted it to end. 

He told me constantly how much I stressed him and told me to stop. And I tried to stop, I really did. But he told me I wasn't trying. But I loved him. I loved him so much it hurt.

One instance, it got so bad, I broke it off with him and drank perfume to try and end my own life. I refused to go to the hospital until Ty threatened me via voice message that he was going to hurt himself if I didn't go. So I went. He got so mad at me afterwards but we made up. 

And we were together again. But it was still bad. So I broke it off with him. He used my Facebook account to post ""I told my boyfriend to kill himself"" and ""I'm so happy Ty is going to die."" I screamed and cried and my cousin and mom took it in their hands to change passwords and block him everywhere. 

Except Tumblr, which Ty got a hold of in order to message me, telling him that I was a horrible person for leaving him and telling me that I left him to die. I believed it. I was wrong. And I kept apologizing and started crying again.

I sent nudes as an apology and we were steady as friends who were very sexual. But apparently I was still stressing him as he says so I blocked him there. He has another account on Facebook and messages me. 

This went on for a while until now. Sometimes it was a sweet message, sometimes it was harassment. Sometimes it was ""you're my one and I can't live without you"" or ""I hope you get the courage to kill yourself because no one will ever fucking want you.""

Every time I gave him a chance, I just ended up crying more and more and I felt like it was my fault. 

Now I am slowly losing feelings for him and I am trying to be better. He's still on my Snapchat though, and I'm going to Europe next year for a graduate internship. 

I don't know what's going to happen. But to come back to the title of this entire post, was it abuse? I know I had fault in this but I swear I didn't want to hurt him or stress him; I loved him. I was completely unintentional. "

Does CMU give Grad students an option to Minor from a department. (eg: Major ECE, Minor SCS)

If Yes, when do the classes for the minor take place ? Are the units earned in the minor included in the units required for the degree? 
Does the minor increase options for internships and jobs in  the tech industry ?
Please share any info related to this.
Thanks!"

I did the big 5 personnality test and to no surprise of mine, I'm way too agreable and neurotic as well as introverted but I could tell that from my own life experience.

It seems I'm always trying to leave a relationship but I'm unable to. 

Right now I'm in a relationship that I have ended countless times but I always end up giving a last chance. I even moved with this person. I could say I really hate this person but even when I attempt to discuss thing, finding flaws, complains, she brushes everything I have to say to avoid breaking up again.

I don't know what to do anymore, I have driven myself mad, anxious, unable to work so now I'm financially codependant of her. I'm so shameful of this situation that I lied to my best friend about having moved with her.

I recently started an internship after completing a really successful academic engineering degree. I was really performing to my best the first week, but the second week, I completely crashed and I can't produce anything right now. My anxiety level is through the roof and I don't even sleep anymore. 

I know I have a really high IQ and really great potential, plus I have a degree in computer engineering that would almost garantee my success. However, I have so much emotional bagage with miserable job experiences and being fired from my last 10 jobs that I don't know how to overcome that before I reach financial ruin and personal catastrophes.

I really want to improve my life and I will consider any sound advices.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u ervan op de hoogte dat de Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming &amp;#40;AVG&amp;#41; op 25 mei 2018 van kracht wordt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2       
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welk moment zal de Belastingdienst volledig voldoen aan de AVG?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst heeft in het traject voor implementatie van de AVG een aantal ’tekortkomingen in de naleving geconstateerd. In de antwoorden op vraag 5 en 12 worden deze toegelicht. Er zijn al verschillende maatregelen genomen om deze te weg te nemen, maar een aantal maatregelen moet nog uitgevoerd worden. Op het moment dat de nu voorziene maatregelen gerealiseerd zijn, kan gezegd worden dat de Belastingdienst voldoet aan de AVG. Het streven is deze situatie binnen een jaar &amp;#40;gerekend vanaf 25 mei jl.&amp;#41; te bereiken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Naleving van de AVG is echter geen statisch gegeven, maar een continu proces. Dit mede vanwege het feit dat de AVG veel open normen bevat, die ruimte laten voor aanpassing van te nemen maatregelen op de specifieke kenmerken van een verwerking en de privacyrisico’s die daarmee samenhangen. Bij wijzigingen in wetgeving en in de uitvoeringspraktijk zal steeds bezien moeten worden hoe op een goede manier wordt voldaan aan de eisen die de AVG stelt. De Belastingdienst blijft dus doorlopend werken aan maatregelen die bijdragen aan duurzame naleving. Voorbeelden zijn het structureel geautomatiseerd schonen van bestanden &amp;#40;waar dit voor de korte termijn nog handmatig gebeurt&amp;#41;, het ter ondersteuning van transparantie uitbreiden van persoonlijke informatie op portalen zoals MijnBelastingdienst en MijnToeslagen, en het verfijnen van autorisatie &amp;#40;toegang tot gegevens&amp;#41; op basis van nieuwe technieken, die nog beter invulling geven aan beginselen van doelbinding, vertrouwelijkheid en integriteit.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst heeft er verder voor gezorgd dat de toets op de eisen van de AVG vast onderdeel gaat uitmaken van de &amp;#40;inrichting van&amp;#41; werkprocessen en ICT-voorzieningen &amp;#40;via de uitvoeringstoets op nieuwe wetgeving en door principes als privacy by design en privacy by default op te nemen in architecturen&amp;#41; en bij verdere modernisering van de Belastingdienst, opdat blijvende naleving verzekerd wordt.    
&amp;nbsp;    
3      
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft de Belastingdienst inmiddels de beschikking over een register van verwerkingsactiviteiten, met daarin alle verwerkingen? Zo nee, is er een inschatting hoeveel onbekende verwerkingen er nog bestaan bij de Belastingdienst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, de Belastingdienst beschikt over een register van de verwerkingsactiviteiten, gebaseerd op inventarisatie van alle bekende verwerkingen door de dienstonderdelen. Er is een beheerproces ingericht voor het register, zodat wijzigingen in verwerkingen en nieuwe verwerkingen worden opgenomen in het register en de actualiteit verzekerd wordt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
4      
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid om uit het register van verwerkingsactiviteiten, in ieder geval de verwerking, de categorieën van persoonsgegevens, de grondslag en het doel van de verwerking openbaar te maken? &amp;#40;met uitzondering van de delen die opsporing zoals bij de FIOD-ECD betreffen&amp;#41;. Zo nee, waarom niet?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst heeft op de website www.belastingdienst.nl/privacy een overzicht van verwerkingen van persoonsgegevens gepubliceerd waarin de genoemde onderdelen zijn opgenomen. Dat overzicht is ontleend aan het register van verwerkingsactiviteiten, maar omwille van eenduidigheid en toegankelijkheid voor betrokkenen is gekozen voor een andere ordening dan in het register. Hiermee kan de Belastingdienst op dit moment beter invulling geven aan &amp;#40;dit deel van&amp;#41; het transparantiebeginsel uit de AVG. Er wordt naar gestreefd om dit op termijn te doen via directe publicatie van het register. Daarvoor wordt nog een consistentieslag uitgevoerd op het register.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5       
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn er verwerkingen die op dit moment in het licht van de AVG als niet rechtmatig zouden moeten worden bestempeld? Zo ja, welke betreft dit en wanneer zijn deze wel rechtmatig te noemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst heeft enkele verwerkingen waarvan de &amp;#40;wettelijke&amp;#41; grondslag onvoldoende is of waarvan de grondslag onderwerp van discussie was in een gerechtelijke procedure. Voor deze verwerkingen wordt een wettelijke grondslag voorbereid of worden alternatieven uitgewerkt. Ook daarbij is het streven deze binnen een jaar gerealiseerd te hebben. Voor zover vaststaat dat de grondslag ontbreekt, is de verwerking van de gegevens gestaakt. Voorbeelden zijn de verwerking van het BSN op het IB47-formulier en het gebruik van camerabeelden voor het toezicht op de motorrijtuigenbelasting.   
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven hoeveel gegevensbeschermingseffectbeoordelingen &amp;#40;PIA’s&amp;#41; er bij de Belastingdienst zijn uitgevoerd en een lijst van deze uitgevoerde PIA’s aan de Kamer doen toekomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In 2017 en 2018 &amp;#40;tot en met 25 mei&amp;#41; zijn bij de Belastingdienst zeven PIA’s vastgesteld. Dit waren geen op grond van de AVG verplichte gegevensbeschermingseffectbeoordelingen &amp;#40;zoals de officiële benaming onder de AVG luidt&amp;#41;, omdat de verplichtingen uit de AVG ter zake nog niet van toepassing waren. Deze PIA’s zijn gemaakt op grond van het staande kabinetsbeleid over het maken van &amp;#40;wat tot nu toe werd aangeduid als&amp;#41; privacy impact assessments.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Deze PIA’s betroffen:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Aanbesteding gegevensportalen Belastingdienst.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Belastingdienst als eigenrisicodrager voor WGA, WGA-flex, ZW en WW.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Exitmonitor.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Medewerkersonderzoek.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verhuur van woningen/kamers via platformen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Belemmeringen vindbaarheid vakliteratuur en abonnementen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gebruik ANPR-gegevens ten behoeve van het toezicht op de motorrijtuigenbelasting.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7       
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven waar de gesprekken met de Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens &amp;#40;AP&amp;#41; over gaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Met de AP is gesproken over de basispositie voor naleving van de AVG per 25 mei die de Belastingdienst heeft opgesteld als grondslag voor implementatieactiviteiten. De AP heeft kennisgenomen van deze basispositie maar hierover geen oordeel gegeven. De AP heeft aangegeven bereid te zijn tot een vervolggesprek. Dit zal in de tweede helft van juni plaatsvinden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8       
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn er met de AP afspraken gemaakt over niet handhaven van de verplichtingen van de AVG bij de Belastingdienst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee. De AP heeft benadrukt dat de AVG voor iedereen geldt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
9       
&amp;nbsp;    
Is de Belastingdienst – los van de problematieken met de portalen – in staat om vanaf 25 mei de betrokkenen in de zin van de AVG hun rechten op informatie, correctie en wissing te laten uitoefenen? Zo nee, wat is niet mogelijk en wanneer denkt u dat dit wel mogelijk is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. De Belastingdienst heeft op 25 mei een vernieuwde privacypagina op de website www.belastingdienst.nl gepubliceerd, waarop informatie te vinden is over het doen van een verzoek op grond van de AVG &amp;#40;inzage, correctie en wissing &amp;#40;voor zover dit laatste van toepassing is voor door de Belastingdienst verwerkte persoonsgegevens&amp;#41;&amp;#41;. Er is een proces ingericht voor de afdoening van dergelijke verzoeken. Hierop wordt nader ingegaan in het antwoord op vraag 10.   
&amp;nbsp;    
10    
&amp;nbsp;    
Is de Belastingdienst in staat om verzoeken van betrokkenen tijdig af te wikkelen? Zo nee, hoeveel geld is gereserveerd om vergoedingen op basis van de Wet dwangsom en beroep bij niet tijdig beslissen te voldoen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst heeft het bestaande proces voor behandeling van inzageverzoeken verbeterd. Om een eventuele toename van het aantal verzoeken op te vangen is extra capaciteit gereserveerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Omdat door de procesverbeteringen en de extra capaciteit de verzoeken naar verwachting binnen de gestelde termijn van één maand kunnen worden afgehandeld en de AVG de ruimte biedt om deze termijn  met twee maanden te verlengen, is geen extra budget gereserveerd voor vergoedingen op basis van de Wet dwangsom bij niet tijdig beslissen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
11    
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke gegevens zijn nu niet via portalen te ontsluiten? Waarom moet dit jaren duren voor dit wel mogelijk is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het primaire doel van de portalen is om de interactie met en dienstverlening aan burgers en bedrijven optimaal in te richten, zodat zij hun fiscale verplichtingen gemakkelijk kunnen vervullen en hun aanspraak op toeslagen eenvoudig kunnen regelen. Het eenvoudig kunnen delen van informatie tussen de Belastingdienst enerzijds en burger en bedrijf anderzijds &amp;#40;vaak aangeduid als gedeelde informatiepositie&amp;#41; levert daaraan een essentiële bijdrage. De Belastingdienst kiest er voor om die gedeelde informatiepositie ook meer en meer te benutten voor het verhogen van de transparantie-voor burgers en bedrijven. Het realiseren van de gedeelde informatiepositie is daarom primair een onderdeel van het realiseren van de voorzieningen voor moderne interactie. Daarbij speelt een rol dat het ontwikkelen van de gedeelde informatiepositie technische ontsluiting vereist van gegevens die nu als het ware opgesloten zitten in de transactiesystemen van de Belastingdienst. Dit is een technisch en inhoudelijk gecompliceerde operatie die tijd kost.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Overigens kan een betrokkene natuurlijk altijd informatie verkrijgen over de gegevens die de Belastingdienst verwerkt op de eerder genoemde privacypagina op de website, en inzage verkrijgen in zijn eigen persoonsgegeven als hij daar een verzoek toe doet. Met die mogelijkheden wordt al voldaan aan de eisen die de AVG stelt.    
&amp;nbsp;    
12   
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke punten voldoet de Belastingdienst niet aan de AVG &amp;#40;zie 21ste halfjaarsrappoprtage&amp;#41;? Kunt u uitleggen waar de problemen zitten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord   
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals aangegeven in het antwoord op vraag 5 heeft de Belastingdienst enkele gegevensverwerkingen waarvan de &amp;#40;wettelijke&amp;#41; grondslag onvoldoende is of waarvan de grondslag ter discussie staat. Daarnaast heeft de Belastingdienst een aantal applicaties waarin gegevens zijn samengebracht om deze effectief en efficiënt te kunnen gebruiken in toezichts- of bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen. Op het punt van dataminimalisatie en autorisatie &amp;#40;toegang tot de gegevens voor medewerkers&amp;#41; behoeven deze verbetering. Daarom worden ze versneld aangepast of vervangen. De Belastingdienst heeft een achterstand bij het schonen van gegevensbestanden &amp;#40;waarin onder meer persoonsgegevens&amp;#41;. Deze achterstand wordt versneld weggewerkt.   
   
&amp;nbsp;    
13    
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u aangeven voor welke substantiële risico’s er nu maatregelen worden genomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Alle organisatieonderdelen van de Belastingdienst hebben een risico- en issueanalyse uitgevoerd op de verwerkingen die zij hebben geïnventariseerd voor het register van verwerkingsactiviteiten. Daaruit komt een aantal generieke issues naar voren dat in elk geval met voorrang aandacht behoeft. In het antwoord op vraag 12 is aangegeven welke maatregelen hiervoor getroffen worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
14    
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat wordt verstaan onder een ‘basispositie’, zoals in de halfjaarsrapportage is genoemd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de basispositie heeft de Belastingdienst op een aantal onderwerpen doelen geformuleerd die per 25 mei 2018 gerealiseerd moeten zijn. De basispositie geeft daarmee invulling aan de vele open normen &amp;#40;doelvoorschriften&amp;#41; die de AVG bevat en bepaalt te behalen resultaten met betrekking tot concrete verplichtingen uit de AVG. Ook is een aantal randvoorwaarden geformuleerd, met betrekking tot houding, gedrag bij het omgaan met gegevens, en de inrichting van de organisatie. De basispositie dekt de verschillende onderdelen van de AVG af. De in de basispositie opgenomen doelen en resultaten zijn:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Transparantie: informatie verstrekken over de persoonsgegevens van burgers en bedrijven en van eigen personeel die de Belastingdienst verwerkt, waar die gegevens vandaan komen en aan wie ze eventueel geleverd worden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Inzage en correctie: een eenvoudig proces voor indienen van inzage- en correctieverzoeken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Register van verwerkingsactiviteiten: het inventariseren van verwerkingen en vullen van dit register, ten behoeve van het toezicht.  
Voorts uitvoeren van risico- en issueanalyses op de geïnventariseerde gegevensverwerkingen en op basis daarvan formuleren van maatregelen om nalevingstekorten’s weg te nemen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Verantwoording: inrichten van verantwoording over de maatregelen ter naleving van de AVG, in lijn met nieuwe topstructuur van de Belastingdienst.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Geautomatiseerde besluitvorming en profilering: huidige praktijk voortzetten, op grond van ruimte die AVG en Uitvoeringswet AVG daarvoor bieden. Inzicht bieden in de logica die aan geautomatiseerde besluiten ten grondslag ligt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vernietigen van gegevens: zoveel mogelijk schonen van gegevensbestanden aan de hand van selectielijsten op grond van de Archiefwet.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Privacy by design en privacy by default: een plaats geven van deze principes in architecturen, handboeken, procesbeschrijvingen etc. Bij wijziging of vernieuwing van systemen aan de hand van risico-analyses bepalen hoe hieraan concreet invulling wordt gegeven. Starten met implementatie van pseudonimisering en verdere verbreding van logging en monitoring als uitwerking van privacy by design.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Datalekken: actualiseren van het proces voor het melden van datalekken in het licht van de AVG.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Bewustwording en kennis: opstellen en uitvoeren bewustwordings- en opleidingsprogramma.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Organisatie: structurele inrichting van de privacyfunctie en verankering van naleving van de AVG in de nieuwe topstructuur van de Belastingdienst &amp;#40;in kaderstelling, uitvoering en control&amp;#41;.   
&amp;nbsp;    
15   
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat valt onder het ‘groeipad’ naar de toekomst? Welke doorlooptijd hanteert u voor het groeipad en kunt u het groeipad aan de Kamer doen toekomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het groeipad voor de toekomst betreft de vraag naar het moment waarop de Belastingdienst volledige naleving van de AVG bereikt zal hebben. Hierop ben ik in het antwoord op vraag 2 ingegaan. Over de voortgang bij realisering van de maatregelen die genoemd zijn in het antwoord op vraag 12 zal ik uw Kamer via de halfjaarsrapportages op de hoogte houden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
16   
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid aanvullende hulp aan de Belastingdienst aan te bieden om wel sneller aan de regelgeving te voldoen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het voldoen aan de AVG is een normaal onderdeel van de bedrijfsvoering van alle onderdelen van de Belastingdienst. Er is gekozen voor een programma AVG om de implementatie in de aanvangsfase aan te jagen en te ondersteunen. Na 25 mei wordt naleving van de AVG verankerd in de reguliere processen en organisatie, ook wat betreft in te zetten mensen en middelen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
17    
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u nu opheldering geven over de status van de gesprekken met de AP en de inhoud van die gesprekken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De status van het met de AP gevoerde gesprek over de basispositie AVG is informatief.  Op de inhoud van gesprek met de AP is ingegaan in het antwoord op vraag 7. Daarnaast zijn er gesprekken geweest over andere privacygerelateerde onderwerpen, onder andere in het kader van de in het antwoord op vraag 23 genoemde onderzoeken van de AP.  
&amp;nbsp;    
18   
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn er verwerkingen voorgelegd voor advies aan de AP? Zo ja, welke betreft dit?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verwerkingen van persoonsgegevens van de Belastingdienst worden aan de AP voorgelegd als onderdeel van de wettelijke adviestaak van de AP over wetgeving waarin verwerking van persoonsgegevens wordt geregeld. Soms zijn er voorafgaand aan een officiële adviesaanvraag informele contacten met de AP over voorgenomen wetgeving.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Verder zijn gesprekken gevoerd over de verwerking van ANPR-camerabeelden, naar aanleiding van de arresten van de Hoge Raad.   
&amp;nbsp;    
19   
&amp;nbsp;    
Verwacht u handhavende maatregelen na 25 mei vanuit de AP naar de Belastingdienst? Zo ja, wat bent u van plan te doen om de kans hierop te verminderen? Zo nee, waarom denkt u dat, als u aangeeft dat de Belastingdienst niet aan de AVG voldoet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hierover kan ik niets zeggen omdat het nemen van handhavende maatregelen is een eigen verantwoordelijkheid van de AP als onafhankelijke toezichthouder.   
&amp;nbsp;    
20    
&amp;nbsp;    
Wilt u inzage geven in de acties die u neemt om de medewerkers van de Belastingdienst te informeren over de AVG?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De medewerkers van de Belastingdienst zijn in de eerste plaats geïnformeerd over de AVG in  hun hoedanigheid als uitvoerders van de belasting-, toeslagen- en douanewetgeving. Daartoe is een bewustwordings- en opleidingsprogramma ingericht met de volgende onderdelen:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verplicht door alle medewerkers te volgen e-learning modules AVG-beginselen en iBewustzijn, die afgesloten worden met een toets.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verplicht door alle leidinggevenden te volgen workshops “bewust omgaan met gegevens”. De leidinggevenden zijn door middel van deze workshops beter toegerust om vragen van medewerkers over het omgaan met gegevens te kunnen beantwoorden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Maandelijkse bijeenkomsten waarin AVG onderwerpen uit de praktijk van de Belastingdienst zijn belicht.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Workshops en webinars over specifieke AVG-onderwerpen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een specifieke praktische privacy opleiding, gericht op medewerkers die in de verschillende organisatieonderdelen de rol van datacoördinator vervullen &amp;#40;als onderdeel van de privacyfunctie die wordt ingericht&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De e-learning modules en de workshops voor leidinggevenden maken blijvend onderdeel uit van het &amp;#40;verplichte&amp;#41; opleidingsaanbod binnen de Belastingdienst. De bijeenkomsten en webinars waren met name gericht op het in de implementatiefase van de AVG versterken van kennis en ervaring in de organisatie.    
&amp;nbsp;    
In de tweede plaats zijn medewerkers van de Belastingdienst geïnformeerd in hun hoedanigheid van werknemer. Daartoe is informatie op het intranet geplaatst over hun rechten onder de AVG en de wijze waarop zij inzage in hun personeelsgegevens kunnen vragen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
21  
&amp;nbsp;    
Werkt de Belastingdienst actief samen met andere partijen &amp;#40;bijvoorbeeld de Manifestgroep&amp;#41; om via hen kennis in huis te halen &amp;#40;en te delen&amp;#41;? Zo ja, wat doen ze concreet daaraan? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Belastingdienst wisselt actief kennis en ervaring uit over uitvoering van de AVG, niet alleen met uitvoeringsorganisaties zoals UWV en SVB, maar ook met verschillende ministeries.  
&amp;nbsp;

Wilt u een overzicht geven van alle datalekken welke het afgelopen jaar intern zijn geregistreerd en welke zijn aangemeld bij de AP?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De melddesk datalekken Belastingdienst beoordeelt beveiligingsincidenten waarbij mogelijk persoonsgegevens verloren zijn gegaan of waarbij onrechtmatige verwerking van persoonsgegevens niet is uit te sluiten. In 2017 zijn circa 1275 meldingen geregistreerd bij de melddesk datalekken Belastingdienst. Na beoordeling zijn 225 meldingen doorgestuurd naar de AP. In 84 gevallen zijn ook de betrokkenen geïnformeerd omdat die incidenten – zoals de AVG dit omschrijft – mogelijk een hoog risico inhielden voor hun rechten en vrijheden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
23  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naar welke zaken bij de Belastingdienst is de AP de afgelopen drie jaar een onderzoek gestart? Kunt u daarvan een overzicht geven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
De AP is vanaf januari 2015 drie onderzoeken gestart, te weten:  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verschil tussen adresregistratie en feitelijk situatie &amp;#40;‘spookbewoning’&amp;#41; bij Toeslagen;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gebruik van gegevens bij de afdeling Data &amp; Analytics van de Belastingdienst en haar voorgangers;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het btw-identificatienummer met daarin opgenomen het BSN.  
&amp;nbsp;    
24  
&amp;nbsp;    
Over welke van deze zaken heeft de Belastingdienst een onderzoeksrapport ontvangen? Kunt u die rapporten openbaar maken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Over het onderzoek bij Belastingdienst/Toeslagen naar het verschil tussen de adresregistratie en de feitelijke situatie heeft de AP in  november 2016 een rapport uitgebracht. Dit rapport is openbaar. De Belastingdienst heeft sindsdien verschillende maatregelen getroffen om dit probleem op te lossen. Dit was aanleiding voor de AP om het dossier te sluiten. De AP heeft de Belastingdienst hierover in april 2018 per brief geïnformeerd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De onderzoeken naar de afdeling Data &amp; Analytics van de Belastingdienst &amp;#40;en voorgangers&amp;#41; en het btw-identificatienummer lopen nog. Er zijn over die onderzoeken derhalve geen rapporten die openbaar gemaakt kunnen worden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
25  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u deze vragen een voor een beantwoorden en voor 25 mei &amp;#40;de datum dat de AVG van kracht wordt en dus geïmplementeerd zou moeten zijn&amp;#41; aan de Kamer doen toekomen?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is helaas niet gelukt om de vragen voor 25 mei te beantwoorden, maar wel binnen de reguliere termijn van uw Kamer.)

8oqss4,0,2018-06-05,Should I/how do I refinance my auto loan?,shishkab00b,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8oqss4/should_ihow_do_i_refinance_my_auto_loan/,"Hi PF!

I've been thinking about refinancing my car loan but I'm not sure where to begin or if it's even a good idea. Figured I'd give this sub a try and see what advice comes up :)

First, a little about me:
I'm 28F, in grad school (~1 year left of class, then 1 year paid internship). I'm currently living on student loans for monthly expenses (figure ~$10,000-$11,000 awarded per semester - 3 semesters/year). Luckily I've been pretty good about managing my finances this way for the last 3 years, although I've had some close calls a few times. At the time of the loan in December 2016, I think my credit score was in the 500s, maybe approaching 600. My credit has been slowly increasing over the last year or two (largely due to my SO getting my butt into shape!), and I'm currently wavering between 680 and 704.

Auto loan info:
Contract Date = Dec 2016
Car = 2014 Kia Soul (I leased the first 3 years, have been financing to own these last 1.5 years)
Balance = $9,690.23
APR = 9.15%
Term = 72 mos. (have 55 payments left)
Monthly Payment = started as $217, but now it's $178.24 (been paying $220/month regardless)

I know $220 isn't a ton of money, but given my situation, I'd like to see if I can lower that. I've heard friends tell me my 9% APR is really high, but tbh I have no idea (wasn't really raised knowing about finance and managing money, etc.).

Should I refinance my auto loan? Is it even worth it? And if so, how do I do that? Any advice, suggestions, etc. are welcomed!

TL;DR: Financed my leased car about 1 .5 years ago, have 9.15% APR, can I get a lowered rate/car payment if I refinance?

I am about to go into my senior year of undergrad, majoring in psychology with a concentration in counseling and health and a minor in music. I have not had any internships yet, but I am working on getting one for the fall. My problem is that I do not know what to do after graduation. I enjoyed my counseling theories class, but I am not sure if I could see myself only counseling for the rest of my life. 

After taking the methods and statistics I class for psych, I realized I may be interested in research. I love the math aspect, and the entire process of creating my own studies one day (eventually) sounds exciting to me. I am planning on working with professors at my college on their own research, as well as applying for internships at the surrounding hospitals and research facilities. 

What should my next step be? If I stay on the research track, my end goal would be to end up with a PhD down the line. Should I bother with applying to a Masters program now, since it will mean more student loans? Or should I work as a RA for a few years after graduation and then apply to a PhD program?

Any insight would be valuable, I am feeling very lost after deciding that I might not want to follow my plan anymore. Thank you! "

**Inside the HGEU**

* **LifeOD**\- Oroin does some big bank business but we’ve already seen the footage thanks to our I N S I D E R \(shoutout mufasa\). Does drifting things, front of his car looks like it’s been in a bunch of low end collisions and then fixed by children.  
* **MOT**\- The CUB\-sport stalls when it was supposed to race another beemer, how convenient, conspiracy? They diagnose that it’s a fuel pump. Mr. Oakes stops by to further the theory that they are in some sort of Zinc Plated OEM\+ love affair. Anna and Stephie beware
* **Mr. Oakes**\-  Takes the Rodknock engine out of the IS300 and instructs us to put our “adult” caps on when considering a swap. NA\-T is a strong contender and I’m personally rooting for a weirdo swap like a 1UZ \(which would be amazing and is the correct answer\). The intern is seen in Mr. Oakes vid and the sub thinks he is contemplating moving his internship to the Oakes Group. We’ll see. 
* **Rudnik**\- Living that RV life. It really is looking like he’s going to loophole his license situation with a Recreational Vehicle. Doesn’t have a license, then how would he get to the shop? Doesn’t need to get to the shop when he lives at the shop in an RV. If that will fit inside his bay doors and Rudnick just moves into his shop in an RV then I think the content is going to get better than when he had a license. 
* **Haggard North**\- Moving Vid. Drive Callie’s Z and the Dually to the new shop. Dually makes it all the way their and then has to get pushed in by a forklift. Nothing really of merit. Cam still has a bunch of his shit in the old shop as does the intern. Intern gives Damian a ride back to somewhere but you can see him daydreaming about Jimmy’s shop the entire time and all the SR knowledge that could be his.
* **eBay Cam**\- Austin motivated by SexyWrxy popped on the discord and put chompers on blast. It was a fun few minutes. Austin could place himself firmly in the sub’s hall of fame if he would gather around the fire and discuss Quan\-Beef, Powerbrick and Onion’s hygiene in detail. 

***Outside the HGEU***

* **LZ**\- Nicole sends the drift missle Z into the mud and you can see LZ not being okay with the purpose of a drift missle. I think in LZ’s mind he thought a drift missle was a show car that you drove but never wrecked. 
* **Cleetus**\- ENGINE IS IN. Gonna need a cut hood but I wish they would get a cowl because that would speak to my redneck southern DNA.
* **Boosted Boiz**\- Kyle and Brent put out a heartfelt gofundme for the down payment on a huge shop. 1320 reposted it and it seems to be getting a bunch of traffic and money. [https://www.gofundme.com/help\-brent\-get\-a\-new\-shop](https://www.gofundme.com/help-brent-get-a-new-shop) at 40k as of now. I think they are going to do it. I hope they do it, I like Brent. Kyles cool to.

One of the worker here ask me if it is possible to view the result of the tests in a fancy way directly from GitLab. The best I can find seems to be a plain download the report as artifacts and open it with your favorite application. Is there any kind of plugin to fill that purpouse?
8os5ic,5,2018-06-05,I don’t treat people well. How can I do better?,Take_me_anyywhere,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8os5ic/i_dont_treat_people_well_how_can_i_do_better/,"I treat my girlfriend and Mom very poorly and sometimes even friends if I am comfortable enough with them. I am almost narcissistic. I do not like to be inconvenienced. I get annoyed with people who are slow or get in my way at the grocery store because I am always sure to be aware of others and making sure that I am not in their way. I think I can work on this by understanding their point of view or just simply letting these little things go. 
My biggest issue is saying hurtful things when I feel like I am being pushed. Whether that be someone antagonizing me or saying something hurtful. I don’t want to lash out, but I feel like if I don’t I keep that anger and those words I want to say to hurt them bottled up inside me and I can physically feel it in my chest and body. When I do lash out I usually feel better but it makes people not want to be around me and really damages my relationships. How can I decrease this physical feeling and avoid saying hurtful things even if I feel like the other person deserves it?

One other thing I really don’t like is that I think I am jealous of others. I show this by talking as if I am better than most people. I know I’m not confident in my abilities but I did graduate with great grades and have one of the most desired internships in my major. Yet I still cannot give others credit for what they choose to do with their lives. For example, my girlfriends brothers are much older than me and have not been able to graduate, it has been 6 years so far. They work as servers/bussers at a local restaurant and still depend on their parents to some degree. We come from a community where everyone goes to college and our parents work very hard to bring us up in this area and send us to one of the nations top school districts. Their mother stayed at home and babied them and still does, cooking and cleaning up after them at 25yrs old. I bash them every chance I get, because I feel like they are ungrateful and lazy because their mom does everything for them and they cannot graduate college when their parents work very hard to pay for it. How would you suggest I work on this situation? 

Some things that may have shaped my behavior are my parents divorce, getting kicked out of high school and judged for hanging out with a bad crowd (always felt like I had to keep my head down and prove that I had changed and was a better person), avoided socialization from high school through college (worse in college bc high school friends didn’t go to college). I feel comfortable going out with my friends who didn’t go to school and have no clue what I do rather than going out with my coworkers or classmates. I do get annoyed by some of these friends pretty easily because they are far less mature and it can be embarrassing when they act this way in public. 


Thank you all for reading and allowing me to be vulnerable and share some of my worst qualities that I am trying to work on.  I would really appreciate your tips/suggestions. "
8os651,77,2018-06-05,BBC hires anti indians so that they can attack hinduism sikhism etc :Premen Addy alludes to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Muslim Pakistani and Bangladeshi ones who are hostile to India.,FastCurrency,IndiaSpeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/8os651/bbc_hires_anti_indians_so_that_they_can_attack/,"In 2008, the BBC was criticised by some for referring to the men who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as ""gunmen"" rather than ""terrorists"".[117][118][119] This follows a steady stream of complaints from India that the BBC has an Indophobic bias that stems from a culturally ingrained racism against Indians arising from the British Raj.[citation needed] Rediff reporter Arindam Banerji has chronicled what he argues are numerous cases of Indophobic bias from the BBC regarding reportage, selection bias, misrepresentation, and fabrications.[citation needed]

In protest against the use of the word ""gunmen"" by the BBC, journalist Mobashar Jawed ""M.J."" Akbar refused to take part in an interview following the Mumbai terror attacks,[120] and criticised the BBC's reportage of the incident.[121] British parliamentarian Stephen Pound has supported these claims, referring to the BBC's whitewashing of the terror attacks as ""the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone.""[122]

A controversial report from BBC accused India of sponsoring Pakistan's MQM party, a domestic party based out of Karachi, to fund anti-Pakistani activities. However, the only sources BBC managed to mention for this report was ""authoritative Pakistani source"", rather than independent investigation.[123] The flawed reporting was severely criticized by India and other prominent journalists like Barkha Dutt.[124] Expectedly, the pro-Pakistan and anti-Indian report was extensively circulated in Pakistani domestic media to fuel propaganda and conspiracy theories.[125]

Writing for The Hindu Business Line, reporter Premen Addy criticises the BBC's reportage on South Asia as consistently anti-India and pro-Islamist,[126] and that they underreport India's economic and social achievements, as well as political and diplomatic efforts, and disproportionately highlight and exaggerate problems in the country. In addition, Addy alludes to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Muslim Pakistani and Bangladeshi ones who are hostile to India.

Writing for the 2008 edition of the peer-reviewed Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Alasdair Pinkerton analyses the coverage of India by the BBC since India's independence from British rule in 1947 until 2008. Pinkerton observes a tumultuous history involving allegations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage, particularly during the cold war, and concludes that the BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics shows a pervasive and hostile anti-India bias due to the BBC's alleged imperialist and neo-colonialist stance.[127]

English journalist Christopher Booker has also criticized the BBC for its coverage of India-related matters. He concludes that the BBC's efforts to reinforce Stereotypes of South Asians has been directly responsible for damaging the image of India, and encouraging racist incidents against Indians, such as the Leipzig University internship controversy.[128]

Right now, I'm also doing the colt Steele Udemy course to learn web development. I could potentially obtain a minor in CS if I worked really hard, but I feel like a lot of what I would learn might be very theoretical. I would have to dedicate a lot of time to taking these classes, time which might be better spent getting internships, self teaching myself more relevant material, or joining clubs. I also haven't had an internship in marketing yet (although I'm working on changing that), so I feel like it would be more important to get internships than learn some esoteric theory about computer systems. Any thoughts on this?"

My name is Dakota, a 23 year old recent college graduate with a bit of a craving. I'm a little over 6 foot, slim but toned build and tanned (thank you summer) skin tone. I have short brown hair styled up, hazel green eyes and currently wearing a tie that may just be a little too tight. I recently landed a dream job of mine, and although I'm only an intern still, I couldn't be happier. Work keeps you busy and the time seems to hurry along. Usually. Apparently slow days are a little different here, and it seems like it's been 1:30 for the last 2 hours...

That is where you wonderful people come along! I'd love really any sort of chat to pass the time. Chat, roleplay, gif exchange, you name it and I'm up for it.

I was thinking it could be fun to see just how close you can get me to cumming while at work, sitting at my desk while the pretty, blonde secretary sits clueless as to what's happening.

Maybe we set up a roleplay in the office, or on the beach, or anywhere your little heart desires.

What if you were to instruct me and tell me just what I should be doing to tease myself as time winds down towards the end of the day.

Maybe you're simply looking for some more hot gifs and we spend some time sharing our kinks and appropriate filth.

If you have any other ideas, I'm happy to listen and chat about them, I'm feeling confident we'll be able to set something up that tends to both of our... dark cravings.

As far as kinks go, I'm pretty open. Things that really get me, clothed sex, public, rough sex, extreme deepthroating, edging, cum/spit play, orgasm control/denial, being told what to do, forced/ruined orgasm, just to name a few.

For limits, just try to avoid extreme pain, blood, toilet anything, incest, and we should be good. Anything, and I mean *ANYTHING* else, please chat with me and let's find out if it's a fit

I'm looking forward to hearing from you all!"
8ou4xt,2,2018-06-05,Should I (23F) break up with him (23M)?,twashi01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ou4xt/should_i_23f_break_up_with_him_23m/,"My long distance boyfriend and I have dated on and off since we were 15 and went two years without speaking to each other back in 2015 after he cheated on me with his last girlfriend (23F) who was my former friend in high school. He said that he was miserable for those two years we didn't speak and continued to date his girlfriend up until he broke up with her in 2016.

He came back in my life a month after my last breakup (June 2017) right before I moved to a new city. We reconnected in the new city for a weekend and hung out like it was old times, we even had sex (which I didn't really enjoy).

After our reconnection he took me out on dates and around his family again in an attempt to win me back, which he eventually did around Valentine's Day of this year. However as time went on, our relationship started to feel like a liability and a vehicle for him to move from his hometown (where we both grew up). I also dealt with bouts of insecurity because of his past infidelity.

He is so desperate to move to this new city and live with me although I'm not ready yet. We're only coming up on about 4 months into our new relationship. His desperation and frustration with a fruitless long distance job search has weighed on our relationship because I'm not ready for him to live with me, nor do I think he has enough experience/time/connections to move here yet. Every time I tried to help him with his job search he encouraged me not to help because he wants to ""get something on his own for once."" He's also afraid that if he stays in our hometown much longer he'll just get ""stuck"" (as if our long distance relationship isn't enough motivation). He's also worried that he's on the chopping block at his current job, which I think he should focus more on than moving to a new city with no money.

Another issue regarding our relationship is difficulty whenever I come to visit him. He still lives at home with his parents and I stay at my parents house whenever I come to visit. I don't feel comfortable sleeping over at his parents', nor does my mother feel comfortable with him over either. So we book a hotel every time and that gets expensive.

About me: I'm a hard\-working young professional who has always had a job or internship. I've moved from city to city since graduating high school and have finally settled in my dream city. I make more money than my boyfriend as well. I feel like personality\-wise we're compatible but our circumstances and history add a lot of baggage. I've already imagined what my newly single life would be like but I'm feeling terribly guilty about wanting to move on with someone more on my level job and maturity\-wise. He's also given me a promise ring and gifts, and I feel bad throwing it all away after just four months.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**tl;dr:** I want to break\-up with my boyfriend but also give him a chance to get his shit together.

What do you guys think I should do?"

---
Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

We’re watching 100% Hotter -series on Netflix in the living room. We’ve been eating food at the couch together for around two episodes in a row now, and also had conversations about the episodes etc.
I finished my meal. Time to quickly check phone just in case I’ve received something about work. I open WhatsApp and notice that there has been some discussion with my friends group chat about Microsoft, Windows and Linux. As a natural nerd, I join it... For like most of the episode 10-15min (ish). 

She sighs desperately, and I instantly know that something is bothering her mind.
“What’s wrong dear?”
“Nothing...” while looking at the floor.
“Honey. Why are you lying? It’s ok, we can talk if something is bothering you.” (I think I said it really softly. Out of context I admit this sounds really creepy)
“Everything is fine.”
“... You sure?”
“It’s fine. I know you want to chat with your buddies.”
“... Ok”
And continue the whole... Not-so-interesting debate about Linux operating system, not the main point right now tho.
Around maybe few minutes beforethe episode changes, she shuts down the TV:
“I think I’ll go shower then.”
“Okay honey.” I reply. (... if I correctly remember)

Now it gets weird. She leaves me in a dark living room alone with my phone, and goes straight to bed. Our bedroom isn’t that far away, I can literally hear her going all THUMB to our bed. She free falled laying down on our bed. I thought yeah that sounds like she’s really bad and it’s pretty close sleeping time, better talk this through so we’re not going to bed angry or disappointed. 

“Um... Honey?”
“Hm?”
“You didn’t answer my question?”(yeah this too sounds creepy)
“Yeah I did. I said: I know you want to chat with your friends so I guess I’ll leave you in peace.”
“.. You want to leave me alone with my phone at the living room?”
“Yeah”
“....O....k...” and I silently leave her be. 

These kind of things have been troubling to us recently. I want to do something without her being present at the certain activity and she gets upset, but doesn’t want to show it because then I feel like stupid man who doesn’t take care of his fiancé. 
And I mean when she’s not getting my 100% attention. Just like the whole phone thing, if I’m just checking if I’ve got any messages from work or any of my hobby related she might already get a bit down. 

About my work:
I’m actually a trainee/intern at good sized company at the field of different events. We supply the sound system and the light for the stage and possibly the whole stage etc.
My average work day is from 7-10h but when things get busy I’m pretty much doing 16 hours a day. 
So I kind of need to keep posted about work stuff, which was the whole reason for me checking my phone if any of the plans have changed etc. 

Hobbies:
Guitar. I have a project but it’s in another city around 3hours driving. I compose pretty much and keep the other members posted about new songs or changes to the old songs.
I also still take classes, although I’ve already played 10 years I like to learn new stuff. I like to practise long sessions, like 2-4 or 6 hours. 
So there’s that keeping me busy.

Also Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Lvl 3 Bard here. Custom campaign every 3 weeks. 

So.. I’m constantly trying to balance with all this right now. And I want to know am I really missing something. I try to maintain connections with my friends, we game really rarely now a days because of the whole job thing. But I still try to keep in touch since most of us met in the internet.

D&amp;D sessions are really hard for fiancé, because 6-9 hour sessions and she really wants to join the campaign but there just isn’t any room anymore. 

Work related used to be hard, but now she really has understood that I’m getting back home as fast as I can but I have to get my part of the job done.  Around 2 weeks ago I got few messages everyday that she really misses me and wants to know the time when I get off work. Which is hard to say, I’m an intern so I don’t really know much yet. And at this kind of job we can have plenty of sticks and stones on the road to slow down the job. I think she understands my work stuff now..

Music is pretty much fifty-fifty. She understand that I have to go to the other town for rehearsals and I’m going to be late back at home. She understands that the project has some gigs here and there, but it’s ok.
But at home when I grab my guitar on my lap, she is already oriented a bit negatively.
I think this might be because of me, but she knows that I’m a perfectionist so it’s practise practise practise.. But still, she could just go to her own PC to watch videos or play games. I thought that’s why our PC’s are next to each other so we can do our own stuff together?
But it’s usually the same, she leaves me there alone in piece, and goes to bedroom to lay down on our bed and starts to browse her phone. 

Friends? I see people at the rehearsals and at the D&amp;D sessions and they both are pretty much every 3 weeks.  Besides that I chat online with my friends or we game together online with Discord. 


I’ve been trying to manage all these stuff like this:

Weekdays:
Work at 1pm? I wake up 7-8am for music stuff (composing, practise). After work always with fiancé.  We eat something, and usually she gets to pick something from Netflix hot YouTube. 
Day before rehearsals, long session practising songs. No matter how late. On the same day of rehearsals I get a day off from my intern job so I can sleep till 1pm or wake up early and practise more. 
Rehearsals are usually from 5pm to 10pm.

Weekends:
Play games with fiancé or with the boys. Recently we haven’t found a new game to play together so we usually just watch Netflix or go out hangout together. Also, it’s rarely with the boys. 
D&amp;D sessions usually happen during weekends. I’ve tried to keep Sunday as a “purritoday” for us so we can just lay around the whole day. But sometimes Sunday is the only option to get everyone to play D&amp;D so few purritohappinesses have been demolished..

After the scenario I described I admit I somehow felt guilty about me texting with the boys, but also I was really happy to chat with them since the last time was around a week ago.  After my battery died I came to our bedroom, plugged the phone to the charger and notice she’s already under the blanket trying to sleep. So I ask:
“Are you already trying to sleep?”
“Yeah. What else?” (I’m not sure if I remember this correct)
“O-oh. Ok..” 
As I leave her be. 
So I pretty much hit the shower and went to bed, asking again:
“Honey, I kinda sense you feel really bad in some way.”
“In physically or psychologically?”
“I mean mentally. I kind of feel numb or at the edge”
“Nah... I’m good.” She replies but with really really drowsy way like she’s really falling into sleep. 

What I’m trying to ask is am I doing something wrong? Am I giving all I could? Im all open to questions and opinions but bare with me as the reply may be with a quite a huge latency 😅
I really feel stupid quite often.

8ovi67,1,2018-06-05,"Talking about it helps, so here is my story so far [Long]",AZestyBurrit0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8ovi67/talking_about_it_helps_so_here_is_my_story_so_far/,"I have been depressed for quite some time now and finally found a way that helps me deal with it, which is talking about it. So I decided to post my kind of story, kind of thoughts at and up to this point.

I am not really sure when it first began, however, I started to notice big changes when I went to college for physics . I used to half crack 'jokes' like, ""Well if I just was hit by this bus I wouldn't have to take that test"" and such, but I guess I never really realized that these had more truth in them than I wanted. These statements increased in frequency, but I have always been a sarcastic/witty person so people never really took it for anything serious. I didn't even realize what I was saying, or that these were not jokes but the start of something more serious. In my classes, I kept up fine, but at a lack of social interaction. I was given chances to hang out with friends and would often give excuses as to why I wasn't going out with them. Instead, I would stay in my room and isolate myself so I wasn't bothering anyone else with my mood.

I entered a  bad relationship (as most freshmen do) but this one was very toxic and ruined any shards of self\-confidence I had left. We constantly had fought and when we weren't fighting I didn't want to talk about me because my philosophy has always been to help others over myself. Anyways, after I got out of that relationship I was left in a very bad spot mentally. This was the first time in my life where my 'jokes' stopped being jokes and I had real thoughts of killing myself. Still, though I didn't realize, or tried to ignore the fact that I was depressed and didn't look for help.

During this time I started to become more and more unhealthy. My diet was poor, to say the least. My dental hygiene was also slipping, ""Why go and brush your teeth if are not worth anything anyways"" was my thought process. I put on about 30lbs, which was crazy for me being an athlete growing up. This lead to a poor self\-image, which leads to me not having any drive to go and change, which continued the circle and issue.

I did have one night with my best friend that changed my life and probably saved it too. He invited me over to go hot tubbing one night and forced me out of my room so I had no choice. We were talking for a long time and I started to talk about what was going through my head and he said something that changed my life. He told me that he thought I had depression. When he said it, something clicked in my head that maybe he was right. Although this was not when I realized I needed help. For years I always have preferred to 'handle myself'. Meaning that I would rather not have others worry about me because I would be fine. But, I will always remember that night.

The summer rolled around to end my sophomore year in college and I went home for the summer. I rekindled an old romance with a girl from my hometown and had an amazing time. For the first time in a long time, I didn't want to jump into oncoming traffic everyday. The next school year rolled around and we dated and then suddenly things ended. She said she didn't love me anymore. I get it, we were different but it still sucked. I guess I never really told her the extent of my depressed thoughts because I never wanted to make her sad in any way even if she wanted to help me. There were many days that I couldn't get out of bed and she could never understand why because I never talked about why I was feeling that way. When things ended, I spiraled into one of the worst spots in my life.

I drank every day. I drank before class in the morning, I drank when I got out of class, I drank till I passed out. I couldn't leave my room unless I had something to drink. When I was in my room I would try to perfect my plan to kill myself without hurting other people \\\[1\\\]. This is probably the reason I am still here today. As much as I didn't want to be alive I knew it would destroy my parents and family. 

    

The summer rolled around and I got an internship in the area. I was able to get through the summer in a decently good mental state due to interactions with another intern who also shared mental health stories. This is when I turned my life around or at least started. I went to a doctor after having a mental breakdown at work one day. I was saying I was having issues focusing and this was affecting my life. However, credit to the doctor who deserves that degree he has and sent me to talk to a Psychiatrist for depression. I started taking an antidepressant that was prescribed to me after some other options were exhausted.

Life after that got better and better. I got the nerve to quit my toxic RA job and my internship decided to keep me on working part\\\-time. I for the first time told my parents that I had depression and that I was taking steps to manage it. I started to talk to my closest friends about it. That is when I realized that one of the steps that helps me is talking. Not trying to hide me and my issues but to talk them through. I am still working on managing, and some days are better than others. However, I am finally able to take steps to improve my life and try and repair both physical and mental issues caused by this time in my life.

    

\[1\] Also as a side note, at this time I was an RA for the dorms and thought it was so obscene that they would train us on how to help residents who were depressed. However, they never took the time to check in on me when clearly I was in an awful spot. This was when I learned that some employers don't care about their employees as long as the job is done.

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

------------------------------------------

***Some final notes!***

* I only write here on Reddit, through the PM's. Not chat. Don't send me chat invites.

* Yes, this is F4F. Guys, respect that. Today isn't your day.

* My message length varies, but you'll never get anything less than 4 lines out of me.

* I can write in first or third person, with a slight preference for third."

I thought I had it figured out but I'm really frustrated again and think I might have been doing it wrong. 

What I need help with is two things. One, I need to have dots of the different sites appear on the map. I have excel sheets that have the addresses of all the sites. This is the thing I need the most help with honestly, it's the base of the project. Two, I need to be able to adjust the size of the dot that signifies the location so match how many students were at these sites. 

Any help with be greatly appreciated, even if its just videos or tutorials to try. I'm really new with the program so I'm still learning all the jargon so simple words would be greatly appreciated.

I don't have any lab experience , yet, and starting my minor late means I have to double down on classes and won't have time for internships or labs.

I’m very hesitant to work at an agency based off of the horror stories I keep hearing about that environment. In the future I’d rather work for a publisher or client side.

I would describe myself as a natural planner. I feel like my mind is constantly analyzing and making connections. I’ve been writing lists and planning every detail of my life since I was a little girl. I love storytelling. I’ve been writing short stories and narrative poetry for years. However, my biggest strength is my nonfiction writing. I’ve always been very good at writing research papers and analytical essays.

I’m currently an ad sales intern at a major television network company. After shadowing for a few days, I can tell that Ad Sales isn’t exactly what I want to do. Its interesting and a good start, but I ultimately want to do something that involves less sales and a lot more strategic thinking. Or something that involves coming up with plans to attract more viewers to watch a particular show/engage with content.

I guess another way to explain how I feel is that I think I’m on the wrong side of things. Ad Sales is trying to attract and convince advertisers to buy ad space based on the TV show ratings. I guess my interest would be finding ways to promote the actual tv shows and getting the ratings up so the advertising space is worth more money. Does this make sense?

Other than that, I really, really like the office and work environment. I also really like the idea of working in the entertainment field. I would love to work at the company one day, just in a different department that suits me better. I want to make the most of my summer, though. Are there any specific skills that I should focus on learning/perfecting this summer that can be transferred to any strategic position?

In upcoming summers and semesters I plan on pursuing a media planning internship at a media agency and a marketing internship at an entertainment company (tv network, record label, etc). What do you think of this?

I’m just trying to figure out what role would be the best fit for me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
8oxys3,389,2018-06-06,Fucking [M] sisters hot [F]riend,Haveuscenemywnr,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8oxys3/fucking_m_sisters_hot_friend/,"

First post and first time sharing this story with anyone else but the girl I fucked. Sorry for the length, hopefully the back story isn’t too painful, I marked where the good parts start. 

I moved to a new city for grad school when I was in my early 20’s, I was accepted to a major university (my long shot) and I was over the moon. This also coincided with the ending of a 6 year relationship and a subsequent depressive weight gain which negated any esteem I felt from professional accomplishments. Thankfully for me, my sister was fairly popular and not too much younger than me, so hanging out with her/her friends was a god send. 

As time went on, I think I had a bit of a mental break, and became known as being kind of a wild card, very good at drinking games, fun at parties and quickly made a lot of great friends. 

When I was introduced to my sisters roommate Anna, she was very funny and sharp, very into super heroes/movies, and just pleasant to be around. Most important to this story though is that she is incredibly sexy. She’s around 5 ft tall, brunette, light blue beautiful eyes, tight everywhere, with world class tits. I tried not to pay too much mind to her as she had a boyfriend and was pretty much forbidden, not that it mattered anyway, because she was well out of my league.  

The year went on well, but I was dry as a fucking bone. Almost everyone eventually left for the summer, and I was resolved to fix my situation. I subsequently spent the entire summer working out, eating right and pretty much never drinking. I ended up dropping around 75 lbs and was in the best shape of my life. 

Description of me at this point, I’m around 6 feet tall, and when the rest of this story occurred I was around 190lbs and very lean, 5-6% body fat and incredibly ripped (still in good shape now, but that was hard to maintain). I also have a decently large cock, around 7.5” and very thick. 

Fast forward to everyone returning from the summer, everyone is treating me differently, still friendly but maybe they were taking me a bit more seriously. I guess you can get away with a lot more when you’re perceived as a fat clown. Eventually confidence caught up with me and the flood gates opened, I broke the dry spell and had a very eventful rest of the year. During all of this, Anna didn’t really come out a lot and spent most of her time holed up in her room with her boyfriend. 

The summer came again, and this time around many more people were staying, including my sister and Anna. Anna’s boyfriend however moved across the country for an internship and they broke up. The moment he left there was a big change with her, dressing up more, going out more often, just a new found confidence in her. 

——good parts start here ——

One night I was invited out for a low-key night at a few dive bars with my sister, her boyfriend, one of his friends, and Anna. Anna and I were sort of the outsiders so we spent a lot of time talking, making jokes, making fun of each other etc.  she starts getting a little more handsy, touching my arm, and standing very close to me. We start flirting pretty heavily as the drinks flow, the others take notice and try to tell us to knock it off. We don’t really listen and end up playing a lot of hidden grab-ass.  

Once the bar closes we all decide to go swimming at my sisters boyfriends. My drunk brain figured I’d borrow trunks or something once we got there, but instead Anna immediately strips down to some very skimpy lingerie and jumps straight in. I was floored, she was incredible, perfect from head to toe in that outfit, and her tits were much larger and perkier than I would have guessed previously, which was the best surprise of all. I get down to boxer briefs to swim, and we all have a decent time as the night winds down. 

We all end up agreeing just to stay at my sisters boyfriends place, I get the downstairs couch and they make her go all the way up to the 3rd floor to separate us. Thankfully, cell phones are a thing and I text Anna and ask her if she wants to take an Uber back. She doesn’t respond, but shows up in the doorway of where I was supposed to sleep, half naked. She walks up to me not saying a word, and I pull her to me, finally getting to taste her lips and explore her body more freely. We break momentarily to discuss what to do next and we decide to get an Uber and head back to her place because we would be completely alone there.  

We get back to her place where we basically were walking and taking off articles of clothing, mouths connected the entire time. We get upstairs and for some reason we are standing making out almost naked next to my sisters bed. Anna only had her bra on which I quickly removed to reveal the singular nicest set of natural tits I’ve ever seen. They defied gravity and looked big and perfect on her frame, with perfect quarter sized nipples. We made out some more, and I eventually kissed down her neck and got my mouth acquainted with her tits, spending time sucking, licking and lightly blowing on each, taking my time driving her crazy as she gasps and her hips start to grind towards me. 

I moved back to kiss her and reached down to feel her wetness, and I wasn’t disappointed. Anna was absolutely soaked and dripping, I’ve never felt a wetter pussy than this, it was incredible. She immediately moaned and sort of half collapsed on my shoulders as I started slowly rubbing and teasing her clit, increasing with speed slowly. I am rock hard at this point and she reaches down to start stroking it slowly, my cock was covered in precum from all the teasing which she worked in her hands to stroke me, and made this feel great. 

Just before I think I’m about to get her off, she takes a grip of my cock and leads me over towards my sisters bed and lays down spread eagle on her back. She beckons me forward and guides my cock into her, which slides right in with little resistance because she was so damn wet. She did this all while looking me in the eyes, her face filled with desire, so damn hot. A condom crossed my mind, and fucking on my sisters bed wasn’t ideal, but I was now hilt deep in the tightest hottest pussy I have ever felt, looking down at her sexy eyes, perfect tits, and she was now begging to be fucked. I didn’t stand a chance. 

I’m on the bigger side so she was a little uncomfortable at first but once she got used to it she loved getting fucked HARD, I was fucking her so hard I thought I was going to break through her back. As I’m doing that she’s digging her nails in my back and practically screaming with her legs wrapped tightly around me holding me in place until she came the first time.  She tells me at this point that she’s never had a cock like mine, and has never been fucked like that before, +10 ego boost. 

After she came she was a little sensitive so I picked her up and carried her over to her bed. The sisters bed thing honestly weirded me out. When I set her down in her bed, I could see the aftermath of the previous pounding, her perfect pussy swollen and dripping down her leg and ass. I immediately took that opportunity to taste her, she was perfect here too, almost sweet. I love eating pussy and I dare say I’ve perfected it over time, and I went after her like I’d die if I didn’t get more of it. After a short time her back starts to arch and she’s pushing my face into her pussy as she cums for the second time. 

At this point she’s putty in my hands and I know I can do whatever I want with her, and she knows it. I flip her over and push deep into her from behind, slowly working her up again, grabbing her perfect ass with both hands, couple of slaps leaving nice red hand prints. I wrapped her hair around my hand and started to pull to make her fuck my cock. She starts begging to be fucked harder, and I oblige, making her moan loud and beg for more, with the wettest sounds made every time I ram against her ass. I reach around this time as I’m fucking her and start to play with her clit, which drove her fucking wild. After a few more minutes she tenses up and pushes back hard against my cock and cums for the third time.  

At this point we are both exhausted, but I had not gotten mine yet (this marathon brought to you by whiskey dick).  I wanted her missionary again because I loved seeing those tits bounce, and the look on her face while I fucked her.  She starts bringing her hips up to meet me and kind of half twerking on it, which was pretty much sensory overload. I told her I was going to cum and she just started grinding harder and meeting my every move.  Thankfully? my brain still worked and I pulled out, absolutely covering her stomach and tits, with the first spurt hitting her chin. We both cleaned up and collapsed after that.  

It really didn’t go anywhere from here but we fucked one more time secretly while she was visiting my sister, about 1 hour before another guy came and picked her up, still soaked with my load still dripping from her. But that’s another story. 

I have a lot more stories from that time in my life, and any feedback is definitely welcome.

I am currently doing an internship at a crowdfunding NGO in Mauritius. They puts on events to raise money for good causes. Our last event went well and my boss asked me what I would like to work on next and I suggested a project to raise money to neuter the huge stray dog population of Mauritius and try to home some them as well as educate the public about them. He then talked to a woman who runs a small animal sanctuary and sent me all the information. Now he expects a plan on how we can help them. I have a few ideas, but I could really do with some input!

This is the sanctuary: [https://pawedforlifesanctuary.com/](https://pawedforlifesanctuary.com/) (I realise the website itself needs to be updated and I'm looking into helping the lady who runs the sanctuary to do that)

And I only have 2 1/2 weeks left in Mauritius, so I'm hoping to set something up they will then continue after I go home.

My ideas so far:

An outside event with a raffle, maybe a wheel of fortune, drink stand etc. hopefully with some of the sanctuary animals there and many volunteers to educate, because the public has a very negative perception of stray dogs here (mostly due to the governments policy of treating them like a pest that needs to be captured and killed). 

An adoption\-day in a public park with sanctuary animals there, with their stories and a description of what makes each of them special on the cages to try and entice people to adopt or at least donate.

Maybe a bigger event such as a fundraising\-concert (that's what we did for our most recent cause) where all the proceeds go to the sanctuary.

Any and all advice and ideas are welcome!

Thank you!"

Mike films a sexual intro to the S15 build and right when I was unzipping my pants and reaching for the lotion Thomas pops on and starts talking about why he's not going to do the thing he said he was going to do. The build didn’t happen because MOT was going to have to cut an intercooler hole. MOT’s OCD was triggered by the swap dudes lack of Zinc Plated bolts. So long story short, shit didn’t go down. Tommyfyeah stock is plummeting SELL! SELL! SELL!
* **Mr. Oakes**-  Jimmai gets the M52 and supercharger from Thomas, Congratulations Mr. Oakes! Unless Jimmy goes full Cam this summer he’s got GREAT content lined up for his channel, supercharged BMW, drifting, cappuccino, His Twin Z's to break up monotony  and the IS300 build. Mr. Oakes states that he is leaning NA-T for the IS300, he also declares that he won’t be going full #OakesSpec on the IS300 engine bay but can he help himself? Jimmy not shaving bays is like a dog trying to walk on its hind legs, it’s just not natural. Tell you what I like about Mr. Oakes he has an authentic friend group around him of what appear to be great people. B-Hall makes an appearance, that guy needs a channel or needs to be featured more on Jimmy's, you decide. 
* **Rudnik**- Streams some PUB G on youtube. 
* **Haggard North**- I’m not sure how many vids we are on now where Damian tells us where the wall is going up in his new shop, I think five, Damian we know where the wall is going, we know you are excited about it but stop telling us. Damian goes to Jimmy’s shop and looks at the IS 300, he jelly. He’s probably over there to find the intern. Travis does not seem amused with Stubbins. Damian does a “prank call” and it’s SUPER CRINGE. I had severe cringe-spasms. He drops two accents in this vid which means his anxiety it rising.
* **Austin** u/jsx86- This [clip pretty much sums up Austin’s return to the sub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSr-VWc_7WQ).  I’m sad, I had a new project thingy kick off at work and I missed Tier 1  Haggard Garage Extended Universe drama, which as you all know I care way to much about. I’m not sure what is appropriate for discussion on the sub as I wasn’t present for most of the juicy cutlets that Austin was tossing the discord but based off my guys Wholeset summary he DM'd me yesterday (shoutout wholeset, you the homie), I feel very confident announcing that eBay Cam is dead but long live Austin Palmerton, may he slide the FRS in Formula FD and may subs flow freely to his youtube channel. Today he is **""ONE OF US, ONE OF US, ONE OF US.""** Austin you have been around the sub long enough to see how quickly fortunes can rise or fall here but I’m quietly optimistic you have a decent understanding of us and know what you are getting yourself into. Glad you're here homie.

* **LZ**- Throws some louvers on the Z, I wanted to hate them but they look good. Does some shit on THICCOLE’s car with wiring? This is probably a skip IMO

* **Taylor Ray**- Seat Time Lord. Lots of drifting in Georgia, nothing riveting but the dude is getting more track time than almost everybody else in the game. As far as actual grassroots drifting, this guy is the king. 

* **Boosted Boiz**- Gofund me broke 50k in 24 hours and I guess one of our own is gonna eat some socks because of it?

8ozmoo,1,2018-06-06,An Interesting File I Found,EndlessScientist01,u_EndlessScientist01,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EndlessScientist01/comments/8ozmoo/an_interesting_file_i_found/,"\-\-PRIVATE LOG 00213\-\-

I was tasked to check out the information on the database in the east wing for anything of value this weekend. The tech guys are working on making a more centralized database for the sake of convenience, which I've been wanting for years. The inconvenience of splitting it up was extremely annoying and mostly pointless. That all being said I hate that I have to be the one to do this. Sure my last experiment may have killed a few of the interns and I deserve some kind of punishment, but this is just demeaning. And on Memorial Day weekend for crying out loud!

But enough complaining about my workplace, I found something interesting while doing the computer work. It looks to be a leftover report from a past employee of the company. I'm going to assume that the original folder of his files was deleted, but the guy must have saved this one to videos by accident because that's where I found it. I shall copy the document here:

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Report Type: Finding

Value: Unknown

Name: TBD (Temp Name: The Wall)

Location: The Mines

Discovery: We had found traces of highly concentrated slithracite along the walls of a few of the deeper passages within the mines. There had been rumors of such, but we chose to take our Goo\-dars and find it for ourselves. We thought that would be the end of that expedition, but we quickly realized that all the veins of slithracite within the walls were coming from one part of the mines. We followed the veins to their source and found something vastly more astonishing. The narrow corridor of the cave stopped abruptly to a wall of swirling dark green slime. It looked almost black under the faint glow of our flashlights, except for the bright green freckles of crystalline slime scattered among it. The viscosity of the slime was similar to that of maple syrup. The slime continuously churned counter\-clockwise and made a faint bubbling sound. My assistant went in for a closer look, but tripped over on what I thought was a rock at the time (on closer inception afterwards it was a dusty femur) and fell head first into the swirling slime wall. I could hear his muffled screams for help as the wall continued to pull in the rest of his body into itself. I rushed over and tried to remove him from the wall's grip, but the pull was too strong. For a couple of moments my hands dipped into the wall whilst trying to hold onto my assistant (he was waist deep at this point), but I was able to successfully pull myself free. I watched as the rest of him got sucked in. After I had accepted the demise of my assistant I surveyed the area, took some notes, and left.

Hypothesis: The location of the wall is more or less under Endless War, thus I believe that this wall is attached to it and can act as some kind of entrance into it. I do not what caused this spiraling tumor, but I do think that the wall spits out some of its victims. I found many bones under some the dirt and rocks of the cave floor. It seems likely that these were Juveniles at one time who got pulled into the wall and spat back out. Are they dead on exit? What exactly happens to them in Endless War? Do they just swim aimlessly in the syrupy soup of slime or does the wall go somewhere? I will have to do a lot more research into this before making any conclusive statements.

 \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- 

The older format of the report leads me to believe that this was written a couple of years ago. The overall informality of the report points to this being a early draft that would have been expanded upon later. I wonder why this guy didn't bring these findings to SlimeCorp? Instead he made a half baked report and didn't tell anyone about what happened. I would have heard about this ""Slime Wall"", the bosses would have put this guy on upper management for finding something actually interesting. Maybe this story was bogus and he just wanted attention, but had a change of heart at the last second? Or maybe he got fired before he could inform anyone of his findings? If it's the latter I better look into this more when I got more time."
8ozy6m,2,2018-06-06,I (23/M) don't know if I should get back with my ex (23/F),CheapComfortable,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ozy6m/i_23m_dont_know_if_i_should_get_back_with_my_ex/,"I was with ex for three years,  my first proper relationship and both our first long term relationships.

She broke up with me because I wasn't emotionally available and I wasn't putting in any effort into the relationship.  We had stopped doing things, I was busy with sport, university work and  an internship and we weren't spending that much time together. Her happiness had started to decline and she said couldn't keep the relationship going. I had gotten comfortable and never saw the problems we were having. It was sort of out of the blue for me and by the time she talked to me about it she said it was too late.
Been 6 months since we broke up and she recently contacted to meet up. We've met a couple of times now and we're thinking of getting back together.

I've been trying to improve myself and sort out why we broke up in the first place but I asked her if she had slept with anyone since. Probably not the right move and it doesn't help either of us but it was a question that was eating away at me. I haven't slept with anyone since and honestly I was only getting over the relationship by the time she contacted me again. She told me she slept with two people around a month after we broke up. Said both were after drunken nights out and both were mistakes. 

She would never have been the one to initiate sex so it surprised and hurt me how she could go out and sleep with someone a month after ending a three year relationship. The fact that it happened twice shows that it wasn't a mistake at the time although she regrets it now. I'm probably being childish but it feels like I was her safety net while she went out and experimented, meanwhile I was devastated by the breakup.

Nearly everyone i've talked to has said to leave her but I still can't get her out of my head. I'm sort of in the same situation as I was in before when we broke up with loads of work on so i've been reluctant to put effort into starting the relationship up again.

Now we're thinking of getting back together I still love her and she says she loves me too, but I'm cautious now and part of me wants to forget about her after being hurt before. I don't know what to do, to progress the relationship? Or cut it off completely.

I purchased the Yoga 920 on March 3, 2018 for my partner's birthday. He is in grad school and was using a $300 laptop he purchased a year ago. I read all the excellent reviews for the 920 and thought it was a perfect gift. I spent $1300 on the computer, that is a lot of money to me. With him in school we are a one income household, but I had a bit of saving and he is perfect so yeah.

The screen started failing on May 27th, a week before finals for him. It had only been 53 days since I bought the device. 

I first contacted customer support on May 30th. They went back and forth with me for 10 days, had me reinstall drivers, go into safe mode and more. I work in tech, I do trouble shooting for my company. After 10 days they finally offered to fix it. It took me a few days to send, I shipped it on the April 16th. On April 23 the called me and asked if they could re-image it, I told them absolutely. I called on the 26th and they told me it was a motherboard failure and might take a few more days. 

I just called again, so June 6th. I was informed that they do not have any replacements for the motherboard so they are waiting for parts and not sure how long that will take. It has been 37 days since the first time I contacted them about this issue. Thirty. Seven. Days. The thing only worked for 53 days.

Not only did he not have a laptop for finals, we gave the his old one to a family friend, he started a summer internship in a different state, he still doesn't have a computer.

I AM FURIOUS. I am embarrassed. At least his old laptop kinda worked. During this process I also needed a new laptop, I bought a Lenovo Y520. I just, why does this company hate its customers? This is absolutely insane. 

Any suggestions on how to get them to care? Or on how to convince my partner I actually got him a decent computer and not a piece of junk from a company that hates me?

Next year we're going to try to transition this into a few students at a time but make them more independant.  We would be there as more of a resource/mentor.. teaching them the basics and then following up when they need help, directive, etc.  One of their main roles will be a student helpdesk for basic issues (wifi, account reset, etc.) but that clearly wouldn't be enough to get them a good amount of experience.

I'm looking for ideas of projects that can be set up for them throughout the year that they can research on their own and then be given a simulation/hands on with it.

An example would be creating a simulated network environment:

* Provide them a few dummy machines to be made into ""servers"" &amp; ""clients""
* Provide them a POE switch, cat6 cabling, 1 access point (all standalone off the switch, nothing actually connected to our real network)
* Have them install server OS &amp; server roles to get a basic network &amp; domain up (DHCP, DNS, AD)
* Have them create a few OU's for the dummy ""clients"" and a few user accounts
* Maybe add a few more server roles (IIS, etc.)
* Set up a wireless network connected to the LAN and connect with a dummy laptop to said wireless network

Has anyone done this with students and found some great projects that work well?"

I moved to Toronto in September from the States to go to grad school and study towards two master's degrees at U of T (Master of Information with a concentration in Library and Information Science and a Master of Museum Studies - two degrees in three years instead of the normal four years). Part of coming to Toronto was to attempt to fulfill my dream of working at the Hockey Hall of Fame.  I went to PuckTalks my first week in Toronto and spoke to Steve and another speaker at the event afterwards.  I told the other speaker what I wanted to do and I was told that it was impossible, that so many others out there couldn't get their foot in the door at the Hall, and made it seem like my dream was going to stay a dream. It was disheartening. After I spoke to that individual, I spoke to Steve, and he was so kind. When I told him what I wanted to do with my life, he was upbeat, supportive, and encouraging. He told me he believed in me and was rooting for me. It was so great to hear that, especially since I had just moved to Toronto and didn't know anyone. Shortly after, I became an intern at the HHOF Resource Centre, which has been an incredible experience. About a month ago, I was hired full-time at the Resource Centre for the summer. My dream has come true and I am so grateful for Steve's support to this random American girl who came up to him one night to talk to him about working at the HHOF. Just wanted to say thanks to him and Adam and Jesse for being there for a laugh and teaching me about Leafs hockey and Toronto.

I suffered from Bulimia for 5 years from the time I was 14 until 19. I finally got myself into therapy and have been working extremely hard on getting myself well. Two years later, this has led me to gain a bit of weight. I am not OVERweight by any means but it is a considerable difference from my size in the midst of my eating disorder.

I recently was offered an internship in my hometown and move back in with my parents for the summer because the rent in our area is exorbitantly expensive.  My parents have been less than enthusiastic about my recovery from the get go, and just think its a matter of not ""being stupid"" and that I should just know better than to engage in the disordered behaviors, and just be ""sensible"" about food and eating. 

This lack of enthusiasm has now shifted into a flat out disapproval because of this weight gain. They say that I am letting myself go and that my weight is getting out of control. They constantly belittle me and tell me that my clothes look bad, or I shouldn't eat that, or I should cut all carbs or all fats, or tell me to go to the gym more frequently, etc. This is really taking a toll on my mental health and my motivation in recovery and I don't know what to do anymore. When I try to bring up that they are making my feel horrible, causing me to want to return to old behaviors, and hindering my recovery process, they tell me that ""the truth hurts"" and ""they wont tiptoe around my poor delicate feelings"". 

I have to continue living here for the next 2 months before I can move back to college for my final year but I'm afraid that will be two months too long. Any advice for someone living with human incarnations of the negative talk in her head?"

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a  lucky guy that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ocudk/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I am in a clinical psychology doctoral program and entered my final month at my first year field placement this month, 40 more hours from successfully finishing my first year of this 5 year program. My academic adviser (who is a psychologist) confirmed my suspicion of having hypomanic episodes at the beginning of this academic year.

I tried very hard to get everything under control when it seemed like it was going haywire. This was actually the longest I've went without having an episode (its been 2.5 months). I've been sleeping more regularly, exercising, eating better, and I no longer drink during the week and hardly at all on weekends. I've even been kind of... bored. But I thought this was to better myself, focus on school, etc.

But the boredom has also become a slight depressive episode, and I have a history of migraines dating back to when I was in highschool that have been increasingly worse lately. I have had some absences throughout this year at my internship due to crashing after hypomania and from migraines.

Today I called out of my internship from a mixture of both, and now I hate myself for it. My supervisor emailed me back saying he terminated my placement and contacted my adviser. My adviser is understanding and working to figure out how I can make up the missing hours and not ruin my likelihood of getting further placements. However, I am so self-loathing right now I'm not even sure if its worth it. Am I even going to be able to complete my program if I get through this rough patch?

I'm freaking out, feels like my skin is crawling and I'm so pissed off I don't know what to do. I just want to go straight to trying to trigger a hypomanic episode because even though I'm unpredictable at least I have the energy and insane motivation to do literally everything, school, work, internship, etc.

I have an internship across the country starting in two weeks so since school ended and I moved back home out of my dorm, I've been sitting at home playing video games all. day. long. Very anti-social. But the thing is, I'm not! My parents just took away my car a year ago and gave it to my brother so yeah I can't go anywhere. I don't really have friends in my hometown but I have my cousins that are the same age as me. One of them invited both of us to go clubbing and spend the night at her house after. And I'm all for it, I wanna go so bad and I love to party. But the thing is, I told my mom today that I'm going to stay the night at my cousin's house this weekend and my mom said ""yeah but she likes to go clubbing and I don't want you to do that"" so I'm not sure if that's a yes or a no because I didn't even say we were going clubbing. If she ends up telling me I can't go and making sure I don't, I'm gonna be devastated because usually she tells me I shouldn't go out during the school year because I should be studying. well it's summer now and I finished off with only A's and B's. So wheres the hurt in a little bit of fun? Also, I'm going to be studying abroad in Europe next semester where legal drinking age is 18 so I will be clubbing more often. Should I just try to leave on Friday with my cousin to my other cousin's house before they get home from work or should I just face them and risk not going by saying ""I've already been clubbing in college"". OR I can lie and say ""oh were just gonna have a girls night and watch movies and do makeup"" There are many things I can do and many outcomes as well. BTW this would also be the first time I've ever stayed the night at my cousins house without my mom with me. They never let me go before college because my dad didn't trust me at anyone's house alone. And in college I went on all kinds of trips without them even knowing. I didn't tell them because they believe I am immature and told me I must stay on college campus all the time. They don't believe I am capable of making adult decisions, though I've also gotten myself birth control since I was 17 without them knowing and I planned my study abroad semester without their aid as well as my internship. This is the first month I'm living with them again in a whole school year before I go away again. But yeah I have strict parents and while I'm here I have to deal with them. Any idea where I should start?"
8p5p05,1,2018-06-06,Mom won't teach me how to drive,40yearoldcarpooler,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8p5p05/mom_wont_teach_me_how_to_drive/,"I've had my permit for almost a year now, and my mom and I have only been out to drive 3-4 times. During the year, every time I'd ask to go practice driving she'd say ""I'm too tired"" or ""Not today"" or ""I'm not in the mood"" or ""I'm too busy"" (and then I'd later see her watching TV for hours and hours every single day). Every time I'd ask her she'd always get mad at me for pestering her, and eventually I gave up. We agreed that I should learn how to drive this summer (or so I thought), since I only have one year of high school left, and yet she still REFUSES to take me out to drive. I even created a driving schedule to make the commitment tangible, and I printed the practice log forms so everything would be easier. She just keeps making up millions of bullshit excuses for why she doesn't want to take me!!!!!! ""Exercise 1 hour every day and I will teach you every day""--and yet, I worked out for an hour and--as expected--she still REFUSED to teach me (and the same goes for *insert any other condition here*, such as cleaning my room or doing the dishes or whatever). The one time we did go out this week she screamed at me after 10 minutes of driving for not stopping in the middle of an empty neighborhood intersection because she wanted me to make a turn THAT SECOND just because she felt like it (and decided to tell me THEN instead of 5 seconds earlier, without enough time for me to turn on my blinkers), and I was confused because there was no stop sign so it took me a good second or two to hit the breaks. She went batshit crazy and screamed at me and said that she won't teach me because I don't understand how to obey her, so I'm not worthy of learning how to drive, and she made me get out of the car so she could drive us home. Her expectations are just so ridiculous!!!!!!! How will I ever learn if she isn't willing to teach me? How will I do things the way she wants me to if I'm literally focused on trying to do so many things at once because I'm so inexperienced? I've literally only driven with her 3 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet she expects me to do everything correctly the first time... She is just SO frustrating. I feel like at this rate, I'm never going to be able to drive. It's like she tries SO HARD to find every single little excuse to NOT let me drive. And it's not like I'm a horrible driver, either. I've driven probably a total of 5-10 times with my dad, my sister, and my brother-in-law (all of whom live in different cities), and they ALL said that I'm a great driver. I just don't understand why my mother is so reluctant to even bother teaching me. It even got to the point that today, she said she won't teach me to drive until I complete my entire Aceable course, which is going to take me about a month (time that I don't have because I need to take my driving test before school starts again in August)--and on top of that, she said I have to do it in front of her, like a child. So since she has to sign off on them, I can't even do it during the 2-3 hours in public transportation to my internship every day, and I'll have to waste all that time just SITTING when besides the online driving course, I still have to study for my SAT/SAT subject tests/complete an online class/write college application essays. She doesn't understand that you're supposed to take the online course AS you learn to drive, regardless of me trying to explain that to her. If her reasoning was true, why would Aceable/the state of Texas only require me to complete the first level in order to get my driving permit, instead of all 12? Why would they let me drive before finishing the other 11 levels? She doesn't want to listen to anything I say!!!!!!!!!!!

If she had taught me to drive last year when I got my permit, I would already have had my license for 6 months. I wouldn't have to take 1-hr bus rides to my internship, I wouldn't have to have cancelled on my tutoring clients due to having to spend extra time on public transit, and I wouldn't have had to (or will have to, in the future) wait literally 3 hours after school every day for my mom to pick me up. We literally have an extra car that I could use, and my mom still won't teach me how to drive. I just don't understand how she'd rather spend so much time every day driving me to &amp; from school/places instead of taking that time to teach me how to drive myself. I'm almost 18, and I don't want to end up like my sister. She learned how to drive in her mid 20s IN COLLEGE because my mom never taught her, and my dad was living in another city. I don't want to be dependent on my mother for the rest of my youth, or have to end up learning to drive in a stressful time during my senior year or in college in a different city. She just doesn't seem to understand how much of an impact this has on me. It's like she doesn't care, and I don't know how to make her care. Every time I mention driving she just explodes. She's just annoying and yelling at me all the time about everything now, and I just CANNOT stand her. I need patience to see through this haze of exasperation and disappointment."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8p62vu,734,2018-06-06,It has to be all on one page? Have it your way,yellowcatemp,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8p62vu/it_has_to_be_all_on_one_page_have_it_your_way/,"Background: I am currently a community college student working for a large(global) company trying to get class credit for an internship I am currently on. I will definitely receive credit for it as long as I turn in all the paperwork over the summer. 

This story starts last month when I had to meet with the work based learning(WBL) contact at the community college to ensure all my paperwork was in order before the internship starts. i.e. the internship has to be relevant to my major, and I am a programmer.

The contact is a program director for a different IT major, we’ll call her PD for short. She states that I must get my new boss, who I have only interviewed with, to fill out some paperwork and turn it in to her so I can get enrolled for the intern credit. Apparently, it is required to go in to meet with her in person when I turn it in. 

So, I email my new boss, NB for short, who seems like a nice guy(understatement of the year) asking him to fill out a few things. He gets back to me a week later with the papers because he was on vacation. No problem for me, I’ll just take them in to PD the next day.

I go in to her office and she proceeds to tell me how I almost missed the window to get enrolled in the WBL credit, which was the day after. I told her I was waiting for NB and even showed her the email chain, but she said I must be more prompt with the paperwork next time. I agree and go on my way thinking to myself she is a power trip cause she’s a director for a gov. organization.

I spent 3 years at a state university so I am familiar with the types of people you often run into in the wonderful world of academia.

The next week I start my new job, and everything is going great. NB is a super chill and laid back manager, and the work I’m doing is very interesting. Don’t think much about PD or the requirements until the end of the month, when a time sheet is due. 

I fill out the time sheet which is an excel file, and get my boss to print and sign it. He prints it out front and back because the sheet is all charted out for weeks at a time, and this way it is easier to read. We both sign it; I scan it in and send it off to her on the 31st as requested. Mind you I haven’t turned in anything late at this point, she has no reason to be fussy.

5 days later I get an email from PD saying my sheet is not valid because it has to be all on one page. Well, I had turned in two scans because Front and Back. She states that the time records on the front are not valid, because the signature is not on that side. She’s essentially suggesting that I could be faking half my hours and lying to her. Not to mention, the one sheet requirement is nowhere to be found on the class webpage. I’m ordered to resubmit the time sheet all on one page, which means I have to get NB to sign again. Time for some delicious malicious compliance against PD.

Of course at this point I have some what of a rapport with NB and he’s one of the best bosses I’ve ever had. I go to him and explain the situation, both of us understanding how ridiculous she’s being so he doubles down with me for the malicious compliance.

He proceeds to print off the excel sheet in the smallest possible font, either 4or 6pt with the cells shrunk to the smallest size. I scanned it super high quality so she can read it, but now she’ll have to zoom in and scroll across slowly in her pdf reader to see each individual time punch. 

We both sign it, and I send it back to her. 

On top of this, there is an on-site visit that “must be” scheduled by the the 16th. NB tells PD that he’s not available til the 20th so she’ll have to wait until then. None of the delays are my fault so I can’t get in trouble or lose the class credit. 


This all happened in the past two days so I will follow up with more details if anyone is interested. Not the most interesting MC but it is so satisfying to go against someone like that. Have not posted here before but lurked for awhile hoping for this chance.


tl;dr: 
my class credit for an internship is being managed by a power trip, and she makes ridiculous request for paperwork formatting. boss joins in on malicious compliance.


EDIT: Nothing has really happened. She has given me credit on blackboard and agreed to what my boss said without replying to my email.. I expect no more future updates. Sorry to disappoint, but the MC was minor to begin with! More like a cool story.."
8p6ac6,1,2018-06-06,Ending on a Low Note: A Dystopian RP [F4M][Para][discord][NSFW][3rd],DarlaLunaWinter,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/8p6ac6/ending_on_a_low_note_a_dystopian_rp/,"**Plot**: It began with a cough; from who doesn’t matter because in four months the U.S Population was cut in half as symptoms advances from coughs to lesions on the lungs, to sepsis, to necrosis, to a slow and painful death over a few hours. The borders closed. Millions died and now the estimates the half of that half are dead, leaving 81,425 million. It’s been three months since that number and most estimates state the U.S population is now around 20,356 million people. Everyone would like to think the survivors are immune, but no one really knows and people suspected of being ill have been killed by mobs. Scattered along the Eastern U.S are cities filled with the dead and the immune animals who consume their flesh. Neighborhoods have banded together, struggling to survive on lonely isolated blocks. Gangs and militias run whole towns. The remnants of the government are trying to rebuild with the military. For those just trying to survive these factions ,and their paranoia, could be the key to survival or a fate worse than death.

Your story begins in a world that no longer exists. Maybe your past left you thrilled to leave it behind, or maybe you carry the dead with you. One thing is for certain…you don’t plan on dying anytime soon. So now your story continues on at the end of a sweltering summer in a hostile world. Will you make your mark in rebuilding the world or fade away as another soul lost in a sea of the dead?

Genre: Dystopian world, shortly after the fall of the U.S.A. I would also be willing to incorporate cyberpunk themes and aesthetic over time. My average post is at least a paragraph or 5 sentences (with some exceptions), but I can easily do up to 6 paragraphs.

**Style/Limits**: This is an RP that can be both humorous and extremely dark, but has realistic sort of progression.This RP will involve subterfuge, diplomacy, and pushing characters to their limit. After all, who doesn’t love a challenge? Together we can shape this world as we'd like.

As a partner I will be respectful both of your boundaries. Serious or traumatic themes are welcome, but over the course of the RP it’d be best to discuss certain themes happening before introducing those themes to the present action. Also I’m in my twenties and expect my RP partners to be 19+, please respect that. 

**Romance**: On that same note, I am a sucker for romance and sensuality. It’s really satisfying when characters build relationships over time that reflects the characters. Some characters may hop into bed on day one, but others have a chaste romance for months before getting physical. I’m really interested in character development and exploring relationships between characters. With that said I don’t mean only romantically. I like having all kinds of characters, and would like a partner open to playing more than one character. 

I usually main female characters with my primary character being a black female. However, I do occasionally have male characters as secondary/mains. Also I am more than open to designing characters together to share with my partners.

**Time Frame**: An important note to me is that both of us recognize that we have lives and obligations. I am a grad student, a mentor, an intern, and have a lot of responsibilities. In the past I’ve had RP partners lose their dang minds if I wasn’t online whenever they wanted, and that’s not something I have patience to deal with anymore. I would love it if we could get a good session of a few hours throughout the week, but I am more than fine having it where “We reply whenever we can”. If something comes up then tell me. If you lose interest tell me. If you want to try and work out a specific time for us to RP then let’s talk about it. This shouldn’t be stressful for either of us. It should be fun.

**Flexibility is policy with me, and if you have any suggestions, questions, or concerns please PM me!**

My kinks include public, cheating, humiliation, forced, tit play, cum play, clothes ripping, smacking \(nothing to serious\), mysteries, surprises, etc. Limits : Scat and Blood. A couple of the roleplays are not my idea's but I have received permission from the original posters.

Please message with detail \(Don't just message Hey\), provide your own contribution to the following scene or else your like everybody else. Some of these reference pictures are not me.

Feel free to message me on my kik @BustyChessika

please understand they I have a very busy schedule and I try to respond when I can.

1. My husband and I are taking nude pics of me at the beach, just a hobby of his he talked me into. When a man or men approach us of sight of my voluptuous body. http://imgur.com/THfy5xy
2. At a nude beach, it's clear that I don't belong with my boyfriend as I turn heads while he hangs his in shame, his little dick drooping between his legs. It doesn't take long before I get propositioned by more than one man with a thick, hard cock that stands straight out for me. How long can you hold out before agreeing to a handjob, a little head, or a lot of sex or maybe I don't agree and they rape me?
3. I've always loved break\-in stories, where you play a burglar that crashes into my home and catches my boyfriend and I in bed. Deciding to force yourself in and join in on the fun, tie my boyfriend up in the corner and he's forced to watch as I get raped.
4. My boyfriend is overseas, but I make plans to travel to surprise him. Arriving, though, my plan falls apart \- not only did the airline lose everything but my lingerie bag, but my boyfriend is out on a deployment for the forseeable future! All I can do is wait at base until he gets back, but surrounded by plenty of horny men who would love to get a piece of my ass, I may not last long...
5. My boyfriend is a reporter who follows the local sports team. Rushing down to the locker room to get some interviews, I get left behind as the game starts, locked into the sweaty room filled with clothes. Forced to wait until the men return after the game, my boyfriend will be too busy chasing a scoop to come save me. Will I willingly end up fucking a few of the studs? Are they so pissed about an ugly loss that they hold me down and rape me until they feel better? Who knows!
6. My boyfriend and I decide to recreate a intense sex experience that I had with my ex, we shamelessly fuck in a cab. But he just can't get the job done. be spontaneous you can play multiple men fucking me against my will, my cab driver, my ex or create your own character. Just anyone but the boyfriend you can either cuck him or have him thrown out of the cab. As I get either raped or fucked \(gotta make it realistic and seductive\). [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgg26RHAyDR/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgg26RHAyDR/) [https://www.instagram.com/p/BggKA\_pAmLj/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/p/BggKA_pAmLj/?hl=en)
7. I show up to my boyfriend's family party and instantly all his cousins and other family members are giving me looks, specifically the boys giving me naughty looks. Eventually the males try to lure me to go into the secluded pool in the backyard but only one thing I am not wearing any underwear.
8. After a cruise ship sinks a woman and \(one or multiple men\) wash up on a deserted island being barely clothed after a while of being on the island the man/men grow hornier and hornier in the presence of this big titted voluptuous woman in their presence.
9. Thick, Voluptuous Singer Ashanti is super bitchy and a drama queen, constantly bare\-backing her intern assistant who is trying to remain faithful to his wife. Eventually the security team, or the higher ups at the label get sick of this and gives her what she deserves even if she doesn't want it.
10. A young woman happily married in a small town filled with huge cocked boys, possibly at every corner. She goes on a day in her life and is constantly getting ravaged and raped. And when she goes to the big dicked cops, nothing really happens there to help her. And when she goes home seeing her husband still not home from work, son asleep but his friends wide awake it's not comforting. \(Please be creative with this one\)
11. You wake up hear annoyingly loud music blaring from my backyard, where I'm sunbathing.....nude. You decide to punish me, forcefully, for interrupting your rest.
12. It's prom night and I definitely chose the wrong dress to wear. Maybe I'm trying something new or it was on complete accident. \(You can send a link of the dress you want me in and we go from there\)
13. My Dad being a detective as he put a guy away years ago as he was a serial rapist as he had a deformity which made his cock very long, thick, and odd looking as well as he had a sack filled with more than just 2 testicles as he usually would drown his victims in all his odd smelling and extremely thick cum, as he now got released and he wants revenge. Maybe he saw me as a child during the case with my overdeveloped body constantly fantasizing about what I would become. Maybe not!
14. My husband has some friends over, my son has some friends over and a washing machine malfunction destroys all my decent clothes, except for my one piece swimsuit that covered very little. [https://i.pinimg.com/736x/40/cc/54/40cc540b43e25e169d1281d005d8a191\-\-girl\-watches\-dark\-angels.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/40/cc/54/40cc540b43e25e169d1281d005d8a191--girl-watches-dark-angels.jpg)
15. Hottest day in the summer, heat wave surrounding the city and the outer rural area's people have been advised to stay hydrated and stay indoors, unfortunately I have to be somewhere driving my car frantically no gas station open in site. My car heating up fast, thinking of my limited options I take a shortcut through the forest ruraly area's but then my car breaks down and my phone dies. Time is running out before I pass out and I see a ravine leading down to a pond.
16. I’m on a tour of a prison for one of my criminal justice classes when some oil in the prison pipes spray me wanting to get cleaned up I separate from my group. Going to the prison showers and rinsing my body off the oil. When finished I couldn't find my clothes I get lost while looking for them and my class, and you stumble upon me.
17. Naughty Halloween party at least that's what my invitation said so! I come dressed as a big titty angel \(inspired by true events\) let's see what happens.
18. We are at your parents house in your old room, fucking. I clearly fake my moans and you are just not getting the job done, your hung dad comes in and does the job you can never do by raping me. \(you can play either roles or both\)
19. You break into my house, I am in my bath listening to music through headphones I don't notice you take my clothes when I don't notice out of the bathroom leaving me with a little towel. \(Watch : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cisN1tf7rbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cisN1tf7rbY)\)
20. Corrupt cops take advantage of innocent busty victim
21. Nude model gets more what she bargains for at sleazy photo shoot.
22. Your idea(s)

**Inside the HGEU**

* **MOT**- Shills a Bluetooth speaker HARD, he plants both of his knees on the carpet, clears his throat and sucks this things dick for a one minute and 54 seconds. This company must have given him incredible terms, Vid actually starts at 1:55. Shows RB26 it’s sicc, no way around it, goes into more detail about why he abandoned forty eight hour build due to his Autism and OCD. No doubt when the car is finished in 2020 it will be awesome. He does throw a wheel and NISMO gauge cluster in it. He picks up the Toyota Truck that had the frame replacement and talks about potentially powdercoating some shit and throwing a thorough detail on it before he posts it on Bring a Trailer. 

* **Mr. Oakes**-  He did some research and decides to boost the M50 that’s already in his car. He dives right in and tears the front end off and starts mocking it up. Didn’t hype it for 2 weeks just got the supercharger and then next vid starts putting it on, like a fucking man. Grit and Intern make an on camera appearance. The longing in the intern’s eye to share a shop with a knowledgeable respectful person that doesn’t do accents is fervent, you can feel it through the screen. All these people coming to Jimmy’s shop confirms my theory that he has the automotive Kavorka, ""the lure of the animal” that other CT mechanics find irresistible. Vid cuts to B.Halls shop and they do S U B F R A M E stuff on B. Hall’s mechanic special Beemer. All the Tommy hangs have got Jimmy hankering for subframes and powdercoating. 

* **Haggard North**- More Moving. The intern pulls double duty and gets his second feature of the day in the north video. He really is doing the stuff interns do. Damian unloads on the neighborhood that the garbage barn is in. Lots of “this guy” and “this other guy” and “this crackhead” and all these hoodrat stories of what’s been going on. Damian executes the Haggard Exit Procedure perfectly, he really gets it. Perfect Haggard exit procedure requires that you take a huge dump on whatever you are letting go of and explain to the humble viewer how bad it is. Very important when taking said dump that you have lots of conflicting footage of you giving the thing you say sucks balls now a firm handjob a few months earlier. I think deep down Damian is in fear because he knows if he doesn’t get this channel to stabilize he’s headed back to the garbage barn in real life. Video cuts to new shop and Damian doesn’t mention the wall but does mention a loft going in. Bets on if he lives there low key? Video then cuts to him back at the garbage barn doing garbage barn things like installing a set of old rockford 12’s in Mercedes trunk. Accents come out STRONG, he can’t help himself, so many. He promises the LS 350Z will run and drive in the next vid. This is a skip. 

***Outside the HGEU***


* **Cleetus**- Promotes his tuner Jeremy’s new youtube channel. He revealed an LS powered Miata that Jeremy has been secretly building for the last 3 years and it’s Vin Diesal RX-7 Hero Car Status, it FUCC’s hard. Taylor Ray remember what this LS Miata looks like because if you ever see it wheel around the corner you need to hide. Your Miata isn’t in the same universe as this one. The main focus of the Vid is Leroy getting a new set of turbski’s. Cleetus is ditching the 64/66’s with the larger back housing and going to a new set of Precision 68/70’s. Shooting for 1400hp and 7’s. 

* **Boosted Boiz**- Gofundme update at [$57,000](https://www.gofundme.com/help-brent-get-a-new-shop)

* **The Smoking Tire**- I’m gay for [22re Toyota Trucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIcboNvx8qc) and a prime example was on One Take. If you don’t appreciate 22re 5-speed Toyota Trucks in the words of ThomasFyeah “just click that X in the top right corner of your screen”.

* **M.C.M**.- Does a talking video but it doesn’t suck. Discuss import costs, build costs, timeline of builds with shooting and editing, insurance cost, car building philsophy and sponsors. If you are at all intrigued by the “back end” of youtubers or all the things we don’t see on camera this is a great vid. MCM picked up Ryobi as a full sponsor (You Mad Mondrose?) and now the biggest question is should I commit to a Ryobi Cordless Life? I’m looking for a cordless ecosystem to buy into but I’m scared. MCM made me feel safe with Ryobi, does Ryobi suck balls and because I’m a weekend warrior I don’t know better? **INFORM ME**.

* **LZ**- Starts with some BMX shit and then cuts to Alberto diagnosing a wiring issue on THICCOLE’s car. Papa Boost and LZ determine that LZ’s Chow Schulman shorted out the car when he pressure washed the engine. Car gets fixed and LZ mic’s up the exhaust to see if it sounds like his Japanese car. Car breaks down shortly after and he tows it back home with his Z. Short Vid 6 and change. Probably skip it.

8p807q,200,2018-06-07,the MunchHam (originally a comment on another thread),katerosetyler,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/8p807q/the_munchham_originally_a_comment_on_another/,"Location: California

Offender: Munch(ausen's) Ham

Me: first-year medical student raised by two doctors that have been doctors for 30+ years. I know some shit, specifically a lot of shit about the human body and not much else about anything. book-smart, real-life-retarded. how do you change a tire?

I used to work at a pizza delivery place in Southern California in a very wealthy suburb in a wealthy part of San Diego that (generally) tipped well with a colorful cast of coworkers, and was always good for a shitty customer story perpetrated by a Soccer Mom driving a Mercedes SUV bigger than my house to tote her Brayden/Jayden/Aiden and Kinsleigh to soccer practice just to ignore them to online shop with her workaholic husband's credit card that he gave her just to avoid spending time with her. these women were everywhere, by the way. venturing into one particular suburb was surreal. me, a heavily tattooed/pierced, generally-scary-looking human being trolling the aisles of Target was usually given a wide berth due to my appearance and resting bitch face. always a fun social experiment to see how many side-eyes I could get on a single outing. today, an old lady scoffed at me in line at the grocery store when I thanked her for putting the divider down between her stuff and mine. it's fun.

anyway, one of my coworkers was the 300lb, 5'5 MunchHam. A hypochondriac that bragged about calling the paramedics to her house at least once a week (called them to work twice) being on a ""no-narcotics list"" at the hospital, being ""mistreated"" by her ""asshole surgeon"", and a whole host of other things that are not badges of honor and left me wondering why someone would brag about this kind of shit. still doesn't make sense regarding most of the human population with dignity and a sense of humility, but considering her personality, it makes a little bit of sense.

in 2016, MunchHam broke her ankle. to be specific, a relatively common fracture of the ankle variety: a lateral malleolus fracture, which is part of the anterior/posterior distal tibia. this kind of fracture, and ankle breaks in general, usually necessitate surgery with internal fixation; titanium screws. titanium is one of the hardest metals available for consumers and used for medical implants. all my piercings are made out of titanium. titanium is not ferromagnetic and does not set off metal detectors, nor does it respond to the massive magnets in an MRI. the integrity of titanium is relevant, I promise.

how did she break this ankle? she CLAIMS that she broke this ankle falling off the toilet. at work. she called an ambulance for that too, but that was probably the one legitimate occurrence cause nobody wants to lift a 300lb, pantsless hamplanet off the floor of a dirty bathroom. however, her version of the truth has always been somewhat exaggerated so I don't know how true that is. she claims she landed on her ankle and broke it. that's some Ham Acrobatics right there. I'm convinced she's got osteoporosis cause that doesn't happen to a healthy person with healthy bones. (make your kids drink milk or give them calcium pills. bones are important y'all). 

after her surgery, she didn't go to PT. she complained of chronic pain that is the result of not going to PT, went back to high-intensity workouts too soon and SHATTERED the titanium screws and needed MORE surgery. she broke ALL FOUR TITANIUM SCREWS. SHE FUCKING BROKE THEM IN HALF. TITANIUM. she proudly showed the x-ray on her phone around to anyone who would look. I looked, out of sheer curiosity and morbid fascination. and of course, evidence. *insert tapping temple meme*

by the way, I don't know why she works out. she's not losing weight. she was the same exact size the whole 2 years I knew her. she would regularly uberEATS Wendy's/equally trashy food from a place less than a 15-minute round trip from work (mind you our breaks were 30 minutes and delivery takes 30+ so she'd regularly clock back in and eat on the clock and ignore responsibilities, not to mention the money she's spending, inflated item prices + $5 delivery), or go next door to 7-11 and get two hot dogs or some other mystery meat of the day and a large amount of candy and ALWAYS, ALWAYS with the big gulp of non-diet Mountain Dew. don't forget the ""inspirational"", slightly-SJW Instagram that promotes healthy lifestyle and weight loss and 'gymming'. the facebook was a whole other shitshow. I haven't accepted her friend request. it's been rotting in my inbox for over a year. I don't need to. my roommate and former coworker has her on fb and it's like watching a semi-literate monkey with no filter in a zoo scrawl crazed thoughts on a whiteboard. free entertainment.

anyway, of course four broken, raw-edge titanium screws would cause anyone pain so she goes back into surgery to have them fixed. also, she's considered low-income so she gets cheap health insurance (CoveredCA here) that covers ALL of this nonsense. I've never been one to use the phrase ""as a taxpayer"" because usually when I hear somebody say that, it's coming out of the mouth of a 50-something baby boomer that thinks millennials are spoiled, entitled brats, that Trump is the second coming of Jesus, immigrants are ruining this country, the whole nine yards. but AS A TAXPAYER, I hate this woman. not cause she's fat. because she's a horrible person. important distinction.

she's also a low-level semi-functional narcotics addict. of course they give you a narcotic script post-op, but she's literally an addict. she openly pops pills in front of everyone and does the 'look at me' sigh like it's such a hassle. she pulled this shit with me, in front of me. I was standing at the label printer at work around 8pm, doing labels, minding my own goddamn business, when I hear this long-suffering sigh off to my left. I side-eye as best I can and she sees it cause she was watching me like a hawk for any kind of reaction, gets what she wants, and says ""I wish I didn't have to take SO MANY PILLS to help me sleep. god, why can't my body work properly?"" and pops like three pills (no doubt a narcotic, maybe a benzo, and maybe an anti-inflammatory or a steroid) and washes them down with non-diet mountain dew. every god damn day she'd drink an entire giant gulp or whatever the medium-to-large size was full of non-diet mountain dew. I did not give her an inch. I went back to what I was doing and once she realized she wasn't getting anything from me, she just left.

I'd also like to add at this point that I myself have a whole slew of health issues that have necessitated extensive hospitalizations and the total amount of drugs I've had to take and am currently still taking are worth more than my mom's house. I hear my lungs are pretty good looking though. my cardiac surgeon says so. AND I'm ever thankful for my mom's health insurance otherwise I would most certainly be dead. But I don't broadcast it nor do I base my entire identity around being ill. She thinks we're Pals™ because she overheard me talking about my body's proclivity for attempting to throw in the towel randomly and without warning and I had to give her a stiff talking to as to not open her fat mouth about it. I appear able-bodied at this point but there will be a day that I don't. miss me with that sympathetic shit though, you miserable bitch. I will die jumping out of a plane before I die in a hospital bed. Fuck you. 

I digress. I'm sorry. Continued:

I'm almost positive it's illegal to be at work under the influence of anything. It is, right? do prescription pills count? Remember, this was a pizza place. She was a driver. She 100% drove while on Percocet multiple times. She also came into work one day bragging about buying morphine pills off 'a friend' for ~$10/pill. She doesn't have any bills. She lives with her disabled, retired parents (good source of drugs too, I'm sure). She's 35. Her mom drove her to work 45+ minutes away against traffic every day during the tail end of my employment. She can't drive (doctor's orders) because her ankle is busted. of course that's the one instruction she follows cause she loves being a victim. Her parents bought her a car. She also parks in the disabled spot at work (she has a placard, for what I wonder? /s) and doesn't move the car for her entire shift. She works inside cause she can't drive (but broke the doctor's orders to drive to work). So she doesn't leave for 5-8 hours at a time. This happened after the first surgery when she was still driving and delivering intermittently (and popping Percocet &amp; Vicodin; ""my favorite"" like they were candy). her selective following of rules and mental gymnastics to justify those things was mind-boggling. of course, that was why she ordered delivery food every day. can't drive. doctor's orders. 

By the way, the parking lot is minuscule. There are like three disabled spots. relatively busy shopping center in a retirement community town. there are DEFINITELY people who need that spot more than her. btw, the farthest spot is less than 500 feet away. She doesn't even have to work! In America, being fat (how fat? I don't know) is a disability. You can GET disability for it. her ankle also qualifies. Nobody knew why she was there. Again, she has a disabled placard so the DMV and her doctor classify her as disabled. getting government assistance wouldn't be a stretch.

My FAVORITE part: she blames her orthopedic surgeon for 'fucking her up for life', as if orthopedic surgeons are crackpots that aren't in one of the most competitive fields in medicine and didn't go through one of the most intensive and rigorous internships and residencies there is. no, nothing is her fault ever and it's her surgeon's fault she can't work out anymore and 'lose more weight' so she's gonna get Medicare/MediCal/whatever the fuck it's called to cover her gastric bypass. still waiting on that gastric bypass, by the way. do you know why? the show My 600lb Life is accurate in their portrayal of the weight-loss surgery process. every single gastric surgery candidate is REQUIRED to follow a nutritionist's diet before surgery to be approved. she does not, but assumes nobody knows that so she makes up all kinds of reasons why she hasn't gotten the surgery yet, all of them blaming medical personnel and how they're all out to get her. I never said anything cause I loved the excuses and stories. I'd poke the ham/bear from time to time, and I'm pretty good at being two-faced when I know the real story and I just like hearing lie fodder. ""so, MunchHam, how's 'gymming'? has your doctor approved you for the gastric sleeve yet?""

I think that's it. I tried not to exercise ""my creative writing skills"", so dear mods: I apologize if you think this is flowery. I tried not to be boring, or hateful of fat people, I dislike this woman because she discredits medical science, of which I am forever thankful to and passionate about, and blames her issues on everyone else. this is like a hybrid Munchausen's/Hamplanet story, hence the story of MunchHam.

Edits: grammar, a word here and there, bared less of my personal shit on the internet and summarized it better. I posted this under my main so I wonder what I'll wake up to. "
8p8gxa,4,2018-06-07,Any resources for weaning Java folks away from interop over-reliance and onto Clojure idioms?,joinr,Clojure,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/8p8gxa/any_resources_for_weaning_java_folks_away_from/,"I've got a good intern over the summer; this is my second time working with him.  Dude's productive, a quick study, and mostly on board with lisp, functional programming, etc.  Unfortunately, I think his recent initial solutions are often derived from StackOverflow or other resources, and they end up full of needless Java interop calls.  Things like calling .toString instead of just using str.  

To date, I'm reviewing commits and commenting with suggestions and changes to exploit Clojure idioms.  Are there any resources out there for folks (i.e. university students) who are still hanging onto the Java edge of the pool?  Like comparing what you're used to in Java, and then cleaning it up in one fell swoop with a Clojure idiom?

I can usually catch this after the fact, but it'd be nice to provide an independent reference, if one exists, so he can learn on his own.  Thanks!"
8p9hxb,0,2018-06-07,[F4A] Magical consent is great.,h425213,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8p9hxb/f4a_magical_consent_is_great/,"Hi dpp, I'm looking for someone to play a hypnosis rp. I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before try before."

8patys,56,2018-06-07,My boyfriend (22M) won’t move in with me. Are my (21F) expectations unrealistic?,throw_problemaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8patys/my_boyfriend_22m_wont_move_in_with_me_are_my_21f/,"First, let me start this out by saying that’s probably not the best title to this, but bare with me please!

Some important background information: My boyfriend and I met online about 6 years ago. We were just friends at first but it quickly became something more. When we finally made it official we were in a long distance relationship for about two years before I decided to move to his state to be with him. I uprooted my whole life. I left all of my family behind, all of my friends, my job, I had just finished getting a degree. I moved here for him. I got a new job that I love, I attend school full time and I really like it here besides the fact that it’s been difficult to make new friends. I’ve been here about a year and a half. 
I don’t regret moving here. I want to make that clear.

My boyfriend just graduated university (yay!). He just got an internship at an amazing company, too. We are all super proud of him. 
Here’s the problem. My boyfriend moved back in with his parents after graduation. (His school was about 2 hours away from the city we live in). He never really gives me a reason. He says it’s just what he’s used to and now with his internship it’s a closer drive if he stays there.
BUT. It’s really not.

I live about 30-40 minutes away from my boyfriend’s family, depending on traffic. Picture a capital L. The short line is the distance from his parents house to his internship. The long line is the distance from my apartment to his internship. The way he gets to work from his parents has sooo much traffic every day and it takes him about 15 minutes. My apartment is clearly further away but there is no traffic so it would take him 20 minutes. I’ve showed him this. I guess it finally clicked for him because he said I was right and he packed up some stuff and moved them into my apartment. That was a month ago. Except he still only comes over about once a week on the weekend. I’m just super irritated and I don’t know if I’m allowed to be. I moved my whole life to be here with HIM and he can’t “move” 5 minutes away to be with me? I also want to make it clear that this isn’t an issue of him not being ready to live with me. When I moved here, since I had to find an apartment and get settled and everything, I lived with him in his apartment near University for about 6 months and everything went perfectly. Even when he was living near University, I drove 2 hours there and back almost every single weekend to be with him. I’m busy with my school and job too, but I found a way to make it work because it was important to me. There has also been talk of marriage in the future but I just don't see how he can even bring the topic up when he won't make the step to move in with me.

This obviously isn’t the whole issue but the main thing I’m concerned about it not being a priority to him. Every time I try to make plans with him he tells me he has to do something for his family. His mom needs help setting up a computer. His dad needs help working on the car. His brother needs help applying for colleges. His sister needs help with her homework. I’m glad my boyfriend is family-oriented. I am too. The reason it makes me mad is because yesterday I asked him if he was coming over this weekend and he said “maybe. I’ll have to see if anything else comes up.” … Exactly those words. I did a double-take reading it. It just made me feel like I was the last resort. He can’t even make plans with me because something better or more important might come up. We’ve talked about this. He said it’s just because his family is super needy and he has to be there to help… but he’s a grown adult man. He won’t be living at home forever helping with every little thing. I just want him to realize I’m trying to start a life with him. I moved here to be with him, not to see him once a week even though we live super close now. 

I don’t know, Reddit. I just want to know if I’m being selfish and crazy. I see his shirts in my closet and his shampoo in my shower every day and it makes me mad because he’s not making an effort to be with me in the way I made an effort to be with him. I know family is important and I’m not trying to take that away from him, but just once I want to be his priority.

tldr: Boyfriend doesn’t make an effort to see me. I feel like I’m not a priority in his life.

Hi reddit, I'm devastated. Apologies for the wall of text to come.

I have been with my boyfriend Chris for 6 years now. We've been so in love this entire time, or at least I thought. We've never had an argument that has lasted for more than an hour, we communicate well and make an amazing team. I helped him through addiction and he was there for me through some of the worst times of my life.

Recently Chris was offered a two-week internship in Spain. We were both so excited! I was so happy for him because I knew how hard he had worked to get this. We had a trip planned to visit our potential new home state once he got back. Also, we just moved in to our first place together two days before he left. Before he left for Spain, he told my parents he was going to ask to marry me on our planned trip. I know this because I walked in on them all crying and hugging each other and my mom kept saying how happy she was for us.

Chris leaves for Spain, everything is fine and normal for the first few days. He is the only guy in his group of 20 interns, but I trusted him and wasn't worried at all. He facetimes me with everyone, they all seem super sweet. About a week into it, I start getting suspicious. We share a google photos account, so I got a notification of some pictures that were taken. Him and this girl Bethany are cuddled up together on the couch, hugging in front of beautiful buildings, just taking extremely couple-y photos. I don't want to seem overly jealous, but I'm very concerned, so I text him and confront him about it. He says she's just her best friend on this trip and that they're good friends. Okay, sure, whatever. Then I see that they are going on dates with eachother. Actual dinner dates. Wine and dine type of shit. Now I'm furious. I send him another very long text, telling him I understand that crushes are normal, and he's in a very romantic place with cute girls but this is very obviously crossing a line. I ask him if something's there, if he wants to date her. And he tells me, honestly yes, the thinks it ""might be worth trying out.""

Obviously I am heartbroken. I haven't eaten in days, I cry every waking moment of the day. My boss sent me home from work because I looked so sick. We JUST moved in together, he literally told my family he was going to propose once he got back. We have cats and dogs together. We've been through hell and back together. And this is what I get in return. Some girl he's known for two weeks is worth throwing away everything we've built? I feel like I'm living in a nightmare, but I can't wake up from this one. I never thought this would ever happen, I trusted him since the beginning.

He gets home in two days and we take our trip the day following. I don't know what to do. We aren't broken up at this point, but I know it has to happen. Do I still take this trip and just go out and do stuff by myself? Because even once we break up, I still want to move out to this state, and I still want to take this time to find areas to live.

TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 years goes to Spain for two weeks, meets a cute girl and decides to throw away everything we've built together."

Need resources and ideas on how to build custom tank for semi-aquatic turtle. 

So I’ve had a female RES for around 6 years. I found her in my backyard after she got pumped through our irrigation from a canal. She was no more than a couple inches long at the time. I started her off in a 20 gal tank, and moved her up to a 55 gal after a year or so.

I left her with my in-laws while I traveled out of state for a couple of internships, and now having settled down in Florida, I want to bring her with me.

But I found out she’s gotten HUGE. She’s over 7 inches long, and too big for her tank now. I want to have a new tank ready for her when I bring her to Florida. I’ve looked online and at PetSmart/Petco, but I haven’t found anything in my area that is any bigger than a 55 gal.

I decided I wanted to build a tank myself. 75 gal at least, probably bigger. I have access to a few sheets of acrylic from my place of work, but I want to know what other materials I would need to start building.

Can anyone provide me with any links or advice on where to start? Also, share pictures of your custom builds; I’d love to gather some inspiration."

I'm aware this is a long shot and a bit naive but I have decided to do a last minute trip to the Grand Canyon. I am a Landscape Architecture student and have three days of summer before my summer internship starts and the Grand Canyon is a 7 hour drive And I have never seen it. I can't imagine dying and never seeing it.

Of course I do not have a permit, I have familiarized myself with the last minute permit procedure and have called the information office and talked with them. 

I am here to ask if anyone has a permit, and would be willing to let me tag along. I could be part of the group or hike 15 minutes ahead or behind, I just really want to make this happen.

 If this is not viable, what would sway you into letting someone join your group at the permit line? I'm thinking show up in proper attire, early, with a box of doughnuts or muffins and trying to sway people.

Barring I get to join a group day one, I guess I get a number for the next day and try to do a overnight on Tuesday (at whatever location I can get half way down) and day hike on Monday.

Thank you very much,

And be gentle this is my first post"

8pcoae,3,2018-06-07,"Girlfriend (23/F) always gets mad at me (24/M) when anything involves another girl, whether I know that girl or not. This has lead to constant fighting, we need help..",MaleficentPay4,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8pcoae/girlfriend_23f_always_gets_mad_at_me_24m_when/,"Last night was a bad one and it has left me in a very tough place as I need to make some decisions because our lease agreement is almost up and we have to renew together or I am going to move back home.

Background: My girlfriend and I started dating a little over two years ago while we were at school. I was finishing up my last classes preparing to graduate and working my internship while she was just wrapping up her last classes for the semester as well. Over the course of that last year together we were with each other ALL THE TIME. Most of my friends had moved away and we were really the only people we hung out with. But we were OK with that because we enjoyed every second of each other's company. It's not that we were anti social or anything, we were just too focused on each other to really give any one else much attention. Now, here is where the real issue in our relationship began. My girlfriend and her roommates were all close friends before I met her and they hung out all the time. Eventually my girlfriend stopped hanging out with them since I was more involved with her. She had this one roommate that she stopped getting along with (however they would always go back and forth with how they felt about each other). One day, that roommate had asked our group chat if anyone had any adderall, so I told my girlfriend that I could give her roommate one and she said No. Do not give her one. Now I am a really passive guy and I hate being mean to other people for no reason so I decided one day as I was leaving for work, to just drop her roommate one as I was walking out the door. Big mistake. I had thought they would eventually become friends again and it wouldn't matter so giving her an adderall wouldn't be a big deal. Nope. The following few days were fine until her roommate texted me how much I wanted for the Adderall and I said I didn't need anything when I had originally told my girlfriend that if I gave it to her roommate I would have charged her for it, which I didn't. Ever since then she would make me do petty things like go into the kitchen while all of them were cooking and demand money from her roommate or she would kick me out/break up with me. The pettyness would ensue and it eventually turned into one night where she came home drunk yelling in my ear for some reason while I was sleeping and ended up in her hitting me in the face a couple times once I called her out for being mad about this adderall thing because she ultimately thought I just wanted to get with her roommate that whole time. Which only seemed that way because I gave her roommate an adderall and didn't ask for money. Jealousy seemed to play a major role in all of this. 

So this was the really the beginning. Ever since that situation any encounter that I have with a girl has been scary for me. She questioned everyone I was following on Instagram, Twitter, notifications I got on Facebook via my phone, like I remember this one time I got a Facebook notification randomly from someone I have never talked to that said ""Say Hi to blah blah blah"" and she questioned why I got that notification. On instagram, she would ask why I needed to follow this or that girl if we weren't even close friends... these were girls I just went to high school with and we were friends at one point but just kind of fell off come college, time went by, etc. basically they weren't very important to me and I didn't REALLY need to keep in touch with them. So she would ask me to explain why I needed to keep following this or that person but I never really had a valid reason obviously and she made me unfollow them. I eventually just unfollowed every girl on my instagram to prove a point that I didn't care about who I was following because I had accidentally been following people I had previous relationships with / she thought they were a slut and didn't like them. She eventually just deleted my Instagram out of frustration when we broke up and got back together after like 24 hours and I followed people back that I was originally following. Long story short, I don't have an Instagram anymore, which I could honestly care less about. There has also been times at the bar for example where she has told me to just make out with her there if I loved her infront of like all of my friends because she got mad that I said hi to an old friend that was a girl and apparently my friend gave her some rude look across the bar when she probably did not but who knows, either way, she would pester me to remove these people from my phone contacts and cut all these ties with old friends that I grew up with. I can't remember the last time I talked to a girl that wasn't one of my girlfriends close girlfriends. I don't risk talking to my friends out of fear of what is going to happen. These instances have sometimes divulged in her hitting me here and there threatening rape, calling the cops, domestic violence accusations, etc. It has been a mess. I could go on and on with stories but it's just so redundant at this point. Do this if you love me... If you love me then you'll say that to her, if you don't unfollow her you're hooking up with her, etc.

Fast forward to the other night now with a couple situations that ocurred whilst playing Xbox. So I followed a girl streamer on Youtube and I hit subscribe on her channel. I guess she was one of the only few people I subscribed to on Youtube since I never really subbed to anyone but since Fortnite came out I have been watching a lot of streamers recently play the game. One night, we were browsing youtube together and a notification for this girl's stream came up. She goes ""who the fuck is that!?!?!"" so I show her the stream and everything and she is lividddd because I will watch this girl play Fortnite but I won't watch her. So she makes me unsub, un follow her on Xbox, twitter, etc. I was like whatever lol I don't really care but she got mad because I said this girl was actually better than me (she has more Solo wins than I do even though I have more wins total). So she was accussing me for lying because I said she has more wins than me when she actually didn't and I didnt make the differentiation between Solos vs Total. My point is, she get's super specific to the point of which I ""lied"" about and constantly tries to call me a liar like I want to hook up with this random youtube game streamer. Another incident that happened yesterday was I was playing xbox and doing a looking for group where I eventually partied up with another girl. We played for a while which I thought was like an hour or so but it was apparently longer than that around the 2\-3 hour mark. Either way I told my girlfriend we had only played for an hour. So she stumbles across that I had added another girl on Xbox and she starts questioning who this girl is, has me remove her, block her on xbox, etc. because I didn't ask my girlfriend to play with us since she is looking for other girls to play with on xbox too. Now she constantly makes these remarks like oohhh well you don't wanna play with me because I don't have 200 wins, or you'll call this or that at for her probably. Or is it because I'm not her blah blah blah. Then she'll say she's going to play xbox with other girls or make remarks about going to play xbox with this guy she hooked up with before even though he plays on PS4 but she just says these kind of things to make me mad / jealous. Either way, she accuses me of lying because I didn't notify her that I had another interaction with a girl that she wasn't involved with / knew about. I am lost and need help. We need help. It's not that I lie, I just honestly don't think she'll freak out and don't tell her everything because I don't think I need to. Am I in the wrong? What do I do? Our lease agreement is almost up and I need to make the decision to live together again because I do love this girl but I don't know if this is a healthy relationship or not because I am in the wrong or am I not?

Happy to provide any more details if needed but I would appreciate any sort of feedback at all... Sorry if some of it seems spotty but I was just typing what was on my mind and got kind of emotional / frustrated at points thought typing that...

Thanks everyone, I really appreciate you taking the time to read this though."

I'm more than likely going to start explaining a lot of the circumstances that have put me in this position, but I don't want anyone to think I can't see that I'm responsible for far more than half of all this.

So three years ago, I was working a shitty call center job and was unbelievably depressed. I had gone to college to be a pastor but lost my faith after I graduated, and I felt like I would never have anything resembling the fulfilling career I had imagined all my life. After nearly three years at this job, I started having suicidal thoughts for the first time, and while I never had a plan to take my own life, these thoughts were terrifying, and I finally confessed to my wife, who was pregnant at the time, that I was at the end of my rope. We decided then that I would quit my job and go back to school for my master's in teaching, and for the first time in a while, I felt like things might be okay.  

Spoiler alert, I was very recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and looking back, it began to take control of my life when I started my master's program. I had been something of a stoner since college, which I've realized since then may have contributed to a lot of my mental health issues, and I started smoking so much that I was basically high all the time for about nine months straight.

By the time I started my student teaching internship, which was in a middle school science classroom, I was completely out of control. To make matters worse, my cooperating teacher and I didn't get along. Because I was being endorsed to teach K-8, I needed to complete one of our state's elementary assessments to be certified, and I chose the math assessment, assuming this would be the easiest to integrate into a science lesson. Unfortunately, my cooperating teacher all but refused to let me teach a math/science lesson. Each time I would plan a lesson to teach and film, she would ask me to take out crucial sections, explaining that she was expected to keep pace with the teacher we planned with across the hall. During the last week of school, having filmed a few short segments that were clearly useless, my wife encouraged me to confront her about this and explain that, if I didn't film an actual math lesson right away, I would not be able to teach that fall. She allowed me to film myself explaining for around 5 minutes how the phases of the moon are related to ratios...

During the next few weeks, most of my classmates submitted their assessments, but a combination of my depression and the poor quality of my materials made it incredibly difficult to be productive. I would head to the university to work each day and just sit in front of my computer for sometimes 8 hours, unable to make any progress. I ended up actually getting a job in July, and despite trying my best to get the assessment done before school started, my work ethic didn't improve, and the district was forced to give me an emergency certificate on the condition that I get it done ASAP. Surprise, surprise. Having a job made it tough to work on the assessment every day, so I didn't finish until the beginning of February (I know...), but when I finally turned it in, I felt amazing! 

... But that only lasted a month. Then I got my results back, and whaddaya know, I failed by four points... 

Since then, I decided to start from scratch, which my university assured me was fine, but I've run into so many roadblocks along the way, including some new meds that got me all weird for a few weeks, that I'm only just now getting close to finishing. The next deadline is tonight at midnight, but I got stuck on one task this last Sunday, and despite working late every night since and even taking yesterday off, I haven't been able to get past it. Last night at 2am, it finally became clear that there was no chance of me finishing in time, and unfortunately, the next deadline at the beginning of July wouldn't get me my score back until the end of that month. This is particularly bad because the HR department of my district hit me up about a month ago to ask ""uhhh... are you fucking done yet?"" (obviously paraphrasing), and my principal vouched for me so I could get a new contract... only I told them I would be done by the end of May... When they find out I won't have my scores back until the end of July, which only leaves a month for my university to endorse me (assuming they still will) and for the state to certify me (assuming I pass), I feel like they're going to eliminate any possibility of repeating this whole mess by giving me the boot so they can hire someone legit... It seems like my teaching career may be over and that I've ruined the life I've built with my wife our now 2yr old son... I'm very, very fortunate that my wife is so positive and reminds me constantly that my mental illness is screwing with me, but I don't think I'm imagining this... It all seems pretty cut and dry. 

If you've reached this point, thanks for reading. Hope I didn't come off as too much of an entitled sad-sack. "

It took me 5 years as opposed to 4, and it was a pretty tough time for my immediate family. School was expensive and across the country (didn't come home much), I had a difficult major, and there were lots of obstacles along the way. For the next month or so, I've moved back home with my parents until I start a post\-grad internship that's nearby. I'll be here until September, after which I'll hopefully have a full time job lined up.

Going to college felt different than many of my peers. My mom didn't graduate high school and my dad got his bachelors, but disliked college/school as a system. Rather than go out and fulfill my potential, whatever that may be, my parents' actions and words indicate that they would have rather had me stay in our hometown and build my life there. They were actually really not keen on me going away to school, but they were very supportive while I was there. I really owe them so much because of all their financial and emotional support. It's because of this and the fact that I love them dearly, that I feel a great sense of duty to at least consider their feelings in what I choose to do next (and where I will be).

For more context, both me and my sister moved away around the same time 5 years ago. She got married and ended up moving back to our hometown, so right now we're all together in the same place and it's made everyone so happy (me included).

That being said, my life lies beyond this town. I will always hold it dear in my heart, but my field and life goals can really only be furthered if I move to a big city. That and I'm young and would like to travel, possibly to Japan for work and other places far and abroad. My sister likewise will be leaving in about a year to further her career by getting a PhD. My parents are very straightforward people and it's lead to some statements from them that neither of them want me to move farther than a couple hours away. Not out of malice of course, they just love me and my sister so much and value family highly. I do too, but I just don't feel that should hold me back from my dreams. It feels like my parents view my time at college as a detour, not as a part of my main path. They expected me to come back at some point and stay, and I'm confused as to how I wasn't part of that conversation.

The problem I find is how to approach achieving my goals and dreams while knowing it would make my parents very sad for both children to leave (possibly forever to a far away place). I never thought this would be an issue. My friends' parents never had conversations like these with them, since parents' usually want the best for their children. I would say that sooner than later, I would be making enough money to either fly out to them frequently or maybe help them pay for a residence near me. In the interim though, there's no promise of that. Especially since my parents are on the older side, leaving is tough emotionally.  How could I talk to them and help them see that I love them, but I just can't put my life on hold.

tl;dr: Left for college, now back home for a short time. I want to move for work and to build my life, but my aging parents aren't excited at the prospect of both children being far away forever. I know I have to make a decision, family vs. career, but I'm upset at having to make such a decision and don't know how to rationally discuss this with them."
8pdspu,2,2018-06-07,Depression meds and identity,pieceapizzaplease,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8pdspu/depression_meds_and_identity/,"Hey so I've been suffering with bad depression, anxiety, dpdr, and an eating disorder since I was 14. I am now 24, and have been in therapy for a long time, about 7 years total off and on. I still feel as though I am lost, and every year feels like a new twist or turn. It feels like the second I figure things out, I have a new problem or conundrum. Finally, today, my therapist, who is a social worker, recommended going on medication. She says that it might give me the boost I need with therapy to be able to figure things out. 

This suggestion brought up a number of thoughts in me. First, I feel like medication will make me focus less on my problems rather than allowing me to figure them out. I don't want to just think things are fine when they actually aren't. I want to get to the root of things and actually address them. 

Also, I feel like I'll be changing who I am. Like if I am not my thoughts... who am I? 

Also, I know some people who have meds working for them and it's like they're just freaky happy. I want to be happy, but I'm also okay with recognizing that life ain't perfect. 

At the same time, I just barely slid by in school this year because of my mental problems, and am worried that they will affect my life (now that I have graduated) as a school teacher because I feel so tired and worn down many days. I realize that in some ways, I am not living up to my potential. I used to be the top of my class, and last year, when I was feeling a little bit better, I had received a competitive internship, while this year I just barely passed my final thesis with exactly the score to pass, no more no less.

Those of you who have taken meds, let me know how you feel. Do you feel like yourself? Is life magically better? "

&amp;nbsp;

Hello all! Long-time user on this forum but I haven't been very active lately, as had been busy with school and internships.

&amp;nbsp;

This is my fourth pair of raw denim, I started out with N&amp;F Elephant 4s around winter 2013, then went on to PBJ XX-012s (which I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/4qbbom/pbj_xx012_1_year_5_hand_washes_2_initial_soaks/)), next I had the RgT 14.5oz SK's (will post later), and finally got this pair last summer during Blue Owl's Customer Appreciation Sale.

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, I love how this pair fades. They are totally awesome and fast-fading (I'm not very active as have been very busy with school and working 8 hours/day at a computer), and they surprisingly lose a lot of color from just that! I wore them almost every day minus a few days with shorts, 3 weeks in Hong Kong, and had to sent them to Leslie @ RgT for about 3 weeks total, because the coin pocket rivet kept popping off (my only issue with this pair of jeans; it happened twice and just felt too lazy to re-send to them)

&amp;nbsp;

I am now probably going to hold off wearing them any longer because I've gained some weight and the rise is a bit too small now; it's ball-crushing me now. I just bought a pair of PBJ XX-019BB's Relaxed Taper from Blue Owl's sale as my next black fading pair, and I love them already!

&amp;nbsp;

Not the best photographer, so I decided to take them indoors and outdoors with the best lighting I could find (grey sky day). No fit pics until maybe 2 weeks later as GF is out of town!

Total estimated wear time: 11~ months
5-6~ washes (I don't religiously keep track), first wash around 4 months or so.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me know if you have any questions!
Sizes I wear:

* N&amp;F E4 - size 30

* PBJ XX-012 - size 30

* RgT SK - size 28

* RgT Stealth Stanton - size 27

* PBJ XX-019BB Relaxed Taper - Size 29"
8pekud,153,2018-06-07,Body Betrayal,RuthieRen,Breeding,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breeding/comments/8pekud/body_betrayal/,"So... I'm sitting at my desk, and my body is betraying me. I'm pegging away at the keys and all I can think about is the achey emptiness between my knees. I seem to be doing a little dance routine here.

*Bite Lip. Cross legs. Squeeze thighs. Breathe Deep. Swallow. Repeat.*

God, how I wish to feel firm hands placing themselves on the inside of my knees and slowly pulling them further and further apart. To feel the small rush of air against the bare flesh of my thighs. To feel those hands slip high up my legs, getting closer to where I feel that distinct limbo between completely empty and knowing I'll soon be filled. I need it so much. I'm not sure if a woman should be these aware of the absence of a throbbing cock inside of her.

*Licks lips. Looks around at the busy office to see if anyone can notice the heat on my cheeks or the way my mouth is slightly agape.*

I try to lean forward and focus on my laptop and continue my work; I stop myself by wondering how many months along would I have to be before my baby bump would press against the desk enabling me from typing without having to pull the keyboard closer. I smirk imagining how I would stretch the skirts and blouses I wear now. Some of the buttons would most likely burst or break off with the slightest movement. Then I envision shopping for maternity clothes. *Baby clothes!* I smile thinking of how I would dress my children. *God I hope I carry multiples!!* I slightly groan at my desk and realize I was rubbing my thighs while using their thickness to squeeze my swollen sex underneath the desk.

I feel the wild cat inside of me yowling out in frustration. My eyes begin to scope the office for testosterone bearing males. My eyes have become that of a starving predator. I squint and spot an intern. Younger than I would prefer my breeding studs, but perhaps his stamina can make up for it? I bite my lips and imagine his willingness to give an older woman exactly what shes been needing. Eager to fuck and be a fantasy.

Then a larger frame crosses my vision. I turn and follow the target. I cross my legs at the knees and slide my hand over my mound. I ever so gently stroke my 2 fingers along the thick crotch seam that hides my own slit. I arch my back and grind myself into that seam. I let out a long breathe and close my eyes for a moment. I open them again and assess the man. He seems more suited for a laboring job, or at least his body does. Good genes. I almost practically drool. I feel my nipples harden at the thought of him being a dark, wild thing in the bedroom. Of him being insatiable and always ready to reassert himself as my body's master.

Another man walks by. ""You got it boss!"" I chime it to him and smile as he keeps walking. *Okay, so maybe not that desperate.* The man is nice enough, but he is much older and such a hard ass. I would rather die then fully submit.

I see the glint of gold by the water cooler. *Ahh...* The new guy. Freshly married and with a baby on the way. Could he go two for two? My eyes widen at my thoughts. I can't believe them.

So this is me, at least for about 6 days out of the month. When I'm at peak, when I'm needing to breed more than anything else. I sit at my desk and my body betrays my every thought and silly notion. I should have more reservations, I shouldn't entertain such proclivities. Yet, I lick my lips and lightly stroke my skin and picture the men of the office filling me with their potent, liquid heat. Some are married, some are not. Some worthwhile, and some just a pole upon which to sit. I should have more shame, but every month I get less and less. Every month I think I am one step closer to the next step. No longer being the predator who watches, but the hunter who pounces. To listening to all my bodily instincts and giving in. To becoming a mommy. \&lt;3"
8pezt5,2,2018-06-07,"Moving to Maryland, Working in Fort Meade: Help me Choose Where to Live! Seeking Advice (Long-Post)",BaoBaotheChessPanda,maryland,https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/8pezt5/moving_to_maryland_working_in_fort_meade_help_me/,"Hello! 

Put quite simply, I'll be moving from Pennsylvania to Maryland next month, as I will be starting a new job. (Finally!)

However, I'm having trouble setting my heart on a particular place. I was hoping you guys could share some helpful experience and advice. (Also, I've used the search function, but wanted to get a fresh perspective-- so apologies if this is a post you're used to seeing.) I am familiar with all the areas that people suggest the most. So here are some of the places I'm considering. Hopefully you guys can share some advice!

To preface, an ideal place for me would be an area with plenty of things to do without a car. Going on runs, stepping out of my apartment and walking a couple blocks to a coffee shop and hanging out there, going to bars/brunch places, good nightlife etc., etc. I'm not necessarily a party animal, so nothing crazy every weekend. But I'd like to have the option there when I want it. I'd like to be decently surrounded by others in my age group. (20's, recent college grads)

**DC**
If it was possible, I'd love to live in DC. But, while DC is expensive, I have also heard the commute northward towards Fort Meade will be bad, despite only being like 20 miles away. I have been looking at places such as Hyattsville, Silver Spring, etc., and while they are closer than a more centralized location in DC, I feel the commute would still be too long. Downside of course is the amount of things to do. There's SO much. Plus the metro, which would eliminate the use of a car everywhere. 

**Rockville/Bethesda**
What really kills me about these areas, is that if the traffic and route to Fort Meade was better, I'd live here in a heartbeat. They both seem like lovely areas that I've been to before and am familiar with. However, while they're not particularly ""far"" from Fort Meade, the route which Google Maps cites to take seems to be extremely annoying. So I suppose this is out of the question. It sucks because these areas seem like the perfect blend of nightlife and things to do during the day. 

**Annapolis**
A friend of mine lives here and seems to enjoy it. Rent seems to be a little on the pricey side, but the commute isn't as bad as the previous areas. He noted that it's a bit of a boring place-- more historic and gentrified. I wouldn't have a problem living here because it seems there is a small amount to do downtown, while being in a pretty safe location. 

**NoVa**
Has to be out of the question, surely? Way, way, too far. A bit sad about this because I lived in this area for an internship and really enjoyed it. Oh, well!

**Odenton, Columbia, Annapolis Junction, etc., etc., etc. + (Areas in the middle of DC and Baltimore)**
Perks here are a short commute, quiet living-space with little crime/trouble. However, nightlife and fun things to do seem to be out of the question. I know I can travel to places on weekends, but how viable is that? Rockville and Bethesda are great because they have metro access. These places obviously do not.

**Baltimore**
This is a weird one for me. Baltimore actually does not seem that expensive as other areas closer to Fort Meade. It definitely seems to be less expensive than DC. Also, the amount of things to do in this area are great, especially Mount Vernon, Federal Hill, Fells Point, Canton, etc., etc. Commute-wise, I have been reading mixed reviews. Some say it's not bad at all, while others say its a total bitch. Some downsides to Baltimore I'm apprehensive about are crime and lack of parking. I'd rather not pay 150/month+ for a place to put my car. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So, what do you guys think? Should I forgo the accessibility of things to do and pick a spot closer to work? What other areas have I not named? Or, will living in Baltimore or a suburb of DC not be as bad as I imagine commute-wise? 

Thanks so much for all help in advance!"

I'm a female college student, studying topics that I'm really passionate about. I'm definitely the type of person who is really dedicated to my academics and my future career, and I love the feeling of accomplishment that comes from doing well on an exam or from succeeding in an interview or at a task at work.

But I also tend to become really focused on how other people are doing, and can be very jealous or resentful when I see that my peers are doing better than me. For example, I've been struggling to find a summer internship this year, while many of my college friends have already started work at their dream internships. I also have struggled in the past to form close relationships during college, and I only have a handful of real friendships at my school; I often feel frustrated and disappointed in myself when I see my classmates surrounded by their enormous friend groups, and I feel like I'm not quite likable or ""good"" enough to be in their position.

 I know it's not ideal to compare myself to others, and I know it's making me unhappy, but I can't seem to stop. Does anyone have any advice on how to avoid this type of thinking? Thanks! "

I volunteered with VITA and do have some work experience (about two years with the same company as their ""accounting intern"" but basically AP) so it's not empty, but still pretty... mediocre. I won a Wiley CPA review from a raffle so to try and improve my chances of finding an okay job I'm going to try and self\-study and pass the exam before landing a job. I do have enough credits to be eligible, but obviously am lacking the job experience.

I'm pretty confident in my ability to pass the test by myself (well, with the review material I mean). My mediocre GPA is all my fault, but it's a result of basically barely showing up to class and cramming before exams/finals and eating up any attendance/homework penalty that wasn't \*too\* much of a deal breaker, minor drug addiction, preoccupation with other things, being a shitty person, blah blah, etc.  Not trying to really make any excuses, but on that note, if there's anything I'm good at, it's self\-teaching myself materials. While I should have probably used my time to go to class or attended more accounting events, I spent it teaching myself teaching myself programming (Python and an okay amount of C\+\+), random math courses (my ""knowledge"" extends about as far as what most engineering students take in math courses \+ some introduction material in Topology), and the ability to read/write in Spanish (conversationally, NOPE). Some other things too, but it starts getting really random. I self\-taught myself for about 90&amp;#37; of my degree too.

I know I sound really flaky, but I'm actually a pretty reliable worker. I just don't really care for the school environment/accounting lectures. I've read around and everyone on the internet seems far more cynical than the people in real life. Obviously, I'm not looking to get hired by a B4 firm, but reading all of the other anecdotal posts on r/accounting about people with similar GPAs but shinier resumes (clubs, being a club officer, etc) getting no replies back from ANYONE is really disheartening. Would passing the CPA exam but not qualifying for licensure yet help me find a job at a small firm that can give me the experience I need? I've read some advice from people saying ""Work AP/AR, go get your Masters, try again"" but I really would rather not. Is working as an AP/AR Clerk a dead end? Also, my networking is abysmal, and my school's ""network"" isn't very great either.

tl;dr: I know I am mediocre. Do you think I will at least be able to find a mediocre job that allows me to progress further into accounting and not be stuck doing individual tax returns at a strip mall HR Block for the indefinite future?"

I regret it everyday, but I now have a strong work ethic because I've learned from this mistake. Now I am constantly trying to get A's in my engineering courses while also taking GPA boosters.

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8pg7iz,1,2018-06-07,Deep TMS - How Important Is the Technician's Skill/Experience?,maiashnuggles,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8pg7iz/deep_tms_how_important_is_the_technicians/,"So I've had almost 20 sessions of Deep TMS, and I'm not feeling any lift in my depression. Maybe some increased anxiety but that's about it. My main concern with the deep TMS is that I've had a few different people doing it and the sensation of the magnet pulse seems inconsistent from day to day. The woman who did my initial mapping quit after that first day. My psychiatrist's wife, I'll call her Jane on here, now seems to be the resident expert so has done a few sessions, and she apparently is training one of the office receptionists, I'll call him Dave, to be the new technician since another intern who did it for me once was fired after 2 days. Dave seems like he has the application down reasonably well, except he often forgets to pull on the strap at the back, which to me seems to be a CRUCIAL piece of the process. I've told him and he fixed it by manhandling it a bit and pulling the back strap down, but it still leave me feeling less than confident about the whole process. And he said sometimes pulling it down like that can shift it off a little. If he is forgetting that basic step, what else is he missing? Are there subtle things that he could be doing that would make it more effective? Is it really hitting the right spot still after pulling in the back? But I don't know what all is or isn't important. I know they use measurements to put it in the right spot, but they've gotten that wrong more than once, too. I'm not the expert, I'm just the patient. But every time I ask or seem unsure about how it is fitting, Dave and Jane seem to brush it off and say it is whatever the patient wants, and that pulling the strap down in the back brings the coils closer to the head, but it still has the same effect either way. Well, I can say that the sensation is vastly different when they do or don't pull on the back. When Dave doesn't, I can barely feel it and my hand doesn't move. When they pull it extra tight and lock it in place, it is a much stronger pulse and my right arm shakes quite a bit, even. But they won't give me a direct answer on what is good or bad. They say everyone is different and it just varies, it is just about what the patient wants. But I want to know if it is good to twitch? Or is too much of that sensation bad and a brain overload? I mean I guess it is a bit more stressful when I am twitching. It definitely isn't painful, but it is just more of a surprise and slight anxiety feeling when the pulses start.

But I don't care about discomfort, I just want to know what is most EFFECTIVE, but I can't find any straight answers. I tried emailing BrainsWay, the company that makes the machine, and of course they wouldn't provide any type of explanation at all and just referred me to my provider. How do I find an authoritative, reliable, expert source of information regarding what has been determined to be the most effective exact application of the helmet? I intuitively feel like strapping it on super good and tight with the coils pushed right up against the scalp would be best because that will allow the pulse to penetrate the deepest. Or am I making too big a deal about this and it really doesn't matter? Maybe I'm just a non\-responder and I have to accept that but I just wish I was receiving the treatment from someone who had a bit more experience and who I had more confidence in.

Also, when I was mapped the first time, my maximum threshold was determined to be 55&amp;#37;. When I was remapped a couple weeks later, the location changed slightly, and my max was only 48&amp;#37;. That seems to be a pretty big difference \- what would cause that to change? I have a feeling it is because I think they were pushing the helmet down tight when they were doing it the 2nd time. Thanks in advance to anyone who might have any thoughts or ideas at all about this!"
8pgz1d,1,2018-06-08,Falling behind in my internship,shark2389738,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8pgz1d/falling_behind_in_my_internship/,"I’m currently interning with a top 6 firm and  I’m not doing so well. It’s only been a couple of weeks but I can tell, I probably won’t get an offer. I’m normally pretty shy. I will have moments when I can act like an extrovert ( that’s probably how I got my internship) but I haven’t been able to fake it during my time here. 

I see the other interns joking and talking with a bunch of other co workers. They are even going out for lunch and beers with them after work. Usually while I stay at the office or go out by myself. However for the most part I just hear them kissing asses. They will say wow this firm is so much better than firm x. Or yeah I like this firm better because they don’t have crazy b4 hours but get paid more than them. And just a ton of other bs that makes it sound like we work at google. 

I’m shy but I have more trouble just straight kissing ass and buttering people up. I really want a full time offer from this place but at this point idk if I will get it. I like my manager and the work I’m doing is interesting. But it just doesn’t feel like I fit in with the office. 


TL;Dr 
I have an internship with a top 6 firm. Other interns seem to be so more social than me. I don’t think I’m fitting in with the office and doubt I will get the full time offer even though I really want it. "
8ph95h,5,2018-06-08,i feel free,INVNIS849,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ph95h/i_feel_free/,"i've told people how happy i am before but i have to get this out to a wider audience because i still feel this so strongly.

college was nice for the most part but the bad parts were so fucking rough. junior year i was so stressed out and convinced i had some mild form of depression. i started self\-harming (non\-invasive method) and i cried myself to sleep a number of nights. i was in a relationship with a guy that didn't reciprocate my feelings and admitted to only dating me to see if he could move on from his ex. my self\-esteem in both body image and artistic skill were near nothing. i was scared to fucking death of not getting a job out of college and not being able to make payments on my student loans. i was terrified at the thought of me being a disappointment to my parents. i was scared shitless at the thought of going into debt, and i remember sobbing to my mom over the phone about it. i went to an expensive school but she reassured me that if her and my dad would not be able to support me, they wouldn't have let me go. it calmed my thoughts a little, but the fear was still largely there.

since then, everything has been falling into place.

i graduated college and went back home for a bit. i sat there sitting on my computer, applying for jobs on linkedin, monster, etc. i knew that students typically have a grace period of 6 months after graduation until they have to start paying off things, but that fear was still lingering. it's always been lingering. all i've ever wanted was to be financially secure and independent and i would do anything to make that happen. 

fast\-forward a month later and i get an email from a company near where my school was located. they're looking for a graphic designer for a paid internship and, if they liked me, they'd hire me full\-time. i'm not going to go into details, but another month later, i found myself packing all my things and heading back down there.

i got hired after a month\-long internship and i have never felt more validated as a designer in my life. over time they've been super happy with what i turn out for various clients. my school was very heavy with the competition mindset and i felt like one of the worst artists in my small design class of \~13 students that year. my inspiration has come back, i'm no longer being pressured to make amazing things in a ridiculous amount of time for a shitty teacher for an average grade. my mental health wellness skyrocketed after getting out of there.

the job pays enough that i can live comfortably in a basic apartment by myself, while still having money to pay off my loans and rent. i've gotten comfortable with the routine monthly payments. i've been steadily building my savings account and i've been able to treat myself to things here and there. i'm nowhere near debt and i have a fantastic credit score with help from my parents. i've been on a journey of self\-discovery and i've felt myself changing over this past year and it feels so good. i'm single and sorta looking but i'm taking my time and trying not to be discouraged by it. my self\-esteem fluctuates but it's better than it was 3 years ago and i'm still working on body acceptance. i find myself coming up with ideas for designs and illustrations and i no longer feel drained of creativity. my mom constantly tells me how proud she is of me and i can finally believe that i'm not a disappointment.

i've gained the independence i've been waiting for all my life. i'm taking advantage of it and i've never felt so fucking good. i'm nearly tearing up as i type this because i never saw myself getting to this point. this was just a dream a few years ago but now it's my reality. there are still things i want to do and places i want to go, but i'm 23, i'm just starting my life and i have so many more years ahead of me.

if you've read this far, thank you so much. i hope you have a wonderful week."

&amp;nbsp;

**Inside the HGEU**

* **MOT**- Dom returns so real work starts back. Dom seems refreshed and adds some color to the install. They lower the RB26 in cautiously and S L O W L Y. Engine finds it’s home and the setup is sicc. Silvia is fire, seems like the sub has slowed down on the Silvia being illegal and we are all enraptured by this cars beauty. The Silvia is superior, I can’t look away.  Thomas goes an a mini rant about the intake manifold having purple and blue anodized pieces on it, I think he just signed that intakes death warrant. His OCD won’t let that purple and blue on the intake live to see 2019. 
* **Rudnik**- Vid starts with a tractor starting up and Rudnik explaining that they are picking up the Forester from Antmans farm. Apparently they stored the car outside with the windows down. Rudnik confirms that he lost his license for a week, good on you Chris for just addressing the situation. He states that if this clutch doesn’t hold on the Forester he’s going automatic or selling it. Tommy and Chris have some good back and forth while they pressure wash the Forester. Chris pulls the engine with Antman and then cuts to him talking and he mentions he’s previously had Lyme Disease twice (WTF?). Next day he starts putting the new ACT clutch on. Tommy and Rudnick fuck around and MOT throws down a 1k bet on a foot race, Rudnick doesn’t take the action. Engine goes in, doesn’t start and during a story time Rudnik informs that he accidently filled the engine with gear oil. Whoops.
* **LifeOD**- PVC Exhaust, Mondrose has found a golden goose with these gimmick mechanic videos. He’s gonna hook a feeding tube to up to the goose, bolt it to a nest and make it shit golden eggs till it dies from pure exhaustion. Karr smiles a few times in this vid maybe he isn’t being held against his will? Karr also instructs Onion to show the viewers what Bozo is. They ride the car around and thanks to having experience with cars catching on fire in a forest Onion wisely decides to bring a fire extinguisher for the maiden voyage. Afterwards they put the car on the lift and determine that PVC exhausts don’t work, W O W. Burky then plugs his channel and tells us some build aspirations for the wagon. He mentions driving it across the country when he’s “ready to go home”, is he plotting his escape already? I didn't watch the Burky vid, anyone that did please give us a recap. They show the drift taxi, promote the “takeover event” and then show some clips for the next vid. Production value seems to have stepped up a notch. Lastly the Duct Tape Tire Vid is at 1.8 million views, Orion lives in a trailer but is a lord of the internet, accept it. 
* **Haggard North**- Vid starts in the Garbage Barn AGAIN. The cleaning moving vids are never going to end, this is an all moving and cleaning channel now. He talks to the camera for a long time about his sleeping and eating habits. Shockingly they are both horrible. I never would have thought he eats fast food everyday, I always pictured him packing a lunch and eating a balanced meal. Intern makes an appearance to show some shims? Cut to lots of “tuning” footage on the Bass Boat Z. Car finally drives. He drives it back in forth in the garbage barn three times and chirps the tires. Damian talks alot about “how it moved” and “he doesn’t want to hear nothing from you guys”. By my count Stubbins dropped 6 accents in this vid, anxiety at an all time high. Favorite comment from YouTube CorysGarage- “That shaky footage tho, looks like Our Guy went to the blair witch film school”. This is probably a skip.

* **Discussion Question**- How do you classify who is in the HGEU and who is out? My personal rule of thumb for determining HGEU membership is that if you spent a significant amount of time on Orion's Camera than you are in. What's your metric for deciding who is in and who is out?

&amp;nbsp;


***Outside the HGEU***

&amp;nbsp;

* **Motion Auto TV**- Tire Machine Restoration. Tool Resto vids are hot right now and I l think  that Trevor is trying capitalizing on the situation. Trevor starts an old KA 240 and lets his buddy whip some donuts. Vid kinda goes nowhere, unless you are REALLY into tire machines this is a skip.

* **Boosted Boiz**- [Gofundme update](https://www.gofundme.com/help-brent-get-a-new-shop) 

* **Gingium**- Does a Divine style intro on his new project TRUCK. He sourced the car out of California. 1991 Mazda B2200 5 Speed 4 Banger, incredibly clean 140,000 miles and practically zero rust. He tells his audience how you can start the truck with ANY mazda key, probably not a great idea to advertise that. Build details, wants to fab up suspension from a Miata, swap in a 1UZ, repaint, redo interior and potentially a rear mount radiator. Super unique build, very pumped for this.  
* **Hoonigan’s Build Biology**-  Rywire Honda S2K, holy fucking shit, endless amounts of cool and lots of Mugen JDM Blood Sugar Sex Magic. C L E A N.

* **Taylor Ray**- Does a review of a drift car. Taylor be careful you break if you buy it. 
* **LZ**- LZ livestreams himself getting VR Drift Seat Time and has his Chow ask him questions. Most life streams I check in on are lame but this was a cool setup. This seems like a better move than doing a livestream in a converted garage “OKAY GUYS CHOW HAS AC” remember that? I member.  Live stream was strong and you could feel LZ’s wheels turning on integrating more livestreams into his repertoire. Answers a lot of questions on his project cars and what he has scheduled for the rest of the year. Something interesting is that LZ talks about some “emissions” mods for his F-250 that he won’t post on youtube for fear legal reprisal. Is that a thing? Do people get in trouble for “illegal mods” that they post on youtube?
* **12 Year Old Podcast**- Two sub personalities have joined forces and started a podcast. I did a quick check to see if they passed my podcast test of annoying voices and they did with flying colors, neither had annoying voices. I’m excited to listen to the whole thing tomorrow while I cut the grass. Both of these gents have made me laugh numerous times on the sub/discord and I’m looking forward to hearing what they have to say, [TRY IT OUT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr14MFTKGjY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14s).

She moved in with me and my dad after a 2 year long distance relationship. The home situation got worse because of our busy lives and my dad who could not get along with her. She wanted to break up with me 2 months after she moved in. I convinced/begged her to stay. We gave it a new go, looked for ouw place. It worked for a while, but didn't find a place and then we got back into the same toxic situation. She then found her own place without telling me, left me and recently broke up with me again. We are still good friends and we had good talk about it all, but I still want her. Can I get her back and how?

So here's the deal. My ex and I had been together for 2 years and 9 months. I got to know her online when she was 16 and I was 21 (quite the age difference I know). She lived in Germany back then and I lived in the Netherlands. We visited each other as much as we could; at least once a month for a weekend, week(s) or sometimes even 2 months. We had a great time and we made it work out perfectly. 

Then after 2 years she went on a 6 month trip to Australia with her sister which she had planned before she even met me. However, things didn't work out and she came back after about 3 months. Now that she was back we could finally make our dream come true of living together. She would move to the Netherlands to get a job there and study there. I was already finishing my studies and then I would get a full-time job.

She moved her in January 2018. The problem was: I still lived with my dad because of financial preferences and since there was a lot of space in the house she could move in with us. It was never a permanent idea, only temporary. We planned on looking for our own place. She couldn't get along with my dad though and she felt more and more uncomfortable at my place. Luckily she got a great job in Amsterdam, she met some people there and now had a place to go to. She started avoiding my place as much as she could. 

Half way in March when she was already working full-time, I got a full-time internship. Problem now was that I would be working from 9-5, but she'd be working from now 14-22. We barely saw each other during the workweek, only an hour before bed and in the morning I could only kiss her goodbye. In that hour before bed we usually were both tired and we didn't really have quality time to spend, we would also get annoyed easily and it would sometimes result in little fights that we then would just sleep over and never talk about.

At the end of March she came home late and a bit tipsy, I made a wrong comment and we got into a fight. She then blurted out she wanted to break up. I was shocked. I tried to change her mind, but she wouldn't have it. Only the next day when I broke down in tears and basically begged her to stay, she stayed. We promised each other to give it another try.

The month or so after that was pretty great. There was love again and we did fun things. We put more energy in our relationship. We also finally had all the papers ready to look for a place of our own. During that month we had no luck finding a place however. We slowly started getting back into our routine and it became a drag again. We would get annoyed with each other again.

Halfway May we again had no luck finding a place for ourselves. I wanted to talk to her. I told her that it doesn't seem to work and I would rather save for buying a house or that we both get a place of our own (which would be easier). At that point she made a decision without me knowing. She started looking for a place in Amsterdam for herself. She found one with quite some luck within 2 weeks.

Then on Friday the 1st of June I discovered that she had packed all her stuff. Again I was shocked. When she came home she told me she'd be leaving the next day and wanted to break up with me. It broke my heart, I tried to convince her to not break up with me, but she would not have it.

The next day I didn't want to be an ass. I understood her choice to move so I helped her move. She was actually surprised by that. Then in the car I wanted to have a serious talk. There I convinced her that we should take a break. She agreed, but we never really were clear on what it meant and how it would work. We would give each other space and time. Though stupid me could not take it. I missed her badly and I couldn't deal with the uncertainty. 

I then called her on Monday night in an emotional state. I had thought things over a lot and wanted to talk to her. She wasn't all too happy that I contacted her; she wanted to break up and not talk to me. I still managed to convince her to talk to me face to face.

On Wednesday the 6th of June we met up. I had written down everything I thought went wrong at memorized it. First I apoligized for my desperate call on Monday. Then, I told her that we made a mistake by going from a long distance relationship to living together, especially with my dad. It was a toxic environment for both of us which caused lots of frictions between us. I failed as a boyfriend by not giving her enough attention and making her feel comfortable at home (I was completely blind to it all though, because I was busy myself and felt stressed and tired). She admitted it was also her fault. She didn't communicate with me and she also felt stressed and tired. Besides that, she really wanted to have a place for ourselves or at least herself to be independent and have the privacy we need. Either way, over these past months she lost her love for me. We still hugged, kissed and had sex, but there was no intimacy. She still had feelings for me and I believe she still does, but it is not enough to love me.

The talk we had on Wednesday was however very chill. It was a sunny day, we took a walk in a nice park, sat by the water and just talked. We don't hate each other, we actually get along really well and are able to laugh together. It feels now that we are just good friends and we also want to stay good friends. During our conversation, I asked her if she saw the possibility to get back together at some point. Initially, she said it was unlikely because she thinks the relationship would be the same as over the past months and end up in nothing. I convinced her that things change and so will we; and that we should stay open for our feelings for each other and consider getting back together with an open mind. She agreed with me there and we promised each other to take that approach.

The reason she thought we can't get back together is that our personalities don't match as well as she thought. We do balance each other out. She is more impulsive and creative, I'm more calm and calculative. It always worked until now. I think that when we lived together our personalities just clashed because we were too focused on our selfs due to the stress and tiredness. It all pulled us apart. 

She also mentioned that we have different ideas for our lives. She wants to work a bit, travel more, experience things, and don't live according to strict plans and commit to them. She thought I do want that; that I want to just get a job, a house, kids and whatnot. Though I told her that isn't the case. I also want to do what she wants. Only when we're older I want a nice house. She said she want to go to Canada and I said I want that too. She was surprised by that.

She was actually surprised by how I was during the whole conversation. She thought I would beg her again to come back. Instead, she said I behaved really mature, was very sensitive and understanding of her and the issues we have. I told her that I am proud of her, how she has matured over the years. There is mutual respect.

When we got back to her place it was time to say goodbye. We made a deal on how to continue our friendship. We decided that she should be the one to contact me first because she broke up with me (she probably will next week). I will only send her a surprise for her birthday next week (a personalized card and a small bouquet of flowers). Then we will slowly start talking more if it feels good and will also hang out together and with friends. We'll see from there. We hugged each other tightly and said goodbye. I was walking towards my car and she was at the door of her place. After a few meters, I looked over my shoulder and she was still standing there holding the door and smiling at me and I smiled back.

I have a good feeling about it. Still, I do want her back. She means the world to me and I want to make right what I did wrong and also the rest that went wrong in our relationship. If I could take her back now, I would, but I can't be too pushy about it. I know it's gonna take quite some time. I do think it's possible to have a great relationship when she lives in Amsterdam and I live at my own place. It's only an hour or so apart. We could have our own time during the workweek and then spend actual quality time in the weekends. That's how I envision it.

Now the question is:  Do you think it is possible to make it work like this, to get back together? And how would you do it?

Hope you guys can help me out."

**Bat-Midget**

Night at the Lynch manor was a solemn affair. Eric would continue till the early hours maintaining peak physical and mental condition, by relentlessly humping his mattress to improve dexterity, and re-watching reruns of American Idol to further his prediction skills. 

A knock on the door. Jon appeared with a phone on a tray. “If I may interrupt, Master Eric, Mr Langford from the Howard 100 News Team is calling.”

*Of all the people.* Eric took the phone. “For the last time, only Shuli gets to interview me!” he grunted.

“It’s not that, Eric. I’m calling you because everyone in the studio is in grave danger! Somehow, Howard and some of the staff have gone barking mad, and are holding people hostage!”

“…I’m listening.”

“We need you, Eric. We need… Bat-Midget.”

Eric closed his eyes for a second. “Hold on and keep everyone safe. I’ll be there.” He gave the phone back to Jon. “Jon, get everything ready. I’m going to need to leave now.”

“And which vehicle of transportation will Master Eric be employing tonight?”

Eric let out a rare half smile.

___

The group of interns huddled outside the Sirius XM building shuddered, as the man dressed impeccably in a suit, fired a gun into the air. “What do you want with us, mister?” an intern pleaded. “We don’t have anything to give you.”

The man laughed. “I don’t want anything from you. I’m just awaiting the arrival of a very good friend.”

There was an increasingly loud sound of what seemed to be a wind-up toy. Going at about 10 mph, a tiny Escalade – probably fit for a 5 year old child – droned across the street, coming to a halt before the hostages. It was the Midgetmobile – originally the mini car Eric drove for Rocco’s Old School Tattoos, but now modified with armored plates and a variety of gadgets.

The man with a gun pulled out a mic. “Our lead story today.” Steve Langford spoke. “Eric the Midget’s latest public appearance yet another disaster, thanks to this news division.”

Eric spoke through a speaker. “I knew you were up to some bullshit again, Langford. You Two-Faced, no life-having Canadian jackass.”

“But thanks to Howard 100 News, Eric the Midget is finally done for.” Langford continued. “This reporter states that Eric’s chances for stopping him are zero point zero. Repeat, zero point zero. And now to the shooting. ”

Langford begin shooting at the Midgetmobile, but it was to no avail, as Eric had used plating technology inspired by the cum hardening his PJ pants. With a single press of a button, Eric fired back, and Langford was down.

___

After making sure the interns were safe, Eric was about to enter the building when **BOOM!** The Midgetmobile had been hit by a missile of some sort. The computers were haywire and the engine was close to shutting down.

“Ha ha ha!” An irritating high-pitched voice. An average sized man with eyes looking in multiple directions had appeared before the entrance, holding a smoking bazooka. A series of tubes containing a purplish liquid were attached all over his body. “It is I, High Pitch Mike! This is where you die and I fuck your sister.”

“No.” replied Eric. “This is where I kick your ass back to Disneyland”. Thankfully the machine guns still worked and High Pitch Mike fell to his knees. But, despite being badly injured, he was not done.

“Watch.. me... come out... of the... closet!” He pressed a button on his chest and the liquids in the tubes started pumping into his body. Grunting and screaming, his body begin to expand horribly. What was formally a paunch burst into a massive gut. Multiple chins appeared. His arms and legs begin to bloat.

This new creature appeared to be unscathed, but its voice remained the same high pitched atrocity. It cried “Hello, this is Kelly Clarkson. Is this Eric the Midget? “

Eric groaned. *High Pitch Erik really is the Bane of my existence.* “Cut it out, High Pitch. Get out of my way… NOW!”

“I think you’re very cute!”

*That’s it.* The roof the ruined Midgetmobile burst open, and Eric – in wheelchair – ejected out to the air. Instantly, balloons sprouted out from the wheelchair’s back, suspending Eric in the air. Eric threw a Midget-rang at High Pitch Erik, knocking him out.

___

Eric made his way to the studio floor. He could hear an increasingly louder laugh. A maniacal, gleeful laugh. *I’ll have to do what I have to do.* As he approached the studio, a silhouette appeared before him. It was tall and lanky, and had stringy curly hair. The laughter continued.

*Oh no.* “Howard, don’t make me do this. Let those people go.” Eric said. The figure charged him, but Eric deftly stunned it with a Midgetrang. Examining the unconscious body, it was not Howard but Ralph. Eric smirked and said “You berry-fa-“

*Hold on. What’s that? The laughter’s still going on. And it’s coming from the studio.*

Eric listened a little harder and realised something terrible.

*It’s coming from Robin’s side. Robin. It’s not Howard, it’s Robin.*

Eric took a deep breathe and took out his Midgetgrappler.

*I’m coming for you, you cackling witch.*

I am writing this post because I am seeking advices from the  Salesforce  community.

I am an IT student who will graduate in software engineering next month.

I am not from the US.

I did my internship in a Big IT corporate which proposed to me a  job as a"" junior analyst""

In the other hand I got a proposition from a start up specialised in Salesforce wich proposed to me a job to work on  Salesforce technologie offering also training.

I don't know wich one to choose . The job in the corporate is more off an communication goal (coordonating between project teams  and information system division of the client )  wich is something i enjoyed during the internship , but not something i studied for.

The job in the Salesforce specialised start up I know really little about but the CEO  is super enthusiastic.

Could you please advise me on what to expect of a  Salesforce  oriented carrier and if it worth taking ?

Thank you very much.

Kære redditors på /r/Denmark,

Velkommen til endnu et tilbageblik på måneden der var.

Tråden er vores mulighed for at fortælle jer om ændringer, tiltag, overvejelser og den generelle moderation, og det er jeres mulighed for at stille os spørgsmål og komme med ris eller ros. I reddits ånd er det vores ønske, at /r/denmark er brugerstyret, og derfor er denne tråd også et oplæg til debat.

Som altid har vi månedens moderationslog [her](https://i.imgur.com/6eSCw9J.png)

---

#### Reglerne

Vi har efter lang, intern debat valgt at opdatere reglerne vedr. racisme. Det skyldes, at vi har haft svært ved at levere en konsistent moderation, når noget er blevet anmeldt for racisme grundet den tidligere formulering.

Den nye regel vil i sin enkelthed lyde:

 - Racisme, homofobi, antisemitisme, sexisme og lignende er ikke tilladt. Kritiske kommentarer er tilladte, men de skal formuleres anstændigt.

Vi har dertil sammensat nogle klare interne retningslinjer for, hvad vi helt konkret definerer som (f.eks.) racisme. Vores definition lyder som følge:

 - kommentarer/indlæg der udviser diskriminerende, truende, vulgær eller hadsk holdning over for grupper af mennesker pga. deres religiøse forhold, etniske baggrund, seksuelle orientering, køn og kønsidentitet, etc

Vi kommer til at anvende denne nye definition med tættekam, og vil derudover være mere opmærksomme på det i den næste tid. Derfor \*vil\* nogle brugere også opdage, at der kommer flere påtaler for racisme. Vi ønsker på ingen måde at begrænse eller censurere bestemte holdninger, men vi forventer, at vores brugere opfører sig som voksne mennesker og er med til at give subben en hvis standard ift. debat. Ønsker man at debattere f.eks. indvandring, må man således formå at gøre det uden at kalde indvandrere ting, der er åbenlyst diskriminerende eller generaliserende. 

---

#### Ugentlige posts

Som nogle af jer måske har bemærket har vi indført en ""Teknisk Tirsdag"", tirsdage i ulige uger. Vi har stadigvæk plads til andre ugentlige posts og tager gerne imod forslag. 

Vi har p.t. snakket om indførslen af en ""Trænings\-Torsdag"", hvor man kan udveksle erfaringer, trænings\- og kostprogrammer o. lign. så vi alle kan ende med at bænke lige så meget som Joachim B. Olsen.

Derudover har vi også overvejet en ""Gaming\-Mandag"", hvor de seneste tendenser i CS:GO og Fortnite kan diskuteres, og hvor DotA og LoL spillere kan afgøre, hvilket MOBA, der er bedst.

Vi kører de to nye ugentlige posts gennem juni, og ser om der er interesse for dem.

#### Vidste du at vi har en Discord?

Som sidebaren afslører, så har /r/Denmark vores egen Discord server. Du har ofte mulighed for at snakke direkte med en mod her eller blot komme forbi til en snak om alt fra Dronningen til astronautis.

8pkbf7,38,2018-06-08,"Personal Primerica Experience (a tidbit long but worth it , I assure you )",blackbettybamalamb,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8pkbf7/personal_primerica_experience_a_tidbit_long_but/,"So at the time I was in a very “prestigious” shall we say internship. The first six months we were there from 8-4 learning computer science / business ethics and public speaking after 4 months I started to feel really dumb and out of place . I wasn’t understanding python and my speeches were too long so my grades were a bit low honestly . On top of that we always had to dress , just so much restriction and one day I thought “hey you know what, I’m gonna leave and prove myself to them and show that I can do better without the internship” (horrible mistake and from the title you can guess why ) so anyways one day I’m walking to the bus stop and a guy approached me (the internship starts at a college campus...then they’ll send you off to places like google ,zynga,dayforce etc) Anyways...getting off track sorry) He says ,and very timidly I might add “Excuse me mam, our company just started and we’re new to this area ,I was wondering if you knew anyone in the area who would be looking for employment . BAM! I thought “This is perfect this is my plan B” fast forward left the internship feeling all smug and cocky . Anyways I go to the open house and people share their stories and things started to stand out a bit too me . One lady said “I make more money I’m 36 hours than I made in a week at my nursing job” ...hmm...ok. Then they talked about their math and listen I’m not very good at math but I’m smart when some bs comes out . This “rep” says “So if you recruit four people , set up an appointment and do the appointment you’ll get 150% however if you don’t do all the recruiting and you come along with the appointment but never set it you get 50% someone called her out and they said “well because you didn’t really do anything” . Anyways ...I got “hired” on spot . After the open house they just try to take everyone back to this room where they already have paperwork spot on and they ask for a $99 fee for a background check and to help pay for your license . Oh yeah you have classes to take for your license . Not sure if it was real cause I went to one class and stopped. Anyways after that they put you with a “team “ and you have to write down a warm leads list but they’ll say “Oh friends who might be interested in being hired” or “Those who have a car and might need help...blah blah blah..you get the picture “ anyways I paid the fee and started getting badgering texts about “what’re you doing , let’s go recruiting “ I went once and we drove to a Walmart and went on a prowl ,for lack of better words, it’s awful approaching people who just want to shop to talk about a watered down MLM insurance company . Then they started telling me “You don’t need to hang out with friends , you don’t need friends , you’re with us.” Ouch okay..cause I’m pretty lonely now .After that they had events come up and in order to win a place there ...you had to recruit and if not you can just pay a simple price of a couple hundred . After that they started saying things like “Why are we focusing so much on the product...we need to recruit .” And no lie everyone around me chanted “RECRUIT RECRUIT RECRUIT”. So I started doing research on Glassdoor ...and thought but it has almost 5 starts . Filtered the review settings to the lowest and I struck some serious gold , they the reps make the good reviews under different names and one day I witnessed it and that was the last straw . Did more research supposedly you can make 100,000 plus , we know the script . Found out that the reps typically make around 1,800 or so a YEAR. Reread that ...a YEAR. Also those that got conned into investing or a life insurance usually never got their money or got some amount much less than it was supposed to be . A lady shared her experience about how she started off paying around 100 and then 200 and then 300 for her life insurance once her dad past , she had no life insurance money because she missed a payment and they decided to close her account ...here’s the catch they didn’t tell her... so she just kept giving money . Anyways I left after a month. I lost my friends and I can blame no one but myself , I lost an amazing opportunity with the internship and spiraled .Now almost a year later I’m getting back on track with working , relationships , I’m actually planning on going back to the internship. Here’s the thing if you’re young, I get it , it’s hard freaking struggle to make a living out here , you are not alone and as long as you have support and that drive ,you’ll make to exactly where and what you want to be. Also try Glassdoor to see reviews, experiences , salaries and other great things about companies before want a job there and the BBB.  Do your research . Thank you so much for your time . If you read it ."
8pkelc,0,2018-06-08,[F4A] Magical consent is great.,h425213,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8pkelc/f4a_magical_consent_is_great/,"Hi dpp, I'm looking for someone to play a hypnosis rp. I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before don't be scared of trying again."
8pki4l,14,2018-06-08,"I (26F) wouldn't lend my brother (22M) money, and now we don't talk. I'm hurt and don't know what to think.",sammers092,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8pki4l/i_26f_wouldnt_lend_my_brother_22m_money_and_now/,"So I haven't seen my brother in over a year since he came to my graduation last May. He goes to school 6 hours away from me and generally stays around school. He doesn't have the best paying job as a part time student, and he works in an assisted living facility up there. 

However, his girlfriend lives about 20 minutes away from me, working less than a mile away from my apartment at a professional sports stadium. My brother is staying with her family over break and I suggested that maybe that would be a good time to catch up as I hadn't seen him and I missed him. He seemed a little ambivalent about the idea, which I wasn't sure how to respond to. He is very into spending a lot of time with his girlfriend, and they post a lot of pictures all over social media having a good time together. I've never met her, as they started going out soon after I saw him last May. I've lent him money before so he could fly down to Texas last August to see her because she was an intern down there, and I didn't get much of a thank you or IOU or anything. Lesson learned. 

Last month I learned that they were going to take in a concert (front row too, expensive tickets) at the sports stadium close to me. Their pictures and videos were plastered all over social media. I had mentioned to him that I live nearby and wasn't working, maybe he could stop by or something. He didn't respond. So they went and had a good time. 

The next day I get a call from him. He didn't say ""hi how are you, hows it going,"" but he said ""hey, do you think you can lend me some money to help me pay my bills, I'm going to be short this month."" He knows I'm in my career and make like 3 times what he does, and I work a lot so it adds up. I'm not stingy, but I know he wouldn't pay me back. I say no, partly because he didn't ask politely, and two, he maybe could have thought of a better time to ask than right after a concert.  He. Got. Mad. He got mad that I called him out for not making the effort to visit when I opened up plenty of opportunities, and he got mad that I'm ""selfish"" with my money. He hung up on me. 

My mother thinks I should have given him money, that family is family and it's charitable. I said no, this is not charitable and I learned the hard way that he won't pay me back. Then she said that she talked to him and said he should show more gratitude. I didn't hear anything from him for an apology or otherwise, so her talking to him was useless. My dad is very angry with him over it, and he used to send him money for groceries because he said he wasn't getting enough to eat. Then it turned into my brother asking him every month, apparently very impolitely, when he was going to send money. (All the while posting pictures on facebook and Instagram of him and his girlfriend having a good time.) He also wanted to buy my dads 2nd motorcycle, which my dad is now not willing to do as he thinks it's irresponsible of my brother to be spending money on that if he's so strapped for grocery money. 

My brother is now spending the summer living with his girlfriends family, free of charge, 20 minutes away from me. Before all this happened, I was looking forward to meeting up with him at least once, but now I just feel hurt and lonely that he doesnt see me as a sister, but as a money bank. I unfollowed him on social media, because I don't want to see him going out when he apparently is desperate for bill money. I also removed his girlfriends access to me, because I don't really even know her. 

Am I being dumb about this or am I justified in going *mostly* no contact? I dont feel like he values the sibling relationship, even though I was there for him when he needed me before. "

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I used to work as a pharmacist's assistant and a health advisor and now I'm studying to be a dental assistant. I recently started my internship at a dentistry. It's a huge facility and each doctor has their own offices.

I spent a few weeks working next to an oral surgeon but I was assigned to a general dentist yesterday. I think I was doing pretty well with the surgeon and I thought I'd do well with the other dentist too but my expectations didn't really meet reality, so to speak.

We had our first patient who complained about a lump in her mouth that comes and goes and she felt some pain. It was a minor inflammation in the gums and in her lower law. I heard many people complaining about stress induced inflammations that basically just vanished once the stress was gone so I got suspicious and I asked her if I could have a question. Yes, I could.

\- Have you experienced any stress lately?

\- Oh, yes, I actually thought it might have something to do with it.

Well, as it turned out, some serious family problems rose when the lump first appeared and slowly disappeared when said problems became resolved. The came some marital issues and the lump reappeared causing some pain.

\- Maybe you should consider some kind of counselling after this treatment, don't you think? Just to make sure you...

And here's where the doctor interrupted:

\- Actually, I'm the one giving advices, alright?

Well....okay. This single comment felt like a fucking shot to my chest and stressed me out for the whole day. I feel like my knowledge and experience is not welcome and I can't help the doctor's job in a way I actually think is useful. This knowledge is my extra, this is what could make me more than other assistants and it's not. fucking. welcome. I just wanted to help that poor lady by giving her some advice she may never heard from anyone because it was the first time she could actually talk about what happened to her.

Also, I screwed up a gazillion other things after this little incident while assisting. Things I'd never thought I would and I could easily come off as a fucking amateur because of them. The entire day was a sour combination of stress and embarrassment for me.

Lesson learned, I'll keep my mouth shut. And let all my knowledge down the sewers. That's how I feel."
8plwby,0,2018-06-08,Have your mathematics studies made you more of a literal thinker?,DarkHoleAngel,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/8plwby/have_your_mathematics_studies_made_you_more_of_a/,"There are many times in which I'm chatting with a friend, and our different communication styles are apparent. For example, I just had the following chat with a friend through text:

* Friend:     *In the gym now. Ive eaten so much and unhealthy food* *this last week* *haha* \[...\] *I've never had sixpacks.*
* Me:          *Well, maybe you do have them but your body fat percentage wasn't low enough for your abs to be easily visible.*
* Friend:    *Do you really have to go technical on this topic*
* Me:          *Simply bcs the steps to have six packs is diff than the steps to be toned and show abs*
* Friend: *Thats some EQ that you would need to understand the connotation on top of the denotation.*

I just did some quick googling and found this article: [How to Get Along With Literal Thinkers](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Along-With-Literal-Thinkers).

I feel that I've grown into a literal thinker after all my undergraduate mathematics courses. In math, I've learned to be precise and articulate with my words.

In my first internship, my mentor mentioned that, yes, we do employ this style of thinking and rationale while at work, but it's wise to turn it off at home with the our significant others. I find it difficult to turn it off. I'm the only one amongst my friends whose studies are in mathematics and computer science. Most of my friends are in finance, accounting, or medical.

Does this resonate with anyone else? If so, how do you manage it? Do you have these mini\-clashes with people who are non\-literal thinkers? What are ways I can try to adjust so I have less of these mini clashes?

**Edit**: I personally felt a little offended when my friend thought I lacked emotional intelligence to understand him. My non\-literal thinking friends often think I'm deliberately being difficult and dense.

**Edit2**: I think I may also respond differently through text messaging compared to an organic, face\-to\-face, verbal conversation. Text messaging has a focus on the literal words, because that's the only thing communicated. Normal, face\-to\-face communication incorporates so much more than just your word choice. There's tone, body language, and pacing. All that is lost in text messaging.

With texts, they're just words on a screen that I can read, reread, and ruminate on. I can dwell on the physical words and letters. I have the time and space to spot spelling and grammatical errors. All this is different than the context of a face\-to\-face conversation.

8pmrzk,267,2018-06-08,Control By Any Means Necessary P7,DejectedDIL,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8pmrzk/control_by_any_means_necessary_p7/,"This has gotten to be a novel and I apologize.  When I'm done, I will have presented my case against HoseBeast, but this isn't the end either...

See Bitchbot for previous chapters of this novella..

So once more, DH is home from rehab.  This was a much shorter stay.  He came out and started doing some mentoring and due to that, reconsidered his career choice.  He found that the kids he was working with saw eye to eye with him and they trusted him, because he had been there and done that.  He was and still is SO GOOD at it.  It really is where he's supposed to be.

I was all for it and proud that he was making a choice like this.  I'm a big proponent of education and I'm a big proponent of enjoying what you choose as a career, so DH went to graduate school to get his degree to work in a counseling setting.

It was a little stressful at times as he had to do internships and work a full time job, but thankfully his work schedule allowed more than enough time for him to get his internship hours and he loved these kids.  It was good for him.

Then, SFIL passed away..  Suddenly..  He had never been sick a day in his life, but I damn near think he died, because he was sick of HoseBeast.  If you can die of being beaten down and denigrated, then that's what SFIL died of.  It made him sick. If you notice, I haven't referred to him a whole lot in this novella, because it was like he really didn't exist except to be constantly tromped over by HB.  He was a shell of a man and I regret that in the years that I had known him, I never really knew him.  There were times that I could see that there was this really funny and interesting fellow trapped in that shell, but those were rare occasions.  HB used him when her kids were younger to keep them occupied, but after that, he wasn't of much use and to hear her tell it and her relatives repeat it, he was worthless, shiftless and would barely work.

But, it wasn't that he wouldn't work...  It's that he didn't have a great education, so he didn't have a choice to choose a job that paid him oodles of money.  He did the best he could, but it wasn't enough for HB.  You see, HB has siblings who made much better choices in their lives and they chose mates with a higher level of education, so HB was jealous of her siblings.  She wasn't being ""kept"" like they were.  But at the same time, she was.  She didn't have to occupy her own children and he worked his job and her work from home job for her, so he bent over backwards to make her happy, but, of course, nothing made her happy.  He died...  On with the story...

HB never shed a tear.  The nurses pulled the plug on him as she was walking out the door.  She didn't even stay with him as he left this world.  Didn't have any desire to.  Also met his wicked siblings while he was in the hospital and during his services.  Guess what?  They weren't wicked.  They are some of the nicest, kindest people I have ever met.  God, why did I ever believe a word that has ever came out of HB's mouth?  I am still in touch with two of them and I love them.  His family detests HB.  I don't ask questions.  I don't have to.  I know why.

Within two weeks, HB was unable to do her job anymore.  She was just too sick and unable.  The truth was SFIL was not there to do it for her anymore and she had a little insurance money to live on.  Not enough to last any amount of time, but just enough for her to milk it and then ~~be kept up~~ helped by her mother, while she filed for government assistance that she still hasn't gotten more than two years later.

And guess what else?  She was so bad off.  She was so sick.  She just couldn't do anything for herself.  So she put all the responsibility on DH.  The same DH with a mental illness, a full time job, graduate classes, graduate school internships and his own household, not to mention he's a recovering addict.  Ya'll, I knew within a month of SFIL's passing that DH would relapse under the pressure she was putting on him alone.He was obsessed with the situation of his mother and at that point, he didn't get that she really could help herself more than she was.  I, also, know she was desperate for DH to be her husband just as she has always been, but even moreso.  He was lost in the fog and she made him carry all of her baggage.  He had been managing school, his job, his internships and our home and had been happy and proud of what he was accomplishing.   And then...

DH started had previously starting experiencing severe pain in some of his joints before SFIL's death.  He was diagnosed with a disease that is caused by excessive use of alcohol, among other things, that was breaking them down.  He had to have major surgery.  We got through that just fine.  Didn't even miss a semester of school.   No addiction relapse and that is a big deal!!  Then after SFIL's death, he started having trouble with some other joints, so another surgery.  I KNEW what would happen with this one.  I didn't have SFIL to keep the HB away and he did do that, somewhat.

She expected DH to be there every day and answer every call she made to him.  Sometimes he was there multiple times a day.   She also started putting seeds of doubt in his head.  She told me many times that she just didn't think he was ""able"" to do this graduate school thing and change careers.  She even suggested he wasn't able to work.  Yeah, because she wanted him over at her house all day every day, because she was just in such bad shape and she was so lonely.

Next thing I know, I was accused of being ""mean"" to HB for suggesting that she was too young not to have any independence and I had also talked to DH about the fact that she needed to take responsiblity for herself and the fact that she was using him as a substitute husband more than ever.  It shouldn't fall on him and that she was intruding on our marriage more than she ever had. Honestly, at this point, I was already ready to file for divorce over his mother, but I hesitated.  I was miserable.   I started to suspect things and guess what?  Yep..  He was hiding pills at her house and she was again, giving him her own pills.  I suspected, but I wanted to catch it with my own eyes or by a reliable source before I acted.  I, also, made excuses to myself.  I wanted so badly for this not to be what was happening again.  And I was fucking mad.  DH and I had the worst two years of marriage, in spite of anything that had happened in the past, because HB made sure she was alienating and triangulating us and it was worse than I could ever imagine.  I expected too much of him.  I was pushing him too hard.  I was so mean to ~~her~~ him.  DH was unable to take care of the family (but he could take of her).  DH was unable to finish school.  It was too much for him.  You name it, she told him he wasn't able to do it.

The fact of the matter was that by this time, the fog was very thin and I had started standing up to her on a regular basis and I consistently called her out on her bullshit, but she still managed to really cause issues.  For months, she would call me expressing worry about him, because he just wasn't able, but..  ""DejectedDIL, do you think he's on pills?""  She did this over and over again.  Again, I know she was covering her own ass, but she didn't succeed.

I finally got my proof.  I just hate the way I got the proof.  DD went to visit HB with him one afternoon after school and heard him ask HB for one of her pills.  She texted me from HBs.  I told her to act like she didn't hear a word, go home and go to her room and let me know when they had gotten home.  So she did.  I immediately called HB who ~~came clean~~ lied like a motherfucker.  DD misheard her.  She hasn't been giving him any pills.  I called that woman everything, but her name and told her what a lying, manipulative, sorry ass bitch she is.  That is the last time I ever spoke a word to that bitch.  (8 months NC, yay!)  She immediately called DH who called me.  I calmly told him I have had all I can take and it's time for him to pack his things and leave.  I can't support him when he has someone so intent on pulling him down and keeping him there for her own benefit, nor can I support him when he is so willing to allow it and after the way he has neglected his own wife in favor of a marriage to his mother and drugs.

When I got home, he was gone and this was the beginning of the real awakening.  I immediately made an appointment with a counselor and I started reading everything I could get my hands on.  It all started by googling ""mother in law substitutes son for husband"". Ya'll I was mad as hell.  That's not even a good description I was so mad.  The hard part was having to tell DS when he got home and watching him cry.  DD was mad as hell, too.  It was from disappointment and from the fact that HB essentially tried to make her out to be a liar when she is the pathological liar, herself.  That was the point that I realized how much my children loved DH, but at the same time, I was not willing to be the only one with will power and a backbone anymore, nor was I willing to be the other woman in favor of his mother.

I filed for divorce.

An added comment:  I never asked DH not to do things for HB.  In fact, I encouraged him to do little things for her and I told him to do some things for her.  I know that, regardless of her behavior, she lost a spouse and would need support.  It's just that when you give HB a little, she takes a lot.  I don't want anybody to think I'm insensitive to the death of a spouse.

8pop8j,1,2018-06-08,OnCenter’s On-Screen Takeoff tips?,thetyh,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/8pop8j/oncenters_onscreen_takeoff_tips/,"I’m currently interning with a company that utilizes OST, and I’ll be working in it for the next few weeks.  One thing I noticed was how inefficient the current methods they’re using for line-items is.
1) They just realized the preconstruction manager wasn’t even on the central server for bids (he was recently hired, but IT didn’t set it up, and I don’t think IT knows much about the software defaults) - this issue is now fixed..
2) Anytime a takeoff is done for any material, they select a condition, click on the search box to find the corresponding phase number, select it.
3) Select the takeoff type (linear, area, count)
4) Name whatever it is they’re using (ACT-1 ceiling as an example) but it’ll be “ACT-1 First Floor” or the likes.
5) Choose to use both area, and perimeter as the measurement (which is fine, but more clicks, etc)
6) finally get the takeoff for the ceiling.

Then they print it off, and manually input it into Timberline (I’m still not 100% sure why, something with the subcontractors numbers, idk) I just feel like there’s a better way to manipulate info between the two but I guess that would be too easy.

So I was talking with one of the estimators and he told me that he didn’t know much about the software, but that’s just how they’d always done it and he told me to feel free to utilize the online training vids, etc to see if I find any tips to help them out.

I found that you can save styles, save style groups, and (hopefully) will figure out how to have them default open when starting a new bid.  His eyes lit up and he realized that once a database of styles/materials was made, it’d make everything much more consistent between estimates, projects, etc.

So I have two questions, 1) is there a simple way to create a styles library or is it the kind of thing that needs to have a good bit of time put in just crunching away at specs/data input

And 2)is there a way to import sheets with hot links from PDF’s to details (like bluebeam does) so you can view the schedule/details without much effort other than clicking on the hot link, or is that a manual thing for each sheet..

I’ve been working on the VDC side of things with coordination, but the VDC coordinator is on vacation next week and I’m interested in pretty much all aspects of pre-construction, so I’d love to know if there’s any “default styles library” I just happened to miss somewhere when playing around with the styles, or if there are any shortcuts to creating a styles database (possibly import their Timberline database (if that’s even possible to export....))

I’m still not 100% sure why both softwares are used, but having used Timberline in the past, I know it definitely is great for producing a detailed estimate, but can On-Screen produce a similar output and they’ve only been using 10% of the capabilities?

Sorry for the long post, just a curious intern.

I’m hoping a different office will have a styles library we can import, but that’s wishful thinking."

Some guys think I must be inundated with responses. That is true with other rp's but not this one. So don't be scared.

 I'm looking for someone to play a hypnosis rp. I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before don't be scared of trying again.

It’s an old Mac (OS X Lion 10.7.5) and we have had it 8 years now. I think it’s dying since after 2 days from the last de\-frag, it slows right down and eventually freezes within an hour, especially when I am online. I would wait until Christmas for more savings but this is getting in the way of doing coursework, internship applications etc. I am dependent on public or college libraries and computer suites atm.   
   
 

The main things I want this laptop for are quite basic:   
 

1. Word processing (Microsoft Office, blogging, application forms)   
 

2. Social media; Facebook, Skype, video chat  
 

3. Internet esp. Youtube, Reddit, Quora, Amazon,   
 

4. Media e.g. DVD, CD  
 

5. Backing up media e.g. photos from phone   
 

I don’t really need a gaming engine. Price range up to £600; don’t think I can afford a Mac right now.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/8plfn0/i_may_have_ruined_my_shortlived_teaching_career/)

Take a look if you want, but I'll give you the abridged version in this post. 

So I've been teaching 6th grade for a year now, and I really love it, but my mental health made it difficult for me to finish my state assessment last year, and I ended up getting hired before it was finished, so my district gave me an emergency certification. I was still struggling at that point, so I didn't finish until February. Unfortunately, I failed, which I explained in my original post was due to some issues I had with the cooperating teacher I was assigned to for my student teaching internship that were out of my control.

When I found out I had failed this last March, I got really depressed and started doing and saying things again that I felt bad about immediately afterwards. This is when I decided to see a new psychiatrist and ask about bipolar disorder, which a few close friends had suggested I do. I was finally put on the right meds, which I'm just now getting used to, and I'm nearly ready to submit the assessment I've put together, but I didn't make the most recent deadline, which was last night at midnight, so I will have to aim for the next deadline, meaning I won't get my scores back until the end of July. This may not leave me enough time to get certified before school starts again, though, and my district's HR department is not going to happy...

I'm worried that I'm going to lose my job, so I posted to /r/offmychest about it and crossposted to /r/Teachers, but the first comment I got, which got enough upvotes to ruin my day, basically said ""I am depressed and anxious sometimes too, so I know exactly what you're feeling, and I almost feel bad for you, but this is your fault and you should be a grownup about it. Why did you even post this here?"" ... I mean, after commenting back and forth, the user did help me understand the difference between deserving consequences and owning up to my messes, but I still shitty about their initial post. They told me I was just making excuses and reduced my situation to me ""just not doing what [I was] supposed to."" I know that on some level they are right, but I still feel like I was told that my mental illness isn't real and that I should have just gotten over it. 

That user's comment reminds me a lot of the ways I've heard other teachers speaking about mental illness. It seems like teachers can't fully accept the idea of mental illness because they need to believe every student has control over their actions in order to justify the extent to which the system is unable (or unwilling) to support students that can't succeed, even with the right academic or social/emotional supports. I have a student who came back to the school this week for the first time in almost a month because of her depression, but the only comments I've heard about it from other teachers have been focused on how her mom just needs to get her back in school so she can finish her state testing... I also have a student who has terrible anxiety and has frequent breakdowns in class. She is widely regarded as being too dramatic, and teachers talk about her like she just needs to grow up, but one of the boys in the other sixth grade class who acts the same way is very well liked by the staff, who all feel very sorry for him, and I can't help but feel like it's because his grades are so, so much better than my student's. 

It all reminds me of the reason I walked away from religion, after two years of being a youth pastor, because my boss gave a sermon one Sunday in which he compared mental illness with laziness and addiction and asked us to stop holding onto these issues by letting go of our pride and giving God control. I'm not saying all faiths are like this, but it occurred to me then that many religious fundamentalists refuse to take mental illness seriously because it challenges their belief that everyone is responsible for the bad things they do and deserve to suffer because of them.

Similarly, I feel like a lot of teachers expect young people to work harder at getting over their mental health issues because it's tough for them to accept that someone could struggle to succeed unless it involves a learning disability or some systemic problem like racial or economic inequality. I know not all teachers are like this. I've met many, many educators that get it, but I just see a lot of teachers neglecting the needs of kids with mental health problems because it's not 100% outside the realm of possibility for them to succeed. I hadn't really thought about it much until earlier today, but it's been on my mind since I received that comment. Anyone else feel this way?  "
8pq0ow,0,2018-06-08,Sick of being an introvert. I am taking a new resolution today. Will need your support.,male_introvert,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/8pq0ow/sick_of_being_an_introvert_i_am_taking_a_new/,"Hi everybody!

As my name suggests, I am a typical male introvert and I don't want to be one any more. A little background information, I am an engineering student and am doing my summer internship here at New York City. 

I love reading books and watching movies. What I can't do is approach people and engage them in a conversation, especially girls. I'd love to, but I just can't. Also, after missing out on such opportunities I concoct fantasies in my mind where I'm approaching the same girl and having a conversation with her.

Well, I'm sick of this, and being in such a happening place like NYC is not helping either. I feel dejected sometimes. I wonder whether I'm the only one who feels like this. I am taking a new resolution today. For the remainder of my internship duration (roughly about 1.5 months), I will approach a new ""female"" everyday and will have a proper conversation with them. I will need your support on this journey of mine. I believe there are others out there like me who are trying to turn over a new leaf, but they need a little push. I will share my story of approaching new girls every day, like a blog, and maybe others might get the extra push reading these. 

Reiterating, I will need your support and any suggestion or advice will greatly boost my morale.

Looking forward to this ""adventure"" of mine and your support as well.

Peace out.

[Original post here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/6zh7pl/dtd_14_examples_of_infrastructure_all_categories/)

\-\-\- 

**Concealment Infrastructure:**

\&gt;Means to hide an operation from outsiders. Some Concealment Infrastructures are mundane, like a fake restaurant to keep mortals from exploring the basement; others are supernatural, which likely explains why so few beings have a clue of the existence of the Machine.

\-\-\-

**Modern Art Installation Plaque**

They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but sometimes the God Machine needs to hide something in plain sight. Whatever Non\-Euclidean geometry is within eye shot of humans can cause them undue harm and either destroy their psyche, turn them into stigmatics, or in most cases both. This plaque assures individuals that what they see is merely an optical illusion created by a famous artist.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

To protect mortals from noticing Infrastructure.

\*Security:\*

Several “art critics will be examine the “art” with fascination. These are typically stigmatics that managed to see through the illusion, but sometimes stigmatics are brought in.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Behind the plaque is an aether exhaust port. Normally the amounts made are small, but the more people who see the “art” cause the plaque to work overtime.

\*Linchpin:\*

Vandalizing the plaque in any way will cause the illusion to disappear. Nearby mortals will likely lose their minds and many will become stigmatics.

\-\-\-

**The Dog Park**

Dogs are not allowed at the dog park. People are not allowed at the dog park. Sometimes hooded figures will be seen at the dog park. Do not approach the hooded figures. The dog park will not harm you.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

Meeting ground for Angels and Stigmatics. Sometimes Demons may utilize it as neutral territory though this is considered very dangerous.

\*Security:\*

No mortal can willingly see the dog park and will always avert their gaze when it comes into focus. A cryptid dog resides inside the park as its guardian. It looks like a normal dog, but it has an advanced intellect and can speak any language. The dog is supposed to alert Angels if demons arrive, but it can be persuaded not to.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The dog park’s water fountain expels aether in a liquid form. This is a trap designed to identify Demons.

\*Linchpin:\*

The dog park has a sign that says “No Dogs, No Humans, Do Not Approach”, removing the sign will revert it to a normal dog park.

\-\-\-

**My Other Car is a Pair of Wings**

Sometimes even Angels need to have stake outs. Unluckily they can be very easy to spot if someone has been tailing them. This bumper sticker makes any car looks mundane.

\*Type:\*

Concealment.

\*Function:\*

Attach to any car to change it into a different car with a license plate and VIN to match. Such cars are unable to be detected except for the bumper sticker which is very difficult to notice.

\*Security:\*

The bumper sticker matches the color of the car. And typically is only used actively by Angels and Stigmatics so there should always be one nearby, unless this was used to hide evidence.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Cars affected by the bumper sticker give off aether from their exhaust pipe.

\*Linchpin:\*

Removing the bumper sticker will remove the illusion.

\-\-\-

**Weird Part of Town**

This part of town has always been called the weird part of town. So when weird stuff happens it’s just business as usual.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

A section of the city or town that makes mortals less likely to notice anything out of the ordinary. They will still notice major breaches of logic, such as Going Loud or walking around in full Demon form, but something like minor glitches can be easily rationalized. This helps hiding some more overt tactics by Angels and Stigmatics.

\*Security:\*

Various groups of street performers are Stigmatics. These performers typically perform carnival acts such as sword swallowing and fire breathing.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

There are purple cables hidden throughout this part of town. They are aether disposal lines that can be tapped into.

\*Linchpin:\*

A “haunted” house in the center of the area is the catalyst for the weird effect. Destroying the building will revert the neighborhood back to normal and cause mortals to have normal perception.

\-\-\-

**Angel the Ascension LARP**

In order to hide in plain site the Angels have organized annual conventions to hone their abilities and share information. What better way to hide than to pretend that you are Angels working for the God Machine? Sometimes the God Machine will have these running with just mortals just to cause confusion for the Demons.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The LARP takes place in a small ballroom in a hotel. In fact the entire room is Infrastructure. This was devised to allow Angels to organize and plan without worrying about anyone overhearing what they are saying. Various Stigmatics wander the event pretending to be themselves, in rare cases there are deranged mortals who think they are just playing a game.

\*Security:\*

The shear number of Angels can range from a few to much much higher. Along with that the Angels make sure that only members are allowed. There is always one Guardian Angel known as the Storyteller who wanders the room making sure everyone adheres to the “rules”.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Aether is stored inside a carboard box with the words “Aether Disposal Tank” written on the side.

\*Linchpin:\*

Touching the top of your head with your hand while in the room removes the illusion forcing the Angels to revert to their covers. Doing so as a Demon is suicide. 

\-\-\-

**Defense Infrastructure:**

\&gt;Means to protect an operation once it has been discovered. Again, the means of protection can vary: Sometimes, it is an ambush set up by the resident gang that have been informed by an anonymous source; at other times, it is a Destroyer Angel equipped with a flaming sword.

\-\-\-

**Mob Mentality**

There are places where locals just don’t like outsiders. No matter the reason people in this town immediately have a dislike of outsiders and will defend the area as if they were white blood cells and everyone else is a virus.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

In the nearby vicinity of this infrastructure there is an atmosphere of unwelcomed feelings. Perhaps people in the neighborhood are looking at you oddly. Maybe there is just a feeling of unease in your stomach. People who live in the neighborhood do not get this feeling. This is an intimidation tactic.

\*Security:\*

Stigmatics who live in the area patrol the streets looking for people who don’t retreat do to the feeling. They will likely try to organize other stigmatics or even normal mortals in the area to attack those who trespass.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The street lights in town will give off aether every night.

\*Linchpin:\*

A local legend statue resides in the center of the place that is of someone who does not exist. If the local legend statue is vandalized people in town will realize they were being ridiculous and return to normal. This doesn’t mean that they will stop hating outsiders, just that they won’t hate you as much.

\-\-\-

**Police Lockdown**

Operations can be discovered by anyone. Typically in areas such as banks and jewelry stores are prone to robberies. While these buildings may be fronts for Infrastructure sometimes it is necessary to lockdown an area until an Angel arrives. Police surround the building and hold until an Angel arrives.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

A silent alarm switch that when pressed will bring an entire police force down on the location. The response time is high priority, to the point in which several passersby will setup roadblocks and barricades without even realizing they are doing it. When the police arrive they will use megaphones and standard hostage negotiation tactics to get the “intruders” to surrender. This is all a trick to get intruders to stay in one place while an Angel is on their way, which they refer to as an FBI Hostage Negotiator.

\*Security:\*

Stigmatics in police uniforms are nearby to act quickly before people are able to leave. The rest of the police force is typically mortals. The Angel is a guardian who protects the area.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Trying to deactivate the silent alarm via the cables attached to it will reveal that they are filled with aether and not electricity.

\*Linchpin:\*

If the silent alarm is pressed a second time the police will receive orders to stand down. Any mortals who were part of the lockdown will forget it took place.

\-\-\-

**Gas Leak**

Many buildings have gas lines. This one is no exception, though the gas is special.

\*Type:\*

Defense/Elimination

\*Function:\*

The way this infrastructure is triggered depends on the God Machine’s preference, there are accounts of doors and pressure plates being used. Upon triggering the building or room floods with poisonous gas that weakens individuals and can lead to death even to Demons. This gas cannot be lit on fire and will not leave the area even if there is ventilation to the outside.

\*Security:\*

Stigmatics wearing gas masks or who have a way to defend against breathing in the gas will be notified. A Guardian Angel known as the Exterminator will then arrive with fumigation equipment.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Aether will rise to the highest enclosed space in the building or room. This includes air vents. If there is an open door or window the aether will escape out that way.

\*Linchpin:\*

The gas leak can be lit on fire by a special zippo lighter that resides nearby. The Angel will use this to deactivate the trap. This will cause a fiery explosion, even though other flame will not.

**Logistical Infrastructure:**

Means to locate, collect, and transport the equipment necessary for generating Output. Depending on the operation, these Infrastructures can vary a great deal, from ordinary metal gears to an ancient relic of a forgotten civilization.

\-\-\-

**Mobile Command Center**

The mobile command center is a unmarked van with various gear and communication gear necessary to supply a small army. The main resource of the Mobile Command Center is the encrypted radio connection to “Command”.

\*Type:\*

Logistical.

\*Function:\*

Acts as a mobile supply point for Angels and Stigmatics. As well as a way of requesting additional orders.

\*Security:\*

The driver is a psychopomp who is tasked with distributing the gear and calling into base.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The van has a septic system as if it has a toilet. It does not, this is full of aether and is emptied similarly to normal RV septic systems.

\*Linchpin:\*

Removal or vandalism of the encrypted radio will stop the Psychopomp from getting orders. If not fixed the Van will not be able to find out where its getting its resupplies and soon after the Angel will fall.

\-\-\-

**Pet Cemetery**

The pet cemetery is said to be haunted by the ghosts of dead pets.

\*Type:\*

Logistical.

\*Function:\*

The cemetery is in fact a supply point for cryptids. Typically Angels have to enter with caution even though this is the purpose God Machine created for this. These creatures are to be trained and used to track demons, since cryptids can sense aether. The cryptids are animals who have entered the cemetery by accident. The change is caused by the animals falling into open burial plots.

\*Security:\*

With the amount of cryptids in the cemetery it would be safe to assume that this area doesn’t need protection, but in fact there is an Angel Guardian known as the Animal Crypt Keeper, they do not allow pets to be buried there.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The patches of fog that emanate from the cemetery is aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Burying a dead animal, not a cryptid, in the cemetery will cause the crypt to lose its cryptid making ability. All cryptids made from this cemetary are permanently changed.

\-\-\-

**The Mall**

Everything can be found at the mall. And for the for the discerning Angel on the go the mall is the perfect place to pick up a new flaming sword.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

Supply point for Angels. Various Psychopomps get their stigmatics to sell gear and necessary Infrastructure in this mall. The contents change based on the needs of the God Machine. There may be a Pet Store selling Cryptids one day and then a movie theater showing briefings about new missions the next. 

\*Security:\*

Security is in fact stigmatic security guards. There is always a bunch of Angels in the area, but a Guardian Angel leads security while a Psychopomp is the owner/supply manager for the mall. Additionally cryptid rodents of unusual size patrol the mall’s employee hallway.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Jet fountain in the center of the mall shoots out aether with water as part of the process keeping the mall running.

\*Linchpin:\*

In the security room is a two key switch that closes the shutters to the mall. Each key is with the Psychopomp and Guardian. Turning both keys at the same time will shutdown the entire mall. Any Angels who were inside at this time are unaffected, but stigmatic store owners will lose focus and either go mad or die from “natural causes”.

\-\-\-

**Elimination Infrastructure:**

Means to eliminate all evidence once the desired result is achieved. The method of elimination can be as crude as acts of arson or demolitions or as subtle as a loyal wizard or spirit that causes the entire town to forget.

\-\-\-

**Hard Evidence**

A simple manilla folder with a piece of paper inside it. It lays in a desk or filing cabinet.

\*Type:\*

.Elimination.

\*Function:\*

Erases the memory of anyone who reads it. It can affect Stigmatics and Mortals, but Angels and Demons are immune.

\*Security:\*

Sometimes there is a simple lock on the desk to make it difficult to find.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

If left out in the sunlight the paper will give off aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

The paper and folder cannot be destroyed by normal means. The desk that contained it must be destroyed.

\-\-\-

**Clean Up Crew**

When a Demon is discovered this phone number can be used to call in a “Clean Up Crew”. An elite squad of Angels with the sole purpose of laying waste to the entire area. It is difficult to clean up after and can result in major devastation.

\*Type:\*

.Elimination.

\*Function:\*

Dialing the Phone Number will alert a group of four Destroyer Angels that are tricked out in tactical gear. They are known collectively as the Horsemen.

\*Security:\*

When the Horsemen are called they each will have a small squad of Stigmatics meant to distract Demons as cannon fodder.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The phone that was used to call the number will discharge aether, even after it was used.

\*Linchpin:\*

Calling 911 on the phone that summoned the “Clean Up Crew” will send a recall signal to the Angels. They must obey this command or risk falling.

\-\-\-

**Love Affair Letter**

Destroying minds and bodies is good, but how about eliminating relationships? The God Machine sometimes needs to replace a target’s loved ones with Angels who will act as Guardians or possibly as just part of the Angel’s cover.

\*Type:\*

.Elimination.

\*Function:\*

The letter is left where the target can find it, with the name of their lover on it. Opening it up shows a very romantic love letter to the target’s wife, husband, ect... The target can’t believe that their significant other is cheating on them with another person and breaks up with them. The act of reading the letter causes the target to discard the letter, which is then grabbed by the Messenger Angel who delivered it.

\*Security:\*

The letter is delivered by a Messenger Angel who will recover it once the target has read it. The letter may be crumpled or torn up, but the Messenger must collect it. Afterwards the letter is delievered to a Guardian Angel who watches over all the letters.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The target who read the letter will generate aether until a certain time period or the linchpin is destroyed. Sometimes Angels will consider this a reasonable risk in order to maintain their goal.

\*Linchpin:\*

Burning the letter will release its hold over the target. This will not fix the relationship that was lost, but allows for the target to rebuild it if they desire.

\-\-\-

**Command and Control:**

The central unit that directs the operation and coordinates the various factors that eventually lead to the creation of the matrix. A Command and Control Infrastructure has never been observed, but there are rumors among the Unchained that by altering one of these Infrastructures, the plans of the God\-Machine can be severely set back.

\-\-\-

**Cloud Computing**

With the advent of technology the God Machine has learned to hide portions of its operating unit across multiple supercomputers. This means that as long as a certain number of these servers are running the God Machine’s Command and Control systems are still operational

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

At least five servers contain this special software. They are housed separately within the same functional area, typically a single city. They will relay information to computers of Messengers who will intern disseminate the information to other Angels, they do not know where the servers are located, but can access them remotely via VPNs.

\*Security:\*

Teams of four Guardian Angels guard each server, their covers are based on the building they are hidden in which can be a teacher for a school or even the President of the United States in the White House. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Each server has aether disposal through HVAC systems. Because of the sheer amount of energy being used to keep these systems going filters are in place to gather aether to avoid detection.

\*Linchpin:\*

Shutting down one server will not stop the Cloud. Each server must be shutdown simultaneously. Coupled with the fact that each server is protected by any number of additional defenses beyond their four guardians it is near impossible without numbers and luck on the Demon’s side.

\-\-\-

**The Church**

The God Machine has existed long before computers were even dreamt of. Before the advent of technology the God Machine had to be more subtle to get their message to the Angels. A religious person is given visions of the God Machine’s will which is then relayed through channels to the Angels.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The God Machine has possessed a human with a large amount of faith. They believe they are talking to God and that they are speaking through him. This is partially true. The prophet of the God Machine will read to a congregation that is secretly coded messages from the God Machine to Messenger Angels.

\*Security:\*

The congregation for the church is made up of Stigmatics and Angels. Guardian Angels act as part of the Church’s volunteer outreach organizations in order to stay close to the prophet. Due to the God Machine’s protection the Prophet is unaffected by Embeds that would instantly end their life.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The religious building that the prophet preaches at generates aether as they connect to the God Machine. When the connection is broken the aether dissolves.

\*Linchpin:\*

The Prophet is both the Infrastructure and the Linchpin. They are still mortal. Killing the Prophet is not the best decision as it is an overt action that puts Demons at risk. Manipulating the Prophet to lose faith or join a new religion is a less messy way of destorying the Infrastructure.

\-\-\-

**Magic Eight ball**

Sometimes the simplest device can create the most complex matrix. The purpose of the Magic Eightball should be hidden from Demons almost completely. They can tell it is Infrastructure, but that's as far as they can tell. It uses the least amount of energy that the God Machine possesses to work, small but effective.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The God Machine created this infrastructure to pass itself around from place to place. Both mortals and Angels alike will pick up the Magic Eight Ball and be compelled to shake it. The result will always point to a new task that must be completed. If the magic eight ball has no use for their current wielder it will roll away or otherwise .

\*Security:\*

The Magic Eight Ball will roll out of people’s hands when they complete a necessary task. It disappears when this happens. If someone shakes the eight ball and doesn’t immediately follow its orders the wielder the ball will try to escape, first subtly then overtly. It can get quite far under its own power, a Demon who once held it turned away for a second only to see it driving away in the back of someone’s car seconds later.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the magic eight ball is shaken and read a small puff of aether is released.

\*Linchpin:\*

Breaking the magic eight ball’s glass bottom and taking the answer die from it will destroy the Infrastructure. The eight ball will try to prevent this from happening by purposefully falling out of the attack’s hand and/or rolling away."

8pqhuj,1718,2018-06-09,Ruining Skylar,jigarkhor,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/8pqhuj/ruining_skylar/,"After college, I was recruited by a company to take part in a paid internship in a foreign country. The company was American, and so were most of my coworkers, but there were several international offices, and I had landed a spot in a pretty popular one.

Now, I hadn't gotten this job based on my looks. In fact, if I hadn't been studying a foreign language (Persian) I absolutely wouldn't had gotten the gig, and that was made clear to me from the start of it. While the everyday work had literally nothing to do with Persian or any countries that speak the language, there was occasionally the need for a translator specifically in that language, and the company had no one else who fit that role. My Persian wasn't perfect by any means, but I promised them it was a work in progress and that it would suffice.

I was hired with three other paid interns, one of them a tall, socially awkward man named Skylar. Now, simply put, Skylar had no idea when to shut up. His routine - and I was convinced that he practiced this - was to rudely start conversations with people by asking uncomfortable, personal, or out of place questions, and then follow up on these questions with a Devil's Advocate kind of conversation. Nobody enjoyed being around Skylar, and he wasn't emphatically good at the job, but I paid it little mind.

Skylar had been studying the language native to the country we were living in. He frequently and loudly criticized me for not learning or being interested in this language, but I maintained that it was in my very best interests to study and perfect my Persian, and noted that I had a pretty good set of relationships with the Persian-speaking immigrant community. No harm done, right?

Not right. One day at work, as I'm coming back from lunch, Skylar, sneering, informs me (in front of the other 2 interns) that he convinced my supervisor that he could translate a Persian-language document with Google Translate alone, and that I wasn't needed for that role. My supervisor let him have a stab at it, and he gave it back a fully translated a little bit later. He then said to me that it seems my language abilities were ""not necessary"" in the first place.

To this day, I don't know why I didn't just push him out the 7th story of that building (which we were on). I went back to the office after lunch and, sure enough, my supervisor confirmed that Skylar was able to translate the document.

Look, some people have different interests. You like football, I like basketball. You study this foreign language? I study Persian. There's no need to degrade my interests, and certainly no reason to professionally threaten me over different interests.

I politely asked my supervisor if he'd like me to double check the document. He thought that would be a good idea. Great. Lets take a look at this translation.

First sentence: Wrong. Really wrong.

Second sentence: Wrong.

Third sentence: Wow. Impressively wrong.

Remember when your Spanish teacher told you that you couldn't use Google Translate, and that you might confuse simple words, like ""bee"" and ""be""? Skylar had done that for something like 6 pages straight. The translated document didn't actually translate to the correct verbiage. By the end of it, it became clear to me that Skylar had made up a lot of what Google Translate couldn't clarify.

I took my supervisor aside and started nerding out on Persian language facts, showing him simple grammatical inconsistencies in the translation, and eventually pointing out how the overall message of the text is changed entirely from start to finish. I underscore that Skylar didn't just get this wrong, he pretended to have it right when he didn't get anywhere close. To his credit, my supervisor rolled with this, gave me a smile, and closed the issue. Skylar wouldn't be doing any more language translations.

Except over the next few weeks, all the more important projects came my way. Things that Skylar and I would normally divvy up became my responsibilities. Months passed and I would go so far as to offer - through my supervisor - to take on a few additional reports or projects from Skylar's workload, to ensure they got done quickly. And I'd get them. Nothing that was too difficult, but always the exact projects that I knee Skylar was looking forward to.

As the internship came to a close, word spread that one of us would be offered a permanent job. Skylar had been talking about this since the internship started - almost a year ago - but we all knew what was going to happen. The boss gave him a handshake and thanked him for working with us, and let him know that he'd be considered for anything that came up in the future. I was asked to step into another room to negotiate salary.

I later got confirmation that Skylar's stunt with the Persian translation was a big red flag to the supervisors there about what kind of work he was capable of doing, and led to him becoming a low-quality intern pretty quickly.

Oh, and my Persian got much, much better. So fuck you, Skylar, for ever telling me what language I was obligated to study, or how my hard work was all for nothing."

I have an IT internship at a large non-tech company this summer that I'm probably going to make around 2200$ from. What should I do with this money? I'm currently living in my parents house and when im at college I live in my sister's house. My cost of living is basically 0$ because my sister and parents pay for everything for me. The only thing I pay for is gas and dates with my girl.
8pqyu3,5,2018-06-09,I deserve just a little better,FeatherNox839,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8pqyu3/i_deserve_just_a_little_better/,"At the end of May, after 10 month relationship, my boyfriend broke up  with me. To be fair, that month our relationship was struggling \- two  weeks before breakup, I was annoyed at him for no reason, although  acknowledged it and took all efforts to stay together and not go away.  Then, my annoyance calmed down, but we still conflicted a lot. At one  day, I was sad because it seemed for me he had not put effort in seeing  me, and he agreed, decided that, even though it felt good with me, he  didn't really love me and we are incompatible and immediately broke up.  And he regrets it.  
What worsens this, his decision was impulsive. He  is not a bad guy, but he should have considered that my father passed  away less than two weeks before. To be fair, I was alright at that time,  but, I believe, this thought still should have came to his mind.  
While  he mentioned idea of breakup before, not long after it he understood  that he loves me, he was (and is) grieving a lot about such decision. We  are on the same year at the same department of the same university, and  this semester was the most stressful we have ever had; we broke up  almost when stressful times have passed \- I think, he also should have  kept this in mind. After breakup, he came to conclusion sometimes he  didn't pay enough attention to his needs of spending time for himself  and felt obliged to spent most of free time with me because he was  afraid it would hurt me. I can believe that \- probably I was annoyed at  him before as we spent too much time together, and often routinely, so  spark could fade away. The problem is, and he acknowledges it, I  couldn't find a hint in his words indicating that.  
Issue is, he  already have broken up with me before, after less than 3 months from  beginning of relationship. However, that time I could understand him  more \- he was considering internship in another country for summer, and I  was really cringey \- not only because I felt that I would be missing  him a lot, but also because I was envious as I had never had internship  and would not get a one in another country that summer. Another point \-  that time he did that in person and probably had considered everything,  and this one in text while we were fighting. Three weeks after first  breakup, we reconnected \- even though I started dating another guy, my  friend \- he asked me and my mind was a mess so I agreed. But I broke up  with him, as it only strengthened the pain. It was sad to lose a  friendship, although some part of it was restored after, but we brought  back relationship with my ex the same day \- he contacted me a few days  before, and I felt it was worth of it. Lyrical digression: this period  of grievance gave me another friendship instead \- with a girl, and I  have never had better friendship with a girl, at least not where I have  been able to tell my feelings about love stuff.  
Well, he told me he  regretted cutting me off, and then we fixed these problems. But this  time I was less cringey \- I had a couple of moments before, in state of  annoyance, but I calmed down couple of weeks before the breakup.  
At  first I really thought that he didn't love me and just missed good  memories. I wanted to make sure he feels like that, because I didn't  want to feel like the breakup was for no reason. But it turned out that  his feelings to me during the relationship were blocked by his emotional  issues, which he had had before it, and he found out that problem  wasn't really in me, but in him. He visits a therapist \- he started  doing it after one moment when he had bottled up negative emotions about  me and it affected him in a bad way, so I adviced him to consider it  and he agreed. He stated more than once he should be more open in his  concerns and emotions.  
So, after two weeks since break up, when I  felt better and believed that I could be on my own happily, I considered  making up (he considered it too, which he stated to me even week after  this situation, when we had to run into each other), he suggested to  meet in person and think about if we should reclaim our relationship. At  first I inclined to return \- even though my family would kill him and  probably me too for having such idea \- as we figured out the root of  problem and he was going to change \- to not leave in such impulsive way,  at least. But then, I felt I couldn't trust him when my trust was  broken two times already \- I don't deserve to put up with this if he  snaps when he have not finished to change. He should have learned lesson  from the first time, but the second time breakup was done in even worse  way. I also don't want him to stop improving himself if our  relationship became good for a time, and the need to change would came  to him as not really important. After all, there are mistakes you have  pay for.  
It is such a pity that he is just a step away from perfectly  working relationship with me. We had really good time together and  managed to solve some problems. He said, after break up, he can't  imagine more loving, caring, kind and sincere person than me and  he had  never ever felt happier than with me. He seems to be a nice, albeit  flawed, person, he supported me when we were together, he admits his  mistakes, understands why I can't stay and says it probably was a right  decision. I pray for him to get through this pain and become a person  who deserves true love.  
There is nothing particularly wrong with me, I  think \- of course, I am flawed and there are things that would be nice  to improve, but I really loved him and tried to fix what's failed to  work even if sometimes I didn't figure out a right way to do it, and my  flaws should not stop me from finding soulmate either. I hope I won't  get stuck in this for too long (ah, these times when I couldn't get over  my first love for three years). I cannot completely block him from my  life \- we are studying in the same place, and now there are exams and  after them summer holidays, but we still have a couple of exams where we  might run into each other. There are also chats for students of our  year which we both don't leave and sometimes text there as these chats  help to sustain connection with other students and occasionaly include  useful information. Still, I hope this won't hurt me too much. And  though he was nice, I still want to believe I can find person with whom I  will feel at least as good as with him and who will stay with me even  through the hardest of times."
8pr5og,4,2018-06-09,I got exactly what I asked for,Theninjalemon,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/8pr5og/i_got_exactly_what_i_asked_for/,"5 months ago I dropped out of college and moved to Southern California from Rhode Island. I knew no one, had no money, so I slept in my car.

I spent my 19th birthday in a shipping container storage unit on a mountain. I was so happy to be having this adventure and I worked hard every day.

I wanted to get into advertising. I've got a background in professional video production (killer internships &amp; my high school production company) but wanted to get into creative direction for commercials. 

I did a bunch of free work hoping to turn it into paid work and cooked my dinner in a co-working space. I learned LA has a lot of fake people. 

One day something I made got noticed by another loser who quit his digital marketing job to start his own agency some 4 months ago. Something to break the status quo of small-medium size business conversion marketing. Something creative. 

Fast forward 3 months. I've been hedging my production skillset to make video ads that perform way better than stock images from Google. Each month we've tripled the previous's billings. This guy is a killer account man, and it turns out I'm pretty decent at pretending to be Don Draper. 

A few days into this month and I sell two campaigns back to back that are multitudes larger than anything we've ever done. I suddenly find myself with a creative team of around a dozen contractors and interns. 

It's the coolest shit ever to me. I love when a client decides to greenlight something risky, and it pays out dividends. I love having a team of ridiculously talented individuals all working together to connect a brewery to a California summer, or to make a small traditional chain restaurant edgier than Chipotle. I think it's hilarious that the reason your 60 year old NRA grandpa buys a specific leather gun holster from Texas is because of some 19 year old lunatic with no friends. 

There it is.

I'm sure you probably guessed I wasn't here to complain about all of my rampant luck and success.

I have come to think I've got a problem being vulnerable in front of people. Every social interaction I get is from a position of creative authority. I guess it's always been like that. I've been able to maintain this by being really damn confident and understanding exactly what I've hired someone to do, and respecting what they know more about than me. I've gotten positive reception because people know I know exactly what I want. 

I don't know what I want here. 

This has lead me down a path of what feels like total isolation. I live alone in my apartment. I love to cook but don't bother doing anything fancy because I couldn't care enough. 

I just want to talk to someone, but I just can't. My entire charisma relies on this whole ""Devil may care"" attitude. I really just don't see otherwise crippling obstacles as that big of a deal. It's kinda paradoxical that I can't solve this. I love working, I hate everything else. I stay at the office late and figure things out. It's so simple. When I go home, I think about my personal life, how I wish I had someone to feel close to, how I've never gotten a romantic relationship past a month. When I run around and tell my crazy stories people love me. I love the attention. 3 weeks in when I've run out of Dos Equis ""Most interesting man in the world"" scripts and I want to try feeling some kind of connection besides lust and it just doesn't work, I lose all my respect. Every time someone gets close to me, I just don't feel like myself. 

Even with my best friends from back home who I've known for years, I can only savor the trickling drops of drunken emotional transparency into my realm. It's as if no one wants to see the stressed out, fucked up reality of my life. I don't want to see it either. It's hard for me to even write this shit. 

Im going to rent a fast car with no roof and fly out a pretty blonde girl from back east that only talks to me when I'm winning. 

I don't know why I came to California. 

TLDR: I'm a fucked up 19 year old living by myself far away from home who kinda wishes he could do normal teenage things, to feel the lifestyles that I fabricate for a living in my advertising career, yet I'm seemingly incompatible with the true realities of intimacy and vulnerability associated with whatever the hell everyone else is doing.

One moment you're running away from a man dressed as a bat.  The next your in a cell chewing on an interns ear while he screams in the corner.  I couldn't help but laugh at the situation myself.  I decided to go with a good old fashioned classic Joker laugh, high pitch and ear piercing.  The chunk of ear fell from my mouth into a big plop of blood.  A few doctors ran toward the kid and checked his vitals.  They all seemed very concerned, however not one of them asked how I was doing.  Very very rude doctors.  If they had bothered to ask, they would have found that I am not happy one bit.

Don't get me wrong biting an ear off an intern is always worth a chuckle.  But I'm always blue when I first set eyes on 'ol Arkham Asylum.  The place was built to kill fun.  Grey walls, grey bars, grey floor, and grey ceiling.  The place is just screaming for a splash of red, a smiley face or two and joke to liven up the place.  But the 'doctors' keep their distance now, so it's a lot harder to get some of that red paint of theirs on the walls. 

This place needs some color.  Even the people are dull.  It'd only take two crayons to color the whole lot.  Old man with grey beard.  Old bald man with grey nose hair.  Old woman with grey hair.  Sun yellow hair with dazzling blue eyes and    
red framed glasses,  Old man with no hair.  Wait.  What did I just see?  

Now that is a looker.  Blonde hair pulled up in a pony tail, like a little flag waving above the grey losers.  Curious eyes darting all over the place, but really only looking for one thing.  And wouldn't you know it, those wondering eyes found their treasure...Me!  Mischievous, alluring and inquisitive.  I've seen those eyes before.  I know exactly what those eyes want.

Oh I can see it now.  Eyes like those only want one thing.  Their looking for an adventure.  An escape from this stuffy dreary grey walled prison.  Those eyes want to take off that lab coat and be the color for everyone to see.  They want to be ravished and fucked into oblivion.  And she knows exactly who in this room is going to take her there.

Maybe this week will be fun.  She's even got a fun little name tag 'Harleen Quinzel'.  My new little toy to play with.

First time posting here but I could really use a fresh perspective,  especially if one of you has experience in this area.

So I started a new laboratory internship recently, and I met with a new coworker who has been teaching me how to use the computer programs. It can become some tedious work so we just sort of started talking. I like him a lot, not entirely sure of in what way, but I'm interested to say the least.

However, there are so many hoops to jump through that I don't even know when to begin. If you guys could give any advice on the following factors of this situation, I'd really appreciate it.

1. I don't mean to stereotype or make unjust assumptions about a person, but I can pretty much tell that this coworker is somewhere on the autism spectrum. How can I indicate that I'm interested in him in a way that he will be able to understand? 
2. He's not my boss but he has 2 masters degrees and a PhD. I don't really consider him my superior but he's definitely ""in charge,"" until he's done teaching me the program and I figure out how to work everything on my own. Do you think an office romance like this would be a problem?
3. He is 27 and I'm 20. So although I previously mentioned that I believe he's somewhere on the autism spectrum, he can seem much younger than he actually is. Still, is this age gap a problem?

tl;dr 

I like this coworker/supervisor, but he's 7 years older than me, and I believe he has an autism spectrum disorder. I need advice on how to let him know that I'm interested in him. I'm lonely , and he's good company"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8ptwec,22,2018-06-09,How Midoriya could develop if he inherited his mother's quirk,ScarletCatnip,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8ptwec/how_midoriya_could_develop_if_he_inherited_his/,"I already had ideas about a weak telekinetic power, so after reading a recent thread I decided that it would fit Midoriya nicely and made it a quirk. It's not the same quirk as his mother's, so let's assume Izuku's quirk changed and got stronger.   

Midoriya’s quirk - **Short-range Telekinesis**. Its strength diminishes with distance. The quirk’s ability consists of *Telekinetic Force* and *Telekinetic Sense*. It’s like a muscle, when you contract (Force) a muscle you are also aware of its position (Sense). It’s also possible to telekinetically *touch* an object even if the applied force isn’t enough to make it move.    

Midoriya can simulate *Sixth Sense* and *Super Strength* with his Telekinesis.   

He can spread his Telekinesis in all directions, using just enough amount of force to be able to sense his surroundings by touch. It’s **Observation**. It doesn’t use much energy so Midoriya can keep it active at all times. It makes him much more aware of his surroundings and improves his reaction time as he uses both his eyesight and Observation in a fight.    

**Augmentation** is his Super Strength. He uses his quirk as *Phantom Muscles* to move his body parts.  Using Phantom Muscles and his real muscles simultaneously makes his movements and attacks faster and stronger. But his body isn’t built to handle superhuman speed and strength. Using the maximum power of his Telekinesis for Augmentation will quickly destroy his muscles and bones, so he limits his power output (it’s like Full Cowling). Usually, he augments his whole body, but in the worst case scenarios, Midoriya will augment only his legs with maximum power.     

He also has various Telekinesis techniques. 

1) When Midoriya lands a hit, he can make it stronger by telekinetically pushing the opponent right in the moment of the impact.

2) He can telekinetically grip objects to hold them better and lift heavy objects using both his Telekinesis and physical strength. For example, Midoriya can fight with a heavy and absurdly long pole holding it with both hands at the edge and with telekinetic grip at the middle of the pole. 

3) His Force Shield pushes against anything that tries to cross it, it can protect from shrapnel, lessen the impact from explosions, slow down projectiles, etc. 

4) He can push himself in mid-air, increasing his mobility even more, especially when using Augmentation.    

5) His quirk is great for first aid, he can telekinetically apply pressure on the wound to stop bleeding and he doesn’t need hands to bandage them, Midoriya can do this in the middle of a fight.    

6) Finally, he’s able to move using his quirk even if his body is exhausted and his muscles refuse to move by themselves.    


So, his quirk gives him great mobility, hyper awareness, superhuman strength and speed.  
And now, imagining how this will affect the plot.    

Midoriya spends his childhood mastering Observation and Augmentation, by the start of the series he can use both of them like they are completely natural to him. 

Bakugou is significantly nicer and their relationship is better, so they don’t fight each other in the Battle Trial. Instead, Midoriya fights Kirishima who’s his worst possible match up.    

Momo is great partner for him, she can create him the aforementioned absurdly long pole and other weapons. They may team up in Battle Trial, the USJ attack, the Sports Festival or the Final Exams. 

Midoriya’s team in Cavalry Battle is ridiculously mobile with his Telekinesis, Uraraka’s Zero Gravity and Hatsume’s gadgets. Midoriya smacks anyone who dares to approach them with Momo’s and Hatsume’s ridiculously long weaponry.    

He breaks himself fighting Todoroki and All Might recommends Gran Torino to Midoriya. Nomu’s Shock Absorbtion gives him the idea how to increase his Augmentation power input. He tries to use Telekinesis to soften the effects of impact but he doesn’t figure out the effective way to do it until his internship with Gran Torino. He also tries to think of another way to use the maximum power of his telekinesis.     

If Stain’s Bloodcurdle can’t cancel quirks and only paralyze body, Midoriya will have a big advantage. Even without this advantage, his hyper awareness helps a lot against Stain and he can stop the bleeding and bandage himself in the middle of a fight.    

Midoriya is more confident in his abilities and doesn’t have experience with One for All, so he’ll be less hesistant in a fight against All Might. That’s why he’ll fight another teacher in the Final Exams. Aizawa is one of the worst match ups against him, Midoriya needs to close distance to fight but without his quirk he loses the fight.    

He figures out the way to use Telekinesis at its full power. He uses his maximum strength to compress air as much as he can. Compressed air is very dense and hot, so when Midoriya lets it go, the air expands resulting in explosion. Bakugou is an inspiration. Force Shield lessens the damage Midoriya takes from his own attack but it’s still too dangerous to use it more than once.      

And then he proceeds to go full out against Muscular, using Augmentation at its full power, then using explosion much more than once and then augmenting only his legs instead of his whole body, breaking his body and destroying his legs.     

Mr. Compress will have a harder time capturing Bakugou. He wouldn't be able to sneak in and snatch Bakugou and Tokoyami. He'll call for back up and steal them when the fight breaks out.    

Bakugou's rescue mission doesn't change much. This is when it catches up to anime.  
Damn, Midoriya surviving Muscular is the hardest thing to justify when Midoriya doesn't get One for All.

8pusf0,5,2018-06-09,Loving for a Living,Vinylismist,Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8pusf0/loving_for_a_living/,"**There is a TL;DR at the bottom for the lazy or short of time.** I still love you if you choose to go that route. :)

What is it that could bring people together, transform the human race, and eliminate war, greed, and hunger for power? What is it that would allow for greater explorations of truth, meaning, connection, and purpose? What solves misery, isolation and loneliness? What allows us to give potential to a greater and better world to live in, where we are more harmonious, caring, and communitive with each other without having to fight amoungst ourselves? What would be the ideal solution to all of these problems and more?

Maybe this sounds cliche, but I think it's the power of unconditional love. Love transforms, heals, accepts, and brings people together. Love allows for the proper exchange of perspectives, creates empathy, and motivates us to become better than what we are in the given moment. If we are to overcome the overwelming hurtle in front of us, we need to love unconditionally and universally. By targeting this one issue, the lack of love, we can thereby target all issues since we'll be more empowered than before to combat them as a whole.

Now, don't get me wrong, the world is big and complicated and those issues I listed there are just as big and complicated if not more so. I think we can agree that, to a certain extent, shit is *fucked up* right now, and if we don't act amoungst ourselves, things may very well collapse underneath us. Getting people to do that is tough - our diversity of our lives, being, and existances are staggeringly different and various. The distance from each other (physically, economically, socially, etc.) makes it harder to gain proper perspectives. Trying to convince 7 billion people that love, let alone a particular strain of love that is sometimes hard to envision, is what we need to cultivate can be a task that sounds absolutely impossible from practical points of view.

Here's the question that I have though. Just because something looks practically impossible, does it mean that it shouldn't be attempted? If it's important enough that we need to act in this way lest we fall, shouldn't we be trying as best we can with the means we have?

I really don't see any other way out of the mess we've created here on earth. We'll either die burning each other up and killing one another over a competition for our individual survival (which, in the end, will become fruitless), or we will come together, love each other, and work as a whole towards overcoming the issues at stake. There is no middle ground that I can see - when it comes down to the line, either one or the other will follow.

Now, I'm 22 years old. Come December, I'm aimed to graduate college with a bachelor's degree in Audio Production. My job is being an intern at a live lighting/sound company. I provide entertainment mainly - an escape from the problems of the real world - with the occasional festival atmosphere that may cultivate some limited amounts of love for various lengths of time with people who attend by paying the $200+ entry fee. I want to not do this anymore, seeing the bigger issues of the world and what's really at stake and how much time we really have left with it all. I'm looking to change my course in life and sacrifice what needs to be sacrificed in order to get the world in better shape.

I am lost on how to do this.

I see the need for love as being the biggest, most important need there is. What I would like my mission to be is to cultivate as much unconditional love as possible amongst myself and others while convincing people that this need has to be addressed. I want to promote the cultivation of unconditional love by other people for others, starting a chain reaction that helps spread it as far across the globe as it can go. In a weird way, (and I hope I don't sound too crazy saying this), I want to be like Jesus, minus the institutionalized religious aspects. Promote loving thy neighbor and treating others as you would treat yourself.

I want my living to come from loving. While I think, ideally, money shouldn't come in between trying to love others, I'm trying to find a way to live, and living tends to require money around these parts. I'm down for finding ways to live and execute this that are abnormal, off the beaten track, etc. and that don't require having much money, but this also needs to be something that can be sustained so that I can continuously do this as well as something that's effective and ideally efficient since there's limited time to do all this.

What are your thoughts? What are your ideas? I ask you, /r/Psychonaut, because I believe that if we obtain this lofty goal, we can change the world. We can more easily and collectively discover the truth and the deeper intricacies of our universe. We will grow exponentially. Our collective conciousness will be stronger, more closely connected, and more whole than before, allowing for all sorts of beautiful possibilities to present themselves to us. I believe love is a central teaching in psychedelic and psychonautic exploration, as it is something that is engrained in our human psyche which or cultures tends to disregard. It's important to further this cause.

**TL;DR**     
The world has many difficult problems, and I feel as if love is the only proper answer to solving them. These kinds of problems are obviously very hard, and cultivating universal unconditional love amongst the world's population seems like an impractical challenge, but I don't think that that should stop people from trying anyway. I want to change the way I live in order to spread as much unconditional love as possible (for myself to others, and for others to give to others), and I'm looking for advice, ideas, and thoughts on how. Love is important to psychonauts because it's a foundational teaching with mind and spiritiual exploration as well as something deeply imbedded in the human psyche, which is why I come to you asking for assistance and guidance.

**TL;DR for the TL;DR**     
Love needs to be more of a thing world-wide. How the fuck do I make that happen?

Thank you so much for reading this. No matter how you reply, and even if you don't reply, I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU!!! :)"

I just started a property management internship with a REIT that owns and operates multifamily apartment communities. I will personally be working with 3 different communities, and I've been asked by my supervisor to try to identify any issues in these communities, and also to try to think of ways in which these communities can be improved.

So far, I've been speaking to some of the residents to try to get a sense of what they would like to see change.  But I'm brand new at this, and hoping to get some advice.

What are some things I should be looking for, and what are some things that I might not be thinking of that could potentially lead to meaningful improvements in these communities?

What would you personally look for and try to improve if you were given a new community to manage?

Thanks for any help!"
8puzy6,1,2018-06-09,How do I move out of a toxic household??,youngbull234,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8puzy6/how_do_i_move_out_of_a_toxic_household/,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently entering my final year of university as a commuter. I live in a toxic household and after months of researching, I've found out that my mother is a narcissist and I am the scapegoat child. My father seems to be a narcissist as well but serves as an enabler to my mother. First let me provide you guys with some backstory. 

I would slightly act up in elementary school and only occasionally get in trouble in middle school like alot of young boys do. I feel like the two of them used these minor incidents to label me as the ""problem child"" I think so because I was perfectly fine going into and throughout high school. I was always about a 2.8\-3.2 GPA student, so I wasn't great but I was doing well enough to pass and eventually get accepted into all of the colleges I applied to out of HS. My parents would constantly label me as lazy, stupid, inconsiderate, selfish, and manipulative. However, I know personally that I am none of those things. I noticed when I would leave the house, my teachers, coaches, friend's parents, and other adults would comment on how good of a kid I was. 

I am the oldest of three kids, and I've always been the target of emotional and when I was a child, physical abuse by my parents. My younger sibling was always given constant praise because she was more of a 3.5\-4.0 GPA student her whole life.  I always wanted to be proud of her, but I was constantly being compared to her and made to compete with her by my family. Even when she'd act poorly, my mother would just let it slide and excuse it. Years later, i've watched her grow into somewhat of a narcissist herself. She doesn't do any choirs, doesn't clean up after herself, and has an entitled attitude towards others. She has a complete inability to make friendships or relationships with others. My youngest sibling is a sweet kid, but he is constantly messing up in school, makes poor decisions, and started smoking much earlier than I ever did. He seems to listen to me when I give him advice, but my parents don't hold him accountable for anything either. So I am the only person in the house who takes all of the ""criticism"", emotional abuse, and drama from my parents, while they leave the other two completely alone. 

On top of this unfair treatment, the two of them constantly argue and fight with one another even though they are still married. My dad doesn't seem to have the strength to pull his own weight and relies on my mom for everything (which she probably set up in the first place to be that way). She's even lied to law enforcement multiple times about him but he still just takes it and will do whatever she wants him to. My mother doesn't take responsibility for anything, is extremely dramatic, jealous, and has ZERO empathy for anyone other than herself. 

I started to realize that whenever I wanted to be independent for myself, like getting my own job, doing my own taxes, or going away for college, my parents would discourage me from it. Because they run a successful business, they always were able to provide me with financial support whenever I needed it. They got me my checking and saving accounts, my own car, and paid my tuition so I'll be graduating with little to no debt. They also pay my phone bill, car insurance, and health insurance. I am extremely grateful for these things but I feel that it was only a way to build leverage to use against me when I want to stand on my own two feet and be independent. I feel like the glue that holds this family together while also being the one that takes the most abuse and accepts the least praise for anything

I've dealt with depression, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts, amongst other things. I can't afford to get a therapist. I don't think I have access to my savings because my mother's name is also on the account. I have about 200 dollars in my checking account. I am totally trapped!

I want to get out of this situation and MOVE OUT! The 4 of them need to face themselves without me. Although, they've paid for everything, I feel very confident in my ability to take care of myself as my emotional needs have never been met by them. I also have this car already, and have experience buying groceries. I also built my resume throughout college with internships and campus jobs that have helped me land a paid tech internship this summer. I graduate in May of 2019 and I want to be on my way out by that summer.  Does anyone have any advice for me? What are the best steps to take to make this transition and escape?"
8pva97,5,2018-06-09,Rant (first time poster),398166511,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8pva97/rant_first_time_poster/,"Hi all, I've been following this subreddit for quite some time but finally decided to post now just to get some things off my chest (sorry for the long, possibly incoherent post I'm just angry and need to rant somewhere haha) 

My mom and I have always had a tense relationship. Typical verbal and physical abuse, but she remarried a Canadian when I was 10 and when he saw her beating me he was like ""woah that's not okay"" so the physical violence has stopped at least, thank goodness. I'm Asian so I think in my culture hitting your children is pretty normal and I guess I thought it was too until this white guy came and was like woah don't do that lol. My mom's usually pretty distant. She ignores me but sometimes she gets in a terrible mood and takes it out on me. There's been several times it got so bad my step\-dad would come and stop her. He's usually pretty complacent and ignores what my mom says to me, so when even he feels the need to say something I know it's bad. 

I chose accounting as my concentration for university and since the get go my mom has been making comments like ""my client is an accountant and she hates her job"" ""my friend says accountants just do the same thing over and over"" ""my friend says after 10 years you get bored but you're too old to do anything else"" ""my friend says accountants don't even make that much money"" etc. etc. and every time I feel like absolute shit lol. She really wanted me to be a dentist or some shit that makes huge amounts of money (as if accountants don't make money LOL) She's always saying like ""I'm not like my parents because they forced me into medicine, I'll let you do what you want bc I'm such an understanding and forward thinking parent blah blah"" and then will immediately tell me ""but you need a job that makes at least twice the average bc I won't have a failure living with me forever"" like ????

I was accepted to summer conferences for 2 of the Big 4 accounting firms, and I got an offer from one for an 8 month internship starting next fall. I'm starting a different 8 month internship this fall with my university. Of course as soon as my mom found out she was like ""I knew you could do it, you're my daughter"" ""you're this smart bc you came from me"" ""I wouldn't expect anything less from my kid."" I remember when I told her about the conferences (which are pretty competitive to get in by the way, only about 10\-15 kids from each city in my country are accepted) she was like ""is it a job. No? Waste of time I don't care""

I haven't even started the internships and she's already like ""you know when you get older I expect you to take care of me"" ""I spent so much money on you, it's thanks to my sacrifices you're here now""

When I was picking universities I was accepted into one I really wanted to go to, except it was in a different city so I would have to pay for residency. My mom absolutely freaked out, told me no way in hell because ""she was not paying for me to go and party and get drunk when I'm supposed to be studying."" I wasn't even going to ask her to pay for it. I've been working part\-time since I was 12 and I had a few scholarships, also my biological dad was offering to help a bit and I was going to take out a student loan. I told her the annual costs and she seemed okay, and then literally the next day she calls me freaking out ""YOU TOLD ME IT WOULD COST (amount) TO GO, BUT MY CLIENT SAYS IT COSTS (3x the amount) WHAT A SPOILED UNGRATEFUL BRAT I DO SO MUCH FOR U ALREADY HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE FROM ME"" I try to explain to her that I wasn't asking her for money, and no it did not cost that much. She refused to believe me, and I remember very specifically our conversation""

Me: ""It doesn't cost that much. I did research. I looked on the website. I checked with career advisory. Do you really think I wouldn't know this if I was seriously considering this school?""

Her: ""NO I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YOU FUCKING IDIOT""

I ended not going to that university anyways but serious regrets lol. Life's good here too though so I don't want to dwell on it too much.

I was accepted to an international exchange in Seoul and when I told her again she was like ""my friend says korea is boring"" ""my client says korea isn't even that beautiful"" ""you know I heard nobody speaks english in korea"" ""I heard the food isn't good there"" etc. etc. etc. And then when I call her out and ask her why she's trying to change my mind (in this example and when she was dissing my career choice) she just acts nonchalant like ""I'm not trying to change your mind. Did I ever tell you not to do this? I'm just trying to make conversation."" Idk am I in the wrong here for feeling like shit? It's like I get so excited about these opportunities I get and then I go and tell her and she's just like ""hm well I heard it's not that great.""

I'm so sick and tired of having all my accomplishments undermined. It's like everything I do isn't good enough for her. And then when I do make her happy (and I try so fucking hard) she's just like ""well of course, I wouldn't expect anything less from my daughter."" I would get an average of 3\-4 hours of sleep a night because of classes, work, clubs and volunteering and my mom still wouldn't be happy with me, yelling at me because oh no I decided to sleep in until 9am on the weekends I'm wasting my life away I can't be a failure in her house.

I feel so tired and stretched thin, I don't even know anymore. Thanks for listening if you read this far."

8pvwgq,6,2018-06-09,WIBTA if I deleted this guy from Facebook and made it clear I didn't want to be friends?,purplejasmine,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/8pvwgq/wibta_if_i_deleted_this_guy_from_facebook_and/,"A bit of context. I go to an art group that meets roughly weekly - it's run by an organisation in my local area that helps young people with mental health difficulties. It's a pretty good group and it has a pretty small cohort, think 4-6 regulars. I get on with the people in the group, but this post will focus on one guy, D.

Long story short, D is a very friendly guy, and seems to latch on to people really quickly. I was nice/polite to him, particularly when I first knew him, and he quickly understood me as a good friend. The thing is... I'm not his good friend, and I don't consider him one of mine. The more I've gotten to know him, the more I find him kind of annoying and feel like I'm not really sure I want to know him. I've been trying to pull away for the last few months and make it clear we're just acquaintances, but this doesn't seem to be working. Part of the problem is D has some kind of mental disability (based off what he has shared, not my own judgement) that means he has trouble relating socially to people and understanding things. (He can get around on his own and goes to internships he gets through school/UK college, to give some context, he's relatively independent but still lives at home). He's incredibly tiring to hold a conversation with and uses non-sequiturs every other sentence, and asks a lot of questions. But getting on with people is important to him, so I've tried to give him a free pass and be nice, not wanting to upset him, while also keeping a distance.

Recently, however, something happened that meant I just don't want him in my life at all, and I'm really annoyed. The organisation that runs our art group also does other stuff (one-to-one counselling, therapy groups, etc) at their centre and they sometimes email our group to tell us about stuff that might interest us. One recent email was sent to all of us, and was telling us about two workshops on Thursday of that week. One was a study by a local university, who wanted to talk to people 18+ who had self-harmed in the past or at present, to try and make an app to help when triggered. You also got a £10 Amazon voucher for participating. The other was a workshop for young people with LGBTQ+ identities and experiences of faith/religion, to inform future support for that group. 

Last Monday, while on the bus home (we both get the same route), David mentioned to me that he went to both of those groups, and got a £15 voucher. 

David is a 23 year old white, straight man with no LGBTQ identity, no religion or experience of such with his sexuality, and no history of self-harm. I've known him for almost a year and I straight up asked him about the self harm when he mentioned he went to the workshop (we've discussed it a little before as I have a history). His response was that ""it seemed like it was open to anyone"", and he thought it was fine for him to go  - not as a place for support, but as something fun to do on an afternoon.

I'm really upset, disproportionately so as I was thinking of going to the self-harm workshop myself and feel like a safe space has been violated. When I go to these sorts of things I expect the people there to be there for the same reason and to share a history of self-harm, not to be people with no relevance to the discussion and no history (and a real lack of understanding, from personal experience with D) wanting something to do on a free afternoon and then *profiting to the tune of nearly $20 from the experience*.

I blocked him on Messenger (ie neither of us can send messages) for a few days after this because I really didn't feel able to handle talking to him, and worried I might send him a really angry message that I didn't want to send. I've now unblocked him and with several days separation, I've had a think. I don't think he meant to be malicious, but someone who turns up to spaces not meant for them, possibly making others uncomfortable, and doesn't understand what they do wrong isn't really someone I want to be friends with. He's a nice guy and I wish him no ill, but between how I already felt about him and this, I just don't want to know him.

I've been thinking about doing something like deleting him on Facebook, and then sending this message: 

&gt;Hi [D]. What you did with going to the self harm workshop really upset me, and I don't think we're a good fit as friends. I don't want to be friends with you on Facebook right now, or to see you outside of [art group]. I'll still see you at [art group] and I'm not angry at you, but I would like to stop being friends outside of art group. You don't need to reply to this message if you can't think of anything to say.

So... WIBTA?

TL:DR Guy with mild learning disabilities goes to my art group, has been rubbing me the wrong way for a bit now but recently went to a therapeutic workshop/study opportunity with Amazon voucher included simply because he likes to fill his empty days with social stuff. This has really upset me and I now want to tell him this and make it clear (politely but firmly) that i don't want to see him or speak to him outside of art group. Please advise my assholeness."

My goal is to make an app that scrapes live updated weather data from publicly available records. What I want to happen is that say anytime an official weather alert is issued, users will be notified in real time. I've been looking into this a lot and have an idea for how to make this work, can anyone tell me if this is doable or if I'm going about this the wrong way/should do something else?

So I'm going to be using Firebase to store user information/login stuff etc. In the past I've used OneSignal for notifications but I've been looking at FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for this project. So I was thinking that I could write a python script to scrape the weather data and host it on pythonanywhere.com and set it to run every hour or so. Then, from the script I was hoping that I could detect any changes from the last web scrape, and if there is a change (ie a new weather alert) then it will make a POST request to FCM with the weather alert, then from there FCM will send the notification to all users.

I would also want the app to show the new alert upon opening, and I think this part should be pretty easy. I'm assuming from the same python script I can push the new data to my FirebaseDB so then when the user opens the app it'll pull that new data.

Is this feasible or a good way to go about this? I've seen people say they've used PHP/Ruby if I remember right to write the kind of script I'm going for, I have no experience with either of those but I'd be willing to try if python wouldn't be a good option. What I'm most worried about is having the script be able to be ran somewhere every hour or half hour and be able to send post requests to FCM and FirebaseDB.

Any and all advice is appreciated!

Thanks :)

EDIT: Just was rereading the FCM docs and saw that I need to setup something called Firebase Cloud Functions which I'm not familiar with... is this going to be overly complicated/expensive and should I maybe just go back to using OneSignal? It looks kind of complicated but I'm confused from the Firebase site if I need to create/setup my own server to do this or if I can just import the Admin SDK... I've had one summer internship in iOS and 2 years of building apps on my own but all this server setup stuff is mostly new to me."

**LANGUAGES:** Dorminian and Varenthian

**STARTING LOCATION:** Dormin, the World's Fair 

**Additional Info:**

Coal: 639

**Biography:**

Hailing from a family of Ulthian immigrants from the early 1600's, Marcus was born in 1710 AE and was the only legitimate son of Simon Anthony Aureas being the Chairman and founder of the Imperial Faction. His father was one of the most renowned politicians of his time. Building his families wealth from political deals and more, Marcus Aureas lived a life of relative comfort in the Sasnian countryside, a far cry from his grandfather, who was a simple clockwork watchmaker. Marcus was raised in the same political environment as his father, who influenced his own political beliefs. At the age of 15 Marcus was an intern with the Imperial Party, working with his father in the political world. An instant hit, Marcus proved his own **Cultured** status despite his families humble origins. As he turned 16, he used his **Charisma** to be elected to the head of Imperial Youth Party. When the First Bush War broke out in 1726, Marcus remained underage. Despite this, the boy lied about his age and enlisted in the Dorminian Infantry Corps, 18th Regiment of Rifles and was sent off the Alkebu to fight. Here, he found his own skills in **Warfare.** When he was discovered, Marcus used his father's political influence to stay in the armed forces, but to be transferred far from the fighting into the Navy. When he turned 18, he was granted a commission as a Commodore by his father's recommendation. When the War ended, he returned home to tragedy. His father had died of cancer, leaving he and his half-siblings fatherless and motherless. Despite this, Marcus took the charge as his father's groomed successor and began to shape the Imperial Faction into one of his own design. Personally seeing to the dismissal and dismantling of every Party committee, using brute force and ruthless **Intimidation** to dispose of anyone who stood in his political path. Securing his position in 1729, he announced his run for Prime Minister in 1730. Though losing by a small margin, he secured himself the office of Home Office Secretary, the head of the foreign office of the Union States, and second to the Prime Minister. 

The Thursday Plot

In the spring of 1731, a year after being named Home Office Secretary, Marcus Aureas suffered one of the deadliest assassination attempts in Dorminian History. In the Imperial Conference that occurs each spring of each year, an intricate plot of marginalized Dorminians, several Shirvani, occultist and three Logikia came together three years prior, to plan the assassination of Marcus Aureas and high ranking Imperial officials, fearing his policies would further their plight and already brutal suppression. However, three years of planning was not enough. Though a good portion of Imperial officials were killed when the clockwork bomb went off, Director Aureas only lost an arm. Hospitalized for a good year, and given a mechanical clockwork arm, courtesy of the King, Marcus Aureas cemented his hatred of the occult, the logika and his enemies. Returning in the year of 1733, Marius pursued a policy of oppression far worse than ever before. State policy changed to immediate deportation of any suspected bombers into The Gap, and the liquidation of several logika ghettos and all their inhabitants. To this day, logicka and many Shirvani and suspected occultists suffer the worst of the worst of inhumane suppression, far worse than anywhere else in the world. 

His political aspirations were temporally suspended when the Second Bush War broke out. Reinstating his commission, Commodore Aureas left his secretary in charge of his office, as he went off to battle once more. Aiding in the liberation of Cyren with his airship, the *HMS Endurance.* Returning to politics in 1743, the Home Office Secretary announced his ambitions for the position of Prime Minister in the election of 1744. As political tensions reach their breaking point, Marcus Aureas is ready to ensure what he believes is his heavenly purpose to save Dorminia, becomes a reality. With his pack of smokes, and his family revolver, Marcus will be fighting for what is his right. 

**Timeline:**

**1710 AE:** Born the only legitimate son of Simon Anthony Aureas 

**1725 AE:** Is elected to his first public office, as Imperial Youth Director

**1726:** Illegally enlists in the First Bush War as an infantryman, only to be discovered and granted a naval commission of Commodore due to his father's gravitas. 

**1729:** Succeeds his father as Chairman of the Imperial Faction

You still think that I haven't done enough. What do you want? I'm just trying so hard but I can't seem to please you. You question why I don't take much interest in learning and practicing.

I'm going on a trip to see her in a week and need to make sure I don't fuck up and ruin everything.,transythrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8pxzsz/i_21_f_have_fucked_up_repeatedly_with_my/,"My girlfriend is away at an internship in another city for the summer and I'm going up to see her next weekend. Lately I've been more depressed than ever and have dumped it all on her because I don't have any friends. Everything in my life has been falling apart since my surgery. My surgery failed, and I'm going to have to repeat the entire thing. All of my friends have left me. My coping mechanisms like running and playing my violin and composing have all been close to taken from me for unknown reasons. I've basically unloaded all of this pain onto her, and haven't thought through what I tell her. I've said passive suicidal things like I hope something kills me and stuff like that.

The fuck up in question is that I posted something on Facebook about how I miss her and how the thought of her gets me through tough times, and tagged her in it. We've had this discussion before that I'm not to tag her in posts on Facebook, but it was months ago and I had forgotten exactly where the boundaries lie. I guess since I have pictures of us together at what is obviously a pride event, I thought I was allowed now to make posts regarding her. She was just livid.

I know depression immediately puts every relationship on the rocks, especially in severe cases like mine. Evidently by the you know, having no friends at all thing, I have just horrible social skills. I've thought for so long that I'm on some sort of spectrum, but I get differing opinions from everyone and don't have a diagnosis.

I think the main problem is that my brain to mouth connection is not very strong, if that makes sense. I have a lot of trouble controlling what I say and how I act. This compounds with the fact that I have a very very poor memory and I'm rather stupid in general. So I'll say something or do something and not remember until after or until I'm reminded that I wasn't supposed to do that. When a topic is brought up I often go on tangents and forget to let the other person speak. I also forget to do things like ask how her day was, ask how she feels, stuff like that. My social skills are very poor.

I don't think it's an empathy problem, I'm told I'm very empathetic, and I don't have problems with strangers (how I make friends and immediately lose them) and many of the books and other results I get when I search ""social skills"" seems to be about interacting with strangers.

This has to be fixed in a week, or I'll fuck up again and drive her away forever. This is the girl I want to marry eventually so that's just not an option but I really wouldn't put it past me.

TL;DR I have really poor relationship skills and have to fix it in a week. What can I read or do and who can I talk to to get this fixed?

ETA: I have a therapist and psychiatrist and have for a while."
8py7x4,10,2018-06-09,How do I move forward?,NearbyPotential,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8py7x4/how_do_i_move_forward/,"The last 24 hours have been such a roller coster for me. Last night I had a work event for some interns at my law firm job. I work with my boyfriend of three years so we were both there. Life has been very stressful lately \- long hours, unexpected house repairs, and an attorney at my firm just dropped dead which has made work a very tense, stressful, sad place. All of that was swirling around last night, and we went to a bar and then a restaurant as a group.  I drank too much very quickly, and ended up talking loudly to a co\-worker about how I had insecurities in my relationship and how I would consider breaking up with my boyfriend out of this unhappiness and how I was reluctant to do so because it would be difficult to go back out into the world, etc....while he sat next to me and all of our co\-workers listened. I remember that their faces were horrified, but there was no immediate consequence before I left. I woke up at 4am with that ""oh shit"" feeling and played what I would say to my boyfriend and how I would explain my actions over and over in my head because I couldn't sleep. 

This morning at 8am, I called the Lawyers Helping Lawyers hotline offered by my bar association because they offer free counseling sessions. I figured that what I had done was related to my social anxiety and possibly depression that I have always suspected I had but never got around to seeing anyone about. There was an intake questionnaire and the person on the line asked me how many times a week I drank. I told her I don't think it's how many times, I think I just can't stop once I start. She said ""okay \- binge drinking then"" and we moved on to the next thing, and she said someone would call me Monday to get me referrals and set up a counseling appointment.

I couldn't get the words ""binge drinking"" out of my head. Of course I knew what that was, but I always thought I just said and did stupid things from drinking because I was drinking out of stress and anxiety and whatever situation was going on in my life at the time \- not that I had any kind of problem with drinking itself. I am a high achieving person \- an attorney that graduated at the top of my class who has worked hard and tried to make the right decisions. I always thought that I was immune from this \- that this didn't happen to people like me because I do fine day to day. No one at my firm has a visible problem. I sat and googled binge drinking, and the stories I saw were just like mine \- people who didn't drink everyday or didn't crave alcohol, but couldn't stop once they started and said things that really hurt people or did something that caused crippling shame, guilt, and regret the next morning. 

I reached out to my boyfriend today asking if I could come by and apologize, but I didn't hear back. I'm not surprised, and I don't feel like I really deserve forgiveness or acknowledgment because I'm a garbage person who hurts people that I care about and embarrass myself in front of everyone at work so that no one will likely respect me again.  I was upset at first, but now I almost feel relieved that I've figured this out about myself, although I feel like such an idiot that this just occurred to me after 28 years of life. It's been there all along \- the happy hours during law school that I always got a little too drunk at, those times I blacked out during dinner because I was celebrating a little too hard, my best friend's wedding where I got too drunk as the maid of honor and fell trying to catch the bouquet and fell backwards off a bus, the birthday pool party I ruined because I got sad and angry and yelled at someone over nothing and drove home, and countless other times. The stress and anxiety that was always going on in my life wasn't causing these incidents \- it was my inability to stop drinking once I started that did this.

I don't know how I'm going to carry on with my relationship being up in the air, or how I'm going to walk into work on Monday when everyone saw me be a heartless monster, or how I'm going to keep going day after day at a workplace with alcohol at the base of its culture. I feel so isolated and worthless and ashamed. I really hope that my counseling referral works out and that things only get better from here even though I'm coming from a very low place. I just needed to tell someone about all of this because it has been so much to process in such a short period so thank you for being here for me. "
8pyadk,6,2018-06-09,getting over a rejection,bibyebaby,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/8pyadk/getting_over_a_rejection/,"Hello r/bisexual! 

So I was in the closet and in denial about my sexuality for a while until I came to college (currently a second year transfer student at a small, conservative college). I grew up trying to repress my sexuality and didn't know too many people in the LGBT community. In college, though, I met this amazing girl at work who came out as bisexual to me. She really helped me embrace who I am and eventually I came out to her and moved in with her because her roommate had to leave college for personal reasons. Four months after I moved in with her, I told her that I had feelings for her, and she rejected me--in a super nice way but I'm having trouble moving on from her nonetheless.


I think part of the problem is that I grew up very touch/comfort-deprived. And she's quite the opposite. She's come up from behind while I'm cooking and hugged me, she's kissed me on my cheek and at the corner of my mouth, we've cuddled together in bed while watching a movie, we've worn each other's clothes (we practically share closets), we've fallen asleep together while spooning, she'll reach for my hand in public, she'll leave small gifts and notes for me everywhere, etc. To me, these are all things you would do with someone you were romantically interested in. 


Absolutely nothing has changed since I told her I liked her and she rejected me. We still do all that, and it's killing me because she told me that she does all that with ""friends."" It physically hurts every time we cuddle together now because I want us to be more, and I know that she doesn't feel that way about me. I contemplated putting some space between us but I can't move out because I've signed a lease for the remainder of the year. Also, leaving my internship isn't an option at this point because I really need it for my resume. 


She also mentioned that she likes this other girl (who's a lesbian, let's just call her Tess) who works with us at our internship and sleeps over at our place pretty often. And I just keep thinking about how she and I are a much better fit than she and Tess. We like the same movies, music, TV shows, video games, books, etc. And I've noticed that she is not physical at all with Tess--I've never seen them hug or kiss or snuggle or hold hands or do anything that she and I do.  

Please someone help me get over this girl. "
8pyb8f,511,2018-06-09,I was her summer subletter. Here's how she became my cumslut sub. [MF] [Long],[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8pyb8f/i_was_her_summer_subletter_heres_how_she_became/,"With warm weather and blue skies finally and truly here, I thought I’d relay an account of something that happened two summers ago. I’ve had a few memorable romps over the years (I’m 27), but nothing quite like this—nothing as intense, surprising, electric, and emotionally charged (the lady involved had a serious boyfriend at the time). And I thought it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to write it all out so it stays intact as a delicious, detail-rich memory. No embellishments in what follows, other than some “dialogue” and approximations (where I put my hand when, etc.) which are obviously not reproduced exactly as they happened below. Read on if you're looking for a realistic retelling that doesn't skimp on detail.

So—late May 2016. My lease ends at the end of the month, and I’m beginning grad school in another state in September, so I’m really just looking for a limited engagement type thing to cover my living situation through summer. My craigslist search was sort of a mess, and too many of the posts gave off too sketchy a vibe (as it would be my last summer in a city that I loved, I was really angling for a nice, quiet, and clean apartment in an okay-to-decent part of town). 

Through a network that curates/advertises subletting situations on the nicer side of realistic options, I found Lauren (let’s call her that). Lauren had just graduated from a good local college (I was ~four years older than her), and was seeking subletters to fill two vacancies over the summer. Perfect. One of her roommates—her boyfriend of nearly two years—had accepted an internship on the other side of the country, while her other roommate was leaving to backpack across Europe and join *her* boyfriend somewhere in Germany (not Berlin, I forget where) where he had a residency of some sort. All in all, they were a professional and hip bunch—by extension, the apartment was exactly what I was looking for. (Towards the end of my stay, I found out I was paying a few hundreds dollars more than I should have. Lauren had a hard time finding a suitable third subletter, the only other half-decent one in addition to me also being a guy—and her and (*especially*) her boyfriend were leery about her spending the summer bunking with two dudes, so they agreed to bump up the rent a little for me and absorb the remainder of the difference between themselves.. something that couldn’t have worked better in my favor, even if I was out a few hundreds dollars more by the end of it all). 

Back to Lauren. She was originally from Montreal, but didn’t have too much of an accent (this occurred in the States). She was a quarter or half Asian (the other side being white), so she had a silky, milky complexion (and a slight summer tan), with straight black hair, and hazel eyes, with sparkly hints of green. About 5’7” with cute little breasts (maybe a B cup?) and an ass—at once full and pillowy while also being tight and firm—that made me clench my jaw when I first saw her from behind (and the four or five times after that as well). She had this funny energy about her where she seemed simultaneously reticent—kind of shy and reserved or mature?—but also perky and sort of energetic for pockets of time. She also had these full, delicious looking lips, and the kind of mouth that leads you to believe she’s quite adept at taking dick with it.

But between the fact that the sublet room/apartment was such a great find and her early and sort of frequent mentions of a boyfriend who I’d essentially be subletting for, I was pretty respectable and circumspect with her from the start—not flirty in any obvious way whatsoever. Our first meeting (where she effectively screened me) was pretty buttoned up, and our first few weeks living together couldn’t have been less eventful. We kept to ourselves. We were both kind, gracious, and respectful, and almost never stepped on the other’s toes—when she was using the kitchen, I was taking a shower; when I was watching a movie in the living room area, she was in her bedroom face-timing her boyfriend. Our conversation was neither colorful nor involved. Her boyfriend and our respective academic concentrations/aspirations were the two things that came up the most.

Towards the end of June, our conversation opened up slightly—her laughs grew a little louder, and we began discussing different topics (living situations, friends and social circles, and even college romance—while her boyfriend came up less and less). I even caught her allowing her gaze to linger on me a second or two longer than natural a couple of times. But, even still, things remained relatively tame and reasonably innocent. As it was quite a hot couple of weeks that late June, I took to wearing tank tops and sporty, fitted sweatpants around the house. By no means buff, I (6’1” 170 lbs) was still definitely toned, and my arms showed nicely in my tank top, while the outline of my ~7.5” (and very, very thick — likely giving it the appearance, and sensation, of being larger than it actually is) cock was sort of unmistakable in the sweatpants I began wearing almost daily. 

The last day or two of June, I was sitting up in bed on my laptop in the early evening, listening to the sound of the shower water hit my wall (my room shared a wall with the bathroom). Just as I was growing slightly distracted imagining Lauren running her sudsy fingers over her perfect nipples, her glistening ass popped out as she washes the backs of her upper thighs, the shower noise became a little weird—like the water was sort of sporadically hitting the shower curtain and a wall other than the one it normally faces and shoots water against. Then—a low whimper, followed by a soft moan. I was already hard and stroking myself before I consciously realized what was happening. I have no real way of knowing for sure if we came at the same time, but it sort of sounded like we did. After that night, I looked at her a little differently. 

Over the next couple of days, we were increasingly warmer and more open/comfortable with one another—before she was headed out to see friends one night, she invited me to finish most of a six pack of beer she left behind in the fridge. I had to leave town for July 4th weekend around that time, and she expressed a half-polite, half-cute kind of regret when I let her know I'd be gone for a few days. 

Upon returning, things were definitely different. I’ll go ahead and fast forward to the night they irrevocably became so.

I was finishing up some contract work one Thursday afternoon, and she’d casually swung by, asking me what I was doing that night. Work, I replied, thanking her for the offer and reassuring her “some other time.” Not even a full hour later and I was already regretting not taking her up on whatever it is I might've gotten up to with her had I replied differently. Another hour and I caved, texting her “what up,” and that I was freed up from work and was getting a little antsy holed up in the place, was looking to hang out. 

She replied maybe a half hour later: “Come!” 

“Where!” I reply, with a smily face—guessing she'd already been drinking.

She apologizes, “lols,” and gives me the address, telling me it “actually kind of sucks” and that she only knows “like two people here” but that there’s lots of free liquor and beer (a rich kid and rising senior at the college she just graduated from).

I arrived within the hour, and spotted her almost at once. I’m not sure if it was the alcohol or the fact that, by the time I arrived, neither of us really knew anyone there, but we totally opened up to one another, almost immediately. Just exploded in a chatty exuberance, joking, laughing, flirting. Peppered throughout our conversation were various “tells,” which increased in frequency and intensity with the approach of midnight. She began to complain about her boyfriend, his busyness, and even his longstanding jealousy. I prodded her on the jealousy, which prompted her to grow sort of red in the face—turns out she’d told him I was “sorta hot” one night when she'd had a few beers, and he’s long had some confidence/jealousy problems, owing to his inability to last more than a couple of minutes in bed. Before I could fully take in all this information, and still on the topic of her boyfriend and sex, she also apologized to me if I had “heard her with her toy.” I definitely hadn’t heard her, other than that one time in the shower (which I hadn’t yet told her about) and proceeded to tease and press her, asking questions and so on. Apparently her boyfriend ordered her a dildo online a week or so after he left town, and that it was “around his size,” (about five inches or so), which again sort of pointed back toward his confidence issues (she didn't have too much romantic experience before him, and he likely didn't want her getting used to anything different from what he was packing).

I teased her that the size of her toy was ""probably why I couldn’t hear you,” and then I advised her to size up so I could (hear her). She sort of rested her hand on my arm, grinning freely, red in the face, and let me know that I’d be the first, and likely only, to find out if and when she did (size up in toys). Almost as soon as she said this, she immediately apologized for “being weird,” and that she’d keep quiet going forward, etc. I assured her that I wasn’t kidding, and that I found it really hot when you “went at it in the shower before I went away for the fourth of July,” sort of intimating that I’d gotten myself off to listening her masterbate with the shower head. Up to this point she’d been simultaneously goofy, embarrassed, and giddy for the past half hour or so of conversation. Almost suddenly, though, she seemed to sober up. “I’m not sure it's wise for us to go on talking like that,” she said, growing timid, even sort of stoic, before running off to get us another couple of bottles of beer. 

Immediately I was regretting having taken a step too far. Hoping that I didn’t mess up the easy atmosphere we’d built up in the apartment over the previous weeks.

As she returned, I blurted out an apology (as I said, I was mainly looking to maintain an easy, stress-free living situation). She stopped me all at once. “Hey,” she said, her eyes lingering on my chest, rising them up over my face and meeting mine. There was a pause in her voice, and she wasn’t exactly smiling. “Let’s play a game,” she suggested. 

She told me to go to the bathroom and wait. She said she’d finish her beer—“a few minutes,” she said. If she didn’t knock on the bathroom door and join me inside by then, we would forget everything we’ve discussed tonight — truly forget (she made me promise) — and we’d basically not hang out with any alcohol involved for the remainder of summer, agreeing that it sort of opened the flood gates on some stuff that was maybe best left untroubled. *But,* if she *did* join me, she said, drawing our her words slowly, “we’d see.” 

Four minutes or so later she bursts inside, without knocking, and immediately started aggressively kissing me. This—this was my green light to drop the polite, accommodating roommate act, and inaugurate her into something else completely (later that summer, she told me she only intended to kiss me, and stop there). Her arms were resting on my shoulders, mine wrapped around her lower back at first, before drifting down to her awe-inspiring ass, which I squeezed to my heart’s content, letting out an audible groan as I did so. After a minute or so I was really starting to fill out in my pants—she wasn’t feeling me with her hands but was moving her hips around, rubbing herself against my hardening cock, sort of giggling and whimpering all the while. 

All at once, and startling her no doubt, I spun her around, unbuttoned her denim cutoffs, and pushed my left hand into her crotch, softly feeling her up, almost teasing her at first, before I began messily smearing circles into her clit, over her panties, which prompted her to coo and wiggle in my embrace, while I brought my right hand up and wrapped it around her throat, holding her body firmly up against mine, so that her shoulder blades were pressing against my chest. When I began to hear a wet, sort of squishy sound from her warm, wet sex, I introduced my fingers into her panties, which caused her to quiver and moan, while I used my lips, teeth, and tongue, to devour her neck. 

“Just you can’t fuck me, okay?” she managed between moans, before orgasming almost thunderously in my hands. 

Her legs noticeably weak, I ordered her to get down on her knees. “Take me in your mouth,” I said, her look obedient and hungry, her eyelids heavy with after-tremors of pleasure. She took me out of my pants and just cradled my cock in her hands for about a minute, alternately planting soft kisses on my head, my shaft, and the base of my cock, just staring at it, and looking up at me, jerking it slowly.

“Take me in your *fucking* mouth,” I breathed, harder than I’ve been in ages.

She opened wide and took me in brilliantly, within a minute she’d already gotten more than half of me in her mouth, massaging the bottom of my cock with her tongue, letting me push down on the back of her head, helping her take in more, tears beginning to roll down her eyes. 

A minute later and I was fucking her face—she was doing an incredible job, and much of what she was doing she was doing (I later found out) for the first time. I’d drank quite a bit, and so didn't feel so close to coming—and since the knocks on the bathroom door were getting a bit loud, we sort of both spontaneously decided to duck out of the party. Saliva plastered across the lower half of her face, tears and redness from crying marking the upper half. She splashed water from the faucet on her face, and buttoned up her shorts, before coming up against me—“We can’t fuck but.. fuck..” she whispered in a breathy voice, grabbing my still-hard cock through my pants, and practically licked my face, prompting me to laugh.

In the uber home her hand was bolted to my cock, massaging me, though we barely said a word the whole ride.

When we got to the apartment—I’m not sure if she sobered up from the alcohol or sobered up to the realization of what she had done: effectively cheating, quite seriously, with her loved and loving boyfriend of two years. “Maybe we shouldn’t,” she began to say, facing the other direction, as I had just removed my pants, throwing them onto the couch across from the TV. I hummed drunkenly, causing her to look back toward me, her eyes seizing on my bulge, widening, and she smiled, half rolling her eyes, quietly murmuring “Fuck it,” as she slowly approached.

I pushed her against the wall and dropped her shorts to her ankles, pushing onto the small of her back, causing her back to arch, and her ass pop out toward me. I buried my face into her from behind, running my tongue along her fragrant, almost floral smelling lips, and ate her out from behind. When she was dripping wet, I began fucking her with two fingers, at first softly, before long quite hard, alternating biting her cheeks and spanking her ass all the while (this drove her mad). 

Spanking her one last time, letting out a resounding crack throughout the living room, I let out a sentence I couldn't possibly have imagined directing her way just hours prior. I said it anyway, and without really thinking. With Lauren having orgasmed twice in about an hour already, and positively drunk from pleasure (if not also from the beer), it was not hard to see how I got away with it. ""Now take me in your mouth like a good little slut."" I pushed down my pants and boxer briefs in one go, and she quickly spun around and felt to her knees in one smooth motion. Without any hesitation. With the utmost obedience . She opened her mouth as wide as she could, and ran her tongue under the bottom of my cock, inviting me with her eyes to take firm hold of her head. And so I did, grabbing a fistful of her silken hair.

I fucked her mouth and made her beg for my cum. I didn’t fuck her that night, but I came all over her dripping wet pussy. She went on to rub her pussy, smearing my cum all around (she was on BC). She later told me that the sensation of my hot cum hitting her sex like that was tantalizing, and was instrumental in wearing away at her resolve against allowing someone other than her boyfriend fill her warm, tight cunt.

After that evening she was addicted. As was I.

I’ll end here, as I’ve gone *way* longer than I anticipated. Not cutting my story up into segments to get more “points” — just, for me, so much of the sweetness is in the detail, so I’m not particularly inclined to briskly skip over it. And I'm also not really looking to write a novel in the space of one single post.  

But, anyway: **TLDR — I sublet a room two summers ago in an apartment with a fairly shy, mature, and really sexy recent college grad, who at the time was in a longterm, serious relationship. After weeks of respectful politeness, we went from 0 to 60 in the space of about a couple hours. And I turned her into my little cum-addicted cockslut by the end of the night. Things only got better — crazier and more creative, more sordid and debuached — as the summer wore on.**

We always looked like a perfect family.

My husband is old money\-\-we're practically the Kennedys of this town, and everyone knows it. We're always perfectly put together, right down to the last hair. My husband, Anthony, is the named partner at his law firm that was founded by his grandfather, and he's running for a senate seat this fall. I know he has affairs, it hurts me, but he always have, and I've learned to accept it. Our daughter, Allison, is fifteen years old and the perfect blonde beauty queen that I always hoped she would be. She's on the cheerleading team, she takes ballet, and she's an excellent student. I'm the perfect wife\-\-I never have a hair out of place, I'm always running charities, hosting galas, attending fundraising events on my husband's arm. I'm the woman everyone looks to and wonders how I do it.

But I'm more proud of you than I am of anything else. You've always been my perfect, sweet boy. You're seventeen years old, the top of your class, and student body president. You're already so tall, I can't believe it! All of the girls adore you, all of the boys want to be you. You're the captain of your football team, you're dating the cheerleading squad captain, and you've been applying to ivy league colleges for next year. You have my dark hair and your father's blue eyes\-\-and you look so much like him when he was your age. I couldn't adore you more!

Which is why all of this came as such a shock for me.

You had been moody lately, I knew that\-\-your father was having another affair, but this time with an intern from his campaign, one only a year older than you were. I was so apologetic when you found out, but you were so angry, I thought it was best to let you work it out on your own.

Now I realize that was a mistake. A few weeks later, when my husband was out of town for a fundraising event, I woke up to the strangest feeling of someone pulling my panties down. Anthony must have been home early! I was so relieved that he had come home to me instead of his mistress that I didn't even complain as he pulled me up by the waist. I thought it was weird when he started licking my pussy, since he'd never liked going down on me before, but I was too busy groaning and squirming with pleasure to care.

And when he started fucking me, oh my god, it was so amazing! For some reason his cock felt so much BIGGER than usual, and\-\-well, my husband had never been very good in bed before, but now I was whimpering and moaning with pleasure as he pounded my pussy into the mattress.

It wasn't until I came around your cock screaming for more that I realized that it was you, my son, how had just spurted his load into my pussy. I was humiliated and horrified\-\-I couldn't understand why you would want to do this to our family, what what happen if anyone ever found out?

But now you won't stop. You think I deserve better than your father\-\-you think I deserve you.

SO I want someone to play my son who starts an affair with me! The fun part is that we're so big in the community, and everyone looks up to us, they have no idea how corrupt we are on the inside.

I want you to be in love with me, but I also want you to be a rough dom. I love the idea of you eventually getting me pregnant, too!"
8pye93,27,2018-06-10,"Well, I get to be afraid to ride the bus now",PaloPintoTourismBrd,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/8pye93/well_i_get_to_be_afraid_to_ride_the_bus_now/,"This just happened on Friday. It may not seem like the most creepy experience ever, as far as creepy things go, but it definitely left me shaken!

I go to law school in a smaller city, but I have a summer internship in a bigger city, so I'm living there for the summer. I worked here last summer as well, and walked all over the city and did all kinds of things by myself, and never experienced any scary or creepy incidents.

I don't have a car, so I have to take the bus to and from work every day. Luckily, although my internship is unpaid, the place I work gave me a bus pass, so I can take the bus for free. Last Friday, I was taking the bus back as normal. I sat on the first non\-aisle facing row on the bus, with my bag sitting on the seat beside me. A man got on and walked to the back of the bus, sitting somewhere toward the back. He was maybe in his 30s and had somewhat grungy, disheveled clothes, but I didn't take much notice of him \- I don't tend to pay too much attention to the other people on the bus or really remember what they looked like later.

After the bus started up again, I was in my own world, looking out the window when the man suddenly came up beside me and lunged out, grabbing my bag. I jumped from the unexpected movement, but had no time to react further before the man sort of lunged/fell into one of the aisle\-facing seats on the other side of the bus from me. My first thought had been *""*this man is trying to steal my bag!"" but he didn't take the bag \- just grabbed it and let go just as quickly. I thought that was odd, but maybe he had lost his balance (as the bus was moving) and grabbed the closest thing nearby to steady himself. It seemed weird for him to change seats after the bus was moving, but none of my concern! At this point, since he was sitting closer to me, I noticed that the man had a strong smell to him.

 The bus was running more slowly than usual, and seemed to be running behind its normal schedule. The driver kept stopping and getting off the bus, and at one point stopped beside another bus and was talking to the other driver about doing some sort of transfer of a passenger, I think? I'm not sure what the deal was, but the point is that the bus was running behind schedule.

Now the man did not like this at all. He started grumbling loudly and angrily. He became more and more agitated, and started walking around the bus, changing seats. Next, I felt a jolt as he settled into the seat directly behind me \- as though he had slammed himself into the seat, shaking the back of my seat roughly. I did my best to ignore him. ""Way to overreact to the bus running behind,"" I thought.

Next I thought I felt something hit my back. ""Is he...throwing things at me?!"" I thought. Maybe I had just imagined it. But I started feeling more and more uneasy. I noticed he was mumbling things under his breath. I couldn't tell what he was saying, and I had a feeling I didn't really want to know.

Suddenly I felt the man GRAB MY HAIR! That was it. I had been trying to ignore the weirdness up to this point, but at that point I knew I had to get away. I leaned forward quickly, yanking my hair away from his grasp. Luckily at that point the bus was pulling up to a stop, the stop just before the one I would normally get off on. I immediately got off the bus, too terrified to look behind me until I was off it. Thankfully he did not follow me off. I walked back to my apartment as quickly as possible. When I got back to my apartment, I took off my blazer and there was a wet spot on it. I'm pretty sure he spit on me.

Now I know I didn't handle the situation that well \- I should have told the bus driver, or someone else on the bus, or told the man to stop. But I was very freaked out and my only thought was get off the bus and get as far away as possible. And I didn't want to antagonize the man further or escalate the situation in any way \- who knows what he would have done? But now I'm terrified for the next time I have to ride the bus back from work \- what if he often rides the bus around the time I get done? What if I run into him again? Thanks to this experience, I feel like I won't be able to ride the bus without fear anymore."
8pyh44,4,2018-06-10,Childhood memory flashbacks,TitsAndCarrots,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8pyh44/childhood_memory_flashbacks/,"Today I went to my childhood home to clean up my room while my family was supposed to be gone all weekend.  I looked through my parents closet, safe, and filing cabinets.  I found old transcripts, letters, and drawings.  

I found a “humorous” memory I wrote and shared in elementary school about the one time I helped my mom cook dinner.  While cutting vegetables, my sister poured ketchup into my hair. I cried and was so upset. Then my mom took a pair of scissors and cut my hair off and said “I’ll give you something to really cry about.” Mom, dad, and my three siblings laughed at me while I sobbed.  I wrote about how funny it was and that I would never cut my hair again unless I was going to donate it again to Locks of Love.  

Why did my mom keep this story and the drawing of me at the hair salon around all these years?  Is she aware of how fucked up that was? I’m working through so much in therapy right now.  How can any adult grow up to be happy when the two most important people in a child’s life, the ones who are supposed to love you unconditionally without consequences, simply don’t treat their child with respect. 

I was almost involuntarily committed by my therapist this past Wednesday when I told him about June 30, 2018, the day I plan to kill myself. 

Why do I drag everyone through my own shit? What’s the point of living when your own parents are incapable of loving you? Why am I the only one in my family receiving care for mental health issues?  I am unsure if I was labeled as the black sheep of the family because I’m actually fucked up, or if it’s because everyone else is.  

I should be happy.  I’m 21. Beautiful. I have an amazing boyfriend. Going to graduate  nursing school in a year. I have an internship. I’m a great artist. Creative. Athletic. Smart. So why does it feel like every single person on this planet has more value than myself? "
8pyh9t,1,2018-06-10,m4F Trouble with the TSA,writingjunknstuff,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8pyh9t/m4f_trouble_with_the_tsa/,"I'm an adult looking for fantasy play with other adults

My school provides an internship program for its student; in fact, it was a big selling point for my parents. They wanted me to work in a doctor's office, a law firm, or some other high paying and college educated profession.

Oh well, there'll be other years.

I ended up in the TSA. Officially they wanted interns with above-average patriotism, an interest in other cultures and travel, or at least a passing interest in security. In practice, they wanted someone who could wave a metal detector wand and would work for free. I fell into the latter category.

My parents and peers all thought I had lost out on all my other applications, but I only applied for this position; not that I'd tell anyone that. I told the interviewers what they wanted to hear when they asked why I applied: ""security, patriotism, etc."" (I didn't *actually* say etc.) and when they asked why I *really* wanted the position I gave them my ""real"" reasons: ""a love for travel and a desire to observe the culture of the travelers"". I didn't *really* lie on that second reason, it **was** about watch the travelers.

Well to be perfect honest, the women. In the body scanner.

Not the best of reasons, but puberty and hormones and **very** strong motivators.

When I got there for my first day, things were not at all what I expected; they were much better (for me). Training, direction, and oversight were almost nonexistent. All I had to do to get on a body scanner was walk up to the operator and say, ""Hey can I-"" and he left before I even got my next word out. With so many people passing through every day, I have been able to admire many, *many* women at my station. Sure, I've seen my dicks than I probably would have otherwise but that comes with the territory. 

My nights became much more ""inspired"" after that first day. Porn is one thing but seeing an actual woman's nude body in front of you is life changing and I would have been perfectly happy to stop right there, spending my nights (and some bathroom breaks) imagining those breasts, hips, and so much more. But then I realized that I could push the envelope. It was innocent at first, a simple unintentional slip with the metal detector wand and I got my first, albeit indirect, touch of a woman's breast. Then a slip with a butt, some thighs and they stopped being unintentional.

Every now and then someone had to be taken for a cavity search, but I never dreamed that I'd get to do one of those (although I did have a recurring nightmare involving a search and a very enthusiastic older gentleman). In fact, I was surprised when it came time for my first pat down. With my other responsibilities I'd push the envelope a little to get the most out of the experience, but with the pat downs I was 100% professional because they were a true gift just by themselves and anything else would be flying too close to the sun. Touching a woman for the first time satisfied me by itself for a good amount of time, and every day I gained more experiences to fuel my hormone driven self-pleasure.

That's how my days went until you ended up in my line. Even though I'm sitting across from you in the examination room, I'm in such a haze that I'm not even sure how exactly we got here. Did I just decide to push my behavior further than ever before? Did you whisper something to me as I patted you down? Did you decide to stuff some contraband in your undergarments after you spotted me as the agent on duty? Maybe you decided you wanted to get me alone to teach me a lesson after catching me red handed? Perhaps I'm just investigating a mysterious buzzing sound.

ultimately, the most important thing is that we have a private room and that I'll **definitely** be thinking of you tomorrow.

TLDR: We'll see exactly how invasive the TSA can be with a young intern and an older traveler.

Reversing the roles (you as the older agent and me as the young traveler) might also be fun.

Relevant kinks: older women &amp; boys, and more or less realistic proportions. If those are in the mix, just about anything else is good with me, and even they're negotiable.

Limits: permanent bodily harm and blood aren't my thing, if they're yours we can work them in for you; but I won't be getting off on them."

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8pytwr,4,2018-06-10,My (27F) partner (29M) of 4 years does not know if he wants to get married,itsmeggroll,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8pytwr/my_27f_partner_29m_of_4_years_does_not_know_if_he/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years, we’ve been living together for  about 2.5 of those 4 years. We adopted a dog together about two years ago.

We’ve talked about marriage and he has made it clear that although he loves me and this is his most successful/longest lasting/most supportive relationship to date, he doesn’t know if he will want to get married to me in the future. He does see himself in a long term, monogamous relationship with me and he still wants to be with me with no reason to end the relationship in sight. This was how he felt about a year ago and he still feels this way. (We rehashed this conversation a few hours ago.)

I *do* want to get married and have a child, and I can envision this future with him,  which he knows. However, marriage is not as important to me as knowing he can see himself spending the rest of his life with me.

Part of me thinks his hesitancy is due to his current situation: he’s working an unpaid (albeit important and influential) internship and doesn’t have a full time job yet. He’s working hard and earning many advocates at this internship and is hopeful about job respects in the near future. He also wants to get a masters degree, and he isn’t sure where that will take him quite yet. In addition to all of this, he was accepted into a teach abroad program in Madrid that he applied for almost six months ago. I’ve made it clear that I am willing to follow him to whatever state or country he goes to- after all, he DID move to DC mostly to be with me 3 years ago (his mother also lives here)- as long as he wants me to be with him:

Part of me feels like I am wasting my time. Men I’ve dated and turned down to be with my current partner are moving on with their lives and getting married. I’m becoming hyper aware of my proximity to 30 and how this aging thing is a continual process...

I know and appreciate that everyone lives their lives on their own schedule, but I’m beginning to feel like my boyfriend doesn’t know what he has going for him, especially since I try my best to support him through his episodes of depression and anxiety (he sees a therapist and takes medication for both). I’m even hyper aware of when he’ll need his inhaler or breathing machine for asthma. We’ve had sessions with my own therapist together to talk about dealing with his depression and also how to fight healthily as a couple and learn/practice active listening techniques.

I love him with my whole heart and have been fully invested in this relationship since we decided to be together, but I’m beginning to think I should part sooner rather than later. I know I want a family and he isn’t sure he wants that with me. I’m afraid he is staying with me because he is comfortable with me and it’s easy. 

Should I leave my boyfriend?

*Tl;dr I’ve invested/continue to invest a lot of emotional energy in a 4-year relationship with a man I still love with all my being and want to be with for the rest of my life, but he’s not sure if he feels the same way.*"

Reason being is that the server is being run inside kubernetes and is using GRPC to create the endpoint. What sucks is that GRPC is using Java and because of this, it requires any endpoint calls to be a HTTP2 request.

Is it possible to do make angular send that type of request?"
8pz61d,38,2018-06-10,How do you Software Dev's who've achieved fatFIRE feel about college?,fattyfatfatfuck,fatFIRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/8pz61d/how_do_you_software_devs_whove_achieved_fatfire/,"So, my younger brother is going to be applying to colleges this fall and I've been tutoring him on programming for shits and giggles. He's picked it up really quickly and is good with Python and has a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (does Leetcode problems for fun and stuff lol and we've been through basically all the concepts in CLRS ... he's iffy on the hairier parts of the math but can solve DP problems and stuff and can implement graph searching algos and stuff like that). He really seems to enjoy it. 

I'm wondering what colleges he should be looking at. He's a really smart guy and I'm sure he could get into top computer science schools, but I doubt he'd get any financial aid. I'm going to be paying for his tuition though if it comes to that. On the other hand, based off his SAT scores and GPA, he's going to be getting a full scholarship to our state school (Rutgers). I'm just wondering what I should advise him to do. I only just started my career and I feel that school name is basically useless. What mattered for me was internships and I'm sure he'll be getting internships at top companies come freshman year regardless of what school he goes to (I know some people at top companies who'll recommend him and he's already really good at interview questions).  So, I feel going to an expensive school is a complete waste of money and that he should just go to RU. 

For the Software Devs who went to expensive schools and have achieved fatFIRE... do you feel differently? Based off how he's going right now, he's probably going to be making 140k+ (assuming dev salaries stay constant) when he graduates and should be able to recoup the 240k investment within 6-7 years max. Do you feel differently about your education once you were able to recoup the cost? If he goes to a top CS school, his competition will be way better than at RU, and he'll be able to make connections with really smart kids and be pushed much harder. What do you guys think? "

I was there with some friends talking with people on the festival, sharing our thoughts and showing some work. 

Then I saw the creative director of Studio Dumbar. In my eyes the best graphic design studio in the Netherlands today. I recognized her face as I felt a bit shy of her presence. As a shy puppy I walked to her and said I recognized her and I wanted to know if she have some tips for a future graphic design student. As we talked and laughed a bit, she gave me good tips on how to find work that's fitting my ideas and aesthetics. She said ""I'll see you next time on your graduation"" then I said ""I hope sooner when I'm looking for an internship"". 

I said I was interested in calligraphy and typedesign but I feel a bit handicapped because I'm left-handed. And she introduced me to one of the festival organizors who is left-handed too. Who gave me all the insights for a lefty to practice for years. 

During and before all this I didn't thought about any networking motives. I was honestly interested in the tips for the academy. But after that I thought about it and wanted to ask you if this is a good way to network? Just to step to people and ask for their advise. Because if it is I'm gonna do it more, getting to know people from the design scene in my area.

What would you think if someone came to you with the same questions? Would you find it annoying or would you be happy to talk to me?

Thanks!"

Started using CBT

Went to a new city in another state for an internship. Sleep stabilized and I had 2 weeks of sleep that I've not had in a while. 

Then 

I went out Friday night later than normal for my time here. Had a crappy night of sleep Friday. And now a night of crappy sleep again where my mind decided to relapse into the anxiety driven thoughts and I've relapsed back into insomnia. Partially driven by heat (it's hot here). Partially driven by noise coming through the window that my bed is next to I need to use to get cool enough.

It just reminds me how my sleep had stabilized but now it's not as solidly better as I thought. When I sleep good I don't think as much about insomnia, look forward to my bed and sleeping, and continue to sleep good.

Then something like being out late can contribute to sleep that is off balance and book I've relapsed.

I don't have a therapist here. I need to deal with sleep hygiene.

Just reminds me that I am not out of the woods even when things are a lot better. And I need to continue my CBT.

Any advice appreciated.,Nikica1234,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8q0ssi/how_do_i_stop_my_anxiety_from_ruining_my/,"Hi all! I would really appreciate your help as I am in an endless ruminating/intrusive thoughts cycle. I know this is an issue with my anxiety and irrational thinking, and not my partner, which is why I'm posting it here. I am just so upset with myself because I feel like I'm self sabotaging my relationship and I can't stop.

My boyfriend and I are long distance for the summer while he is away at an internship. He has met a lot of new friends and goes out with both guys and girls, and he always talks about what a blast is having. He picks going out over talking on the phone with me, which I was upset about for a long time, because I felt like he was choosing them over me. I kind of got over that, because we do talk a lot, and because it makes sense that he doesn't want to be glued to his phone, right? 

I told him that  I need more reassurance and love because he's not a very emotional person. Lately, he's been giving me SO MUCH reassurance. He tells me he loves me so much so many times a day, and how much he misses me, and how he can't wait to drive 12 hours to come visit me, and honestly he's doing everything right.

My anxiety can't handle that. I came across an article that said being overly affectionate means cheating because it means the partner feels guilty and is trying to overcompensate. For some reason, I thought that that coupled with him wanting to go out all the time and having a blast with these new people, getting drunk with them, and going on a diet means that he cheated.

Am I being irrational or is there something to worry about? I think he is reassuring me because he loves me, but my anxiety can't handle the fact that I don't know for 100&amp;#37; certain that something DIDN'T happen with some other girl, and that he might regret it. I'm terrible and I even asked him about it and he has told me that he promises nothing at all happened and that he'd never cheat.

How do I get over this? It's not even a trust issue, it's not a relationship issue, it's my anxiety finding the good things in my life and latching onto them and ruining them.

Thank you all SO much."

I have had 3 interviews by now, 2 of which I made it to last round but didn't get the job. Besides the lack of effort on my part (didn't apply as much as I should have), the lack of a good internship experience (had a 2-month internship at a friend's incubator startup, some TA and assistantship experience), and the lack of interview confidence/experience, my skill in actual development is probably to blame.

I know this is the case for a lot of CS undergrads just coming out of college, but my education path has been particularly math heavy. I've mostly opted for classes that count as both math and CS courses to kill two birds with one stone (e.g. graph theory, cryptology, ...), and these courses lack hands-on programming. 

In addition, I am only now just starting to get into web dev (6-month ago, I didn’t even know what MongoDB was, or how to request a POST method), so a lot of the companies out there hiring for full time positions are going to raise their eye brows at me. I’ve had an interview where the interviewer partially realized this, and changed directions for me to ask more “fundamental” CS questions like “how does a DNS resolve URLs?” And I felt so embarrassed because I really didn’t know at the time. 

Everyone tells me how desirable my degree is, but in my experience, more traditional companies hiring for full time SWE positions want mostly professionals with great development knowledge. Or, in the cases of larger companies like Google or Facebook, are willing to hire “smart” people and train them. This occurs mostly for internships or people with very impressive theoretical backgrounds. I can’t really apply for internships anymore since I graduated, and my background is just average. Besides, the prime time for hiring from these big companies are mostly in the Fall.

So I’m wondering what Reddit would recommend or advise me to do? How can someone in my situation market themselves? Or what could someone like me do to get a good job fast? "

I have a Nintendo Switch so after seeing the trailer for Pokemon Lets go Pikachu and Eevee I immediately got hyped. Now I have 10gb of data per month. I didn't care if I would play alone or if nobody is interested in the game anymore, I wanted to catch some damn Pokemon! 

After playing a bit, today was the first time my girlfriend joined me. We went together, got some snacks, drinks and went outside to find some stuff. We eventually saw a pokemon in ""nearby"" which we liked so we just kept walking. We ended up in the middle of a forest/park. 
It was so much fun and actuallt exciting.
After hatching my first egg, I got Tyrouge and evolved it into Hitmonchan. I actually was super happy and tried showing it off to her like it was something super special haha.

Idk man, and now, about 30 mins ago, my first raid. It was a huge ass Starmie with A LOT of cp, while my strongest Pokemon is about 830 CP and the rest is about 600 CP.  Luckily 3 other players joined before the raid started, all level 37-40 with Groudons. All my Pokemon died lol, but at least we won, mainly because of the 3 ppl that joined. Eventually I could try and catch it, so I caught Starmie with 1300CP!

So this baby is my strongest right now, but my body is ready to get even stronger and better ones! 

So thats it, the game is so much fun, especially if you are playing together. I'm going to go now, gotta catch 'em all!"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

* 5 degree fully assembled. (Zelios)
* KBD661 fully assembled. (Zelios)

Then I remembered that for that price I could also get a HHKB Pro2 which is a keyboard I have lusted over before. 

Now I understand that telling someone what to buy is very difficult. However, you could at least tell me what to think of and what to prioritize when choosing between these three keyboards.

I'm currently 26 and finishing up my last 2 semesters to obtain my AS in business. I was going to originally transfer into a CIS program at the local university, but came across WGU.

I've always been a tech enthusiast, however, I have no formal IT training or experience. I do plan on completing my CompTIA trifecta(A+,Network+ and Security+) in the next couple months.The security field has always interested me, so I would most likely choose to complete either the  BS:NOS or BS: CS&amp;IA Programs.

How many of you were completely new to your course of study and were able to land either jobs or internships before or after graduating? I do realize most people advise I'd have to probably start in something like Helpdesk, which is fine..I just kinda want to get a gauge on difficulty for breaking into the field with a degree/certs with no experience.

8q345c,1,2018-06-10,My (23F) boyfriend (22M) quit his job and now refuses to look for a new one.,thr0wahhway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8q345c/my_23f_boyfriend_22m_quit_his_job_and_now_refuses/,"My boyfriend quit his job two months ago. At the time, I supported it. He was working 7 days a week, 9 hour days, all while going to school part time as well. It was getting to be too much for him. He was grumpy all the time, had no time for himself, and very little time for studying. He decided to quit before finding another job so that he’d have time to study for his finals. At the time, it sounded like an okay idea. We both have a lot saved up and I didn’t think he’d have a hard time finding another job.

Long story short, it’s been over two months and he’s still jobless. Finals are over, he’s not taking summer classes, and aside from applying to one internship a month ago, he has yet to apply for a single job. Instead, he sits at home and plays video games all night, sleeps all day, and never wants to leave the house. I have tried multiple times to bring up the subject in different ways, but every time I start talking about it he says he doesn’t want to talk about it and gets mad. I don’t like fighting, so I usually drop it after that. He still has some savings, but that won’t last much longer, and he’s already started to neglect some bills and asks me to pay for things. Somehow this still does not motivate him to find a job. At this point I’m just starting to resent him for not working or doing anything around the house either. I work a stressful job with long hours, and it frustrates me when I come home to a mess, knowing he’s just been drinking and gaming all day/night. He has done this dishes one time in the past six months, never picks up after himself anymore, and leaves beer bottles and dirty clothes everywhere. I’m at my wits end. We’ve been together for 6 years but have never had a problem like this. He knows I’m frustrated about it all but nothing has changed. It’s not something I’m willing to put up with much longer.

Any advice?"

And then i get the bullshit excuse that they dont have enough money and that they need to pay the other employees first... so that intern makes it so i am forced to live with the guy in my parents old house even though i want to get away from him as far as i can.i know this is getting long and if you’re still with me i thank you &lt;3 anyway i guess this gets us to the point of why i just stormed out and left just now.My parents finished restoring a old house that they have owned for quite a few years now and for the past month or so they have been asking me to move in with them Witch you would guess is a good thing but it isn’t. My parents have never really been abusive towards me like my brother but over the years ifjust noticed that they are very mean and often times see themselves as superiors to other people witch they need to tell me about after the other person can’t hear them anymore. For example (im helping a customer at the registry and mabey hes from another country or he might be a bit nervous due to anxity (witch i also suffer from) or something else he has going on in his or her life and then they leave and as soon as they are out the door they gotta make just a stupid or awful comment about them and they think its funny and they look at me like im suppossed to laugh about it with them.especially struggeling with my brothers abusive behavior for the last 5 years this just makes me so fucking angry and im at the point to where i just dont want anything to do with them anymore im embarressed to have this fucking familly name attached to me at this point. And now a few hours ago they just called me and told me the where coming to pack up my shit so i could move because they wanted to “help me” there is more to the story but thats basically the jist of it .Im at my wits end and i just don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to say thank you to everyone that reads this and any advice would be welcome &lt;3 and sorry for any mistakes English isn’t my first language "

I moved to Spring for a summer internship earlier today and I know nobody in this area! To give me something to do outside of work, opportunities to connect with people, and challenge myself, I got a membership at the inSPIRE climbing gym. Thing is, I'm very shy and new to climbing! I'm not an awkward person or anything, just quiet &amp; reserved around strangers, and I feel a little silly being both a beginner and in an unfamiliar environment. Having a gym buddy to ease the transition would be really great!!

I intend to go to this gym every day I can with my schedule, and I'm overcoming this shyness regardless, but I thought I'd post here to see if I can connect with anyone this way ? I'm not looking for a teacher, just company whether once, a few times, semi-regularly, whenever. I'll be here for the next couple of months (until mid-August).

I've saved up all my pennies for over a year so that I could do my dream internship in New York for the summer and now I'm here and I just feel so miserable. I love my internship but at the end of the day when it's over I realise I'm alone and know no one here. I joined meetup and went to a dinner but I just felt so out of place.

 I'm really shy and I don't think I'm that interesting so when I went out to some bars last night I just kept to myself. I don't think anyone wants to socialise with the girl whose by herself. 

A few months before I left I met the most amazing girl but I think I might like her more than she likes me and I 1.) Don't want to come on too strong 2.) Settle for that but I'm just so terribly lonely that I would settle a lot. She hasn't tried to reach out in the 3 weeks since I left but my birthday is on Tuesday so maybe she will then.

That's the other thing, I'm not even excited for my birthday and it happens to be the anniversary of Pulse so it kinda makes me a little sad now. 

I'm worried that I'm never going to be fulfilled if literally living my dreams isn't enough to make me happy. I'm thinking I need to be on some sort of antidepressants but I think I'd have to wait until I'm back in my home state at the end of the summer.

End rant. Thanks for reading hope everyone is feeling a little better than I am. I don't expect anything to come from this I just needed to get it off my chest. "

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

So, while training her we kind of hit it off, in the first day we met she gave me her number and would initiate texts outside of work, we talked for hours in that fist day and every single day for about 2 weeks, with her usually initiating, she told me that she was single, she woud send me pics of her working out, talk about intimate stuff, about previous relationships, send me texts super late at night (1\-3 am) asking if i was awake, wich some times i was if i had a exam in the moring.

in this 2 weeks we would leave the office  together  since we took the same way to the subway, and because we left together, sometimes i would wait for her for a few mintues or she would wait for me, and our co\-workes  kind of picked up on that and  would make jokes with me while she wasn't present, and i would always say '' its not like that we are only friends'' but they would never belive me and would taunt even more, btw my office is almost all female, with only me and the boss being males.

in these 2 weeks we were texting talking about ourselfs, likes/dislikes, everything really, so on a thursday i asked her out and she said ''i want to, but i cant friday because im going out with my friends, and cant on the weekend because its mothers day and im going to visit my grandmother'', i took that as her letting me down gently and stoped initiating texting, while she would still text me semi daily, and would still chat with me on the job normally.

Now, the problem is everybody in the office ( its a small one, about 12 ppl) will taunt me, saying that im hiding me dating her, that they know it, her aunt the secretary says that im a part of the family now and brings me food, when her father came to pick her up, the aunt called me to met my new father in law, they are now taunting me and her all the time, she cant even speek to me about doubts in her work without ppl making fun, i can see that she is starting to resent me because of other ppl poking fun at us, even tho i said multiple times that im not dating her and to stop it.

i cant even complain about it to the boss because he will sometimes make jokes about me dating her too, way less than my other co\-workers but still.

how should i deal with this situation? Is my first job and i really dont want to quit, besides the taunting its a perfect job and im learing alot.

**(TL:DR) my boss and co\-workers are ''making fun'' and taunting me and the new intern (21F) saying that we are hiding the fact that we are dating, even though we are not, annoying me and her, going as far as telling her father that im his new son\-in\-law, and because of that she is kind of resenting me.**

They have said many things here and there about the game so from what I found and remember (will make edits if needed) here is everything that should be a part of ~~Halo 6~~ Halo Infinite

* [Splitscreen:](https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/23/14715906/halo-split-screen-coming-back-halo-6-bonnie-ross-343-industries) Back in 2017, Bonnie Ross stated that Splitscreen would return in all future installments for Halo. Chris Lee also [tweeted](https://mobile.twitter.com/tefferlee/status/1005944852553461760) saying it will have splitscreen in response to the question.

* [Capacious](https://twitter.com/franklez/status/911308254847787009?s=19): When asked about H6 back in 2017, Frank O'Connor replied with ""Capacious"" which means big and open. This could mean (along with what we saw in the teaser) that Halo Infinite is an open world like game or one with very open levels/environments.

* Classic Armor: In the teaser we see a return to the Halo 3 style with Master Chief and Halo Reach Marines, as well as a return for black under suits and if these stay true in the game, what does it mean?

* Classic Theme: This doesn't really mean much, but its a nice nod to the fact that they are headed to what made Halo great.

* [Mystery and Wonder](https://www.343industries.com/slipspace-engine): The Slipspace engine is the new engine for Halo Infinite and possibly every Halo game to come, and their website defines it as ""Mystery and Wonder"" ""Inspired by the most iconic Halo moments to build the future of our legendary franchise."" Which seems to imply that they are going back to there roots.

* [Alive with Excitement](https://www.343industries.com/slipspace-engine): Also on the site is ""Alive with Excitement"" ""A living, breathing world ripe for exploration and endless gameplay possibilities."" This seems to back up the idea of an open world like game similar to Nintendo's Breath of the Wild from last year. 

* Windows 10: Play anywhere title means it will come to Win10/PC, and possibly all future installments will. This could also lead to MCC being added later on (after their massive changes are done)

* Possible 2019/2020 Release Date

* Cortana/AI chip: at the end of the teaser, Chief is seen inserting an AI chip into the back of his helmet. This could be Cortana or another AI that he is using to replace Cortana.

* 2560: in the cockpit of the crashed pelcon, you can see the date “5/27/2560” which puts this at around 18 months after Halo 5. It was already confirmed to be a sequel, but this gives us a rough estimate of how much time has passed

* Battle Rifle: The Marines can be seen holding BRs which appear to not include a scope similar to BR variants in Halo 5.

* Birds/Sentinals: When Master Chief appears, some small creatures can be seen flying in the distance. They could be ethier Birds or Sentinals, but most likely the latter.

* [Walkytalky](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/8q53f9/when_the_walkytalky_bleeps_at_this_point_in_the/): When the Walkytalky appears, it starts to beep and vibrate. When translated from Morse code it states “SOS ZETA HALO GRD.” ZETA HALO could be referring to the Zeta Ring, installation 007, which was known to have deer similar to what we saw earlier.

* [Beta](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/our-journey-begins): 343 has confirmed that at a later date a beta will be ready similar to the MCC ones on the insider program.

* Day Night Cycle: this isn’t really confirmed, but the teaser starts out at night and ends during the day and if it follows the open world route then it could have a proper day/night cycle like most open world games.

* Weather: At the start you can see it raining and later in the teaser you can see sandstorm in the desert. This could apply to levels or be world events if it’s open world.

* Wildlife: the teaser displays Deer and some rhino like creatures that could be found throughout the map/maps to make it feel alive similar to halo reach.

* [Current Gen Systems](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/8q9uhg/frankie_confirms_its_a_current_gen_game/)

8q538l,10,2018-06-10,Looking for advice on physical intimacy,Theanonman,latterdaysaints,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/8q538l/looking_for_advice_on_physical_intimacy/,"Hey guys, I normally frequent the sub using a different account but to protect my wife's anonymity I created this account.

My wife and I were sealed late December 2017. It was a wonderful sealing and regardless of the issue's I'm going to bring up I absolutely love her and care about her happiness deeply. We had planned on doing a short 3 day cheaper honeymoon and planning a more expensive and grand honeymoon once she graduated from school and her internship, which in hindsight I'm thankful we did as the honeymoon was an extremely difficult time for us. Her parents left her completely unprepared for physical intimacy and as such we ended up going to bed without doing anything past mild kissing.

Throughout the course of the honeymoon, we were able to overcome her fears of being naked around me but other than that there was/has been no headway beyond heavy kissing. Manual stimulation outside of intercourse is uncomfortable for her as well.

Fast forward to now and it's really draining our marriage. I flip-flop between trying to spice up the marriage and get her interested in intimacy or doing everything I can to avoid intimacy because it just ends in negative emotions and there is nothing I can do about it. If I'm too gentle she loses interest, if I'm spicing things up we try going one step further and she gets anxiety right before we try and I spend the next hour comforting her.

To be honest I knew that there would be struggles with intimacy while we were courting as she was extremely innocent, more innocent than I thought possible in today's age. Her parents taught her absolutely 0 about intercourse other than the fact that it's how children are created a little bit about the anatomy and that ""it will come naturally."" Being the extremely diligent and righteous woman she is she never sought any more information and left the room whenever she felt people were speaking inappropriately. Because of this I don't feel cheated in any way, but regardless it's still challenging.

The most discouraging thing is that when I attempt to bring up seeing counseling, or reading books she says she doesn't have any interest in doing any of that or doing research on her own, even though she hates how it drags the marriage down at times.

I've given her some space as she's in her final semester at school and is extremely busy, but once her internship starts and she has time I'm going to make a stronger case for seeing counseling. She's said that she doesn't want to even at that time, which once again has me discouraged since I cannot force her to have a desire for physical intimacy.

I'm trying my best to remain positive, but I fear that even if we are able to have intercourse, sex is going to be relegated to purely having children. This is definitely something I'm terrified of as I have an extremely high libido but I don't know how I can communicate this to her without it deteriorating the relationship as she'll take it extremely personally and feel like she doesn't deserve me for weeks if not months. If I do tell her it's definitely going to have to be after graduation.

I know there isn't any perfect advice anyone can give me, and I don't know if I'm really even asking for advice, but regardless does anyone have any ideas? I'm willing to try anything as long as it doesn't jeopardize our relationship, and at what point does this become something where I'm within my rights to demand that we seek counseling?

I've tried keeping this SFW, but if it's not, well I guess it will be removed.

Thanks.

Edit: thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts. Sorry it's taken so long for me to respond. To be honest I've been dreading looking at them for fear of what I might hear. It's been helpful though and I really appreciate it!"

8q5qz6,24,2018-06-10,Community Node Update 10 June 2018,bondibox,Tronix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/8q5qz6/community_node_update_10_june_2018/,"Well, it's been quite a journey. Maybe it's time for a recap.

I started running a node as soon as I heard about the java-tron project. It wasn't long, though, before I learned that a real Super Representative wasn't just one guy with a server, it's a whole organization. Even though I was relatively new to crypto and was still trying to earn 200 karma points to post on Reddit, I thought maybe I could bring people together from twitter, reddit, youtube and other Tronix forums to create a Super Representative group.

Turns out I wasn't the only one with that idea, and while I may have beaten some of them to my announcement, they already had large organizations built. Undeterred, I pressed on.

I decided to walk a fine line. I'd accept help, but I didn't want anyone else to risk their capital. My plan was to cover all of the costs until we started generating revenue, because the risk was just way too high for me to ask anyone else to take a part of it. Part of that meant running a lean budget.

The first thing I did was I published a Witness Node how to for newbies. And the first thing one of the other candidate groups did was plagiarize it and redistribute it. So I learned the various Super Representative groups were all operating at different levels of professionalism.

During test net, I spent all my days in the 'issues' forum at the github java-tron repository. I discovered a lot of bugs, but what I discovered in the end was a few of these weren't really bugs. Like the time I would sync to a different block height, I think they were testing the potential for a 51% attack. I chalk up most of the ""hiccups"" to these tests. They didn't call it ""test net"" for nothing!

A lot of us reported bugs to Tron, but that doesn't really take any talent, and it probably didn't tell them anything they didn't already know. What was really helpful to Tron was when we went out and found solutions. I found one such solution, and last week I was informed I'd be receiving a Bug Bounty for it!

One of the challenges during the test net phase was to stay productive when the application wasn't working. To me, this was just an opportunity to multitask, putting on the hat of CEO and CFO too. I crafted a rewards plan that is unique, and in my opinion it actually ends up strengthening the trust level of our witness node. 

The CEO role was the hardest, as I've never held a management position. I learned not to force anything, instead letting people come to me to let me use their best strengths. Greg was the first person to join the team, and then Colradi and Duane came on board. The beauty of this was all I had to do was delegate assignments that they were anxious to perform. We didn't need a dictator, we just needed someone to set a steady course.

So maybe we had a community member who was difficult to deal with in the beginning. The easy temptation would have been to kick him out of our group, because I really don't have time for that. But I made time for him. And instead of creating an enemy, I offered him an internship and began to mentor him. That's how you win a campaign, one ally at a time.

I remember the day Tron announced they would require a 100,000 TRX application fee for the Super Representatives. I was crushed. There was no way I could come up with that amount of TRX.  But the Community Node members said not to worry about it, they had my back. In the end, Tron lowered the fee to 9,999 TRX which made me very happy. In the meantime I was just a little bit short for the 15,000 TRX needed for the SR deposit. Out of the blue, a coder extraordinaire named Rovak came to the rescue, and he gave me 2448 TRX to complete the deposit. I think I cried a little when that happened, for I was really getting to see what the Tronix community was all about. Roy didn't join our team that day, he's just an incredibly nice guy who wants to see us all succeed.

Helping everyone succeed is something we at Community Node take to heart. We are the open source Super Representative group, and we've had all of our corporate docs and howtos on github since day one. I don't think you can create a more transparent organization. We've even begun a 'fledgling program' to help people who want to run their own nodes. What? We must be crazy to cultivate the competition, but the way I see it, it just makes us stronger. Every new node we help to get established just makes us that much more of an invaluable community resource.

Going forward, I see our role as becoming a trusted source for information. Even among Super Representatives, there is a lack of consistency in the messaging. One SR group is telling their members they can choose how long their TRX will stay frozen for voting at the time they freeze them. That's not how it works. You must freeze for a minimum of 3 days, and after that you can unfreeze at any time. Your TRX will stay frozen until you unfreeze them. And if you vote once, that vote gets repeated every day until you change it. They also think market cap is equal to the total investment, and that's just filling people's heads with wrong information.

Theres's still a lot of work to do. My training is as a network engineer, but I've spent some time learning object oriented programming. I'm coding a website that will calculate the voter rewards for us, and then batch send all of those rewards out every day. It's some cutting edge fintech stuff, but I think I can do it.

Well I hope you find this interesting and helpful. I hope to write more updates that give the voters a sense of the soul of our organization.

I somehow managed to graduate both high school and college and enter into graduate school. 

But now that I've ""woken up"", I am trying to change masters degrees for a better paying job in the field. This summer I have been trying to reach out to people on LinkedIn, old college friends, and to anyone who is in my field of interest just to network now where I was too afraid to before. I am applying to jobs, and I am riddled with perfectionist fear that if I cock up one application, then I can never get a job at that company (which some have told me is true that they ignore future applications and some say it isn't true). I am trying to find research opportunities, internships, job work, anything to help me make the transition. And I'm just not hearing anything and it drives me into anxious rumination about where I went wrong and should have done better.

No ""go fuck yourself""s no ""Thanks but no""s, just damning silence. I feel terrified that I might have no chance at finding a decent job because I was too avoidant in undergraduate. But I try to keep going because I know I have to.

I just feel overwhelmed. Like I'm fighting my own feelings of shame and hopelessness while trying to blindly learn how to find jobs and opportunities. That I'm walking in a pitch black room and every time I trip, I hear ""You should have figured this out earlier, it's too late for you.""

I know venting on a forum won't fix anything. I just feel isolated and overwhelmed and just afraid."

For some reason, my post disappear, so I am trying again.

My girlfriend recently got into a summer internship program, so we haven’t been able to talk all that much lately.

She recently told me that she MAY like someone else, but is very, very confused.

She tells me that she loves me all the time, and that she is in love with me, more than anything in the world, and I am The best thing that has ever happened to her.

She has told me that she is scared, but scared of what, I’m not sure.  She has told me that she is scared to be in love, and she doesn’t know what love feels like, and she is afraid I’ll leave her, for what reason, I don’t know.  Maybe she doesn’t know what being loved  feels like?

I suspect her childhood upbringing has something to do with it. She didn’t have the best childhood growing up, and she is not close with her family at all.

I guess I’m just wondering what she is thinking, and what do you see for us?   How can I help her see that I’m not going anywhere?  Ever!  Also, what do my angels think? Relatives? Basically, anyone from the other side who wants to have their input heard.

Thank you for the help in advance! :-)"

8q7fym,1,2018-06-11,"M (22) Meeting last year Summer Fling (F/22) w whom I fell out pretty bad, advice?",djawirness,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8q7fym/m_22_meeting_last_year_summer_fling_f22_w_whom_i/,"Oh boy, this is gonna be quite long

Story first \- 

Last summer I had a pretty interesting summer fling with a girl from another university not far away from where I study. We had enjoyable nights, good sex, times, talks, and everything and by the end we were dating even though it's never official. But everyone in the summer trip knew it was overt and my friends were already teasing we should move in if she gets an internship in my city (her campus town is just another campus town, I live in a big city).

We were both going to US the next semester \- Fall 2017 (me doing exchange and that's where she ended up doing her internship too) we were already planning of traveling here and there together.

Not long after we part home, before we got to fly to this other country, we had a major fall out (I fucked up).

It's pretty bad considering she blocked me on all soc media fronts. I tried to make it up to her when we were both in US, asking if she wants to meet up when I was in her city. But what started out as polite ask became a full\-on texting fight for some time. And she blocked me again.

We went back to Europe this semester (Spring 2018), and after some time I moved on. Some FWB, some hookup, life as usual.

Until this month. I knew that next month, after my exams (yes we in Europe have finals in June) I am going to meet her in another event.

*Context : That summer trip last year was because we're both student activists. In Europe, if you are a student activist or in some kind of movement/organization, and with our cheap and easy travel, it is pretty easy to run into people you know in events, gatherings or conferences even in a different city or country. Last Summer it was a gathering in Holland, this year it's the same event again \- I am going there and I know for sure she is also going (even though she doesnt know I will, or maybe she knows, idk).*

Thing is, for like first month I came back to Europe, I was quite anxious if we met again in these kind of events, learning from my experiences (I ran a branch of the organization for 3 years now, so yeah I've traveled here and there quite a lot). Five months passed but in any of my organization event, even abroad, I didn't see her. That also might have helped me moved on.

But now it is official. We are going to meet again.

It's the same event and place again, and there is only 150 people spending time together for 7 days. So there is no way I am going to avoid talking to her.

I don't want to be awkward but I have a few things in my mind \-

1. I want to say sorry for fucking up a few things
2. I want to have a clean closure, to confirm we both have no more baggages
3. I just want to enjoy that week, not needing to have a thought in my mind of what to say (or rather, what NOT to say) to her, so I want this closure to be as early as possible

Some of you might wonder, was a summer fling\-turn\-gf and then falling out that bad?

There is one asterisk that I need to disclose here, that changes everything for me and I still don't know how to handle :

**\*by the time we had a fell out and she blocked me the first time, I knew from her telling me personally that she have had history of abuse\***

For some people, that is a red flag. And before her, it has always been a red flag for me. I stay out of girls that I know w abuse history as far as possible (in terms of sex and relationship, being friends or classmates is ok)

But she was the first whom I got a thing going and actually told me about her whole story and incident.

I felt really bad ever since then, and probably that is why, when I know we are both going to the same event again, I have that last stretch of ""hey bro you really still need to say sorry to her"".

Normally I just moved on from a girl and just, well, see how it goes \- one girl I fell out with actually became best friends, some just faded.

But yeah, I somehow have a guilt knowing her history and the memory that some things, that I thought it was ok w other girls, easily triggered her. Also the fact that we both dragged the problem for 1 whole semester is pretty nasty.

But hey, at least she is not blocking me from facebook and insta anymore (that's how I know she's going to this event again).

My friends here have given 3 opinions \-

1. Don't talk to her unless she approaches you. If she has some things left to talk (or try to avoid) then it will show naturally. So let the ball be at her side of the field.
2. Be friendly, natural, to everybody on the event. Act as if nothing really happened and just do small talks with her like an old friend. Never approach the subject nor build up anything, again, unless she is the one who starts the talk or tries to talk more with you.
3. Actually trying to reconnect with her. First just doing small talk and then building it up over the week. And then when it feels right and she feels comfortable we have the talk.

From past experiences, I usually choose number 2 approach. But again, in her context, I have no clue if I should actually do that.

So, reddit, any advice?"

***Inside the HGEU***


* **MOT**- Drilled holes in the DREAM S15! My dick was crossed for the whole video.. Mr. Oakes makes an appearance to slowly stroke his stick to the Silvia and they both geek out over mounting side skirts to #fyeahspec levels. Rob and Jimbone show up to get an engine. Jimbo looked like a stonebag with his mohawk, Is Jimbo a homosexual just for Thomas? Leave your thoughts down in the comments. 
* **Rudnik**- Drove to Penn State in the new RV. I didn’t see any rape alerts in my Penn State email so hopefully we don’t have another Dylan situation on our hands. The pink helmets were MINT too. The dirts jumps they hit looked SICK AF, I should hit those up when I go back to uni in the fall.
* **Jimmy Oakes**- Justifies his addiction of buying shitty drifty stance cars. I still wish he did a grip build on the E36. Does a talking update vid going over what’s going on with all the cars in his collection. If you had any wonders on Jimmy’s summer car build plans he lays everything out. Interesting tidbit the Intern filmed this for Jimmy, another sign that the intern is hungry to get away from the Lord of Garbage. Jimmy covers EVERY car even the Saturn. Jokes about doing a giveaway on the Saturn. 
* **LifeOD**- Onion hasn’t released anything since pandering to his Patreon crew. Probably busy counting the giveaway money and getting seat time on the simulator. Or maybe he’s thinking of more ways he can turn the dually trailer into an internment camp hopefully (but not likely) he’s in a laundromat cleaning his hoodie he’s been wearing since early March.  
* **Haggard North**- Dually is still a piece of shit and leaks oil everywhere. He should stop dicking around with CL 7.3 masters and take it to a real diesel shop. Our guy hacked together a fuel return for his eBay fuel system in the Z. M’lady looked extra trashy today in some skank sweatpants. She needs step it up and look like a sophisticated woman like THICCOLE.
* **Cam**-The Sad One is creeping around IG taking pictures of removing Brendan’s miata engine. It says something that he can’t reach out to Rudnik, Damian or Jimmy for any help with a car. He done some doo-doo. Brendan made a pic or two and he looks ahhh, not good. I don’t want to shit on the guy cause he’s had some shit go down in his life but he looks like a big ole bag of mashed up assholes, that’s all I have to say about that. 


**Discussion Question**- The floated number that Mondrose cleared for the drift starter giveaway is $550,000 dollars. During that period they did VERY little to promote it, practically nothing at all. Onion states that he was to busy making $43 dollars a day on cryptomining. That number is so insane to me but it got me thinking about what they could have done to drive sales even higher. Why didn’t they make it the “youtube starter” giveaway. Offer the van, trailer, car, PLUS being being filmed and featured in 3 vids and the keys to one of their channels that already has subs. These kids weren’t buying the entries for the hope to win a car to grassroots drift, they were buying a chance to be mini Onion. What are the subs thoughts on that? How would you have run the DSP differently? Also I’m pretty sure I just gave Onion his “next great idea” just remember when he does this to blow his comments up with my name. 
 
***Outside the HGEU***
 
* **Motion Auto TV**- Live streams a tug of war between his drift car and an LS swapped BMW. This is a skip. 
* **Cleetus**- If you’re Chow and you see other youtube slaves getting pampered with a 675 wheel horsepower Cadillac how pissed are you? Vid show’s Coopers CTS-V getting a final dyno tune on E-90. They show the cut hood for his supercharger and it’s extremely well done. Honestly Cleetus’s dog Holly has a better existence than Chow at this point. Chow pledge your katana to be Cleetus’s shipping slave. Even if you slept on the floor in his shop it would be better than the 7 inch bunk and Mondrose. 
* **Boosted Boiz**- [GoFundMe Update.](https://www.gofundme.com/help-brent-get-a-new-shop) 
* **Gingium**- Launches a new series and his production value has SKYROCKETED. It’s Battle of the Builds and the first episode features a lightly modded Mazda 3 hatch against a Stage 3 Focus ST. Gingium does a great job and if I had to guess I would say his end game is real TV. This guy must have gone to a weekend “Live your best life” conference because the difference in quality from just a few weeks ago is staggering. My Gingium stock is skyrocketing. Sell haggard but Gingium. 
* **LZ**- bullshits around the garage, admits the Skyline needs that #fyeahspec subframe treatment. The new Skyline turns out to be pretty boof- turbo’s done, and it’s got un-mint blowby, LZ decides to stop drifting it for the day. The rest of the vid is standard triple Z drifting content, with Thiccole getting some laps in with the 240. Still don’t get why LZ has that many cars, but this one’s at least cool.

Was informed in a meeting before work last today that the inept feminist manager who couldn't even figure out the tab section of our database system has chosen to ""leave due to creative differences"" which is code for getting fired ""with grace.""

I hung out at lunch with a few of the folks who worked under her department as we got along due to common interests and having worked together on other collaborative projects before. One of them, an older man who has the same seniority as her and who gets along with me fairly well explained that she got fired for more than simple technical ineptness.

Apparently, upper management went and questioned the staff and interns in her department while she was undergoing assessment and found out she had been assigning her own personal projects (not company work) to the interns using the company logo. The only reason she's been allowed to leave quietly is because the boss and her were former peers with an excellent working relationship years ago. However, this has obviously soured the relationship and he probably won't be doing any favours for her in future and hinted he might be placing her name in a blacklist.

Whether or not legal action will be taken against her remains to be seen but the moral here is this guys; don't use company time and resources for your own personal projects\-it might come back as a legal nightmare."

""P\-please, I'm s\-so...""

I  spread my fingers slightly inside of you, curling them up against your  walls for added friction as my thumb slides over your clit in slow, *cruelly*  slow circles. You're bent over my desk, your body trembling under mind  as I lean over you, my hand wrist deep in the front of your unbuttoned  slacks as my fingers work your slick little cunt.

But  when I feel you get close, I stop. I let you fall forward against the  desk, groaning with frustration as I slowly lick your juices off of my  fingers. ""Interns with boyfriends don't get to cum. Remember, baby  girl?"" I press my lips to the back of your neck, sucking at soft,  sensitive flesh as you shudder. ""You know what you have to do.""

I'm  interested in an RP where a 'straight' girl has never had an actual  orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college,  and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with  drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her  orgasm *several* times before the  evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and  embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss  just fucked her brains out.

The boss  wants to have a Sugar Mama/girl relationship with your character,  but she resists, insisting that she's 'straight' and that she has a  boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again  throughout the work day, reminding her of the *actual* orgasms they had the night before.

So, will you dump your boyfriend and let your rich, older lover spoil you and fuck you raw?

Kinks:  anal, cunnilingus, strap ons, public sex,  clothed sex, mind break, mommy/little girl, age play, incest, breasfeeding and more

It's Yeezyheads this week as the release of Kanye's new album *Ye* is released with a controversial roll-out.

All of the songs from the album have charted in the top ten but not consecutively, as 'Ghost Town' tops this week while Charli takes over the #2 spot on its second week with '5 in the Morning'. Following them are the rest of the tracks from *Ye* which includes 'Yikes', 'All Mine', 'I Thought About Killing You', 'Violent Crimes', 'Wouldn't Leave' and 'No Mistakes' charting from #2 to #8 consecutively.

Joining Charli as the only non-Kanye artists in the top 10 are The 1975 and Ariana. The 1975's 'Give Yourself a Try' debuts at #9 while 'No Tars Left to Cry' might see exit the top ten next week as it charts at the bottom of the top ten on its seventh week.

With the release of their music videos, 'What I Need' by Hayley and Kehlani re-enters this week's chart, making the song the highest re-entry, while Selena Gomez's 'Back to You' increased 25 spots to #20. 

Unfortunately for Pusha T, 'Come Back Baby' earns this week's biggest decline, losing 41 spots to #43.

* **Highest Debut:** #1. Kanye West - Ghost Town	
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #18. Hayley Kiyoko - What I Need (feat. Kehlani) 
* **Biggest Gain:** #20. Selena Gomez - Back to You (+25)

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

I do mostly hard labor but it is all related to my major in some way. I also end up doing a bit of research. I think this has been one of the best experiences I could have given myself and will be something I’ll remember forever. I enjoy talking to the professionals and actually being able to experience a lifestyle I could see working for myself. My favorite part is being able to work inside a lab and outside, plus free food lol. I don’t think anyone else gets it, but I really don’t mind working hard. I don’t think I could stand working behind a desk all day. My biggest problem with this program is my roommate. He is such an asshole and is always critical of me. He hates that I snore and that I wake up at 5:00 for my internship. He always makes me feel unwelcome and I don’t really know how much more I can take before I snap or ask for a switch. I don’t even know if the program leader would even let me switch, but I guess I just have to get to the point of asking. I also have a lot of problems with him however as a person, he uses the house’s groceries to cook for other apartments and I’m not cool with that. Anyway it has been a long time since posting but I like to give an update on my life for future reference. This experience has been good so far and it is only going to get better hopefully. Besides my roommate, the other people in the apartment are really nice and I have made a few friends. I feel like every day that passes becomes more fulfilling and I am happy, I haven’t had this feeling in so long."

8qd3mz,6,2018-06-11,How do I ask for a raise when there's no comparable job?,DietCokeYummie,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8qd3mz/how_do_i_ask_for_a_raise_when_theres_no/,"Not sure if this is the right forum, so apologies if not.

I am at right around 3 years at my company. It all began when I started working for another company, where my boss was supervisor there. 6 months into my employment there, she let me know she has been quietly planning to break away and start her own company doing the same type of work. She basically ran the whole deal at our old company, so she wanted to fully own it. I was 100% on board and left with her.

I was the only employee for the first couple years. In the past year, we've grown so much that we have the freedom to tell prospective clients NO if they seem like too much trouble. It has been great. My boss moved and lives out of state. We have 2 full time employees in other states now, and I have 1 under me (soon to be 2, as an intern is starting next week).

I started at $35k. I am relatively young and was still new to what we do, so this was reasonable. I was 1099 and also paying my own health insurance. I have since moved to W-2 and am making $41k. However, I am still paying my own health insurance ($400/month).

I have a lot of freedom in the sense that I can work from home, come and go as needed, don't need special permission or even documentation of time off, etc. However, I also go above and beyond in a lot of ways (and it has come to be expected). Clients are 2 hours behind me, so I regularly work on things later in the evening outside of ""work hours"". During busy season, I stay in the office late almost every day due to the sheer amount of work. I travel for my job, which often means I'm ""working"" (traveling) on Sundays and also as late as midnight.

I doubt I exceed 40 actual working hours most times, so it isn't really an overtime situation.

I really, really, really love my job. I am good at it and I enjoy it. My boss is younger and very awesome. She is so laid back and doesn't measure your worth by ""clocked in"" time. Rather, she just cares that the work gets done. I definitely don't think she is trying to screw me.. I just think I'm starting to feel that I am worth more. My responsibilities have increased quite a bit as we've grown. And we are only getting larger each year, so even though I'm not really being assigned new tasks, I am performing my tasks on a much much larger scale. 

The issue is that there aren't really any other companies that do what we do. I am a consultant in a niche that we basically created. I don't really have anyone to compare to. The work that I do for our clients is work that is generally split amongst several of their employees, so I can't even really compare myself to what they'd be paying their own employee. 

My work requires pretty extensive knowledge of federal and state level requirements. A huge part of my job is making sure my clients are compliant and pass their state audit. So not just anyone could hop into my place. If I left, I'm not naive enough to think the entire company would implode.. but I am responsible for a large enough % of what we do that it would be EXTREMELY burdensome on my boss/coworkers.

$41k per year with $400/month going to health insurance just doesn't seem right. I have friends teaching kindergarten or ringing up groceries at Trader Joe's making more than that. I just need some guidance on how to go about bringing this up.

Because I do have such a lax schedule as far as ""time in office"", I don't know how to put a # on my work. And I don't know how to compare myself to others, as there are no others.

Advice?

EDIT - I should add that I absolutely do feel like my boss would be open to giving me a raise. I guess it is just difficult to know where my expectations become unrealistic. The average person doesn't get a $10k raise. They get like a few %. But I kinda feel like $50k (and insurance covered) is where I should be right now. "
8qd9aj,1,2018-06-11,Should I start my training?,Torched80,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/8qd9aj/should_i_start_my_training/,"So I am currently working an internship as a software developer for the summer until September 2018. In September I will return to university to finish my Computer Science Bachelor Degree and graduate by the end of December (Fall semester).

I am looking to go into Confederation College or Sault College to get my CPL. My main question is whether or not I should start my flight training or ground school training before I go to one of the colleges. It will obviously cost me a lot more to start training and then go to college since I would be paying for redundant training. I wouldn't be going into the flight college until September of 2019, so I would have lots of time to train. Would it make sense to get my PPL before going into the college even though I would be able to get one from there? I have taken one discovery flight almost a year ago and it has only strengthen my confidence in that I want to fly for a living. 

If I did want to start studying now, what books should I look into reading? Are there online resources that are free/cheap that would benefit me?

Thanks"
8qd9ef,2,2018-06-11,6.11.2018 Co-Pilot?,mermaid011,Diary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/8qd9ef/6112018_copilot/,"Disclaimer: My metaphors regarding driving and co-piloting doesn't exactly make sense because driving is for cars while piloting seems to be used for aircraft. Just go with it. Or don't. 

I think part of the reason I've looked to date someone responsible is because when I'm single and in a low place I find myself feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of choice in life. I have anxiety and sometimes having SO many choices makes me not want to choose anything at all. Or make the safe choices. I've been making the safe choices for a while now. I am currently pursuing my second undergrad degree and I think it's partially because I wanted to make safe choices and because I seek approval. My parents suggested different career paths they thought would be good for me, most notably a forensic pathologist, then a doctor. When I went to college I liked biology, chemistry, and math, so I took those courses along with gen ed courses thinking I'd eventually go to med school. There was an incident my freshman year when a friend needed treatment in the ED and I got squeamish when she got a numbing shot and the solution that was injected oozed out of her wound. I was worried at that point that the medical field may not be right for me. I think it was actually because I didn't have much in my stomach and really should have eaten but hadn't had the chance. Anyway, that led me to look at my current courses and what my school had to offer and I decided to major in nutrition. I decided that I would become a dietitian. I wasn't passionate about it, but thought it was useful, I could learn the material, and I could help myself and others. 

Thankfully before I got too far into my master's of nutrition program and before I started a dietetic internship I watched 'The Business of Being Born' and I fell in love with midwifery. I researched midwifery, was convinced it was for me, and figured out how to get through nursing school as quickly as possible. Now I'm on a path that will get me there (eventually) and it was a series of choices that I made 100% for myself. I feel confident in these decisions and am very excited about being a midwife in the future. I am in my maternity class/clinical this summer and have seen 3 births in the last 3 weeks. The first was a vaginal delivery of twin girls, the second was a vaginal delivery of a boy, and the third was a C-section of a boy. Birth is so beautiful and magnificent. I'm so excited to have these experiences. 

While I'm super excited about my chosen career path, I've been feeling pulled somewhere else. Location wise. When I was little, I used to want to live in a big city. At one point I wanted to live in NYC but visiting deterred me from that. I was obsessed with Charmed for quite a few years which made me want to live in California. For the past few years I've been longing to be close to the beach.  I've considered the local coast, but if I had no ties or commitments I would move to California as soon as I was out of school. However, my brother actually moved to CA 2 years ago for rehab and isn't returning in the foreseeable future. My parents are here, my friends are here, and my cousins and their children are here. My friends would be fine without me. They may come visit eventually. My dad is in poor health though and my parents have always tried to support and love me, so it just seems cold to try to move away. Especially that far. I dream of it though. 

I'm at a weird spot in life because it's hard to make a 5 year plan or a 10 year plan. I'm not JUST making the safe choices anymore which is exciting but terrifying. If you asked me my 10 year plan a year ago, I could've mapped it out for you. Very safe, predictable choices. Granted I knew there was always a chance for things to not happen the exact season or exact year I planned for them to, but there were lots of specific goals with specific timelines. Now things are pretty much a free for all. I know for certain that I want to become a CNM (Certified nurse midwife) and I would REALLY like to live near the beach in CA, but I'm not sure that's practical. I want children and dogs. I want a life companion. Or two. Or more. I think it would be lovely to surround myself with people I love and trust who support me and make me feel safe and accept love from me. I would love to have a group of friends who challenge my way of thinking in the nicest way possible and who show me fun new activities or exciting places. 

I want to be as happy as possible and have as much fun as possible while still being responsible enough to sustain said fun. I think that is what I've realized over the past couple of months. It's probably possible too! I can make choices that allow me to have a lot of sustainable fun. I think that in the past I've worried about the choices I'd make if given free reign. In combining that with feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of choices, I opted to find a driver for my life. I dated 2 guys for 2.5 years each. In a few ways they were very similar which I didn't see at the time.

The first guy (the lawyer) was 6 years older than me and was in law school when I was first in college. He had a set path, was possessive and controlling, and I loved him. I was ready to build my life around his. It took me a long time to figure out that while I could have a nice house, kids, and dogs with him, I wasn't going to be happy. In the beginning I was happy to let him drive but as I grew during our relationship, I wanted to be a co-pilot, I wanted some say in the direction of things. We struggled with that and he tried to give me some power, but ultimately I realized it wasn't a healthy relationship for me and I ended things.  I was single for about a month and determined to date differently and have fun! I dated a bartender for 4 months and had a lot of fun. It was my last semester of my senior year of college and I partied more than I ever did throughout college.  He definitely wasn't the ""responsible"" type I had sought out before and he ended up cheating on me. That hurt. I was single again for about a month before I met the second guy (the engineer) I dated long term. Things seemed so much better than with my first bf and he checked all the boxes. I was definitely in a high place when I met him. Everything in my life had gone wrong all at once besides him and I surrendered. It was like getting knocked over by a wave, being thrashed about in the water trying my best to fight it, but then I let go, stopped fighting, floated to the surface and enjoyed the sunshine. He was a good choice logically and the high I got from surrendering to life's treacherous waves caused me to fall fast and hard. We spent as much time together as possible and got intimate pretty quickly and pretty often. I fell in love with him before I had a chance to realize that we didn't have that much in common and didn't actually have super compatible values. 

When I dated the lawyer, I let him be the driver at first, realized I was somewhat competent in decision-making so I asked to be co-pilot, then realized I'd be kinda miserable if that's how I spent the rest of my life, so I left and became my own driver. When I dated the bartender, I was driving and having fun. He was a fun guy so tossing all caution to the wind, I scooted over and let him be the driver. It was a rude awakening when he cheated and I had to go from being the passenger back to being driver. Then with all of life's waves I decided to go on autopilot about the same time I met the engineer. I quickly fell for the engineer and he fell into the driver's seat so I no longer need autopilot. After regaining some self-confidence I once again figured out I'd like some control. I asked for it, we struggled (much like I did with the lawyer) and I realized this relationship wasn't healthy either. Back to the driver's seat. 

I've done more self reflection during my time in the driver's seat this go round then ever before. Self reflection has always been scary for me. It overwhelmed me just like having infinite choices. I didn't want to figure myself out. I wanted someone else to do it. At least that's what I thought. And to an extent, I still do. I can't honestly say that it wouldn't make me melt to think that someone understood me as well or better than I understand myself. But that's the key. I NEED to understand myself. I need to have confidence as the driver before handing over the keys. I also need more confidence in the driver I hand the keys to - in the past it hasn't taken much to get my keys. I want to be in relationships where all parties are confident in their own and each other's competence before anyone starts handing over keys. The key exchange shouldn't happen because one party feels incompetent. The key exchange should be the result of loving and trusting one another enough to take turns. 

When my dad got sick, he had no choice but to be the passenger. My mom had no choice but to be the driver. When my dad had good days, he struggled with this because he's stubborn (I get it from him) and he wanted to be the driver. But never because he didn't trust my mom. My parents love and trust each other. They built their lives around each other. They were both competent drivers and they were also both comfortable as passengers because of the love and trust they have for one another. I want that. 

I aim to be a competent driver and surround myself with other competent drivers. I don't mind helping a friend who needs help becoming a more competent driver, but if I'm building my life WITH someone (emphasis placed because I used to plan on building my life AROUND someone which isn't healthy for me) I need them to be competent. Neither one of us should be taking the driver's seat due to lack of competence or confidence of the other party. We can build trust and love for each other and then be co-pilots. You get your shit together, I'll do the same, let's meet in the middle, drive beside each other for a bit, then decide if we want to be in the same car. If we do, we can take turns being the driver or being the passenger, we can also just be co-pilots. No one HAS to be in control. 

I don't need a driver. I don't need autopilot. I don't NEED a co-pilot. I CAN drive. I don't want to swoop in and drive for someone else and I don't want anyone to do that for me. I don't need that. I can drive. "
8qdcep,2,2018-06-11,Actuarial Software Dev Internship,WaterlooOP,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8qdcep/actuarial_software_dev_internship/,"I have an interview coming up for an Actuarial Software Dev Internship for next summer, and I had a couple questions that I want to ask to be more prepared going into the interview, as well as some general knowledge about the industry. For anyone who has worked in a role developing actuarial software (and had to pursue exams at the same time), can you briefly touch on:

Work Life Balance (Is it as ""chill"" as an actuarial analysts job @ an insurance company, or closer to the consultants workload)

How coding intensive is the job? Obv I expect it to be fairly intensive since it is an actuarial software job, but is it just grinding out C\+\+/Java for 8 hours a day, or is there a lot of client interaction, etc

Did they pressure you to pursue your exams/did they have a study program, or did they not really care about credentials.

Did you feel overpaid/underpaid/justifiably paid, relative to a traditional insurance job?"
8qdcgh,3,2018-06-11,My [19/F] with my parents [47/M and 46/F] they have a tracker on my phone and it makes me uncomfortable.,historicalprowess,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8qdcgh/my_19f_with_my_parents_47m_and_46f_they_have_a/,"I am an only child and have been away at college about two hours away from home for a year now. My parents have always said they trust me, mostly because I don't think I ever gave them a reason not to. Sure, I have fun like any other college student, but I'm also very responsible. I get straight A's, I have a part time job on campus, and landed a very prestigious summer internship. About many aspects of my life I am very open with them because I've never really had anything to hide. However, lately they have gotten very intense.

Anyways, my parents have a tracker on my phone so they can see my location at any given time wherever I go. A few months ago, I was leaving the town I go to college in to spend the night with a guy I had been seeing a couple towns over. I turned my location off in order to prevent them from seeing that I was leaving town because I knew I'd be bombarded with a million questions. As soon as I turned it off, I was inundated with a flurry of texts from my mom asking me where I was, if I was okay, telling me that I was acting weird, etc. I responded immediately and told her I was fine and safe, and that she had nothing to worry about. She called me and began interrogating me, I lied to her and told her that I was at a coffee shop with one of my girlfriends in the town I go to college in. I didn't tell her I was visiting the guy I was seeing out of town. Admittedly, I realize that lying to her wasn't the \*best\* course of action, but I'm still not sure there was any alternative. The guy I was seeing wasn't my boyfriend, we honestly just had a FWB thing going, and I wasn't eager to tell my mom I was having casual sex. I was not prepared to be bombarded with questions about where I was, who I was with, how I met him, if he was my boyfriend, what his name was, etc. I figure that I am a grown adult, and where I am and who I am seeing 24/7 isn't their concern.

On this same day the interrogation continues, non\-stop calls and texts from both of my parents. They said that I was breaking their trust, they could never trust me again, how could they be sure I was actually safe, etc. It caused a huge rift with them, definitely the biggest fight we have ever had. Through some other means, they managed to acquire my location through another app. Once they saw where I was, they were angered even further. We fought about it for a while, but I eventually relented and turned it back on because they kept insisting that it was for ""my own safety"" and that they didn't care where I was or what I was doing, but they just wanted to have it on my phone to make sure I was safe. They said that they would have no need to react in the way that they did if I had the tracker on in the first place because then they would know I was safe. They pay all of my bills and my tuition, and I also get a pretty generous allowance. I figured that perhaps their disproportionate reaction was a one off, and due to the fact that they support me it was respectful of me to let it continue.

However, the situation only got worse. A couple weeks later I went to visit my FWB again, except this time my location was on out of respect for them. I told them I would be ""out of town visiting a friend"" for the weekend and didn't elaborate further despite prodding. I was genuinely trying to be respectful of their feelings and to keep the peace, but it ultimately failed. The next morning, I was a little \*busy\* with my friend and didn't look at my phone for less than an hour. When I did look at it, I had 16 text messages from my mom freaking out on me for not responding to her. In said texts, she threatened to call the police twice, in addition to saying that she was going to drive to where I was and that she couldn't focus at work and she was crying at her desk because she couldn't shake the feeling something ""awful had happened.""

This angered me. Clearly, their earlier assertion that having the tracker on would prevent a crazy reaction was false. Even worse, I sat my phone down for LESS THAN AN HOUR. When I did respond to my mom, she was convinced that I did this on purpose to hurt her and didn't believe that my ringer was off and I wasn't looking at my phone. She demanded to know what I was doing in this one hour period of time and I refused, because I once again wasn't keen on telling my mom I was busy having sex.

Every time I have gone on a date or been hanging out with a guy some iteration of this same instance has happened. Even coffee dates in the middle of the day in broad daylight this kind of thing happens. I am at a loss. I'm so tired of being treated like I'm 12 years old. I am grateful for everything they do to support me, but at the same time I feel like I'm a grown woman who can my my own, \*smart\* decisions. I understand they may be having trouble dealing with this as I was a bit of a late bloomer and didn't really begin to explore my dating life until recently. But even when I lie by omission and don't tell them if I have a date, if my mom senses something is even \*slightly\* off she interrogates me. They insist that they are just worried about my safety and are worried about something happening to me, which is understandable. However, I don't live in constant fear (or let it prevent me from living my life) of me being assaulted and murdered and neither should they. I've tried to explain this to them but it doesn't work. As much leverage as it may seem that they have over me financially, I also think I have quite a bit of leverage because if I refused to have a relationship with them it would devastate them. In addition, they would never stop paying my tuition because me going to college has always been their biggest priority and I know they want me to succeed. This fact alone proves they are decent and loving parents, but their intensity lately has been pushing me away and making me want to tell them even less about my life.

Reddit, what should I do? I want this tracker off of my phone because it patronizes me, my parents need to stop living in fear and I feel like I'm being smothered based on some of their over the top reactions to me not responding or turning off the tracker. Am I being unreasonable? I've tried to tell them it makes me uncomfortable but like I said, they say it is for my own safety. Any advice or thoughts are appreciated!

TLDR: My parents have a tracker on my phone and freak out if I don't immediately respond to their texts if I am with a guy, despite the fact that I am a straight A student and have never given them a reason not to trust me."

8qdxcj,1,2018-06-11,My (25F) friend (22F) is in a 4 year relationship with a giant jerk (22M) and it's affecting our relationship,aggibridges,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8qdxcj/my_25f_friend_22f_is_in_a_4_year_relationship/,"I have a friend called Hilda that's dating this guy called Xavier. She's a beautiful girl, highly intelligent, caring, and nice. However, she's dating a guy who's an absolute loser. Hilda comes from a humble family, with a hardworking single mother, but Xavier comes from a more privileged background, and so he feels that most people (including Hilda) are beneath him in terms of status, class, and intelligence. He commonly refers to people as 'monkeys' (we live in a country that's predominantly dark-skinned, but he, Hilda and I are all light-skinned), he treats everyone with a derisive, mocking attitude, and he's just generally an asshole. 

Some things come to mind: Hilda landed a prestigious internship, and when she told him about it his atittude was ""Yeah, well, anyone could have done that. It's pretty easy if you apply yourself, I've just never cared for that"" But meanwhile, all he does is fail his university classes and play videogames like League of Legends 8 hours a day (aspiring pro player, but he's like Diamond in NA, lol). He has no inclination of getting a job, and generally seems pretty content mooching off his parents and watching anime. Since he's one of the top players in our area, he has this huge sense of achievement and superiority and acts like a local celebrity, which can get pretty taxing for her.

Now none of this should affect me, except me and him had a confrontation in July of last year. He was bullying another friend of mine and Hilda's (in a large Facebook group where everyone knows him and the girl he was bullying), and I called him out and said he was being a huge asshole, and he responded in a very belittling and demeaning way, using his 'status' to put me down. So I just laughed at him, told him his arguments were stupid and broke down his arguments in a way that left him looking pretty dumb, and he got so angry that someone 'intelligently' voiced their concerns against him that he started spewing obscenities like ""Kill yourself, you worthless piece of trash"". But that was it, I didn't engage further so as to not make the situation worse. Another time, he sided with me on an argument and told me 'Simmer down honey, let me take care of it, just shut up already' to which I said 'Hey, you already talk enough as it is, let me do the talking for a change, thanks' to which he replied 'Fuck you, you ungrateful pig', and again, I didn't say a thing back. There's been a couple situations like this but well, you get the drift. He's frequently told her and his friends how much of a piece of trash I am, how terrible I am, etc. I've blocked him everywhere but since we share a lot of friends, I still get wind (via screenshots) of many terrible things he does to her and says about me. I really couldn't care less about the guy, but he's definitely holding a grudge. 

Recently, however, I've felt some animosity from her regarding the subject. For my birthday, one of our friends asked Hilda ""Hey, is Xavier coming for Aggi's birthday?"" To which she replied ""No, he can't stand her. :)"" And whenever the group has plans and the boyfriends are invited, she says things like ""Well obviously I'll go alone..."" And generally passive agressive comments like that. 

And even more recently, one of our mutual friends uninvited me from his birthday party because Xavier was going. I would have 0 problem being in the same environment as Xavier because, well, I'm an adult and I can be in my lane while he's in his. But apparently Xavier refuses to be in the same building as me, so I was very clearly warned against going. 

I feel this is going to create more issues in the future and I really don't know how to navigate this without creating more drama. I feel trying to mend the situation with a guy as toxic as him would do nothing at all, and he'll continue to be an offensive jerk. Most people say I should cut her from my circle or at least limit the level of friendship, but I'm hesitant to do so because I really aprecciate her friendship and I feel she's an amazing person that's stuck with a bad apple. So what can I do so this doesn't keep escalating? 

I've already blocked him everywhere, I've asked Hilda not to reveal private information about their relationship (every time he treats her like shit and shows us a bunch of screenshots of his actions where he's shown insulting and manipulating her, so she reveals a lot of his bad side to us) just to not harm our relationship with him further (though our entire group of friends already hates him, and he can't abide any of us). Our group of friends are all keeping a low profile just so he doesn't go around saying we're a bunch of attention seeking whores, so we are all actively trying to minimize potential situations.

**TL;DR: My friend's boyfriend is a huge asshole that's been verbally abusive towards me, towards her, and towards a bunch of people in our circle. It's beginning to cause some issues since he's holding a huge grudge, and I have no clue what to do to make things tolerable at least.**"

Things ended because I was going to be studying abroad in Spain for the summer, and he was going to be starting a 6-month internship in Germany, and potentially even doing a 6-month study abroad right after his internship. It sucks because we didn't break up because of lack of feelings or some argument or something; a few weeks before we broke up I even realized that I loved him, but I never got the chance to tell him. I know it probably makes sense to have broken up, given that he's going to be gone for longer than we were even dating, but it still hurts like hell and I can't stop thinking about him. Recently he started occasionally messaging and snapchatting me again, and I don't want to not talk to him, but it still makes me realize how much I miss him. He's a part of my friend ground, and I still want to be friends with him. I'm going to be visiting a few of my friends who are abroad in a few weekends, and he will be there as well, and I'm still not entirely sure how I'm going to feel when I actually see him again. I just can't stop thinking about how maybe there's a chance that we could get back together when he gets back, but I know I shouldn't be hung up on the idea and I should move on. I just don't know how to give up on the possibility. Any advice?

tldr: hung up on my first ex, we broke up because he didn't want to do long distance, but i still love him and can't stop thinking we could potentially get back together when he's back"

As many have said, Boson exams are definitely harder than the real deal. As far as my background, I am a Computer Information Systems major. I've taken a couple networking courses, but everything was essentially covered in the first few chapters of the OCG. Just started working as an IT intern hoping to land some time of junior networking role hopefully sometime soon.

Materials used:

* OCG read cover to cover
* Boson Ex-Sim Max
* Net Sim Lite
* Pearson Test Prep
* INE with Keith Bogart
* David Bombal Packet Tracer Course on Udemy
* My own personal physical lab

Started studying for the test late March and took the test today for a total of about 2.5 months of studying. I studied 5-6 times per week, between 3-5 hours per day. My strategy was to watch a video or two on INE, read the associated chapter(s), do some packet tracer labs, and then fill in the gaps referring back to the OCG, INE vids, or Google/youtube. I honestly didn't take a lot of notes. Just some flashcards to memorize port numbers and IPv6 multicast stuff. Going forward, I will definitely be taking more notes for the ICND2 and above. I just recently bought some cheap routers and switches so I did do some practice with them, but the majority was with packet tracer.

So I started working with this girl about 2 years ago. She went to the same school as me and was 2 grades above me. We eventually became friends through working and we went out to eat with other coworkers a decent bit, as a group. She's super friendly and bubbly, so she talks to most people at work and she is absolutely gorgeous.

So we got pretty close by the end of the summer before I was done with high school and we went out to eat one last time. Before I left she came to my car and we hugged, said goodbye and whatnot, then she said ""do you think we should kiss too"" and laughed. Now she had never even hinted at something like this before and we always joked around pretty casually at the time so I thought it was a joke. Even if it wasn't, she had a bf at the time and he happened to be a good friend of mine, so I'm not about that.

Fast forward to the end of the first semester and we were talking in a group chat about hanging out when we got back, her, my best friend who was also my coworker, one of her friends and I. I sent her a snap when I got back that said ""missed this"" while playing hockey and she snapped back saying ""missed you"" and nothing much came from any of the snaps and she started ignoring them later in the week. While texting she never she never seems too into it either, but I haven't really put anything out there either, they're usually just standard mature conversations. We hung out 2 or 3 times during winter break and did our usual goodbyes when I went back.

So im back for the summer again and same thing happened: group chat but with a new friend of hers and hanging out as a group. She complements my outfits and stuff, but so does her friend. 

We went to take some pictures and the girls were talking about guys and stuff and she asked me how school was with girls and ""if you ever want to date let me know"" and I said ""yeah sure I will."" Now I'm super quiet and basically keep to myself 90% of the time and I'm not a lady killer whatsoever (had a gf towards the end of high school, but the signs she showed were SO obvious, which was nice), so I was thinking she was just messing around, also because my best friend always talks about sex and stuff with her, but I know thats jokingly and its super obvious. She always talks about other guys in front of us and when we go to hang out around town she sometimes meets up with guys there. From what I have observed, she likes to mess around when it comes to hooking up and just goes for guys she thinks are hot when she's out, but when it comes to dating, she understands theres more to it. 

Now, is she not interested anymore, simply not interested and joking around, or am I just completely oblivious lmao. Another problem I have is ruining the group I've been hanging around. Most people in my high school are idiotic so I really only hang out with them, so If I read this wrong it might kind of ruin what we have going. I would 100% date this girl too. She's talked about moving to NYC for an internship soon and I'm there over the weekends during college (school in LI) and ill probably be moving there right after college, so this might work perfectly. 

Im just 50/50 with this and maybe I have no confidence in myself in terms of my game, but I'd like some feedback if possible. I asked in our group chat if anyone wanted to go take some pictures and film a video and she responded ""HELL YES"" in all caps but we couldn't make anything work as a group.

8qfpuq,2,2018-06-11,Pulling Myself Back Up,BlondesHustleHarder,lifegoals,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifegoals/comments/8qfpuq/pulling_myself_back_up/,"I’m only 19 but I find myself have existential crises nearly every time I meet a roadblock or setback. I think that a part of me believes far too deeply in the idea that everything happens for a reason.   

I always try to have a lot going on, because when I have a lot of free time I get super lazy, and feel guilty that I’m wasting an excess amount of time not progressing as an individual.

I am double majoring, and although credit-wise I am nearly a junior, the reality is that I’m only going into my second year, and I’ll need at least 2.5 more years to finish both majors. 

I joined a club focused on connecting business majors together, but it’s also a social club and I don’t love the atmosphere. Also, in committing so much time to it I found my GPA slipped a little.

Here’s the plan:

- I am currently planning a Semester at Sea for this spring. As soon as I confirm that within my university I’ll be applying and organizing for that.

- In the fall, I’ll be joining at least 1-2 more clubs, probably a volunteer-based club as well as an active one like debate, for example.

- I’ll be joining an intramural sport in the fall to try to stay in shape and maybe get my body back in order because I could be doing better.

- I want to plan an internship abroad for the fall or spring semester after I return home, to keep the traveling spirit alive because I find that planning trips makes me feel more elated than anything else can.

I need to be getting good experiences for my resume, but also so that I have some good shit to talk about in interviews and networking. I’ve realized lately that the moment I’m not thinking of my next few steps, is the moment I fall back into a really lonely and unfulfilled space, and being aware of that is going to really help me I think.


I unfortunately have no idea what I’m going to do career-wise, which makes it hard to convince an internship that I’m a good candidate when I can’t guarantee I’ll be falling into that field anyway.



TL;DR: I love to travel and I find it easy to incorporate that into my life and education, but planning and organizing myself for a career is much harder for me"
8qg2hh,6,2018-06-12,Tech work in Malaysia?,MicrowavedAlien,malaysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/8qg2hh/tech_work_in_malaysia/,"Hi fellow Malaysians, I'm looking for something to do before I go to uni next year and came here for recommendations to make some pocket money. I can go for the typical summer jobs like waiter, promoter etc. But I hope to find something related to tech which is my interest. I'm not an absolute newbie, I have projects built with Django, React Native, Docker, Ionic, Tensorflow, OpenCV and many other stuff, having to do with web, mobile, application security, reverse engineering, image processing and object recognition. From previous internship experiences I find it kind of meaningless as I felt like cheap labor. I wasn't given any serious task/responsibilities*. But I don't think I'm what people look for in a full time dev. I had some luck in hackathons winning a few bucks for coding a day or 2 but I want to fill up my time in an environment where I can learn and work in a team. Any tips from people in the industry, should I just be an intern to gain experience, try to apply full time, or are there other ways like teaching and freelance?

*Context: I was helping them migrate their systems to GNU/Linux systems, basically just tech support and fixing driver issues when they're having problems. But to be fair, I wouldn't trust my 14 year old self too.

tl;dr: Looking for a summer job, hopefully in tech which I'm quite passionate about."
8qgmw3,17,2018-06-12,Does anyone else feel like dying/harming themselves when someone talks about their SO/crush?,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8qgmw3/does_anyone_else_feel_like_dyingharming/,"**Examples**

1) My boyfriend is SO0o0o sweet, he brought me my charger from X college to Y college (Y is where the girlfriend attends college).

2) I fell in love with her the moment she made a yicycles sign, and she's really cute too! (yicycles is a parody of ""yikes"" that was started on my dorm floor by the boy crushing on said girl)

2a) Can someone please tell me how you're supposed to fall in love with someone for making a sign?

3) ""She's really smart and I feel comfortable around her"" (well that's BS because I go to a top public university in America and there are lots of girls who are smart, and I'm sure if that guy got to know more women he'd find someone else that he's comfortable with as well, if not more)

4) ""A year of bagels and you're still hot as fuck, fuck me up!"" (guy commenting on his GF's instagram picture of her in a bikini + thong) 

**Background**

I am a straight 19 year old female. I've never had a *serious* boyfriend before; people have expressed interest in me but I didn't really like them back. I've had 2 fleeting crushes but those lasted for like &lt;1 week and I simply can't imagine liking anyone enough to want to spend a significant amount of time with them, whatever society defines that to be these days lmao.

However, I get jealous because I feel apathetic to everyone and anything (literally the last person I've felt myself actively feel affection for is my brother, who died 8 years ago of terminal brain cancer), and all of my relationships are just dumb and casual and stuff, even with family because we're not expressive or anything with affection and stuff. 

**Also, this quote, written by a former classmate, pissed me off even more:**

Before you know it, you’re experiencing the other kind of love, the intimate one. It’s the one where you meet that someone special and you feel like the whole world just stops when you’re together. You close your eyes and they’re the first person to pop in your mind. Someone asks you what happiness is and you immediately know it’s when you’re with that person. You feel like you can share anything with them and be 100% yourself, without any fear or hesitation. You know in your heart that this person truly loves you and you truly love them for who they are.

**Analysis of Quote**

I have never experienced that with anyone. N E V E R. I've never felt comfortable sharing everything with ANYONE. Even my closest friends see maybe like 50% of my life at most. The whole world stops when I fail a midterm or final or class or some shit.

Anyway I apologize if this made no sense but that's honestly how I feel. 

I also wanted to clarify that I'm straight and that I'm not attracted to any of the men who commented about their girlfriends. It just pisses me off to no fucking end for some reason. 

**Rant**

Also an ex-friend of mine said that she loved her first boyfriend because it was nice feeling ""appreciated, validated and adored"" and while I would really fucking hate being ""adored"" because I'm not a 5 year old little girl, nor am a small, helpless newborn puppy, I guess it'd be nice to feel appreciated and validated for once in my life I guess. 

I've also noticed with 5 girls my age (17-20) that after they break up with their boyfriends, they find a new guy almost immediately! I think that says a LOT about what relationships have to offer. Like why would they find a new guy if relationships weren't a good thing to have in their lives? 

I've seen a therapist twice and I talked about this with her, and she acknowledged that I didn't like it when people talk about this stupid romantic idealistic bullshit but didn't really discuss further than that or ways to stop feeling so bad about it.

**Rant Part 2**

I literally feel like cutting every single time I hear something like that. 1 cut for each stupid comment I hear. 

Hearing that bullshit makes me wish I were deaf and blind and compounds the emptiness and meaninglessness I feel every single fucking day of my life. 

**My Life in Comparison**

I solely live for the dopamine rush I get after success, which to me means getting a good grade on an exam, getting a good grade in a class, getting that position, getting that internship, getting that job, doing something that'll look good on a resume, realizing that I'm closer to getting where I want to be (a doctor, if at all possible). That is where my validation comes from. 

Other than that, my life is just totally meaningless and empty otherwise lmao. I'll ask my parents how they are, make some small talk (how's your day) or a random sarcastic comment with a floormate, and share some stupid meme with my friends.

Occasionally I will talk seriously about something that's bothering me to my parents or my friends but rarely, as my parents don't understand and my friends can't really either, and I don't want to burden them. 

I'm seriously so fucking pissed that I am seriously just going to fucking pay someone to treat me like his GF for the day. 

I don't like anyone and have never had a ""serious"" crush so I guess whoever's the most ""handsome"" and seems the most genuine/caring the most gets the spot. "

8qib85,32,2018-06-12,"I am really happy in my situation, but it took a long time and the road was tough. Its long!",jalamanta101,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8qib85/i_am_really_happy_in_my_situation_but_it_took_a/,"In my twenties, I would be thinking about a million things and my emotions would fly all over the place. I thought this was normal and didn't seek any help and carried on with life, bottling up feelings.

This led to me going into situations to relieve the stress. Acid, Ketamine, cocaine, pills, MDMA and Booze. Going out across the city. 2 \- 3\-day benders. When the buzz wore off and the feeling of real life came back I found it unbearable. The feeling I had when I was on LSD, Booze or Cocaine gave me a sense of control and confidence. This carried on for a long time starting from 16 to 26. 

I was in a relationship at the time, that now I look back on was unhealthy for one reason or another. Most likely caused by my lack of confidence and inability to assess my own health and seek help. A lot of irrational behaviour. Young and stupid. She didn't understand the situation and I never explained. I was in and out of jobs and only started to get myself together with college. This relationship collapsed when I was 26.  So there I was one day on a Saturday playing payday 2 I think? She came in and 2 minutes later left me and then the country soon after. I Found out that she had an affair with a really good friend of mine. This was a 9\-year relationship and to say the least it absolutely crushed the life out of me. Queue the Violins.

Maybe a month after when it all started to sink in I had my full blown panic attack one day. Trying to play it cool walking down the road. The usual ""your alright bro, you don't need anybody"" Got a few beers and was going to go into the city. Halfway down a sinking feeling in my chest and then I just collapsed. All the fear and helplessness just boiled over and that was that. Let loose like a fountain. Nothing to trigger a change in your life like rock bottom and a broken heart.

That's when I went home and started thinking. assessed absolutely everything. I lived in a shitty one bedroom apartment. 1 window was broken. I was in debt. There was a crazy guy downstairs that had anger issues and raged about burning the house down. Everyone I knew just went on benders and would ridicule you for only drinking for 8 hours instead of 72. Most importantly I started to assess everything I was feeling. What made me feel that way and what I could do about it.

I finally started talking to people about how I felt. Some best pals, occasionally a random person at a bar and throwing it out there on the interwebs! Mostly, I was focusing on situations and how I dealt with them. How I would feel in this situation or that situation. Finally uncovering that anxiety was a core issue that would trigger a lot of irrational behaviour.

I started to take control and had to make a plan. I knew it was going to take a long time to re\-arrange everything i had known until this point and start down a different path. 

First thing was a good career. I got an internship and then after what seemed like 10,000 CV's, I got a job. Low level with the chance to progress in the career I wanted. 

I met another gal who I had laid out everything on the table to when we got serious. We moved to a new apartment. Some asshole left a dog in the middle of a motorway that I picked up and is now my best buddy who I love to death. 

I then progressed in my career and she progressed through college and into her career. We got engaged and bam here I am.

So what were the things I changed? No drugs (easy choice), I stopped smoking (it was painful). I still have a drink but ya know, like a normal person!

But mostly I didn't try to hide my anxiety. I embraced that this was a condition that I had. I found all the triggers and I would avoid them. I knew big parties and a lot of people would make me uncomfortable. So now I tend to just have one on ones or in small groups and avoid drinking sessions and nightclub scenarios. I got myself to the gym and started working out and getting fit. The Gym is genuinely the biggest help to anxiety, it builds confidence and lets you rest properly. I highly recommend yoga as well, this will iron out your breathing technique and keep you calm. I built a routine. This way you can keep control and when you feel in control you don't feel anxious.

I focused on myself, on how I was feeling. I stopped worrying about what everyone else was doing and trying to fit into their shape. I have my own way and I now control it. Knowing my limits and taking a step back to see the full picture. Finding the negative areas and keeping to what I felt comfortable with.

Remove the noise and create a positive atmosphere that you feel comfortable with. When you are comfortable with yourself, the good and the bad then everyone else around you will see that. Being confident and in control is the greatest portrait you can paint. It takes a lot of work and compromise but in the end, you will know that you have earned it and your anxiety won't be a burden but a compass.

I also got rid of Facebook. A personal thing I was just tired of people being pissy all the time. That or I am getting old. Either way, without it life seems quieter.

People sometimes say i am boring and don't understand but f\*ck em! Let em on !

Sorry for the ramble and grammar and spelling! I am not sure if this helps or is even entertaining. but if it helps even 1 person even a little it was worth it. "

I’ve been praying for months...,monitarlizard,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/8qif08/god_isnt_answering_my_prayers_ive_been_praying/,"Excuse my long story here: I am an immigrant to the US, doing everything 100% legally. Came on an H4 visa, switched to a student visa when I turned 21 ( this allowed me to work on campus, do internships etc unlike the H4 visa). I studied hard, even got my masters and landed a good job upon graduation. The company is willing to sponsor me for a work visa and they are, the problem is the US gov’t has turned the process of obtaining this H1B visa into a lottery.
My future is literally dependent on a lottery. I began praying for the process months before it started, and for the second year in a row I haven’t been selected. All my friends that had to go through the process got their work visa on the first try. 
Just when things were getting better for mum and I, this happens. With my income we were finally going to move out of our cramped  one bedroom apartment to a bigger one. We were finally going to get a car that isn’t at risk of leaving us on the side of the road. Heck she was going to take a break after a decade of working almost 365 days a year. I have to stop working soon and I am frustrated because this is the exact thing I prayed wouldn’t happen every single night since 2018 started... I look at people in the world who aren’t nice, torturing others, taking advantage of others yet some of them live wonderful lives. 
I feel like I am not doing anything bad. I Immigrated to the country legally, worked hard, had a 3.9 GPA for grad school. I am not out being a nuisance to anyone, but my prayers aren’t working."

I am about to finish my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in Romania. Last winter I applied for a Master degree in Austria (TU Graz), Denmark (Aarhus University) and Sweden (Uppsala University), and I got admitted to all of them. I didn't really expect to get a study place in all three of them, but here I am... :) Now I have a decision to make and I've been postponing for quite a while now. Where should I go?

My number one choice would be Austria, because it's really close to my home and from what I've seen online, Graz is generally one of the cheaper cities to live in. I don't know much about the other two.

How easy is it to find jobs as an English speaking person in any of these cities? I would really like to find a part time job as a programmer or a software engineer. Maybe an internship? Any advice or experience is highly appreciated. 

I don't really know much about the Universities in DK or SE. I saw that they are situated better in the World Rankings, but nothing else, really.

I speak very basic German, and no Danish or Swedish.

What do you guys think? 
Thank you in advance!"

After Onion was begging for new camera gear from his Patreon subs the Youtube check came in the mail so it’s time to make it rain.

All characters are 18+, it will involve some of my favorite kinks! Those are bimbofication, rough sex (hair pulling, spanking, choking..), young/old. Here is the prompt below:

I currently work for a tech company in upper management, this has given me a lot of extra money in my pocket but not a whole lot of free time, which leaves my 45 year old self still single and looking. I am in good shape, lean tone stomach, muscular arms and chest, a bit of hair on it in all the right places. I am clean shaven and my hair has that salt and pepper look, most would say I am one handsome man...

It was the first day that the new interns started and I was not present to pick, so one was given to me, you. You’re a plain looking girl, a bit nerdy if you will, but you are very intelligent and a quick learner.

We worked closely together, you learning as much as you could from me over the last 2 months and with your help we completed a large project, to celebrate I take you out for dinner and drinks. Little did I know that I would take you home...

That’s the start of my prompt, my idea for the story would continue turning you from nerdy young lady, to a complete and sex hungry bimbo, complete with fake tits, lips, ass, anything else you can desire. If you’re interested kik me at kinkyqcguy1320

*Brian blinked the sleep from his eyes, the wailing buzz of the alarm clock holding him from his sleep without warning. Groggily, he reached over to the bedside table and hit the button to shut it off. He didn’t need the snooze button. He could lay in bed for a few minutes without falling back asleep. Another look around the room reminded him of his unique position, a boon granted from God himself. The pale blue walls were a little more familiar today than they were the day before; where he was used to posters of bands and video games, instead there were paintings and whimsically written phrases. The typical mess of collectibles and homework on the dressers were now replaced with photographs, framed and positioned alongside each other. These pictures, of course, weren’t of him, but rather of two grown women by the name of Lena and Emily Oxton— the later of which slept peacefully beside him, adorned by nothing but leggings and a g-string. He could hear noises from the kitchen; Lena was most likely making coffee. And while he was loathe to leave Emily in the bed by herself, it was time to get ready for work.*

——————————————

If you know nothing about Overwatch lore and need a refresher about everybody mentioned in this post: Brian is the boy in the blue hoodie in the trailer, Lena Oxton is Tracer, and Emily Oxton is Tracer’s girlfriend– in this case, she’s her wife.

I’ll be playing the role of Brian. In my imagining of this prompt, Overwatch headquarters has been rebuilt and the team has been called to action once more. Also in this prompt: Tracer and her wife are massive pedophiles (or at least have a thing for young men.)! After the events of the museum robbery, Tracer and Brian crossed paths a few more times, finally electing to swap numbers after the umpteenth time. Not long after the two shagged; between that latex-covered butt and Tracer’s rampant desire for young boy cock, it was only a matter of time.

At the present moment all three parties are located in Bern, Switzerland, living in an apartment just outside of Overwatch headquarters. Lena and Emily have relocated from London due to Overwatch’s reassembly, and Brian is abroad from America under the guise of an internship with Overwatch– technically not a lie, but certainly not the whole truth either.

———————————————

My primary goal for this post is to build a harem of Overwatch’s finest, with Tracer and Emily as my ‘starter girls.’ To them, I’m their well-loved boytoy; all I need is to ask, and every one of my needs is sated (though occasionally with a chiding remark if my desire is especially kinky, or we’re in a public place). This goes vice-versa as well, and if you want to be done a certain way, I’m more than happy to play the bashful, eager-to-please hormonal teenager.


Although I have an excessive amount of kinks, my favorites are pregnancy/impreg, casual sex, public sex, cosplay, petplay, raceplay, drugs, beast, watersports, light/heavy bondage, sadomasochism, ageplay, willing abuse, tattoos, body writing, piercings and various others I’m probably not thinking of at the moment.


Typically I have no limits, but I’d like for this prompt to be fairly light-hearted, so I’d like to avoid scat, snuff, and gore. Blood is one hundred percent okay, so long as we aren’t shanking each other to make it, and I don’t mind bruises and black eyes so long as the characters specifically ask to be beaten in such a way.


I also play via KIK and Discord if chat or messages doesn’t work for you. My only requirement is that you understand I’m human and at certain times A.) am not horny, and B.) must attend work. In exchange, I will understand the same about you. Life happens, etcetera, etcetera.

8qjuxd,1,2018-06-12,20 [M4F] [Toronto]-Hoping that this can relieve some of the mental and physical stress I've been experiencing,PupsandCups,VirginityExchange,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginityExchange/comments/8qjuxd/20_m4f_torontohoping_that_this_can_relieve_some/,"Info: 3/4 Asian and 1/4 white, 5'10, 150 lbs, fit body, ddf, reasonably attractive

I'm currently a 20 year old engineering student residing in the Toronto/GTA area and am looking to experience the loss of my virginity this summer. I'm currently doing an internship and to say the least it's been a stressful experience, but at the end of the day this increases my job prospects, right?!

So I'm hoping on one of my days off I can meet up with an amazing woman who can show me a great time and give me a much needed stress release (both mentally and physically). I don't mind if you're a virgin either, because in that case we can help each other learn more about ourselves. I'm really interested in the whole concept of sex, the physical contact between two bodies and the intimacy that one experiences makes it sound like such an amazing time!

My birthday is also next week (June 21), so this experience would definitely be one of the best gifts I've ever received.

Some hobbies of mine include running, outdoor activities (I love free climbing), relaxing with the latest new Netflix shows, and cooking.

We can meet up for coffee or grab a bite to eat and get to know each other more before we get down and dirty. Hosting is possible (but can only do so for certain days on limited hours), I can split the cost of a hotel or Airbnb, and I can definitely travel within the GTA.

Again because this is a two person experience, I promise to respect any boundaries set beforehand and make sure you feel as comfortable as me before anything occurs.

I don't mind if this is a one time experience or it it turns into a FWB situation

Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!"

So last evening, I get an e-mail from a Facebook recruiter asking for my resume for the position ""Software Engineers, University Grads""...to either upload it to Piazza where he apparently found me or send it directly to his @fb.com e-mail address (which he provided).

I am surprised because:

1)  Piazza Careers during my college career was useless for getting an internship or job

2)  This ain't recruiting season for new University Grads

3)  My Piazza profile says I've already accepted a position for 2018 and so does my LinkedIn profile (which was recently viewed by a ""Recruiter"" that was most probably said Facebook recruiter)

No, I just realized I was arguing with a child. 

You start by saying Trump himself lies, but then like to substitute ""his administration"" whenever it suits you. I mean, if you're just going to bring in anyone in his admin to support your claims then who's next? We bringing in interns and shit to rebut Obama's policies now?

Then there was this line which I can only attribute to a hate filled aneurysm on your part...

&gt;And you can tell your Syria advice to Trump as he literally announced that’s what we were going to do

You're right! I don't know how to respond to that (because you stopped making sense). 

The rest of what you said just isn't grounded in reality. Trump is afraid of the Republicans? Really? And Chuck Schumer hasn't been running his lips about obstruction if Trump fires Sessions? 

Not to mention on every rebut I've given you specifics. What do you give back? A selective 20 second clip that DOESN'T EVEN CONTAIN THE LANGUAGE YOU PURPORT IT DOES!!! Utterly amazing.

That's right! Not only did he not say he'll sign *any* agreement in that clip (he says ""an agreement"") he doesn't even use the word ""any"" in the entirety of the clip.

Who's the liar now? According to your logic - you are!

So when you say

&gt;I’ve lost this argument so now I’ll resort to dumb insults that completely undermine the argument

It's more like ""never argue with idiots. They'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.""

8qkvo6,41,2018-06-12,Olivia Caridi podcast w/ Jared and Ashley,idontrlyknow1,thebachelor,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/8qkvo6/olivia_caridi_podcast_w_jared_and_ashley/,"Yes, I'm sick of them too. But I have a fake internship and I have nothing to do so fight me !! 

Jared is like interesting to me kind of in a bad way I feel like he's overloading her with love to make up for egging her on for 3 years. Ashley said Jared never ""toy\-ed"" with her but idk man.

\-  Brandi Cyrus had a party in LA and Jared and Ashley were kissing and being affectionate so Olivia had an idea before they announced it.

\-  Jared said they would rather be the annoying couple who's so in love than one that doesn't touch each other at all. They discuss how often Jared kisses her. He's a big PDA guy.

\-  They kind of recap the video. Jared's feelings for her was a slow process (obvi). He saw her in her comfort zone after paradise just chillen and he knew he liked her. He says people assume Ashley is emotionally unstable but she's very communicative and he's the unstable one because he internalizes things.

\-  He said he had feelings for Ashley as he was talking to Caila on paradise (hmmm).

\-  Olivia was like ""Jared you were on BIP Australia what the hell was that?"" and I actually LOLed. Jared got a call for WG and it didn't work out. Then he got the call for BIP Australia. They offered him money and it was a free trip. A lot of his friends were on WG so he wanted to do something too. He was there for 2 weeks and didn't kiss anyone but somehow made it through 6 rose ceremonies.

\-  When he went to BIP Australia Ashley wasn't that worried. During the entire time she knew him he never liked anyone else. She did cry before he left because she thought he was a different person and that he was depressed \- he was very in his head for like 2\-3 months at one point. He missed home and didn't know what he was doing (this was when he moved to LA). He also said it was painful to see her around that point because he had shame and guilt.

\-  The last time they did Olivia's podcast they were just friends and stayed in a hotel in NYC. They thought there were two beds and they slept in the same bed. Jared said he wanted to kiss her like a long time after that but not that night. 

\-  They talk about the reaction from fans and Bach people. They call each other the loves of their lives. Ashley's sister loves him. She texted him when Ashley was with Kevin saying she was rooting for her and Jared. He was at a Patriots game or watching one I couldn't quite understand but he started crying because he was so happy.

\-  Jared visited her family in Virginia a few times. He would leave and Ashley would be like how the hell is he not with me? His parents have also been pro\-Ashley. Bottom line Jared has been so manipulative these past 3 years I'm so over it but I'm already halfway through so I'm going to keep truckin'.

\-  Nick Viall told Jared to move to LA. He lived in his spare bedroom and told him to give it a try for a while. He didn't love it at first but knew he had to be there because of everything he told to Ashley, he wanted to give it validity. He's still not a huge LA fan. Ashley says during her mid 30's entertainment hosting will be less exciting for her and wants to stay in the field but could move somewhere else. She could see herself there forever though.

\-  They said the transition between being friends and more than friends was very easy. Jared said he likes being ""cutesy"" and I got goosebumps \- in an uncomfortable and chilling way.

\-  They said they wouldn't do a Paradise wedding and if they did a TV wedding it would be on their terms. Olivia didn't get the Paradise call this year. She got closure from the Bachelor world when she saw Ben for the first time at Brandi's. 

\-  Olivia went to a dating event called the great love debate (this may be a tv show idk?). The host was saying women are more independent now. And guys like to feel needed or admired. Guys say they want the independent woman but then they get her and don't want her. This was somehow related to Arie choosing Becca then going to Lauren \- comment made by Jared wasn't necessarily shady he said that Lauren doesn't appear to be the same caliber as Becca independence wise. That was probably a run on sentence but I'm not really a grammar person :))

\-  Jared and Ashley don't live together. Idk if he's still at Nick's or not though, Ashley just moved into a place 3 weeks ago.

\-  Olivia hasn't watched any of Becca's season yet but says she would get with Joe because he's attractive \- but she obviously hasn't seen any of his personality because she hasn't watched the show.

\-  They asked if they go overboard with the pictures. Olivia said keep a little mystery and do maybe one a week.

Something that really threw me off is that Jared kept saying in different ways that he never lead her on, or treated her bad, or played with her emotions. I don't think he meant to a lot, but when he told her he wanted to kiss her after the NYC thing and other stuff I feel like there was a little bit of that. Anyways I think it's clear I'm not the biggest fan of their relationship, however I do like Ashley more than I did before."
8ql2en,1,2018-06-12,I texted her,Stopdrinking111,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/8ql2en/i_texted_her/,"And I'm very concerned about her mental health. 

I know. I should not have texted her but we never fully agreed on NC. I'm working on myself and am feeling optimistic towards my own future, even though it's hard. The good news is that my anti-anxiety meds are working and I'm able to focus more on what I want to do. 

After the breakup, I went through hell and back the week after. So much so that my body broke out in hives and I was unable to breathe and had to go to the doctor. My body literally shut down. The idea of her with another man doesn't scare me any more, thank god for anxiety meds. 

The reason I texted her was to wish her a well week at work. Her two bff's just left the country for their internships, she's struggling at the job, and her family is far away. I also heard that she's had crippling panic attacks since the break and wasn't doing well. I don't regret reaching out. 

The conversation was fairly dry, she seemed defensive and then I cut through the formalities and asked if she was doing alright. She said she was having bad anxiety and I told her she could always reach out to me. 

I leave for Europe on Saturday for two weeks. I'm planning on potentially asking her out for coffee before I leave just to catch up on work, life, etc. I have NO interest in hearing about her dates, relationship, etc. 

We both want to be friends, and YES I am so aware of the dangerous territory I'm entering, but I think it's worth it. I'm not expecting her to take me back, I am un-investing myself from her, focusing on my mental health, and trying to just be a good person to someone who needs it in a lonely time: that's my default setting.

8qle8c,1,2018-06-12,"Let someone down at work, feel terrible about it",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8qle8c/let_someone_down_at_work_feel_terrible_about_it/,"First time posting here. 

So I started a new job recently, it's my first proper job, an engineering internship (I'm 22). 

I'm one of those people who can hide my anxiety pretty well, mainly by being overly matter of fact, only speaking when spoken to and doing my work to as high a standard as I can. For the most part this gives me a pretty ok time at work, I politely say hello to people but for the most part I'm working at my desk, and people tend to think I'm busy and serious about my work and leave me alone. For the most part I'm fine. 

However a new guy started at work (he was a graduate, so 2 years my senior). He was put sitting beside me, so I was pretty much forced to make small talk and be talkative. I was trying my best but small talk really isn't my forte, as the day went on I grew more and more uncomfortable and shy. 

Lunch time came (I usually stay at my desk, go to the canteen and wolf something down then go back to my desk and keep working). The new guy was asking me what we did for lunch and realising he didn't know many people I said I would go for lunch with him, as I know how awful it feels to sit on your own (did it for 3 years of high school). So we went down to the canteen and it is packed with people, my heart starts to beat faster and my stomach turns in a knot. We sit down. I usually eat my lunch quietly and make brief contributions to conversations but since I'm pretty much sitting one to one with this guy he keeps making conversation. I try my best to engage him but it's hell. I feel like everyone is staring at me and the shame and panic take over. I hold it together by excusing myself to get some coffee, then I go to the bathroom and have a full on panic attack in the cubicle. I take some deep breaths, make it to my desk, put my headphones on and play soothing music, staring at my monitor for the rest of the day. I felt truly awful about leaving the new guy on his own and I could tell he was angry about it, I know I would be if someone did that to me in that situation. 

I spend the rest of the day debating whether to tell him the real reason or making some excuse. I am holding back tears from the guilt I feel from it, meanwhile he is sitting beside me the entire time. Eventually, I just tell him I'm sorry I rushed off today and that I usually don't go to the canteen, the rest of the engineering team usually go for lunch at x time so generally it's best to go with them, and I apologize again for being rude. He's very ok about it but I'm on the verge of tears. We keep making general conversation, it's almost time to finish up and I can feel my voice about to break so I excuse myself and get out of work as fast as possible. Soon as I get out the door I burst into tears, I hold it together for my commute and then I spent about an hour crying my eyes out on my bed.

I feel awful about hurting someone elses feelings, I know how bad it feels from being an outcast pretty much all of my life. "
8qlmsj,0,2018-06-12,"Me(29M)ex Fiance(25W)""cheating"" Fiance ""wanted"" me back very complicated",LeBongFlamezz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8qlmsj/me29mex_fiance25wcheating_fiance_wanted_me_back/,"Im posting  here because I don't know where  else to go. Long story short, I blew my  load into my ""girl"". Why its  complicated...... Ill try to keep it short  but there is a lot of  details.

My  backstory: I was a colossal  fuck up, trying to do the right thing.  Failed relationships, dead end  minimum wage jobs. I started going to  school For programming Got a good  factory job. Huge Stoner,  occasional(at this point) drug user, never  heroine though. My mother has  Multiple Sclerosis, and Father is an  alcoholic, still married.

Our  history:  So I meet this girl through a mutual school friend, She is  funny, smart  GORGEOUS. Turns out her mom is my mom blood management  specialist for 3  years. Finally get the courage to ask her out. We go  out find out she  has a kid, baby dad is a heroine addict, no real issues  on the surface  so we just keep progressing normally. We start  officially dating,  before we had sex, talked for a month. The first time  we had sex it was  going really well, as perfect as you could image.  Than out of no where  she gets off my dick, starts crying tells me its  over she doesn't want  to get hurt and likes me too much.This is when ALL  HELL BREAKS LOOSE, I  should have took it as a sign. But i thought, hell  I could fix this  girl and we can live happily ever after.  A year and a  half pursued and  it was a constant cycle of her breaking up with me,  next day fixing  it. Really high and Really low, but the sex was amazing  for both of us.  She would break up for literally no reason, cause she  scared or  because she is mad about the littlest thing. Always throwing  it I'm my  face that other guys hit on her and she could go out with them  at any  point. Even saying she is going to, but never did. Now through  out all  this, her baby dad, was a HUGE disappointment to the kid, she  her once  or twice a week for a few hours, Over our 3 year relationship I  was  basically her Dad and the only reason I stayed was because I felt  bad  for them. But this girl would always talk to said baby dad but never   see him or do anything with him(so she swears). The guy in and out of   jail, same thing every time, disappear come back for a few months till   addiction set in. A year and a half into the cycle, things start getting   REALLY good, like its finally working and perfect, less bullshit. It   was really shitty, what I did but it is what it is.  I have HPV, the   warts were there, i knew it the whole time, I didn't know how to tell   her. It was so wrong and i feel terrible about it. I think the guilt was   a reason why i thought i deserved all her bullshit. She finds out and   is fucking LIVED, thinks I cheated on her,  We decide to work it out  and  put off sex for a while. 2 years in now and the sex is starting to  get  great again. She finds out she had it now(another episode) but we  work  through it. Things are relatively stable now and pretty good,  still had  cycles but not as bad. The only real problem was she was a  little weird  about sex sometimes, I understand, but she keeps begging  and asking me  to marry her and fighting about it and blah blah blah, so  i ask her, she  says yes. It was very romantic, on the beach in Daytona  Beach, her  parents and sister ""babysit"" her daughter while went to  dinner and they  set candles in the shape of a heart and flowers with  the question. Fast  forward 4 months. Things get FUCKED. New management  at my work, They  till me to quit work or quit school, I chose school,  but 5 years man and  I'm crushed. Meanwhile I'm taking 5 graduate level  CS courses. And she  is basically living with me at my parents house  with her kid. My parents  are fighting all the time because my dad is an  alcoholic and my mom is  getting worse and worse, cant walk at all at  this point. My girl was  almost done with her Registered Nurse schooling  so my mom thought ""it  would be good practice for her"". She helping my  mom so much, making  lunch cleaning up her bowel messes showering her,  my parents were  definitely taking advantage of her. They said she could  help out since  she is eating there food and basically living there for  free. Anyway, we  fighting worse than ever at this point and ODDLY  enough didn't break up  during this time(like the past). I had always  had the alcoholic in my  blood and she hated it. Meanwhile I was  drinking every chance i had away  from her, often alone playing video  games. She HATED that. She didn't  want me to be like my lazy alcoholic  dad, drinks and plays video games  all the time. Oh and she was being  nice and tried to help me out by  printing a resume off for me. In a  rush I gave her a USB with my resume  recently added to it, with  pictures and a video of my fucking my first  love from 7\-8 years prior.  She actually ""breaks up"" with me. And it  seems for real. Except she  would still come around sometimes and she  wouldn't tell her daughter  because it would ""crush"" her or get her stuff  from my house. I'm more  of a dad than her real dad, he was never there  for ANY holiday the  whole time, birthday, nothing. No gifts Nothing. She  never kept her  daughter FROM him because she didnt want it to be her  fault that Sophie  was held from her dad. She really is a caring, loving  person, just  fucked up from her ex. So I'm trying to keep my grades up  3.75 GPA and  find a job for summer, and i figure she trying to find  herself, her  words. A month of this and very little talking she pops up.  Wants to  work things out, Loves me, sorry blah blah. I find out I got a   internship and a software developer! yay! except she doesn't want to   cuddle and definitely doesn't want sex because she is ""too emotional""   and we aren't connected. Than it dawns on me and I ask. during our   breakup, she fucked her baby dad twice. At this point he actually seems   clean in a halfway house. And has been spending time with his daughter   all day on Saturdays, BUT she don't trust him to be alone with her, so   she does other stuff when she there with her daughter. She claims she   feels TERRIBLE about it and didnt ""cheat"" cuz we were ""broken up"", she   did it because she felt so ugly and depressed and unwanted and it was   easy and purely for sex, and to feel better about herself and never   cheated on me ever. At that point it had been 4 months or since we had   sex.

TIFU

I   completely neglected her emotionally during those 4 months and neither   of us really ""tried"" in the relationship. I've been drinking everyday   for 2 weeks. trying to not fuck up this internship. Her ""trying"" to  talk  to me.  I thought it would be good to see her and my ""daughter"" so  we  got a Hotel. He daughter the usual hold me clingy i love you type  of  little girl to me. We talked a bit and she feels so bad she hurt me  and  all this stuff, even fought a little bit about me asking ""personal""   questions about her ex baby dad and how much they talk and this and   that. Too which she gets mad and defensive over. But she ""swears"" she   only talks to him about their daughter now.We had sex and let me tell u   something. It was the worst 10 seconds of sex i ever had (6 months   without pussy). I mean i told her it would be fast but ill fuck her good   after and keep going. I got a little in her (couldnt pull out fast   enough) INSTANTLY.  To which SHE replied, ""I wanted that in me"", and   proceeded to wipe it on my dick and than go really slow. I was like,   ""what you doing, ride it hard now"" and she said ""Trying to get it all   in."" Than hops up and starts crying saying how could i cum in her   without her consent, thats basically rape, and im not her property and   blah blah blah. We fought cuz someone called and she couldnt tell me who   it was and she left at 1 AM. She says she ""doesn't know if she wants  to  work stuff out after last night"". But she will prob try to come   back..always does.

I dont know what i   should do, because it obviously CRUSHED me. It will CRUSH a little 7   year olds heart. And i DO honestly believe it would crush my now EX if   we don't work things out. And obviously i know i need to stop drinking   lol. And in a comical and humiliating way, i don't want her to remember  my sex like that... Do I try or Give up?

PS. sorry for being   so long, a lot of details were needed to show the complication. This   isnt the ""plain and simple"" relationship"

I'm a 20 year old engineering student residing in the Toronto/GTA area for the summer and am hoping to experience the loss of my virginity. I'm currently doing an internship and to say the least it's been a stressful experience, but at the end of the day this increases my job prospects, right?!

So I'm hoping on one of my days off I can meet up with an amazing woman who can show me a great time and give me a much needed stress release (both mentally and physically). I don't mind if you're a virgin either, because in that case we can help each other learn more about ourselves. I'm really interested in the whole concept of sex, the physical contact between two bodies and the intimacy that one experiences makes it sound like such an amazing time!

My birthday is also next week (June 21), so this experience would definitely be one of the best gifts I've ever received.

We can meet up for coffee or grab a bite to eat and get to know each other more before we get down and dirty. Hosting is possible (but can only do so for certain days on limited hours), I can split the cost of a hotel or Airbnb, and I can definitely travel within the GTA.

Some hobbies of mine include running, outdoor activities (I love free climbing), relaxing with the latest new Netflix shows, and cooking.

Again because this is a two person experience, I promise to respect any boundaries set beforehand and make sure you feel as comfortable as me before anything occurs.

I don't mind if this is a one time experience or it turns into FWB situation

Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!"
8qmclm,5,2018-06-12,Huge increase in migraines after stopping MMJ (Rant),greatertrocanter,migraine,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/8qmclm/huge_increase_in_migraines_after_stopping_mmj_rant/,"I've used MMJ to control/relieve my migraines for probably 5 years now. It doesn't completely take away the pain but it helps me cope with it. I still take daily preventatives and abortives and sometimes I still end up in the ER. Anyway, about a month ago I decided to stop using MMJ because I'm going to be graduating from college and re-entering the workforce and even though I live in a state where it's both medically and recreationally legal, you can still be prevented from being hired if an employer chooses to enforce a no-tolerance policy. I didn't want that to potentially prevent my from getting hired somewhere.

Over the past month I've noticed a huge increase in the number of headaches and migraines I'm getting. I went from probably having one every couple of weeks to having one or two a week. I'm missing more work and internship days. Of course, I'm also more stressed because of the job search and graduation, etc. But still, this is excessive and I can't live like this. 

I decided today to use MMJ again just to get me through until my first neurology appointment next week. It might set me back a little bit on the job search but hopefully that means I'll be able to function a little bit these last few days of college. I just hate the fact that I have to decide between my health and the rest of my life, you know? Not just with the MMJ thing but with migraines in general - they run my whole life."

I figured i'd post in this sub to get more advice. Please let me know if this is not allowed.  


My friends and I were looking for apartments in SF for the summer (sublet) for our internship. We found one 3BR apartment and it looked pretty nice. We reached out to the broker (Craigslist ad) and moved forward in the process. We were sent the lease and told we had to be in the office in 6 hours with paperwork and the funds, otherwise we'd lose the apartment. We suggested to hold for a few days so we can look over the lease more thoroughly, but the landlord refused and engaged in pressure tactics to keep us. Unfortunately, it worked. One of my housemates checked out the apartment and we signed. Upon further inspection of the apartment, we noticed that the apartment is actually a 2br with an office that is 7 feet by 7 feet, way too small for anyone to live in. It also doesn't have a closet or windows.

The broker was bragging throughout of how he's got many reviews and experience. This seems to be a lease and not a regular sublet. I believe the Broker simply advertised the house for the landlord. Do we have any action here?

We need a place to live for the summer and are worried that the 7x7 room might be unsafe (earthquake and fire standards?) My housemates don't mind living there if we can get a rent adjustment.

We'll be contacting the tenants union tomorrow for advice as well. Has anyone faced something like this or heard about this happening to someone before?"

For those that don't know, this refers to the big 3/4/5 etc companies that a lot of people want to end up working for or get internships at, consisting of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc. due to their constant evangelisation in the community.

UX doesn't seem to have anything like this. Why not? Are they the same? Is there significant overlap, or do people prefer working at companies like Frog or IDEO?

While I'm sure there are plenty of reasons why this is the case, (UX is a newer field, Big tech companies focus more on CS, etc.), and there is a case to be made that this sort of mentality of putting certain companies on a pedestal is detrimental, I think that it is symptomatic of a larger issue, which is that **there needs to be more information about careers in design.**

I think we need to have a discussion about how we can improve this situation, as it will serve to help designers arm themselves with information to more easily make career decisions."

Prompts within!",MarriedMILFMischief,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8qo65w/45f4a_looking_for_my_sons_bully_or_maybe_just_my/,"Hi, everybody. I'm Gwen, and tonight I'm on the prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay. Something filthy, something rough and wrong and maybe taboo. I love dirty talk, rough sex, infidelity, incest, humiliation...all that good stuff, and I'm especially looking for someone to play either my son's bully or my son himself.

[Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png)

Listed below are a few prompts/scenarios that I'm interested in, although none of those are set in stone and I'm eager to hear your ideas. Also, since it sometimes helps, I occasionally like to put a celeb face to the character I'm playing. Christina Hendricks, Elizabeth Mitchell, Evangeline Lilly, Rachel Weisz, Kim Dickens, Winona Ryder, Julie Bowen, Monica Bellucci...or anyone you want, really.

Anyway, onto the prompts:

* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...

* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...

* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me..."

Edit: I’m adding this edit to address a common point, a lawyer without college would do worse, not well rounded, lacks x,y,z. They might not be good enough etc. here is the counter argument. Don’t hire them. I’m saying they should be allowed to take the test. Eventually they will score an internship from an open minded employer who respects self teaching, and gain experience and prove themselves. Keep in mind, everyone still needs a resume, if you don’t want to hire no college then don’t.

Let me add something, I’m going into IT, it offers tons of certification tests, many of these jobs are very important to keep a business running, a failure can cost millions to larger companys. Yet the issue of “people just study to pass” is not mentioned at all, people know they need this knowledge. These certifications are obtained by a test, no college needed. Other disciplines can copy this concept. Want a specific field of law certification? Take that specific test which covers a specific topic extensively. Sure college helps, it gets you past resume filters and makes you a more appealing candidate, but you should be allowed to take these “qualifying tests” without college

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

My name is Dakota, a 23 year old recent college graduate with a bit of a craving. I'm a little over 6 foot, slim but toned build and tanned (thank you summer) skin tone. I have short brown hair styled up, hazel green eyes and currently wearing a tie that may just be a little too tight. I recently landed a dream job of mine, and although I'm only an intern still, I couldn't be happier. Work keeps you busy and the time seems to hurry along. Usually. Apparently slow days are a little different here, and it seems like it's been 1:30 for the last 2 hours...

That is where you wonderful people come along! I'd love really any sort of chat to pass the time. Chat, roleplay, gif exchange, you name it and I'm up for it.

I was thinking it could be fun to see just how close you can get me to cumming while at work, sitting at my desk while the pretty, blonde secretary sits clueless as to what's happening.

Maybe we set up a roleplay in the office, or on the beach, or anywhere your little heart desires.

What if you were to instruct me and tell me just what I should be doing to tease myself as time winds down towards the end of the day.

Maybe you're simply looking for some more hot gifs and we spend some time sharing our kinks and appropriate filth.

If you have any other ideas, I'm happy to listen and chat about them, I'm feeling confident we'll be able to set something up that tends to both of our... dark cravings.

As far as kinks go, I'm pretty open. Things that really get me, clothed sex, public, rough sex, extreme deepthroating, edging, cum/spit play, orgasm control/denial, being told what to do, forced/ruined orgasm, just to name a few.

For limits, just try to avoid extreme pain, blood, toilet anything, incest, and we should be good. Anything, and I mean *ANYTHING* else, please chat with me and let's find out if it's a fit

I'm looking forward to hearing from you all!"

8qpium,2,2018-06-13,[17M] Asking out [17F] in my school,throwaway487921,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8qpium/17m_asking_out_17f_in_my_school/,"There's this girl [17F] in my class (and also in my lunch wave) who I really like, and I want to ask her out. I'm also shy, but that's a problem I can solve. I've had classes with her last year but we never talked, so she didn't even know me. This year, we actually got to know each other, and we've been sitting together at lunch and computer science (the class, which I happen to excel in) since then. She's always happy to see me, but I can't really tell if she's actually interested in me. No physical contact, but she gets happy whenever I sit next to her in class/lunch. She did bring me cupcakes for my birthday, but I don't know if she has done anything similar for others. 

I've befriended her friends, but there was a recent feud in their friend group so I'm trying to stay out of it and focus on the girl I'm interested in. As for her other male friends, she behaves with them kinda how she behaves with me (she does have a few guy friends, and I'm friends with two of them) but I'd like to think I have a chance. She did date someone back in January but I haven't heard anything about it recently, so it might have been a one time event. 

The year is basically over (tomorrow is our last computer science class, and then finals) and since I'll have a car in the summer (she already does), I was thinking about asking her out then. I know that dating is possible without a car, but I'll have like 200% more freedom with one (I also need one for my internship). I'm going to ask her about her summer plans (she's also working/interning) and tell her tomorrow that we should hang out some time in the summer. We already talk daily on Snapchat, so I might ask her for her number as well. 

Edit: I wasn't able to ask her today (we had a final exam) but I'm going to try to get her number."

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

8qpnx9,1,2018-06-13,My [28F] Boyfriend [30M] Meeting Out of Town Married Ex [30F] He Texts Daily for Drinks,reveuse88,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8qpnx9/my_28f_boyfriend_30m_meeting_out_of_town_married/,"I'm not sure what to do. 

I have been dating my boyfriend for almost a year. He is kind and caring was there for me after I was hospitalized for a brief illness last year. But I feel he is also insensitive when it comes to this ex\-girlfriend. She lives in California, we live in DC. He traveled out there for his internship sometimes and she is now in DC on a work trip. From what he has told me, they have not met up in years, but they talk everyday. Her texts pop up all the time even the wee hours of the night. He replies to her first thing when he gets up (he normally doesn't even text me until he is entering his office or at about 12pm on weekends if we aren't staying over at each other's place). He hides his phone when her many messages pop up. And then criticizes me for making him feel like he is doing something wrong even though I don't say anything when I see her texts. I have brought up my concerns three times and he was defensive so I just pretend not to see or leave the room. But then I feel like I am being forced to pretend I'm okay with something that makes me uncomfortable.

I realized they texted last year when my boyfriend and I have the same phone and while we were on a camping trip last night, I picked up what I thought was my phone to help me get to the bathroom and read a message from her alluding to their past. When I asked him about it, he said, ""she's married and she lives in California"". That was not comforting and I told him that he said, ""we fought a lot when we were together"" and then finally ""I'm with you not her."" He freely gives her and other women compliments, but rarely compliments me. I am know I am beautiful and smart, but it would be nice if my boyfriend could sometimes tell me I look nice for a date especially when he freely compliments his exes and other women. 

Today, he told me ""oh by the way, she's in town and I am meeting her for drinks tomorrow, but I asked her to make sure our former coworker is also there."" I feel like the late notice is so we cannot discuss it and after almost a year of dating, he could extend the invitation especially knowing that I would not show up and be the awkward third wheel. I doubt their former coworker will show up because I do not feel she respects our relationship or that he protects our relationship because I am left to wonder how much he values us over her. When I asked him tonight if she is happy we are together, he said a high pitched ""yeah"" and then said he doesn't open up about some aspects of his life. WTF?! As a future wife and mother, her behavior is something I would not do because I think it's emotional cheating. Talk to your bloody husband about your tough day. As his girlfriend, I feel as though that relationship and his pride mean more to him than I do.

I care about him a lot. I have even expressed that I love him, which he returned, but subsequently rescinded and said he was not ready to say. I feel dumb even typing that because in my heart, I feel like I know this is another sign that this relationship is not where I need to be. Then again, I think about the good times and the future he talks about with me and I decide to just let him get there when he is ready to say the love part. But this thing with his ex is to the point I am seriously thinking of leaving him.

Before you assume I am just some jealous chick, he just finished grad school and has lives in a house with another male and two single female roommates. One who walks around with her cheeks out and no bra (I hate bras too so no hate there). I do not feel concerned about that roommate because she respects our relationship and has even grown to be a friend of my friend. He is on a softball team with another ex, who is extremely handsy. I told him to nip that in the bud (no reason some chick should be wrapping her legs around you in a hug every time you go to a team event), but I did not ask him to go to another team or whatever even though their teammates expressed that they thought the two of them were dating because of how they interact. In that instance, he said he did not feel she liked him because she had dumped him years ago. I asked if he would be okay if I behaved the way she did with another man and that got him to talk to her. She continues to be flirty, but less so now so I just (try) to ignore her. I am polite to her.

The ex\-girlfriend makes me uncomfortable. She is a married, working mother of two, who somehow has time to text her ex about everyday stuff and her problems. From what I saw, they don't talk about each other's significant others. It's like me and the husband do not exist. I think their behavior is something that her husband would probably not appreciate either. My boyfriend is a hypocrite though. He confronted me for chatting with a woman I met at a bar about breakups. He thought we were flirting (I shared with him before that I have dated two women in my early 20s). I thought his reaction was embarrassing and rich considering he has this on\-going emotional bond with another woman.

I have expressed that it makes me uncomfortable on three separate occasions. He says that he doesn't keep in touch with his friends and she is the only other person who makes the effort to reach out to him. No, they text and IM daily. He can make that effort to talk to her, but for months now, he has not talked to the guy he calls his best friend and who always initiates contact with him.

I am friends with two of my exes, but once I became exclusive with my boyfriend, I had clear chats with my exes that playful banter that could be misconstrued as flirtation and risk my relationship could no longer go on. I cut out one of them for seven months when he left me a drunken phone message and referred to missing me as his girlfriend and especially our past physical relationship (including explicit details of what he wished he could do to me). He apologized the day after his message, but I told my boyfriend (not any gory details) that my ex had drunkenly referred to our past in a way I did not think was respectful of our relationship and had subsequently apologized. I just didn't want my boyfriend to get the wrong idea. I kept this ex/friend at arm's length for several more months and only after he expressed support and respect for my relationship did I invite him to my graduation party where my ex turned friend met my boyfriend and they got along great. I'll admit that I now feel foolish and taken for granted for being more cognizant of not letting anything get in the way of our relationship than he is. 

In my experience, the woman a man fights for or defends is the person he values more. He knows that I have been left before by an ex who swore his very familiar and omnipresent ex was just a friend. And then one day, they were moving in together. Granted this is a married lady so a little harder to do, but still. I'm hurt. After he told me about drink plans tomorrow, he is now offering to take me to a nice restaurant on another night. I feel like that is another smack in the face. 

Thanks for reading,

The Insignificant Other

8qqu06,1,2018-06-13,I wrote some hard core 'erotic literature' while skiing...,CaliYoThat,cocainegonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocainegonewild/comments/8qqu06/i_wrote_some_hard_core_erotic_literature_while/,"So I dunno if posting this in gonewildstories would be alright, because I wrote this while skiing and while thinking of previous nights having sex on coke. And when I'm horny on coke, I get *dirty*, and hard core language and thoughts get me going.

So I wrote some paragraphs that I'll eventually amalgamate into a story or book, as it is all different versions of the same 'scene', but only if people want this kind written erotica. Let me know what you think. It's all cocaine sex related, and how I feel inside while skiing while horny:

""*She pulled down his briefs and it stood out for her. Presenting itself. His hard thick cock. Throbbing. Throbbing because of her. He looks at her swollen tits and hard nipples, and his cock pulses in her face. He catches a glimpse of the top of her ass as she kneels before him, and his cock pulses in her face. He meets the gaze of hers, locking eyes, completely open and vulnerable to each other, seeing the most private and intimate things that no one should see and wanting nothing more than to fuck each other, hard core and dirty, and his cock pulses in her face. It throbbed and hardened with each heart beat, and she felt her own pulse in her tits and deep in her cunt. They felt so much lust, and they drowned themselves in the thought of it being wrong. Dirty. She was a lawyer. A professional woman, sharply dressed, walks around respected and admired and fully clothed, and her intern was business casual and boringly polite with everyone in the office and now she’s naked showing him her wide wet pussy and his rock hard bare dick is huge and solid in front of her face and they both jerk themselves off, staring into each others eyes and fuck holes and it was so god damn wrong but so good. 

She intently watched every throb in front of her and felt her pussy match with throbs of achingly good pleasure. She couldn't wait anymore. She wraps her hand around the head of his dick, and slowly runs it all the way down to the base. And it feels like it takes forever. His cock keeps going. Every smooth inch is a mile. Every pulsing vein is a mountain. Every drop of cum is an ocean. She briefly thinks to herself, all of this is going to be inside me, and she moans. A moan so vivid that it hit him. It came out vibrato, visible, thick smoky sound waves that you see and feel as they hit your body. You can smell them. You breathe them in, and feel her moan inside you, echoing.* ""

------------------------------

""*The heat. A lot of people hate the heat, but many do love it. Mugginess, though, not many enjoy. That ‘too hot’ temperature where you’re just uncomfortable, and sticky-sweaty on every inch of your body. 

But there’s one moment when a hot day transitions into mugginess; One fraction of a moment, that not many notice, where the temperature is just right. Just perfect enough to hit a well hidden, dark yet thriving and throbbing part of your brain. A moment where you’re hit with a flash of heat, and body sweat, but it just feels oh…so…good. For a moment when, no matter where you are, in a hot flustered sweat, you just want to rip off your clothes, lay down, throw open your legs and show the world your pulsing clit. You open your pussy as wide as you can and just beg, to anyone, to get down and suck on your cunt. 

————————————-

She was in it. 

Her back arched, and she had a look on her face that, normally, would mean one thing: fury. But anger here is pleasure. A primal, ethereal, hard core, dirty, “fuck me now” kind of pleasure. The angriest you’ve ever been, but concentrated in pure endorphin bliss in your clit, deep into your pussy and rolling out through your whole body. In this way, she was furious. Livid. She grunted, an animalistic caveman grunt, as she kept rubbing her clit. 

It was coming soon. She could feel it. A dam holding back the ocean, but an apocalyptic storm is coming. The dam is cracking. Leaking. The flood is too much. 

The air around her is red. Hot, steamy. The sound around her is red. Everything is red. A deep shadowy alluring red. Violently delightful red. She finger fucks her hole, and a colour of white is growing, glowing, growing from her pussy. She moans, and it comes out as vibrato. Thick moaning sexy sound waves, that you can actually see. You can breathe them in, and feel them. Feel her moans deep within you. 

She turns her head to the left and there’s a long, thick, throbbing hard cock next to her face. ""*"
8qqxes,10,2018-06-13,Frustrated journo grad at a crossroads,jazz_matazz,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/8qqxes/frustrated_journo_grad_at_a_crossroads/,"I'm 28-years-old and I've been out of my cushioned ""safe job"" at a local homebuilding company for the past 2 months. My funemployment has consisted of selling my old high school clothes on depop and catching feral cats around my parents' house (I've been pretty good at it too). 

I've also been a journo grad for 5 years with no real experience in journalism outside of student-run newspapers. I have run a local community blog before, but it fizzled out within a year. I've applied for our local Central California newspaper for a general reporter position at least twice, with no callback. I've applied to our local, bigger Central California newspaper for an internship position, again, with no email or callback. I was able to get into my interview shoes with a Central California Business Journal newspaper, and no callback. 

Most of my writing (mostly focused on local music) was published with no compensation, for the sake of experience and resume-building. I've been thinking of working in social media/marketing industry, but I have a deep love for journalism, mostly human interest, and mostly local (Visalia/Fresno). I do feel journalism itself is at a crossroads too, but it has been so important and so crucial in this day and age, that I feel it's one of the last, true bastions of Western society. It's how we continue to connect, and how we continue to *try* to understand each other. 

Unfortunately, I feel I have no real outlet to gain anything in journalism. I have applied for multiple marketing positions in the area, as well as for basic communication positions with no callback. Tried AmeriCorps Vista position in communications, again with no callback. I worked as ""marketing assistant"" with that local homebuilder, up until they decided they didn't need me anymore (probably because they only had me focus on making hundreds of homebuyer gift baskets in a basement of an old building, a white-collar sweatshop, essentially). 

Suffice it to say, I feel I am at the end of my non-existent journo career rope. I've written at least 50 different cover letters, with about 20 versions of my resume. At the moment, I volunteer for a nonprofit as a social media volunteer, where I have been working on my email marketing skills, under the guise that I'm a ""Christian"" working for a Christian-based organization, so at this point, I feel like I'm selling out on my dark atheist soul. 

After I got laid off from my last job as a ""marketing assistant"" (where I started out as a receptionist), I continuously looked for ways I can enhance my skills. Any skills. Hence my social media volunteer position. I've sent out about 10 different cover letters, applications, and resumes, that I'm pretty sure I can't tell the difference in them anymore. 

The only other idea that I have where I can mesh my passion (writing, human interest, photography, layout design, social media) is by taking my career into my own hands and publish a magazine focused on downtown Fresno. People everywhere in California still see it as the state's smelly armpit, but I've seen the local community thrive and it has been growing like crazy. So many young people are moving downtown, dozens of local restaurants, and even an emerging tech hub. I'm sure the Fresno Bee has already covered most of these trends here, but I feel a long-form magazine with nice ""hip"" design and aesthetic would appeal to the emerging young audience. I would have to look into how much publication costs would be. Starting out as a blog could help, and will have literally zero cost, but I feel the print aesthetic will be more appealing (mostly I am a print lover, and I can't let my hard-earned InDesign skills go to waste!). 

So I'm asking you, Journalism Reddit community, what advice would you give to an older journo grad, with no real-world reporting experience (other than being an editor and reporter for three student-run newspapers) who is at a career crossroads?

Should I pursue making a local magazine? Should I hit the books and get a masters in journalism? Should I get into PR/marketing/social media as my bread and butter? Should I ask for a mentor? (How does one even do that?) Should I be an admin assistant or receptionist for the rest of my life? Should I move to Mexico, work at a tortilleria, and make a tableside photo book on roadside memorials? Should I start a business on catching feral country cats? 

Someone, please guide my unlucky stars. "

I will be starting an internship which will include tasks with Apache Spark. Thus I thought that having hands-on experience before starting internship would be better for me and I would contribute more.
I checked the offical RDD programming guide but I did not find it educative. I understood the material on site but I would like to do some basic tasks involving RDDs, DataFrames etc. Do you recommend any books/free materials? Btw I am using Python API but using Scala is ok for me, however, in internship, most of work will be done with PySpark.
I went through O'Reilly book (Learning Spark - Lightining Fast Big Data Analysis) but it includes simple examples too. I would like to work on real world data. Should I pick random dataset from Kaggle and wrang on it on my own then?  

Thanks in advance."

We're pulling back the curtains on Robin Wesley's successful beat selling business and do a deep dive on what it takes to grow to that level and make a living off your music

I'll post a good chunk of the article right here as I know you guys like to stay in the app. However, there are no annoying fly in popups so your reading experience should be similar if not better in the [OG article](https://urbanmasterclass.com/how-to-sell-beats-online/?utm_source=sm&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=sm_reddit_definitiveguidetosellingbeatsonline_13062018&amp;utm_term=post&amp;utm_content=r-beatmakers). Oh and yes, there's a download in the article in exchange for your email, but I'll just include a direct link at the bottom of this post. 

All set? Good.

## Enter Robin:

Escape the 9\-5. Do what you love. Spend your days in the studio creating music. Take the day off and make your own hours. Get paid when you’re chilling with your friends and family. And get paid, even when you’re asleep.

That’s not a dream. That’s reality. I know, because [I’m living that lifestyle.](https://www.instagram.com/robinwesleyinstrumentals/)

And so are hundreds of other producers.

To get started, you don’t need a team. You don’t need a manager. You don’t even need a lot of money.

**You only need two things:**

* Good music
* A way to put your beats in\-front of an audience

If you plan on selling beats, make sure those beats are worth selling.

Are they? Great!

In that case, you can turn your beat making skills into a profitable business. There are thousands of artists who are willing to pay you for your music.

But selling beats online is not only about making music.

You need a plan to get started. How are you going to get your music heard?

How are you going to close deals and get artists to pay for your beats?

You’ve come to the right place because that’s what I will cover in this article.

## Who am I?

My name is Robin Wesley. I’m a full\-time music producer and co\-founder of Urban Masterclass. I’ve been successfully selling beats since 2013. Only 4 years before I decided to write this guide.

I started making beats in 2012, but it wasn’t until 2013 that I sold my first beat online.

In 2013, I made less than $500. I didn’t have a clue what I was doing…

In 2014 I made $16,432 and started to get the hang of it…

In 2015, I made $31,231 from selling beats online.

That was more like it! And at that point you could safely assume I was making a living off doing music. But it wasn’t enough for me.

In the years after, I’ve automated and optimized most of my beat selling business. **I’ve made 6\-figures** with less than 50 beats in my beat store and putting in about 20 hours of work every week.

I’ve built an email list with thousands of paying customers. I sold over 5,000 beats to artists worldwide. Landed **placements with major artists**, labels and television networks. **Heck, I even scored a** [#1 hit in Vietnam](https://youtu.be/g20t_K9dlhU).

And this all started as a hobby. Making music in my tiny little bedroom studio. Simply doing what I love most, day in and day out. Perhaps, just like you right now?

Today, I’m running multiple businesses and still making thousands a month from selling beats. I’m not telling you this to brag, I’m merely showing you what’s possible.

Enough about me, let’s dive into the specifics.

## A throwback to selling beats and why you should consider doing it.

The truth is, I always thought I was late to the party. I started selling beats in 2013, but I wish I started earlier.

Then again, back in the day, it was a struggle to sell beats online. I remember talking to producers that told me about the hassle. The whole process was clumsy, to say the least.

When someone purchased the tracked out files of a beat, producers had to burn the files to a CD and mail it to the artists. That’s a lot of work even when you only make 2 sales a day. I can’t imagine having to go through that every day.

Even when file sharing was introduced. There was no easy way to automatically send beats to customers.

I used to wake up every morning and the first thing I’d check is to see who purchased my music. Then I had to manually email that customer all the audio files.

Lucky for us, it has become a lot easier these days.

We now have online beat selling platforms like BeatStars, Airbit and Soundgine—to name a few. They help beatmakers run an automated beat selling business.

You can sign up for free and start selling beats on their platform within 30 minutes.

These beat selling platforms give you a beat store and a personal website where you can sell beats from.

A place where you can direct your customers to and give them an opportunity to buy your beats. You don’t even need your own website anymore (although I recommend getting one).

Instagram, Facebook and YouTube are the most popular places to sell beats and to build a loyal fan base.

## Is it profitable?

Definitely. In essence, beats are digital products that you can sell over and over again. The profit margins are crazy once you gain traction.

BeatStars recently posted [a tweet](https://twitter.com/BeatStars/status/929214591665569792) about the monthly revenue made by their producers.

The fact that producers made over [$1,000,000](https://twitter.com/BeatStars/status/925560210697138176) in one month says enough about the possibilities to snatch a small piece of that pie.

This also proves that artists are willing to pay serious money for beats these days.

I ran the numbers to see how much revenue the beat selling market generates. I concluded that the market must be generating at least $30,000,000 a year.

Even if you manage to get 0.001&amp;#37; of that, you would still be making $30,000 a year.

Plenty reasons to start selling your beats online, wouldn’t you say?

## The dark side of selling beats online

If you’re anything like me, you’ve seen a dozen producers making 6\-figures a year from selling beats. That sounds very promising!

Remember I told you that I only made $500 back in 2013?

A year later, I made a whopping $16,432. Yep, this wasn’t bad—but it wasn’t good either. You probably get paid more by working a job at the supermarket.

Needless to say, I was hungry for more.

But selling beats online is all about scaling your business one sale at a time. There is no “get\-rich\-quick” method.

When you’re building your business, you will stumble upon people who tell you there *are* such methods.

*“Want to get a 1000 YouTube views today? Buy now!”* or *“Get 500 Instagram followers for only $25!”.*

Don’t fall for that sh\*t! Accepting offers like these is a short\-term play, usually with low return. Even if you decide to buy a “YouTube promo” and get a 1,000 views. Those views never come from people who have interest in buying your beats.

A general rule of thumb is: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

You can start an online beat selling business, on your own, just like hundreds of other producers. But, *you* have to do the work. You have to be willing to get up every day, create new music and be consistent with your online presence.

## Part 1: The Inner-Workings of Selling Beats Online

Until this day, I haven’t found out who pioneered the business model for selling beats.

If you know the person who was the first, please let me know in the comments below. I’ll be sending that guy/girl some flowers, a postcard and a box of Hennessy!

All jokes aside, the business model for selling beats is easy and straightforward.

## Beat Licensing Explained: How does selling beats work?

There are two ways of licensing: Non\-Exclusive and Exclusive.

There’s only one exclusive license, but you can offer and sell different non\-exclusive licenses. For example, a Basic, Premium and Unlimited license. The Basic license would be the cheapest option. And the Unlimited license the most expensive.

More user rights and better quality audio files equal higher license prices.

You can sell non\-exclusive licenses to an unlimited amount of artists. But an exclusive license can only be sold to one person.

When you create a beat and upload it to your beat store, people can (instantly) buy these non\-exclusive licenses. You can also choose to sell exclusive licenses from your beat store. But it’s common to negotiate on the price before selling the exclusive rights.

When artists buy a non\-exclusive license, they are granted several user\-rights that allows them to use your beat for their (personal) music projects.

Once someone purchases an exclusive license, other artists can no longer buy a license for that same beat. Generally, producers then mark the beat as ‘SOLD’. Or remove it entirely from their website after it’s sold ‘exclusively.’

Artists that have licensed the beat before the exclusive rights were sold are still allowed to use the beat for the length of the term in the license.

## How much money can you make from selling beats online?

It’s pretty much the exact same as any other eCommerce business. With simple math, you can determine how much money you can make.

The best part of all this? **This is a proven business model!** Hundreds of producers, including myself, are making serious money from this.

Think about it…

How would an extra $12,000/year change your life?

How would an extra $30,000/year change your life?

How would $100,000/year change your life?

That graphic shows you the journey that producers have travelled to build their online beat selling businesses. But, let’s take it one step at a time.

### How I went from $500/year to a 6-figure income

Back in 2012, I got one of my friends to build a website for me. Thinking back now, It was terrible.

I had a player on my website that didn’t work half of the time. Nobody really visited my website and I had no idea how to generate traffic.

But I was determined to sell my first beat.

So, I started uploading my beats on YouTube, Soundcloud, SoundClick and any other platform that I could think off.

I started creating promotional videos on YouTube.

even searched Facebook and Twitter for artists. Sliding in their DM’s asking if they were interested in buying my beats.

At that point, I was frustrated. I spent a lot of hours trying to sell my first beat and it seemed like nothing was working.

But slowly, more people were starting to listen to my beats. Until one day, I made my first sale on SoundClick.

Cha\-ching!

### My first terrifying sale…

November 23rd, 2013.

I woke up in the morning and jumped out of bed because I was late for work. I overslept because I worked on a beat the entire night.

I noticed that I had a PayPal notification on my phone: “You received a payment of $30.00 from name@gmail.com”.

I couldn’t believe it…

Even though I was late for work. I said to myself: “What the heck, I’m already late anyway.” I sat down and logged into my PayPal account because I still couldn’t believe it. I had to double\-check.

But it was real. I just made a sale!

Like I mentioned earlier, we had to manually send the audio files by email. It took me almost 30 minutes to write a simple email (re\-wrote it a bunch of times).

I thanked the guy for purchasing my music and acted like I had been selling a bunch of beats overnight…

*“Thanks for purchasing my music. I’m sorry it took a while to send you the audio files. I had a bunch of sales to process this morning.”*

LMAO! 

I was so excited, I sent out the email without the attachments. Oh man, such an amateur…

But it happened. And it was one of the best moments of my life.

A moment that changed my life forever (how cliche that may sound).

### Selling beats is not magic, it’s simple math &amp; marketing

Later that day—at my boring 9 to 5 job—I was doing the math.

**What if I could sell 10 beats a month?**  
10 x $30 = $300

**Wait, what if I could sell 50 beats a month?**  
50 x $30 = $1.500

I was blown away! These were crazy numbers for someone that worked a 40\-hour intern job for $750/month.

It hit me that I could make twice the amount of money by selling beats online.

That moment my mindset changed and the growth of my business began. Because within this story lies the plain old truth; “Hard work pays off…”

8qrtck,25,2018-06-13,Dutch Software Development Traineeship with IOTA development options,JelleFm,Iota,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/8qrtck/dutch_software_development_traineeship_with_iota/,"Hey Reddit,

I am posting this traineeship advert on Reddit because I know a lot of people want to start a career as (Software/Blockchain/IOTA) developers and don't know where to start. This might be a good opportunity for some of you! 

We are currently setting up a brand new software development traineeship program at VX Company IT Services in Baarn, the Netherlands. It will run from September with a duration of 6 months. The traineeship is meant for recently graduated Dutch speaking IT workers that want to get their first experience in professional software development.

Schedule:

- 1st month of the traineeship you will study to gain important certificates for your CV and get to know the company and your colleges. 

- Months 2 and 3 you will gain your first work experience with an internal project. We encourage trainees to have a specialization of new technology like Blockchain and IOTA, and this internal project will be based on your interests (We are open to someone doing their Internship or Thesis in this timeslot).

- Months 3+ you will work as a software developer for a project with one of our partners. 

Future possibilities:

- We have full intention to extend the contract into a junior developer contract after the traineeship if both parties are happy. 

- We cannot guarantee any Blockchain or IOTA projects when you start as a junior, but the IOTA team is small right now, and once the team needs to grow further, you will be the first on the list. 

NOTE: This is first and foremost a software traineeship. However, at VX Company we value personal growth and interest a lot and will actively try and find Blockchain or IOTA development work if this is in your interest.

If you have any questions or are interested in applying, feel free to contact me here or via jmillenaar@vxcompany.com"
8qru7i,24,2018-06-13,My boyfriend [21] and I [20] are long distance for the summer. He has close female friends. How do I stop being jealous/do I have a reason to be?,Nikica1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8qru7i/my_boyfriend_21_and_i_20_are_long_distance_for/,"Hi guys! 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. He's far away for an internship an
Ld making a lot of new friends, and he's always talking about how great they all are. 

We have been fighting quite a bit, and I know my jealousy needs to stop, but I'm just worried about losing him. He tells me he loves me and misses me all the time and is driving to see me soon. We are planning visits and everything seems fine. 

I had an irrational anxiety attack and with no evidence accused him of cheating, kind of. This was not fair of me, and it really hurt us. I know hes not cheating, but also he has come to tell me that he often hangs out with the three other girl interns who live in his dorm.

Now, as someone with anxiety, my mind is racing. He told me that they go get food together sometimes and that they get ice cream on the way back from intern volleyball. He also told me that I dont have a right to be upset, or a requirement to give up all his privacy because hes in a relationship. He keeps saying that he doesnt want to be with me if I dont trust him, and I do, but my mind keeps going worst case scenario ""he is crushing on one of them and will fall out of love with me""

He said he doesnt have to tell me what he does every second of every day and that I have to trust him. He believes that I don't trust that he loves me and that nothing is happening. 

Listen, is it weird that he is hanging out with three girls if he doesn't really have female friends back home? From what hes said, other than one guy, they're the only interns that live in his building, and I know he has to socialize. I know with two of them no feelings would ever occur but I also know he thinks one is pretty attractive. 

I realize (I think) that this is a problem with me and not him, and I also realize that if we keep arguing every night about things and I keep grilling him that we are going to break up. 

What do I do? Does this sound platonic? How do I give up my jealousy?

**tl;dr**  Boyfriend is away at an internship for the summer and is getting close to a few female friends. He hangs out with them without any guys, and I'm getting jealous. How do I get over that?"
8qrwhv,1,2018-06-13,Will a portfolio school make me better!,thenakashima,copywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/copywriting/comments/8qrwhv/will_a_portfolio_school_make_me_better/,"


So, I'm almost done with my MBA and lo behold, I don't have a job

The market is down, not really taking in freshers
So it might seem that the MBA is useless
However, it let me find out my love in life..my raison d etre 
Which is advertising, specifically writing and conceptualizing ads i.e. copywriting
I did an internship scripting radio spots and finally found out..hey! This is my gig

I'm decent in it...I can be better
Trying to get into the market, they are looking for 
A. Experienced or,
B. A killer portfolio
Neither of which I have

So, I know that I'm good or at least decent in conceptualize

I know that I can be better, if I'm around more varied competition

I also know that none of the big agencies are going to fight over me, not yet anyways

Which brings me to my dilemma 

There are two year courses by ad schools where for two years you do nothing but create ads for a killer portfolio

Pros
The people teaching there are all from ad agencies 

The course I want to take will be filled with other creatives hence the competition

The schools are based in Us, Canada which are ad hubs
Some schools have branched in places like Madrid, Brazil, Hamburg which means international exposure which means I experience more leading to better writing

95% grads from these schools get placed in massive agencies i.e. the best of the best 
They also earn a starting pay in the range of 40000-60000 USD

Proximity also means entry into the job market which means a potential skip ahead on getting some form of permanent residency


Cons
The cost averages at 35000 USD for both years

The cost of living in Miami New York or Toronto 

I've already spent 5 years on a bcom + MBA which isn't what I believed in 
I.e. already 5 years on education plus 82000 dirhams or around 40000 dollars ish 

So
My question to you is this,

Knowing that this is my call in life and it'll make my life better somehow or the other, 

Should I take on a debt of 35000 us or 12  lakhs
Or
Should I suck it up and come back to India looking for a marketing job and more importantly won't pay ?

8qshqx,8,2018-06-13,Grey’s Best Episode (and its aftermath)?,GreenAwareness,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8qshqx/greys_best_episode_and_its_aftermath/,"It’s really hard as most finales had pretty gripping storylines (until a certain point). My favorite seasons are 2 and 5, though I also really enjoy 6. One of my favorite storylines are the shooter and the plane crash. 

However, I would have to say my favorite episode is the 2-hour S5 finale. Everything was just so perfect there. The characters were so connected and everyone really felt for George. I did also love the twist of him being Jon Doe even though I hated losing George/TR. It was well executed, exciting and beautiful. And tragic of course. Everyone truly felt it and not in a contrived way like these couple of seasons. I mean Alex felt it deeply because of Izzie, Bailey made it clear that George was her favorite intern, Mer and Cristina were deeply touched. All of the doctors had a strong connection to George in one way or the other. Callie, Derek, Richard, Owen. It was also so insanely heartbreaking in a beautiful way. When Izzie learns about the death and is responsible for the organ donation: “Everything, his skins, his eyes, George would give everything”. Then during the transplant when Bailey wants to know exactly where/to whom George’s organs are going. 

It was also one of the last MAGIC + Bailey moments. I love the scene where Bailey says:
Meredith - You’ll convince him to drop the army idea with logic and reason.
Cristina - You will use science and practicality.
Izzie - You will look at him with sad Cancer eyes.
If everything else fails:
Alex - You will just use force and not let him leave.

My MAGIC + Bailey heart.

That was definitely the show’s last real golden times.

Notable mentions:

Season 2 Finale.

Shooter episode.

Plane Crash.

My gf ahs I have been together going on 3 years, we currently live in a nice sized 1 bedroom apart, and have afew pets. (Cat and now a new puppy [where the stress is coming from]). I work at a school district, so summers means I have a lot of time off at the moment. (I had some smaller work that I'm doing just to keep busy and make some extra money). My gf is currently doing her medical college internship and working at a restaurant (which she's been working at for almost 4 years now).

We both knew this would be a stressful time for her, but I don't think she really put all the factors in order before getting her puppy (picked up last week, french bulldog). She gets up around 5-5:30 am, takes do puppy out, goes to her internship until she gets back between 2-3 (usually takes a nap) followed by her restaurant work if she has to go in (which she gets home around 10:30pm) then we eat and go to bed after she takes the puppy out again so we're in bed around 11:30 but the puppy is whining so she's not getting to sleep until after midnight into a repeat (sometimes no work the next day. She usually works weekends though).

As j said I have more time off so I do a lot of cleaning the apt, taking the puppy out, cooking, dishes, laundry, etc.  The cat and puppy are not being civil though, just recently they ate becoming social with each other. I'm trying my best to support her emotionally but I don't know what to do, not really. She's super stressed, and it's honestly putting a small amount of strain on our relationship, and it doesn't make matters any better that I honestly didn't want a puppy to start with. I'm taking care of her for my gf, but I would never get a puppy for myself.

We have enough funds to have her leave her restaurant job until she gets a position with her medical qualifications say in Oct or Nov. (Rough estimate, not entirely sure about her job lineup). Other than my suggestions I'm not sure how else I can support her.

Any suggestions from the beautiful people of reddit?

Sad thing is i still can't apply internal and they only have like 2 job posting in CS\-01 programming for external. Il check every day but my question is can a casual be offered full time job after like a contractor or no? Do i have advantage over others to apply external?

I'm 17 years old and have been in a serious relationship for almost 6 months. I have always used condoms and never had any problems until the condom broke in the middle of sex about four weeks ago. I didn't think I would get pregnant just from pre-cum. In reality, I didn't WANT to believe it, and stayed in denial about the fact that I could become pregnant. Luck has always been on my side throughout my life, in all sorts of situations. I fell prey to the mindset that I'm invincible, which was a mistake.
Last night I took a pregnancy test and found out that I am pregnant. I have no emotions surrounded getting rid of the cells floating around my uterus, but I'm terrified about the abortion procedure, which I'm getting in the next couple of days. I have severe OCD that centers around gore and blood and things of that nature, and the thought of the procedure is eating me alive. I feel like I can't breathe. I anticipate that after I get the abortion, it won't be over at all. I'm going to have images and feelings about the procedure and I won't be able to focus at all. I graduate high school next week and work at a law firm to make money for myself and this is going to overtake my mind. The images of blood are already ruining my focus and I'm at my law internship right now.

On top of that, I feel disgusted and embarrassed about my parents knowing that I am sexually active and made a mistake like this. They are being supportive but I can't look either of them in the eye. I feel like a dissapointment.

Do any of you have any advice for easing my mind of obsessions and guilt or anything like that. Any kind words would help. I'm scared

8qt43g,6,2018-06-13,Some educated thoughts about women in BFV.,Accomplished_Active,Gamingcirclejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/8qt43g/some_educated_thoughts_about_women_in_bfv/,"Before I begin, I have to introduce myself as kind of an ""insider"" in the corporate world. I've mastered in reading Bussiness for Dummies and worked in marketing team of an international firm (intern at McDonald's). Psychology is an vital tool I used throughout my 3 months old career. The moment I read about EA executive Patrick Soderlund's interview, I saw through his mask, and I'll help you all to see through it too, my children.

As many of you are aware, Soderlund said during an interview that protesters and the rioters on the street are uneducated. Basically narrowing the whole BFV controversy down to ""misogyny"".

This can't be further from the truth, I think we all know that only the most intellectual and progressive gamers roam /r/Battlefield. Female soldier was only a part of a bigger complaint about the game's flashy cosmetics. During the first reveal trailer, the Kratos looking naked guy and the soldier carrying katana were equally laughed upon on, which I scientifically measured and included the results in my master thesis. And the EA play trials only made it worse. Due to my weight I couldn't make it there without dying so I had to watch the whole spectacle from my Peecee.

Then why EA and DICE made it into something about social justice, and totally ignored complaints about other ridiculous costumes?

The answer is, it's internationalle. They are well aware of the demographies of the complaints. Yes, there were complaints about women, and I fucking hate women.

What they are trying to do is shift the attention away from the rest of the problem to only about females.

In fact, you are being played right into their hands. Everything is proceeding as EA has foreseen *Makes evil guy hand gesture*. More and more anger is directed to female soldiers while the real problem is ignored which are female soldiers.

EA WANTS YOU to complain about women, because they can paint you in a negative light in this way. They can label you as a loud minority who is just the society's fringe, then your opinion automatically loses persuasive power to new-comers, casual gamers, and people who are sitting on the fence. WE ARE THE VICTIMS!!

EA DOESN'T WANT YOU to focus on the actual bigger problem, that is females taking over the gaming world and why they are there at all in the first place. Then well, they can't paint you in a negative light.

At its core, customization is all about microtransaction. But they rather risk offending a whole community than telling the blunt truth about microtransaction. that's all it is, it sounds simple but only someone with such experience in Bussiness and Psychology like me can figure that out.

Now, insulting your customers, under normal circumstances is something businessmen should never do even though in my 3 months old career, I've done this countless times but that was just tactics. That's just a number one principle in the industry, but it's not common sense, only someone with such Bussiness and psychology experience like me can understand that. Then why did Soderlund call protesters uneducated? 

~~Because he's a white knight SJW cuck~~ 

~~Because I am uneducated~~

~~Because I actually hate women~~

There's 3 scenarios that may explain this. And i want you to remember, EA is a greedy multibillion dollar company without soul. The first and foremost duty for company managers is to generate wealth for shareholders. They are businessmen, not ideologue. I've learnt that when reading Business for Dummies.

Scenario 1: Despite initial HUGE backlash against reveal trailer, pre-order number is still strong.

Scenario 2: Pre-order number is weak compared to bf1. But they set a threshold on how many sales they are willing to lose. They are counting on post-launch microtransactions as the main income and to cover the initial sales loss. They announced multiple times that there will be no microtransactions but I pulled this out of my ass so the post gets more credibility.

(Activision made more money from microtransaction than selling a new COD base game). So if BFV's preorder doesn't go over the threshold. EA will sit comfortable.

Scenario 3: Veteran battlefield players are not the main audience of BFV. EA is rolling the DICE *gasps for air after laughing at my own joke*, betting on attracting fortnite players over to the franchise. Battlefield fanbase experiences its largest shift in history. And we, my brave gamers will find ourselves on the right side of it. So they don't care about the feelings of old fans, YOU ARE NOT THE AUDIENCE. YOU ARE A VICTIM! This is an extremely risky business plan. It's a bet.

Thank you for reading. I hope my advanced knowledge of bussiness psychology didn't go over your head."

8qtdl7,21,2018-06-13,The two times I was almost suckered in,pastel-d20,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8qtdl7/the_two_times_i_was_almost_suckered_in/,"Gonna preface this with saying this is long (and I’m on mobile) 

So the first time I was right out of high school. I was always aware of pyramids from my friends mom who was into Mary Kay and Avon, so I can smell a pyramid from a mile away. This time it was a tech company (I don’t remember the name because it was about 10 years ago). My friend (let’s call her A) told me that we could make money really quickly if we just talk to one of our friends (friend B) for an hour and sign up to something. I already knew this was a danger zone and said no but my friend was adamant. I kept telling her what it was but she was not understanding what a pyramid was. Either way she dropped it and we continued our lives. 

Flash forward a week later I get invited to coffee by friend A, so I said sure. I get there and sit down and my friend shows up and we talk for a bit. After about 20 minutes, friend B shows up. He’s got his phone in one hand and a pad of paper in another. He sits down and I’m seething as I’m staring at my friend. Friend B starts talking about how we would be working for him, we get a new phone within a week of joining and all we had to do was sell something (I think it was some tech investment shares). I’m saying no and I have no money for this so I don’t know what you’re asking for. And he goes off on how “it’s only a small 99$ fee and you’ll get access to...” I forgot what he said after but it doesn’t matter because the next thing I know he’s using the pad of paper and pen to draw a pyramid and telling my that at the top there’s him and then there’s us then there’s our friends and that we get money based on how many people we bring in and help because no we’re our own bosses. After he stopped talking I said thank you but no and got up. Friend A called back to me and I turned around and said loudly at in the coffee shop “I told you I don’t want to be part of a pyramid scheme, but you went and did this behind my back anyway.” (I was one of those over dramatic kids but also I was really mad). 

I kept talking to friend A but I have no idea what became of friend B. 

Second time was at university. I needed money and the school had some great things going on and a lot of paid intern work. This company that promised paid intern work and your own group to exec was offering a pretty interesting deal and there was interviews going on that week at one of the school buildings and I just had to set up a time to meet. I called in and I got some own right away, the girl on the phone sounded excited to meet me and that she was going to go over more of the details later in the interview. 

The day comes and I walk in to the building. There is literally hundreds of people waiting and I’m like well crap. I’m thinking I’m not getting in. I wait for my time and as I was called so we’re about 6 other people. That’s fine, mass interviews I get it. I go into the room sit down and we’re all sitting in a circle. A girl walks in sets up some stuff and says this is the interview (I looks more like a cult thing). She says she works for college works a house painting company where you have your own team and you go around painting houses. This is in Canada where we have College Pro which is a legit house painting company for college students. They said this company college works is under college pro and that everything they do is the same but they give more control to the college students than anything else. 

This is were the red flags start going up. She sounds like a cult leader, they all look brainwashed and waaaayyyy too excited to be there, and “all they ask is for you to pay for the paint and equipment and the rest is yours” nope, nope, nope, hell no, no, absolutely not. Now, this is where I’m really stuck. I’m thinking this is something legit, the school is putting this on, everyone is looking around like they just got duped and no one can leave. They have someone at the door so it looks like we’re being Locked in. 

It’s an hour of her talking about how much money we’re gonna get, how you’ll be your own boss, get great experience etc. I sit there and listen and when I see my escape I say I’m getting a call and have to leave Which worked but they didn’t let me leave until i signed something. I don’t actually know what it was but I scribbled something that was not my signature and left. 

After a week the calls came. Two or three a day, during class, nights, any time they wanted. I didn’t answer until I picked up and said I’m not interested and hung up. They called back a few times and then I screamed at them that this is harassment and to never call me again unless you want to cops involved. I don’t actually know if they can be but they stopped either way.

Another look around the room reminded him of his unique position, a boon granted from God himself.

If you know nothing about Overwatch lore and need a refresher about everybody mentioned in this post: Brian is the boy in the blue hoodie in the trailer, Lena Oxton is Tracer, and Emily Oxton is Tracer’s girlfriend– in this case, she’s her wife.

I’ll be playing the role of Brian, fresh out of his sophomore year. In my imagining of this prompt, Overwatch headquarters has been rebuilt and the team has been called to action once more. After the events of the museum robbery, Tracer and Brian crossed paths a few more times, finally electing to swap numbers after the umpteenth time. Not long after that the two hooked up– what with Tracer being everybody’s wet dream, she could only cross the horny young man’s path so many times without getting her ass tapped.

At the present moment all three parties are located in Bern, Switzerland, living in an apartment just outside of Overwatch headquarters. Lena and Emily have relocated from London due to Overwatch’s reassembly, and Brian is abroad from America under the guise of an internship with Overwatch– technically not a lie, but certainly not the whole truth either.

———————————————

My primary goal for this post is to build a harem of Overwatch’s finest, with Tracer and Emily as my ‘starter girls.’ To them, I’m their well-loved boytoy; all I need is to ask, and every one of my needs is sated (though occasionally with a chiding remark if my desire is especially kinky, or we’re in a public place). This goes vice-versa as well, and if you want to be done a certain way, I’m more than happy to play the bashful, eager-to-please hormonal teenager.


Although I have an excessive amount of kinks, my favorites are pregnancy/impreg, casual sex, public sex, cosplay, petplay, raceplay, drugs, beast, watersports, light/heavy bondage, sadomasochism, willing abuse, tattoos, body writing, piercings and various others I’m probably not thinking of at the moment.


Typically I have no limits, but I’d like for this prompt to be fairly light-hearted, so I’d like to avoid scat, snuff, and gore. Blood is one hundred percent okay, so long as we aren’t shanking each other to make it, and I don’t mind bruises and black eyes so long as the characters specifically ask to be beaten in such a way.


I also play via KIK and Discord if chat or messages doesn’t work for you. My only requirement is that you understand I’m human and at certain times A.) am not horny, and B.) must attend work. In exchange, I will understand the same about you. Life happens, etcetera, etcetera.

My father ran an electrical engineering company in Greenwich Village where he built technology exhibits.  His biggest client was Bell Labs, the research arm of the original ATT.  Whenever they would make a technological breakthrough, they would hand over a prototype to him so that he could create a way to explain and demonstrate its importance to the public.  My house was full of new technology.  From my earliest days I was surrounded by technologies years before they were seen by the general public.  I still have a ring box with one of the first transistors and a laser that my father wired up that was so new that the name laser wasn't used.   It was called an Optical Maser. A model of the Telstar satellite hung in my Dad's shop.  And of course, he showed me my first hologram.  But at that time, I never considered holography as a profession.

In 1968, I learned of a new technology exhibition called ""A Science Tune\-In"" that Bell Labs was putting on at the Time\-Life Building across the street from Radio City.  I applied and got the job.  It was the first public exhibition of lasers and holograms.  That was half a century ago.

In 1975, after years of seeing holography as a hobby, I decided to go professional.  I have been making holograms ever since.  My business, Holographic Studios is the longest operating holography gallery and lab in the world, located in Midtown Manhattan at the same location since the 1970's.  Over the decades my clients have included artists, corporations, researchers, entrepreneurs, designers, musicians, and even a comic book artist.  I have created holographic portraits of artist Andy Warhol, President Bill Clinton, sci\-fi author Isaac Asimov, Ed Koch, musician Billy Idol, Prime Minister Edward Heath of the UK,  Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith, among others.  I've been commissioned to create holograms for IBM, Mitsubishi, ATT, Sony, Goodyear, the Museum of Natural History, the Philadelphia Stock Market, Remy Martin, Hyatt, Lord and Taylor, DuPont, and Hasbro to name a few.

I've taught holography both at colleges and here at my studio for over forty years.  More recently I have started giving tours of my studio that have become quite popular attracting people from all over the world.  My internship program has had its alums go on in their respective fields to achieve remarkable success.  Jason Corsaro became a Grammy Award winning recording engineer and producer (Madonna's ""Like A Virgin,"" Daving Bowie's ""Modern Love"", Queen's ""We Are the Champions""), John Gaeta won an Academy Award for his special visual effects in ""The Matrix, ""  and Vince Gilligan won the Emmy Award for creating ""Breaking Bad.""  Holography is a great incubator for creative minds.

8quwgh,0,2018-06-13,Moving to Zurich in less than a month and looking for communities of like-minded people and fun things to do,_art3mida_,zurich,https://www.reddit.com/r/zurich/comments/8quwgh/moving_to_zurich_in_less_than_a_month_and_looking/,"Hey guys! I will be moving to Zurich in a few weeks and will be living there for 3 months. I am 20 years old and a computer science student, and will be there for an internship. While the internship opportunity is great in itself, this year I've made it my goal to make the absolute best out of my travel, and I would be so thankful if you could provide me with some tips and tricks! Also, consider the fact that I will be there for a longer time, so I'm not looking for restaurant suggestions and stuff like that only (although that's always good), but also things that might require a more long term engagement.

Since I know how hard it can be to suggest things to someone you know nothing about, here are some things that might help you:
1. very interested in all things technology(both hardware and software), so any tech museums, workshops, lectures on this would be of interest
2. interested in business (more on the side of freelance business, having your own blog, marketing, etc, not necessarily purely starting a business), self-improvement and philosophy, so the same stands for those. Does Zurich have any kind of coworking hubs, an Impact Hub maybe? Any place that has regular lectures and workshops about these topics?
3. recently got into running and making videos, so please do suggest your favorite scenic running route. Also, anyone who is a beginner filmmaker and would like to learn together, please don't hesitate to message me!
4. other nature places are always a good thing to visit (even if it's a little bit out of town and might require a few hours or maybe 2 days even to fully enjoy, still down for it)
5. finally, I'm gay, so tell me the best gay bars or parties in the city!"

Apologies in advance. Please try to be brutally honest and point out my ignorance. Thank you so much.

Background: I just turned 21, and am currently in the 3rd year (junior for the Americans out there) of my Bachelor's doing informatics/computer science at a Canadian university with 2 years of professional work experience. I recently finished a software engineer internship in Oslo, Norway and the company has extended me a full\-time offer asking to me to go back after I graduate. I had a blast and I really enjoyed living and working there. I made a lot of friends and it was honestly an unforgettable experience. 

However, working and living there full\-time is a different story. I grew up in an extremely homogeneous environment in East Asia (I was the only kid of Chinese descent at the Japanese school I went to, and I was the only kid born outside of China at the Chinese school I went to, and I got a lot of shit for that). I had never seen a South Asian or Latino/a until I moved to Canada when I was 13. 

As a result, despite having spent over a third of my life in a diverse and multicultural country like Canada and being native\-speaker\-level fluent in English, I still sometimes feel that I don't really belong here. My childhood experience is so ingrained in me that I am very self\-conscious and am constantly reminded of the fact that I look different and come from a unique background in a foreign country. And I felt that sense of ""not belonging"" even more in Norway. As my parents put it when they came over to visit, Norway to them felt kinda like a ""Norwegian\-speaking, white Japan"". 

Now, I'm not necessarily referring to active and overt racism (it's an issue everywhere, and East Asia is probably one of the most racist regions on Earth), but rather a passive and covert form of discrimination. I fear that I will be seen and treated as a foreigner (which I am), not unlike in Japan where restaurant staff automatically switch to (broken) English when a non\-Japanese walks in. Of course I will try my hardest to integrate. I speak 5 languages if you count the dialects I had to learn when I was a kid, and I already have rudimentary knowledge of Norwegian. And I think I already share the majority of the prevailing values in Scandinavia (I identify as a social democrat). But will I ever be truly accepted and seen as a ""Norwegian""? What about my future kids? I genuinely do not know. 

I have multiple options after I graduate \- I could go to either China or Japan (the places I feel most at home at), or Norway (definitely going to be a challenge). I guess I will just have to do more research.

Sorry for all the rambling. Looking forward to your insights and opinions."

Cannot make it back to see my doctor, any advice?",welliguess982,Asthma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/8qvh9s/asthma_worse_since_relocating_for_summer/,"Hello and thank you in advance! I was diagnosed with asthma 6-8 years ago and it has varied in severity over the years. I’ve been on Xolair for 6 months, Symbicort for a year and Qvar for a month. I also take high dose antihistamines(two H2 and an H1) to help with asthma and chronic idiopathic hives. My health has been generally declining for about a year with no known cause. I was mostly stable the last few months, only using my inhaler 2-3 times a week(other then exercise). 

I recently relocated just under 2 hours away from my home to a fully furnished apartment unit for a summer internship. The living arrangements were set up by the company I am working for. I had a worsening of symptoms upon moving in(hives, trouble breathing, LOTS of coughing) but figured it was the moving and the fact that the building I am residing in has a lot of strong smells(perfume, etc.). 

Sadly my work environment is also not great, perfume in the office and sawdust, etc. in the shop. And the unit where I live has continued to cause issues issues(I’m allergic to the couch for example). I let me doctor know I was going to be out of town over the summer and he seemed on board with helping me manage over the distance. I contacted him to let him know about the issues I’m having and a nurse responded saying I really need to be seen. 

I wouldn’t consider this to be a “bad flair” it’s mort like my asthma just went back to the level of control I had when on the wrong meds. I cough though the day and night(waking up my SO and myself) and feel like I can’t get a decent breath except for a short time after I have taken my inhaler. 

The problem is it was hard enough to get off early once a month to drive all the way back for my Xolair and we work on a tight schedule so I don’t think I can get off to go back. I’m still talking to my doctor but wondered if anyone had any thoughts or suggestions for things I might be able to do?

I am considering getting an air purifier for my bedroom but other that I’m at a loss.

I really appreciate any advice you have to offer! Thank you!"

I squander away every opportunity I get in life. I know I could turn things around if I wanted to but I'm sure I won't do anything to improve my situation. My day consists of sitting in the darkness of my dorm room with the covers over my head and black curtains preventing any light from entering. Occasionally, I'll open my phone or laptop to watch anime or youtube videos. I feel like I watch way to much porn, probably like 5-6 times a day. However, most of my time is spent in silence, like I'm in some sort of haze. 

I'm in my second year of college. My first semester grades were fine: 3.89 GPA. However, I started to become extremely unmotivated second semester and ended up ditching every class. I ended up getting a 2.73 and I failed one of my labs. There were days when I honestly tried to study. I would go to the library with all my books and sit down in a cubicle with my textbook laid out in front of me, but I would just end up starring at the same page for 2-3 hours. I was on a full-ride scholarship but I had to maintain a 3.5 GPA to renew. I don't know if I'm going to lose my scholarship, and I haven't even signed up for classes next fall. This isn't a new behavior either. I would go through slumps and massive spikes in performance in high school as well. Some semesters I had the highest GPA in my class, others I would be close to failing. My father is paying for my room and board, but I haven't told him about my situation.

I work at a shitty job that pays minimum wage. All my roommates are working amazing internships and seem to have everything together. I have no skills and no work experience. I never joined a single club in high school, never played any sports, and didn't start working until my freshman year of college. My dad sent me to a boarding prep-school, where I did the exact same thing I'm doing now. I'm just an over-educated piece of trash. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, and now I might be flunking out of college.

I had shitty roommates last semester, but moved in with some really nice guys. They will take me out to places and invite me to things, but I just lie to them just like I do to my family. I act like a completely different person when I get into social situations. I basically start acting like a jester/class-clown and make dumbass jokes and make fun of everything. 

I don't do drugs or drink. I haven't had a girlfriend. I've gone out on 2 dates since I started high school and both girls just stopped talking to me after the first date. Like I said I think I have a problem with porn and I don't even try with women anymore. The only people I would consider friends are my roommates, but even that I'm not really sure of. They are nice to me when its just us, but as soon as their real friends come over I pretty much get ignored and their friends seem to not like me. No one in my family gives a shit about me, most of them live hundreds of miles away. My siblings ignore me, my mom is a crazy woman who has tried to screw me over at every turn, and my dad only cares about me if I'm doing something that makes him look good. 

Sometimes I think I might have depression, most of the time I think I'm just overdramatic and lazy. I've been fighting off suicidal tendencies for the past couple months. I had an attempt when I was 17 that I covered up from my family and never told anyone about. I know I should go see a therapist, but I feel like all of my problems are just due to me being lazy, unmotivated, and falling into bad habits. I think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for something to blame for my inadequacies, because I can act completely fine as if nothing was wrong when I'm around other people. I have tried to express my feelings to one of my close family members and they told me what most other people seem to think, ""everyone feels that way when they are your age, your are worrying to much, you'll be fine."" 

That is the part that makes me feel the worst. I know other people feel this way, if I'm hiding it then they probably are too. They are working through their shit while I let mine make me a shitty person. I know my dad could get me a job if I need it. My university could get me help if I need it. My roommates would help me if things go really bad. I don't know how to tell people how I feel without sounding like an entitled prick, because I have no reason to feel like this. I just don't know what to do."

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

------------------------------------------

***Some final notes!***

* I only write here on Reddit, through the PM's. Not chat. Don't send me chat invites.

* Yes, this is F4F. Guys, respect that. Today isn't your day.

* My message length varies, but you'll never get anything less than 4 lines out of me.

* I can write in first or third person, with a slight preference for third."
8qxpcv,103,2018-06-13,"The Saga of AnimeAssassin: Undercooked meat, ghost pepper, and beer onion soup",CastielGalafran,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/8qxpcv/the_saga_of_animeassassin_undercooked_meat_ghost/,"Yesterday's story reminded me of this theme in our relationship which, for some reason, I completely forgot to post about until now. This one, as with all AnimeAssassin related topics, is just weird. To this day it's a part of this man I do not understand.

AnimeAssassin embraced two great truths of the universe:

He was a gourmet chef to rival Gordon Ramsey.

And my cooking was about as appetizing as a used diaper soaked in milk and clam juice, then left out to stew on a hot summer's day.

He made his feelings about his own cooking clear early on in our relationship. From the night I introduced him to my parents, which you can read about in my second post on r/JustNoSO, he firmly established that he saw himself as an accomplished chef. In truth, his cooking was palatable at best. I tried to gently offer him constructive critisicm when his meals were especially nauseating, but he insisted I simply didn't have a sophisticated palate and needed to learn what good food really was.

To be clear, I am not a picky eater. Sure, avocado makes me gag, but if someone offers me food and it the smell doesn't make me feel sick immediately, I'm going to eat it. I also like to think I've been exposed to a wide range of quality food. I'm no connoisseur, but throughout my life I've gone with my family to a wide range of high end restaurants all over the world. My European family is well off. And I mean really well off. Eating at exclusive, Michelin Star restaurants is just another Tuesday for them, and when I've visited they make no exception. Sure, I haven't eaten that sort of food a lot, but I've had objectively good food. And, as much as AnimeAssasin refused to admit it, his cooking simply didn't measure up.

Additionally, he was hypercritical of my cooking. My mom used to give me cooking lessons growing up. I hated it and would rather run around outside fighting imaginary orcs with my stick swords, but I learned a thing or two. She comes from a long line of women who knew how to cook and who passed down their very traditional methods. As little interest as I had, I remembered most of these methods. I stopped trying to cook throughout most of college, but attempted to dabble when I moved in with AnimeAssassin. He was so awful to me about it I gave up altogether until the Summer of 2017, when our DnD group begged me to make them dinner each week after tasting my food once.

Since there are just so many stories to tell over this one, and my brain is loopy right now from being sleep deprived all week (work schedule sucks at the moment), I'll provide a list of the highlights.

\-AnimeAssassin was utterly convinced his greatest culinary talent lay in Korean cooking. This is because of his mother's obsession with going to Korea and inexplicably returning home with Korean babies despite having CPS called to their house on the regular. We would go to a Korean restauraunt and AnimeAssassin would loudly complain about how he, a WASP\-y white boy, could make better food than the actual Korean people from Korea. As we ate, he would ask me, loud enough for the waiters to hear, if the way he made it was better. I'd kind of mumble something in the affirmative and pray that the waitstaff wouldn't remember us if we ever returned for fear they'd add their own special touch to our meals between the kitchen and the table.

\-AnimeAssassin's version of Korean food consisted of two dishes. The first being Korean barbecue He would buy the most discounted meat from the local Asian market, severely undercook it, then smother it in a sort of sweet gray sauce which left the house with a pungent odor for days. They tasted and looked nothing like the Korean barbecue I've eaten at restaurants. The second dish was ramen. Now, I'm pretty sure ramen is a Japanese thing, but I'm no expert so maybe Korea has its own version. But, if it does, I am almost 100&amp;#37; positive it is not made from a 30 cent packet of dry ramen noodles. See, AnimeAssassin would boil a pot of water, throw in the noodles and flavor packet, chop up 2\-4 discount hotdogs and add those, add an ungodly amount of soy sauce, then throw in at least a teaspoon of ghost pepper chili flakes.

\-On the note of ghost pepper chili flakes, he insisted on adding those to every dish. He claimed to love spice and made fun of anyone who couldn't handle it. I had stomach issues during my relationship with him (perhaps from the undercooked discount meat, which I'll get to next), and would beg him not to make his food so spicy. But he'd throw in those ghost pepper flakes then not allow me to leave the couch until I'd eaten every bite. I would be crying and struggling for breath, my stomach already burning, but he'd call me weak and stare at me until I practically licked the plate clean.

\-He was also obsessed with rare meat. Not just rare steak. Rare pork, chicken, fish, lamb, and any other meat. He claimed that he liked to eat his steak still moo\-ing, and I guess he also liked his chicken still clucking, fish still making fish noises, and lamb still going baaa. The man had no concept of food borne illness.

\-He would pile my plates with so much food and then not allow me to go to bed until I've eaten everything on my plate, despite me telling him that eating that much put me in pain. I was forced to eat past the point of pain almost every night.

\-He claimed we were so poor that we had to finish off all the leftovers in our fridge before buying new food. He would buy family sized frozen foods and make practically buckets of spicy hot dog ramen, then not allow me to even use my own money to buy myself food until those dishes were all gone. The thing was, he bought and cooked so much food it would take at least a couple weeks to finish it off. I can no longer eat lasagna, because once, he bought a party sized frozen lasagna and made me eat it breakfast, lunch, and dinner for two weeks. By the last time I had it, each bite had a distinct funk and I got sick afterwards.

\-Why didn't I cook, you may ask? I tried. I really did. His food was so vile and made me so sick that I asked him permission to allow me to cook at least once a week. But when I did, he'd yell at me for every perceived mistake. Then he'd snatch the pan, or spoon, or whatever cooking tool from my hands and start slamming it around as he ""fixed"" my ""stupid error"". Then, with one final slam, he'd huff off to the bedroom and refuse to speak to me the rest of the night because he just couldn't tolerate how stupid I was. Every time I cooked he'd tell me that I was just as dumb as his mother. When he tasted my food, he always found something to criticize. He told me I was just awful at cooking and he needed to teach me how to be better. It got to the point that, even when I had left him, I'd have a panic attack almost every time I cooked. Even today, I still apologize before anyone takes a bite.

\-I grew to sincerely believe I was a stupid, shitty cook and that he was an innately gifted chef. Then, one night, L came over and ate the pork stuffed bell peppers AnimeAssassin had prepared. She got violent food poisoning. I began catching on that every time she came over and AnimeAssassin shoved a plate of his food into her hands, she wouldn't eat it. She would stir it around her plate/bowl, then, when neither of us were looking, threw the food in the trash. But she would always eat my food and ask for more. She'd text me before coming over to request that I, not AnimeAssassin, cook. Then E, Rahleigh, and Doge tasted my cooking for the first time. From that point on, they refused to eat AnimeAssassin's and would exclusively eat mine. To this day, E, L, and Rahleigh will text me on an almost weekly basis to ask me to cook for them. E has also asked I give him cooking lessons, and I do.

\-One of the absolute worst, gag inducing, sickening dishes AnimeAssassin ever made was.....beer onion soup. He had come to visit me during my summer internship. Some fellow interns and I were sipping on some beer after work. This gave AnimeAssassin what he must have believed to be divine inspiration. He grabbed some of the beer, chopped up obscene amounts of onion, took sliced white bread, and then threw it all together in a pot which he let simmer for an hour. He dished it up into two huge bowls and practically chugged his share. I took one bite and gagged. It was vile. The other interns had to walk away from the table because of the smell. I had never in my life eaten something that actually made me vomit in my mouth, but that beer onion soup did the trick. For months, AnimeAssassin would randomly turn to me sometimes and tell me how amazing that meal was. He would offer to make it again and I'd all but beg him not to. He was deeply hurt and wounded that I did not like the beer onion soup. He told me, naturally, that the only reason I didn't like it was that I had a terrible palate.

Those are best of the food stories I can think of. To this day, my friends and I will joke about the sickening concoctions AnimeAssassin would force feed me. My confidence in my own cooking has grown. My friends and family have loudly expressed their love for my food and frequently ask me to cook for them. In the last year, my cooking skills have increased exponentially. Apparently, my maple glazed salmon is my premier dish, and my friends have praised it so much that I made it for W the first time we actually hung out. A week later, when he introduced me to a school friend of his, the first thing that friend said to me was, ""Oh, fuck, you made the maple glazed salmon. W wouldn't stop talking about how good it was. Literally he wouldn't stop bringing it up.""

For funsies, if any of you are interested in that maple glazed salmon recipe, I'll add an edit to this and share it. According to W, E, and L, my other best dishes are: hatch chili chicken pot pie, jerk chicken with caramelized mango and pineapple, rocky road cookies, chicken enchilada casserole, and truffle oil mac and cheese."

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a  lucky guy that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ocudk/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8qybc3,6,2018-06-13,Thinking about dropping out of vet school...,confused_vet,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/8qybc3/thinking_about_dropping_out_of_vet_school/,"Hi redditors,

I recently finished my 2nd year of veterinary school. I am not failing, in fact I'm doing quite well. I don't currently have any debt either but I will if I continue. I am seriously considering leaving and have been for the past year or so (started having doubts last summer, decided to tough it out for another year). When I decided to go for this career I was 20, and nearly 6 years later I have changed and matured a lot and have lost (or have realized that I never had) my passion for vet med. While I enjoy working at a vet hospital to a degree (1.5y experience prior to vet school and now currently working at a vet hospital over the summer), every day I think to myself how miserable I will probably be if I have to do this for the rest of my life. I love dogs and think they're cute, and I do like to see animals get proper care and help them be healthy, but it doesn't ignite a fire in me or bring me a sense of satisfaction. I am relieved at the end of the day when I get to go home and do something else.

In the past year I have done some soul\-searching and I have realized I am a more artistic and social person than I used to be, and I think I've really suppressed my true self by forcing myself to go into the sciences. I switched to pre\-vet in my 2nd year of undergrad (I'm seeing a trend here!) because I was unhappy in economics and wanted to work with animals. I'm really good at academics, essays, and interviews, and got into vet school the first time I applied. First year was very challenging, but I felt accomplished because I pulled a 4.0 and seemed to be good at vet med. However, I think after completing my second year and realizing just how much work and debt goes into this career, and how little financial return you get when you graduate, it just doesn't seem worth it to me anymore. We always say ""we don't do it for the money"", and now, I hate to admit it but being a veterinarian is not financially or emotionally rewarding enough for me. I hate the idea of potentially being injured every time I examine a patient, the long hours, the lack of gratitude from clients....

Although it seems I am pretty sure of my decision here, I still am having trouble committing to it. It's extra difficult for me because I'm pretty good at my job as a vet assistant and I'm pretty good at vet school (grade\-wise, at least). So it's not like I'm incompetent or failing. I am also worried about the social stigma of being a drop\-out, and of my parents being disappointed in me. However, I want to do something that makes me happy and fulfilled. I don't want to be 35\-40 and regretting my choices when I was 25, when I was young and single and still had the freedom to do something else.

I think I want to pursue something like PR, Marketing, social media management, event management, etc. I love working with people to create something that provides an experience for other people or for a company. I love photography (pets, portraits, events, fashion), makeup, travel, and other creatively\-minded things, and I'd love to find a career that could help me combine those. However, given that my past experience involves nearly only vet\-med related jobs, internships, etc., I'm really not sure where to even begin. 

Any advice, personal anecdotes, or anything you have that might be useful to me would be appreciated. I am pretty terrified of this whole situation and it would be a huge leap for me if I decided to leave. I've never been a failure or a quitter before, and I know if I were born in my parents' generation this would never be a possibility. But as a millennial, I want to do what I love, not do something to support what I love. Of course I still love animals, especially dogs, but I think that owning my own dogs would be enough. I don't think I need to be surrounded by them every day to be happy. 

Thoughts!?!? I'm honestly filled with self\-loathing for even considering this, but after a year of having second thoughts every day...I think I need to face this head\-on. 

I have cross posted this to multiple subs in hopes of gathering as much advice as I can. T\_T"

I'm a 25 year old male and I've been working in television broadcast operations for 5 years now. Prior to that I did some freelance work and internships, my first job in TV was at 17 as a camera attachment/clapper loader for a TV show. I had been very passionate about this industry for a long time prior.  But lately I've been thrown off by it and have been wanting to change industry's. One of the things that bothered me that didn't before was the salary expectations in this industry.

The reality I've come to face is that usually the high end salary of most departments within the television broadcast industry (In Australia) averages at around $80,000 \- for technical and senior roles. If you want to earn anything more than that, you have to go into management \- which isn't for everyone. 

Compared to other professional industry's, it's considered a low high\-end salary. 

Don't get me wrong, I could live on $80k comfortably, but living in Sydney where houses average around $800k (in the shitty areas), it would take me two decades just to save for a deposit on a house. And I can't move to a cheaper city because all the jobs are being outsourced to Sydney, or television networks are downsizing and closing down their stations in other markets but Sydney. Sydney is unfortunately the only place in Australia where jobs in TV aren't scarce. 

Nonetheless, I'd like to be on a good salary one day. And by good salary I'm talking in the 6 digits. Unfortunately that doesn't exist in broadcasting hence why I've been contemplating on changing industry's completely.

Anyone else get into broadcasting without realizing this? "

8qzopi,434,2018-06-14,Kevin the Biology Intern,kenjiandco,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/8qzopi/kevin_the_biology_intern/,"It has been three months now since Kevin left us. During my tenure as Kevin's main supervisor, I wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to laugh at anything ever again. Now that he's been gone long enough for some of the horror to fade, I've realized how much of his story just begs to be shared. 

Some background: I'm a team lead/supervisor for a disease ecology lab. We do a lot of field work collecting samples for pathogen testing, so we hire a lot of seasonal interns when things get busy. Kevin, poor bastard, was the third choice of three applicants for a position. He came off a little...weird...in his phone interview, but he'd had the same internship at a sister location the year before and his resume was okay, how bad could it be?

So bad. So very very bad. This kid somehow obtained a college degree with no ability to make decisions, think critically, follow verbal instructions, follow written instructions, or retain any kind of information for longer than about three minutes. I truly cannot fathom what went on in his head most of the time. 

Without further ado, here are some of the highlights of Kevin the biology intern:

*Kevin was a little off from the get go, but I put it down to social awkwardness at first. First major red flag came when I asked him to pick up the pace a little in the field. He interpreted this by running everywhere, full speed. In the forest. Off road. Wearing a pack.

*Kevin understood how to use a compass to find north. Using a compass to find south, east, or west was completely beyond him. He just couldn't wrap his head around it. I never even tried to explain bearings. 

*We have an anonymous google form interns can fill out with complaints/requests/concerns they're not comfortable bringing up in person. In the three years I'd been here, it's been used exactly twice. Kevin filled one out at least once a week. He would, without fail, end every ""anonymous"" form by signing his name. The first one was a request for a packing list for a protocol that required exactly two items. 

*Even after opening them, Kevin required confirmation from three people that one box labeled ""whirlpacks"" and one box labeled ""whirkpaks"" contained the same thing

*Kevin thought hummingbirds sting.

*Kevin thought viruses were a theoretical concept. Like wormholes. Or the existence of aliens. Likely but not proven. Did I mention we're a disease research lab?

*Kevin once asked me why drinking water cures dehydration

*Overheard the interns talking about places they wanted to travel. Kevin waxed lyrical about how he's traveled so much by now that nothing really amazes him or impresses him anymore. Kevin is 23, has lived in two states, and has never left the US.

*Four people with five master's degrees couldn't explain to Kevin's satisfaction why -80 degrees was colder than -40. 

*Kevin firmly believed sunscreen was a conspiracy theory designed to cause cancer. He had a similar theory about parking brakes. He submitted an 'anonymous' survey form saying he was worried we were spreading harmful information by encouraging sunscreen use. In August. 

*Another intern didn't get far enough out of sight before peeing behind a bush in the field. Instead of quietly looking away, Kevin screamed ""BECKY I CAN SEE YOU PEEING"" at the top of his lungs. 

*Kevin developed a massive crush on a supervisor from a sister location who came to help us out for a week. Said supervisor was, in increasing order of dealbreaker, 8 years older than him, from Virginia, happily married, and a lesbian. Kevin didn't see how any of that was a problem. I'm not entirely sure he understood the concept of homosexuality. Then again, he didn't understand any other form of human relationship either.

With all that said, Kevin was generally friendly, had a good attitude, and was genuinely happy to do whatever menial task we came up with for him. He would have been pretty benign, as Kevins are judged, if not for his parting shot, two weeks before his internship ended. 

We have interns take turns researching a safety hazard (dehydration, snakes, cold weather safety, etc.) and doing a little presentation on it at our staff meetings (and I think I personally deserve a medal for not suggesting Kevin do his on the treatment of hummingbird stings.) Unfortunately, Kevin decided to do his on the evils of sunscreen. His presentation (which was almost 20 minutes long, as opposed to the usual 3-5) included the line ""Remember, the *real* cause of cancer is bad life choices."" One of the other interns had recently lost her mom to breast cancer. Said intern was also one of Kevin's roommates. 

Kevin's signed anonymous survey that week reported that he'd ""detected a rise in hostile feelings in the office and at home,"" and he wondered what we were going to do to fix it.

I'll say this one thing for Kevin...he made me an exponentially better trainer. Never have I worked so hard or come up with so many new tools to try to get through to someone. I made new guides. I rewrote protocols. My coworkers and I elevated idiot-proofing to both a science and an art. 

I mean, none of it worked with Kevin, but my interns with functioning brains have found it useful."

8r1xjz,39,2018-06-14,Yearly repeating dream has started early this year. Advice appreciated.,randomdreamer252,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/8r1xjz/yearly_repeating_dream_has_started_early_this/,"I've been having the exact same series of dreams yearly, for about 2\-3 weeks or so, usually starting in early July, always ending the night before my birthday. This has gone on for the past 15 or so years.

I've talked with various therapists and medical professionals about it, and none of them have been able to actually help, or even give me a halfway decent explanation for it. Most of the time they either cut me off when I tell them about it, or ignore the majority of it. I've tried lucid dreaming, sleep aids (both over the counter and prescription), changing my diet, pre\-sleep routines, etc. Nothing works, and the dreams happen the same every time.

This year it's started nearly a month early, and it's really stressing me out. I'm finally used to it happening (as much as a person can be), and it starts early on me. 

The part that bother me the most (aside from getting dismembered) is the consistency and clarity. A few years ago as an experiment I damaged a window on the 4th floor. That window is still damaged. If I try changing something in the dream, it stays changed. And I remember every detail as if it actually happened to me and it's a recent memory.

\-\-\-

It always starts the same way. I'm in a parking lot, completely empty aside from a couple of badly damaged cars, usually burnt out. The parking lot is cracked, full of potholes, dirt everywhere. It's in front of a really large building, broken and dirty windows. The main doors are always wide open, but there's lights on inside.

Going in, the place is full of hallways. The walls are smooth, doors are either locked, or missing. Rooms without doors are usually empty, just dirt and papers scattered around, no furniture.

I spend a lot of time wandering those hallways, usually several nights. Eventually I find stairwells leading up. Almost always leading up. Most of the floors I end up on are more hallways and locked doors, a few missing doors leading to more empty rooms. I can look out windows and see the parking lot, and if I'm on a high enough floor, dense woods beyond. 

If I head towards the ""back"" of the building, I can look out the windows and see a swamp. I've managed to reach the swamp a couple of times. Just outside the building in that direction is a very old van, painted to look like the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine, rusted and junked, with 2 skeletons in it, Shaggy (what's left of a green tee shirt and jeans) in the driver's seat, and Scooby (large dog skeleton with a collar) in the back. I don't try go to the swamp if I can help it.

Going up more than a few flights of stairs usually starts me being chased by the Interns. Dressed in blood\-stained scrubs, surgical masks hanging from their necks. Humanoid, but with no eyes or noses, and extremely large mouths full of teeth, and 4 arms with very large hands. They tend to come out of the locked rooms towards the end of the hallways, sniff the air, and then start chasing me until I go up or down a staircase. I can usually get away from them until about 3\-4 nights before the dreams stop. Then, no matter what I do or where I go, they catch me.

Going up is a bad idea, because the further up I go, the more Interns are around, and the Surgeons start showing up. Again, humanoid, dressed head to toe in spotless surgical scrubs, but they have eyes, and wear surgical masks covering the rest of their faces. Just two arms, but extremely long fingers with very pointed nails. They lead the Interns around in packs if I go high enough towards the upper floors.

If I can find a stairwell going down, and head to the basement, I find my way to the cafeteria. A really large room full of tables with a counter full of trays of food along one wall, and a restaurant booth for 4\-6 people in the center. 

I usually spend a few nights in there, sitting at the booth talking with my friends. Someone is usually at the counter serving food. Last year it was the brother of one of my friends. I've never met him in person, and never seen a picture of him. But when I described him to her, she said that was exactly what he looks like, right down to the shirt he wears often.

For some reason, the Interns don't come to the cafeteria. Ever. They hang around outside the doors though, waiting on me to leave. I've tried staying in the cafeteria but my friends always end up wandering out the doors, where the Interns grab them and drag them off somewhere.

Once the Interns catch me, they take me to somewhere near the top floors of the building. That's where the main room is, and where the Surgeons normally stay.

At that point, I'm strapped down to an operating table, and I can see the observation room above me. The people in the observation room are my friends, looking like they're paralyzed, and tied to their chairs. I've asked them repeatedly about it in the cafeteria, but they don't seem to understand what I'm talking about.

After I've been strapped down, a voice from an overhead speaker says ""Begin phase one."" Then the Surgeons gather around me, and start removing all my implants. Left knee, entire right forearm, pins in my left elbow, the anti\-aneurysm stitch in my left temple, the nerve block clip from the back of my head, my ICD from my chest, everything. No anasthesia, and I feel every single cut, pinch, and pull.

That usually happens about 3\-4 nights in a row. The Interns catch me, strap me down in an operating room, the voice says ""Begin phase one,"" and the Surgeons take me apart.

The last night of the dreams is always the same. After the Surgeons take me apart, they stand back, and the voice says ""Begin phase two."" The Interns move towards me, mouths open wide, and I wake up screaming.

Last year, after a few nights of the usual getting chased by the Interns, I started seeing writing on the hallway walls. It started out as just arrows pointing towards rooms where the Interns couldn't find me temporarily. Then short messages, saying ""I'm stuck here too."" A couple of weeks in, the messages guided me to a marker in one of the rooms and a message that said ""I'm Dana, what's your name?""

We started leaving each other messages on the walls, pointing out where the Interns were hiding, and the best routes down to the cafeteria. From her messages, Dana's birthday is apparently 2 days before mine, and she's 3 years younger than me.

We've tried to meet in the cafeteria, but as she wrote in a message right outside the cafeteria doors, ""we can't share certain parts of the dream.""

Just for the hell of it, I've tried writing my phone number, email address, etc. to Dana in my dream, but the message always gets smeared, or my marker runs out. She's done the same, as far as I can tell, and the same thing happens.

Dana is probably a complete figment of my imagination, some way of trying to cope with this messed up dream. Last year, just before they caught her, I left her a message asking ""What is phase two?"" The night before her birthday, she left a reply: ""You don't wake up from phase two.""

\-\-\-

I haven't seen any messages from Dana this year, but like I said, the dreams have started a month early. I'm wandering the halls, somewhere on the third or fourth floor, and so far I haven't even seen an Intern. It's like I'm there before anyone else has arrived."

I have a pending job offer in Mandaluyong for Junior Soft. Dev and long story short nabababaan ako sa salary which is 25k. I've recently turned down another JO from Alabang, 20k naman yun. Am I aiming to high for being a fresh grad or mababa po talaga ang offers nila?

Reasons bakit ako nabababaan:

1. From Laguna pa po ko mang galing so transpo or rent if ever.
2. I know my worth

Yung 1 po self explanatory naman na so yung 2 explain ko. I like to think of myself as different from other IT/CS graduates kasi I like learning A LOT. I created my Reddit account way back 2014 all because of self learning, also my GitHub account to browse and look for open source projects, and even booted up my first ubuntu machine. So yeah, I study and learn new technologies all by myself. I was really good in programming that I was able to join programming competitions outside of school and even bagging a championship for a South Luzon leg. We also competed at the Asia Manila leg. I was hardcore coder until my recent internship where in I learn a bit of Sys Ad skills and had hands on experience working with AWS. Because of this my interest shifted from Software Engineering to DevOps engineer. Of course there's the fact na I'm not from the top schools (UP, Ateneo and the likes) pero I don't like to think na they are better just because galing sila sa kilalang school.

Do I think too highly of myself or okay lang po ba mag demand ng mas mataas pa sa basic salary na nakukuha ng fresh grad? Thank you so much to everyone that would reply and take time to read. Ayoko lang po mag sisi na mag turn down ng turn down or mag accept ng basta basta.

TL;DR: Is 25k good enough for a fresh grad who is not from a top school pero has the attitude and skills na above average?"

My chronic nausea is abolsutely taking over my life. I have been feeling nauseous for the last 3 months everyday from morning to night. When I wake up first thing, I either throw up a lot of bile or I dry heave. this nausea stays with me throughout the whole day till I sleep at night. It's to the point where I can't even go to work, school, or gym happily. I still attend work and school as I have to, but it is hell for the time that I am there. I have taken a blood test for h. pylori and it came back that I did not have that bacteria in my stomach. I really need someone to help me out please because I'm giving up on life as I cant do anything. My doctor also had initally prescribed me Ranitidine for stomach acid but that pill barely helped. I have been self medicating with cannibus to help with the nausea which it definitely does, but I need to be super high for the nausea to go away. This is hard for me to do as I can't be extremely high and shouldn't be high at school and work. I also want intern-ships for my engineering degree that I can work for but they all do drug tests. As a result, I really need to figure out what is happening with my stomach as the cannibus helps but I'll have to quit it for internships. Anybody ever gone through this or have a similar experience?

UPDATE: I finally got the ultrasound report back today and they found nothing. Now I have to go to an endoscopy on September 18th. I'm still smoking at the moment because I keep throwing up. Life is going downhill for me man..."
8r3mtg,8,2018-06-14,"Do positions like *this* exist? (Low-level software, etc.)",_Hey_Its_Tom_,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/8r3mtg/do_positions_like_this_exist_lowlevel_software_etc/,"EDIT: Meant to post this to /r/cscareerquestions, but I'll leave it here for now unless someone wants to remove it.

Hey there,

I just finished my senior year with a BS in CS (among a few IT minors). I did pretty well academically, but unfortunately I spent my summers taking more classes instead of getting internships. As a result, I have absolutely no programming experience outside of few minor personal projects and the occasional class project. While I can say I've used 10+ languages, I don't really have any *experience* with them. My only jobs have been with management of tech support, hardware deployment, etc. - nothing with a whole lot of programming aside from the occasional script I choose to write to automate the boring stuff.

However, what I really love is the stuff that I never did much in school. I know the big name stuff is in software engineering, but are there jobs in the low level, byte code stuff? I love reverse engineering, emulation as a tool of preserving hardware, romhacking, and performance sensitive code. My favorite projects have been making a *Wolfenstein 3D* clone and writing a very very primitive unix-like ARM OS in C. I just love the low level software that deals with byte-level code. I can't say I'm a fan of the ""full stack"" with tons of high level abstractions and hundreds of proprietary libraries. I don't mind HTML, C# or SQL (or using them in a full MVC context) but I really prefer to use just a few libraries where I know what each does and how the interact - why they're necessary modules and not just bloat.

I can't say I know a whole lot about hardware - sure I've built my own PC, and I am fairly familiar with all sorts of stuff like:

* Disks (not only things like clustered indices and B+ trees but also physical layout issues like seek time and track length)

* How an OS interacts with I/O devices (and RAM, cache, virtual memory, deadlock detection semaphores, etc.)

* The CPU pipeline, etc.

but at the end of the day I'm **not** an engineer by any means. Once we start getting into voltages and circuits, I kind of lose my way. What I do get is general concepts and phenomenons like the 2007-ish Power Wall and 2017's Spectre/Meltdown. I absolutely love crazy workarounds and firmly believe that limitations are the best way to foster creativity.

I feel like most people use their degree in short-lived startups or boring jobs ""maintaining"" some proprietary ERP service.

I'm just a big fan of open software, cronjobs, linux, emulation, and all other fun stuff. (Not a FLOSS purist, but I certainly feel at home there)

**Do jobs with this ""low-level"" abstraction exist? If so, how do they compare to the typical software engineering that everyone clamors about? (both in pay and the type of experience required).**

Also, what other types of CS careers are out there? I've really only hear people talk about things that can be summed up as ""software engineering"". While I love the ideas of agile environments and MVC architecture/abstractions, **I just don't know where to look - or rather, what all is out there?**"

Little bit of my programming background:

* Senior in College
* Have loved software and development since Freshman year in High School
* Been doing it ever since

Except, my passion and confidence in programming as a profession has been waning since failing classes and being put on academic probation for low GPA multiple times during my college career. It has caused my depression and put me towards ignoring my work and spending my time playing video games and finding an escape from my self.

If anyone has some tips to get myself back on track. My huge interest is AI development (as well as Software Development/Engineering). What do you suggest I look to learn to improve myself as well as my skills?

Edit 1: Seriously. I can't express my thanks in words. All the kind words and advice are reassuring. I am currently working an internship as a researcher for the MIT Media Lab Personal Robotics Group. It has been a great experience so far and I hope that throughout all this, it will drive me into a new passion. It's all about gaining experience in life and figuring out as you go along. Thank You."

Antwoorden op de vragen van het lid Diks &amp;#40;GroenLinks&amp;#41; over de opties rond de verhuizing van de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne te Doorn, ingezonden op 2 mei 2018 met kenmerk 2018Z08198.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u nauwkeurig laten berekenen wat het annuleren van het besluit tot verhuizing van de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne te Doorn naar Vlissingen zou kosten en de resultaten hiervan aan de Kamer doen toekomen?1&amp;#41; Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ter voorbereiding van de bouw van de marinierskazerne in Vlissingen zijn de volgende kosten gemaakt:  
&amp;nbsp;    
€ 15,5 miljoen voor de verwerving van bouwgrond en het bouwrijp maken van het gebied,  
&amp;nbsp;    
€ 7,5 miljoen voor de eigen apparaatskosten van het ministerie van Defensie, en de advisering en de voorbereidende werkzaamheden van het Rijksvastgoedbedrijf &amp;#40;RVB&amp;#41; voor de aanbesteding,  
&amp;nbsp;    
€ 13,8 miljoen voor kosten die de provincie Zeeland heeft betaald &amp;#40;zie voor deze post ook het antwoord op vraag 5&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deze posten bedragen in totaal € 36,8 miljoen. Daarnaast is het mogelijk dat, in het geval van het stopzetten van het aanbestedingsproces,  de drie consortia die aan de dialoog deelnemen een vergoeding vragen voor de daadwerkelijk gemaakte kosten. Ik houd er rekening mee dat er in het geval van het annuleren van het besluit nog meer claims voor kostenverrekening worden ingediend en dit zal resulteren in hogere kosten voor Defensie. Bij het annuleren van het besluit tot verhuizing geldt nog steeds dat er een oplossing zal moeten worden gezocht voor de huidige verouderde huisvesting in Doorn.    
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid scenario's te onderzoeken waarbij de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne na renovatie als volwaardige marinierskazerne in gebruik blijft en er in Vlissingen een nieuwe multidisciplinaire &amp;#40;voor onderhoud aan schepen, oefenplek etc.&amp;#41; kazerne wordt gebouwd met faciliteiten die momenteel in de rest van het land ontbreken? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de constatering dat bij herbestemming van het beoogde kazerneterrein in Vlissingen ten behoeve van een multifunctionele kazerne voor het Rijk niet alle tot op heden gemaakte kosten voor niets waren? Zo nee, waarom niet? Welke kosten waren dan wel voor niets?  
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid met de gemeente Utrechtse Heuvelrug in gesprek te gaan om te bezien wat de mogelijkheden op het moment zijn en welke oplossingen eventueel kunnen worden gevonden voor de plannen die de gemeente inmiddels heeft voor het terrein van de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u, mede gelet op de uitlating van voormalig minister Hans Hillen dat hij een scenario van instandhouding van de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne nooit serieus heeft genomen2&amp;#41;, bereid nauwkeurig en serieus te laten onderzoeken welke besparingen ten opzichte van het huidige besluit kunnen worden bereikt met het in stand houden van de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne, zoals bijvoorbeeld besparingen op het gebied van verhuiskosten en het aantal boordplaatsers? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In het verleden zijn verschillende scenario’s ten aanzien van de mogelijkheden in Doorn, Vlissingen, De Peel en Budel verkend. Zoals blijkt uit de Kamerbrief van 10 april 2012 &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 32 733, nr. 59&amp;#41; en uit de brief van 22 juni 2012 met antwoorden op schriftelijke vragen &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 32 733, nr. 70&amp;#41; is de businesscase van de gemeente Utrechtse Heuvelrug indertijd bestudeerd. In een uitvoerige bijlage bij deze antwoorden ontving de Kamer het Onderzoek naar volledigheid financiële onderbouwing businesscase VBHKAZ en rapport Zeeland.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De realiteit is dat er in 2012 een besluit is genomen dat niet zonder consequenties kan worden teruggedraaid. Naar aanleiding van de signalen van vertrekkende mariniers wordt nu wel een analyse van de cijfers van de irreguliere uitstroom gemaakt. Hierbij wordt gekeken naar de eerste zes maanden van dit jaar.   
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Van welke totale kosten voor de bouw van de nieuwe marinierskazerne in Vlissingen gaat u momenteel uit? Hoe verhoudt die raming zich tot de oorspronkelijke raming voor een 'state of the art' kazerne zoals door uw ministerie gemaakt in 2012?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor het antwoord op deze vraag verwijs ik naar de commercieel vertrouwelijke bijlage bij deze brief. Dit antwoord gaat in op de bouwkosten. Daarnaast houdt Defensie in de financiering van het project rekening met exploitatiekosten. Uw Kamer wordt zoals gebruikelijk voorafgaand aan de gunning geïnformeerd over het te sluiten contract en de totale kosten.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u uw eerdere stellingname in antwoorden op Kamervragen &amp;#40;Aanhangsel Handelingen, vergaderjaar 2017-2018, nr. 1932&amp;#41;, dat het annuleren van het verhuisbesluit ""tientallen miljoenen euro's"" zou kosten, financieel onderbouwen? Zo nee, waarom niet? Waaruit bestaan bijvoorbeeld de kosten á 13,8 miljoen euro, waarvan de provincie Zeeland zelf zegt dit uit te hebben gegeven aan de kazerne, terwijl er nog geen schep in de grond is gegaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor de berekening van de kosten die Defensie kwijt zou zijn in geval de aanbesteding wordt afgebroken verwijs ik naar het antwoord op vraag 1.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de voortgangsrapportage van de provincie aan Provinciale Staten van eind maart 2018 over het project MARKAZ staat, dat van het beschikbare budget van ruim € 18 miljoen &amp;#40;€ 15 miljoen van de provincie en ruim € 3 miljoen van de gemeente Vlissingen&amp;#41; nog ca. € 4,2 miljoen resteert. De provincie en de gemeente hebben tot nu toe € 13,8 miljoen besteed aan onderzoek en planvorming, grondverwerving, sloopkosten, explosievenruiming, engineering en aanleg van nutsvoorzieningen, een afkoopsom voor bouwrijp maken, communicatie en promotie.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke financiële risico’s zitten er aan de bouw en aan de exploitatie van de nieuw te bouwen kazerne in Vlissingen? Wat is de financiële omvang van deze risico's? Zijn deze risico’s groter door de gekozen DBFMO-constructie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De financiële risico’s gedurende de bouw en de exploitatie van de kazerne zijn op geld gewaardeerd in de commercieel vertrouwelijke Public Sector Comparator &amp;#40;PSC&amp;#41;. De PSC maakt onderdeel uit van de DBFMO-constructie. Voor deze waardering verwijs ik u graag naar de commercieel vertrouwelijke bijlage bij deze brief.   
&amp;nbsp;    
In de DBFMO-overeenkomst betaalt Defensie een prestatie-gerelateerde vergoeding. Daarmee liggen deze risico’s bij het consortium, dat deze risico’s het beste kan mitigeren. Tot die tijd bestaan de financiële risico’s voor Defensie uit mogelijke gevolgen van de ontwerpkeuze, algemene marktrisico’s zoals rente en inflatie, het aanbestedingsresultaat en prijsontwikkelingen in de vastgoedsector.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
In hoeverre is de inrichting van de nieuw te bouwen kazerne in Vlissingen vergelijkbaar met de raming in 2012? Klopt het bijvoorbeeld dat de geplande schietbanen bij de nieuw te bouwen kazerne in Vlissingen maar half zo groot zijn als door de mariniers was gevraagd, en dat hierdoor slechts met zes mariniers tegelijk kan worden getraind in plaats van de vaste aanvalsteams van zestien personen, en dat er niet of beperkt geschoten kan worden? Zo ja, bent u voornemens een alternatieve faciliteit in gebruik te nemen voor oefeningen met zestien mariniers waar geen schietbeperkingen zijn en wat zijn daarvan de meerkosten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Sinds 2012 is de behoeftestelling op onderdelen aangepast. Er is bijvoorbeeld nu voorzien in de huisvesting van marechaussees en van de NATRES op het terrein, en in de opslag van Viking rupsvoertuigen. Daarnaast is het aantal parkeerplaatsen voor civiele personenauto’s conform normering naar beneden bijgesteld.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het aantal schietpunten van een reguliere schietbaan, zoals op de kazerne in Vlissingen is voorzien, wordt bepaald op basis van gebruiksintensiteit per jaar. De in de huidige ontwerpspecificatie opgenomen schietfaciliteiten zijn op basis van de hierbij horende capaciteitsberekening nog steeds afdoende. Door het treffen van geluidwerende maatregelen, hetgeen onderdeel is van de uitvraag bij de consortia, voldoet het gehele operationele gebied aan de wet- en regelgeving en zijn er geen schietbeperkingen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ten aanzien van een aantal onderdelen in de behoeftestelling en bijbehorende outputspecificatie, waaronder onder andere het aantal schietpunten,  overkappingen voor het stallen van militaire voertuigen en havenfaciliteiten, heeft de medezeggenschap aangegeven dat zij de huidige outputspecificatie niet vinden voldoen. Hierover is Defensie intern nog in gesprek.   
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat niet alle gewenste helikoptertrainingen bij de nieuw te bouwen kazerne in Vlissingen uitgevoerd kunnen worden en dat voor bepaalde trainingen uitgeweken gaat moeten worden naar andere locaties? Zo ja, wat zijn daarvan de meerkosten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke kosten gaan gepaard met de extra reistijd en reiskosten die gemaakt moeten worden voor de veel grotere afstand die mariniers moeten afleggen vanuit Vlissingen ten opzichte van Doorn om bij andere militaire bases te komen, zoals bijvoorbeeld Den Helder, Gilze-Rijen en de Harskamp?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Net als nu in Doorn zijn de mariniers na de verhuizing naar Vlissingen voor helikoptertrainingen aangewezen op trainingslocaties zoals de vliegbases Gilze-Rijen en Deelen, en op laagvlieggebieden op een aantal locaties waar ook geïntegreerd geoefend wordt &amp;#40;dit betreft de Oirschotse heide, Leusderheide, Weerter- en Budelerheide, Ederheide en de Marnewaard&amp;#41;. Daarnaast zullen de mariniers jaarlijks oefeningen houden op terreinen als ISK Harskamp, ASK Oldebroek en op Texel. Voor het bereiken van deze terreinen is de kazerne in Doorn gunstiger gelegen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij verhuizing naar Vlissingen kan in de toekomst voor het trainingsprogramma van de mariniers ook gebruik worden gemaakt van de mogelijkheden die de in Zeeland aangeboden terreinen bieden. Momenteel is Defensie in gesprek met terreineigenaren, gemeenten en de provincie Zeeland over het medegebruik van verschillende terreinen. Voor een aantal terreinen is al een contract afgesloten.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De meerkosten van de verhuizing naar Vlissingen betreffen voornamelijk reis- en verblijfkosten. In 2012 zijn de hieruit voortkomende exploitatiekosten op enkele honderdduizenden euro’s geraamd. Deze kosten zijn echter afhankelijk van een aantal factoren, zoals de oefen- en trainingsschema’s van de mariniers en dienstreizen ten behoeve van opleidingen en bedrijfsvoeringactiviteiten. Dit zijn factoren die nog niet vastliggen en per marinier zullen verschillen. Het is daarom niet mogelijk om deze kosten exact te duiden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat bij de nieuw te bouwen kazerne in Vlissingen geen oefeningen uitgevoerd kunnen worden tijdens het broed- en strandseizoen? Moet hier een alternatief voor worden gezocht? Zo ja, wat zijn daarvan de meerkosten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Net als op de oefenterreinen van Defensie elders in Nederland wordt in Zeeland rekening gehouden met natuurwaarden. Voor de oefen- en trainingsfaciliteiten op de kazerne leveren het broed- en het strandseizoen geen beperkingen op. Op twee gebieden buiten de kazerne, namelijk de Kop van Schouwen en Krammer-Volkerak, gelden beperkingen gedurende het broedseizoen. Hiermee kan rekening worden gehouden in de planning en hiervoor zijn zodoende geen alternatieven nodig.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Voor het medegebruik van terreinen van Staatsbosbeheer en North Sea Port zal Defensie, zoals gebruikelijk bij dit soort terreinen, rekening houden met recreatieve medegebruikers.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke kosten gaan gepaard met de extra reistijd en reiskosten die gemaakt moeten worden voor de veel grotere afstand die mariniers moeten afleggen vanuit Vlissingen ten opzichte van Doorn om bij andere militaire bases te komen, zoals bijvoorbeeld Den Helder, Gilze-Rijen en de Harskamp?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het gecombineerde antwoord op vraag 8 en 10.   
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gedurende hoeveel jaren verwacht u dat extra accommodatie nodig is voor personeel dat niet verhuist en daardoor op de nieuw te bouwen kazerne in Vlissingen moet worden gehuisvest? Wat zijn de financiële consequenties als deze verwachting niet uitkomt? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de behoeftestelling is ervan uitgegaan dat gedurende tien jaar extra behoefte aan legering bestaat. Als er gedurende een langere tijd extra legering nodig is, gaat dit gepaard met extra exploitatiekosten. De hoogte hiervan is sterk afhankelijk van de invulling van een contract met een consortium. Deze kosten kunnen daarom nu nog niet worden berekend.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat de gemeente Utrechtse Heuvelrug inmiddels een nabij de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne gelegen golfbaan heeft opgekocht, terwijl het niet kunnen aankopen van deze golfbaan een struikelblok was voor eventuele uitbreiding van de kazerne?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De gemeenteraad heeft op 14 maart jl. bepaald dat Utrechtse Heuvelrug het perceel zal overnemen. Indertijd heeft Defensie gepoogd dit perceel te kopen, om het bij de kazerne te kunnen trekken. Dit is toen niet gelukt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid met de gemeente Utrechtse Heuvelrug in gesprek te gaan om te bezien wat de mogelijkheden op het moment zijn en welke oplossingen eventueel kunnen worden gevonden voor de plannen die de gemeente inmiddels heeft voor het terrein van de Van Braam Houckgeestkazerne? Zo nee, waarom niet?

15  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke besluiten met betrekking tot het vastgoed van Defensie zijn sinds 2012 teruggedraaid of aangepast? Wat waren hier de financiële consequenties van?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de nota ‘In het belang van Nederland’ van 17 september 2013 was onder meer besloten tot de sluiting en afstoting van de Van Ghentkazerne in Rotterdam en de Johan Willem Frisokazerne in Assen. Deze maatregelen zijn in de maanden daarna teruggedraaid. Civiel medegebruik maakte voor deze kazernes kostenverdeling en een meer optimale bezetting mogelijk.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Onlangs is in de Defensienota 2018 aangekondigd dat een aantal defensielocaties openblijft: het Complex Brasserskade in Den Haag, het munitiecomplex in Alphen, de Korporaal van Oudheusdenkazerne in Hilversum, de Joost Dourleinkazerne op Texel, Kamp Nieuw Milligen in Uddel en de Koningin Wilhelminakazerne in Ossendrecht. Enkele andere locaties worden nog onderzocht.     
&amp;nbsp;    
Dit leidt tot een verhoogde exploitatie en in voorkomend geval het wegvallen van geraamde verkoopopbrengsten. Daarnaast zijn op bepaalde locaties investeringen benodigd. Defensie actualiseert de Vastgoedportefeuille Strategie. De daar uit volgende stand van zaken en de financiële gevolgen van de defensielocaties die open zijn, open blijven, en in de toekomst nog open zullen gaan, zullen worden verwerkt in het Materieel Projecten Overzicht, de begroting en het jaarverslag.    
&amp;nbsp;    
16  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat in onze moderne samenleving het werk van de partner even belangrijk is als dat van de marinier en het weinig emancipatoir is van hem of haar te verlangen dat hij/zij zijn/haar werk, familie en sociaal leven achterlaat om met de marinier mee te verhuizen? Bent u bereid bij uw onderzoek naar de oorzaken van de verhoogde uitstroom bij het Korps Mariniers de consequenties voor partners en kinderen expliciet te onderzoeken en mee te laten wegen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Defensie kent naast de mariniers veel meer uitgezonden militairen van wie velen niet wonen in de nabijheid van hun kazerne, vliegbasis of de marinehaven in Den Helder. De beslissing over het al dan niet meeverhuizen van gezinsleden is altijd aan de individuele militair geweest.

8r4nqt,0,2018-06-14,Boyfriend (40m) won't get a job - Need advice,pequaywan,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8r4nqt/boyfriend_40m_wont_get_a_job_need_advice/,"Long post \- lots of content. Question at the end. I'm F46, he is M40.

We moved up to a cold climate about a year ago, spent about a month in\-transit, and moved full time near the end of July, 2017.  At that time, my boyfriend (40m) had a job lined up.  We were still in process of selling our former home down south. I was working from home during the day, with a part\-time local job at nights/weekends for extra income.  I didn't exactly want to leave permanently, since we didn't have the house sold, but my boyfriend pretty much insisted that we move. I thought I would stay behind, work my 2 jobs, until the house sold but nope. I was able to transfer my day job working from home up north.

So, after we moved \- at the end of August, he ends up QUITTING the job he had lined up.  That really bothered me, because I had quit my second job down south to move up north at his insistence.  However, I tried to be supportive, and since we bought a fixer\-upper, I said he should ""take the winter off"" and get a job in the Spring.

We ended up selling the other house in late November, 2017.

I subsequently my job contract ended at the end of January, 2018, unexpectedly to me. I found another work from home job in mid\-February and I recently (last week) got a different second job for additional income.

Meanwhile, boyfriend was working around the house \-\- but not like all the time, every day. Maybe 2\-4 hours a day, maybe 6 at the MOST.

Around February of this year, he said he was going to start a tour company for local breweries. While I tried to be supportive, and have been, internally I felt this was a bad idea for the following reasons:

1 \- we live in a cold climate and the only real busy months are summer. This would not be something he would be able to do year\-round and have a sustainable income from. He mentioned getting a second job M\-Th, and doing the brewery tour business on Fri\-Sun.

2 \- we have a HUGE fixer\-upper \- so if he's running his own company 3 days a week, and working the other 4 \- where is he going to have time to work on the house?

3 \- when would he have time for US if he's so busy with all of the above mentioned stuff?

He has been living off of the sale proceeds from the house down south, and his retirement. I have no idea how much he's been spending, but there's zero income.

The place we bought has no garage. I was promised a garage this year, and at the rate of ""do it yourself Danny"" it won't ever get built. I never would have agreed to move up here if there was no garage. I'm talking it was \-25 last December. Personally, I have a feeling he is squandering the sale of the house proceeds to continue to live off of.

He went to college years ago for graphic design \- never graduated (never finished a required internship \- why on earth would you let that ONE thing deter you from your degree \-\- but he did, and technology has changed SO much since then... not sure if he did complete the internship, he would know the programs and be able to get it at this point). So back in february, when he's mentioning the brewery tours \- he throws out that he'll start up his graphic design stuff again.  Meanwhile, he also said he was ""burnt out"" and did no work around the house for the whole month of February. So no job, no income, just surfing the internet all day. He finally got back to work but only after I called him out on it.

I've mentioned several times since then (usually during a fight), that he should really get a job.  But for whatever reason, he is not. I don't know what his problem is. He said he was going to start the brewery tour and reboot his graphic design stuff... but nothing. It's summertime and now is the time to get your business going. Meanwhile, ""taking the winter off"" is now somehow summer. It will get harder and harder to explain a long gap in his resume as time goes on.

I must say, I am relieved that he seems to be off of the whole ""start my brewery tours company"" thing \- because as I said above, I don't think it's a good idea. Maybe in a few years, but not now. He used to constantly surf craigslist for a tour shuttle, but now he seems to be looking for a new replacement truck and not a stupid used shuttle bus.

He is paying the bills, but I also work from home. He is a HUGE distraction to me. Talking, slams doors, working around the house... since this place is such a fixer, we basically live in a studio apartment environment while he is fixing the 2 bedrooms, closet and bathroom... yup, they are ALL in shambles. He decided to replace roof himself because he is too cheap to hire someone unless he HAS to \- shortly after Labor Day (after he had quit the job he lined up), a massive storm came in \- I said to buy a tarp in advance \- he bought a TINY one... all of our crap got wet inside... so as a result, we had mold and so everything is a mess. It was like a movie, water pouring down from the ceiling in many places \- had to use every bowl and cup we could find to contain it. He eventually finished ripping the old roof off, and we had to wait until mid\-december, when there was snow everywhere, for the roofing company he hired to come and finally finish it. We had a massive tarp over our house for about 3 months. We met our neighbors and they said ""oh the house with the tarp"" LOL.

At our old place, I had an office I could escape to \- although he was working and he wasn't such a distraction. Now however, there's nowhere to go to and frankly, I would have rather gotten a 40 hour job outside of the home than to have to see him here 24/7... I was trying to work from home because we have a puppy and an older dog. There's times where I ""sush"" him because he's talking too much and I'm trying to WORK. It's disrespectful I feel frankly.

He yells at me for not contributing more financially to the house. So I now work 2 jobs, he has none.  I make less than half of what I used to, before I moved to a different state to move in with him \- and there are few to nil jobs in this state that are really good paying.  I was paying the electric/internet bill down South \- but then we moved up here and there's no central heat. Very cold environment \- we used electric heating which made our bill soar to $500 a month. Well I dont have $500 a month for electric. So he got mad at me for that too. It used to be under $200 a month. Getting central heat is one thing supposedly on the list to do this year but who knows at the rate he is going.

**Any suggestions on what I should do?** For now, I am trying to save money so I can leave. I really don't want to lose him or the relationship, but I really am having a hard time respecting someone who seemingly can't find a job. Whatever happened to his drive in life?  He works maybe 4 hours a day here. I worked over 11 hours yesterday.

I should also add, he has no health insurance which is like playing russian roulette. in 2008 I unexpectedly had a medical emergency and was in the hospital for a week. This could happen to ANYONE. A job can provide insurance.

I hate to think I need to give an ultimatum... but this is really bad. I dont know what his ""plans"" are for himself for the future, he never tells me. How can I marry someone who says nothing like that.  Im sad. I gave up my life, friends, a $40\+K job a year to move here only for financial hardship due to a bad job market and to be haggled about money from him. I dont really know anyone here in this state.

Thank you for reading.

ETA\- we have been together for about 4 years, 2 months. I moved to a different state about 6 months after meeting him."
8r5ahz,7,2018-06-14,I have a college degree and can't get a job in my field due to crippling anxiety during interviews.,tuna_dip,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8r5ahz/i_have_a_college_degree_and_cant_get_a_job_in_my/,"I've suffered from anxiety and depression for all my life. I've taking medication on and off, however, I'm currently not taking anything. 

I struggled intensely during college to finish my degree, suffering multiple panic attacks a day, having days where I couldn't get out of bed, etc. After graduating, my anxiety and depression got better from the lack of stress. 

I had two internships and and did pretty well grade wise, however, I am struggling to get a job. I've had dozens of phone interviews and more than a handful of in person interviews and have not managed to land a job. I graduated over two years ago and I feel worthless.

When I'm in an interview I freeze up, panic, and have a difficult time articulating answers to questions. I'm already not very good at off the cuff speaking, but when I'm in an interview situation it's a hundred times worse. I sound like an idiot. I've practiced a lot and always am well prepared, but when it comes down to it I think I come off as stupid and unqualified. 

I don't know what to do or how to handle myself any advice would be much appreciated. 

TLDR: I'm terrible in job interviews due to crippling anxiety. "

8r5p5t,7,2018-06-14,"Reporting mistakes have me wondering if I'm cut out for this career, any advice?",WriterInNeedPlz,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/8r5p5t/reporting_mistakes_have_me_wondering_if_im_cut/,"Hey all, Sorry to be another annoying early-career journalist casting solicitations for advice into the ether, but I'd love to hear about this from other journalists and hopefully get some much-needed perspective on my career if possible. I'll try to be as specific as possible without incriminating myself, in case my bosses are on this forum.  

I've been working as a reporter for a fairly respected publication for the past few years. In the past, I've gotten feedback about not doing enough to verify facts on certain articles, and it resulted in me being pulled off of reporting on certain topics. On the one hand, I get that this is something I need to work at and extremely important for any reporter. On the other hand, most of this feedback has been directed towards hat-tipped reporting I've done; I write multiple posts a day, on top of writing a Q&amp;A or feature of varying length every few weeks. I recognize that this is not a lot to many journalists (although a couple have told me that they're surprised it's that much when I tell them how much I do), but I've been overwhelmed by the load, and do find myself not fact-checking individual articles as much as I should (especially hat-tipped ones, because you'd think that if they came from a prestigious news source, they'd be fine). The same goes for grammar and publication style rules, but I think I've gotten better at that just by virtue of writing a lot.   

Recently, I was writing a feature in which I asked interview subjects a question about a delicate subject. I thought I'd prepared for that question well, but I realized as I was writing the article that I had used some incorrect information when framing the question; it was 100&amp;#37; accidental on something that I thought I'd adequately prepared for, and I don't think it really affected the nature of the response because the respondent said they didn't know much about the situation I was describing, but it was a mistake and I mentioned it to my editor when I turned the draft in. I apologized, recognized that it was an issue and asked if I could come clean to the interviewee and try to get a response to the question with the right information. My editor decided to cancel the story, and admonished me in an email explaining it, saying that I shouldn't be making mistakes like these after the amount of time I've worked there and that they couldn't understand why I made the mistake when we'd talked about the article prior. 

I've spoken to other people in the industry about this situation, and they've told me that I shouldn't beat myself up about it. But based on my editor's response, I feel a bit like what I thought was a weak spot might actually just be something that suggests I shouldn't be in this career. I would like to not be a daily reporter in the future, or at least report with the frequency that I do. My dream would be to be an op-ed and/or features writer, with a work load that permitted me more headspace to do due diligence in my reporting, and an editing structure where I felt less pressure to turn things out both perfectly and super-frequently. But I understand that I don't get to a position like that if I cannot do better with this aspect of things.

It's not that I don't know how to fact check; I started doing that as an intern when I began my career. But I have trouble doing a good job of doing that well without going down rabbit holes, especially for the hat-tipped stuff, and balancing being thorough with the deadlines I have to stick to. I'd like to think that I wouldn't have these problems as much if I was in a place where 1) I didn't have to have my head in so many things at once and 2) could maybe get fact-checking help from interns, fact-checkers or others. 

I have issues with my management and higher ups, as well as the conditions of the place that publishes us, but I don't know if that matters so much. Some people tell me I'm in an unsupportive environment, and others tell me to suck it up because it's a lot worse at other places. In the middle, I'm wondering if I even have the skills to make this work. I know I can write well, but if I make errors like these with any consistency, is there a place for me in journalism at all?

8r5vxu,12,2018-06-14,Tips to support husband through situational depression?,BooksAndCatsAnd,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8r5vxu/tips_to_support_husband_through_situational/,"Hi RPW! I made the huge mistake of posting elsewhere on reddit for advice on how to help my husband through this tough time and oh wow did I miss you ladies - everyone was suggesting divorce.... did everyone else not say “in sickness and in health”?

Anyway my question for you is: what are your tips for guiding your husband out of situational depression, without being a nag or emasculating him? I trust you ladies to give me real options. 

About our situation... 
- We’ve been going through the immigration process. It is actually going well but we are still waiting for the final step....  my man has 2 STEM degrees, 1 internship in his home country, and a year spent waiting on immigration decisions - recently he got temporary work authorization and is trying to find that first job out of college— difficult for all people and definitely just a tough situation when combined with the immigration factor. 
- Not being legally allowed to work for a year has done a NUMBER on him ... he feels shame about being a house husband and accepting help from family (although it’s not a burden for them to help, he’s not sponging off them). 
- He has a huge desire to get his career together but he has even bigger fear/anxiety that makes him feel as if the battle is already lost and that it’s too late for him (depressive mindset)
- He is stuck in a negative feedback loop where he doesn’t believe in himself (says “I can’t” constantly), so he doesn’t take action, not taking action reduces his self-confidence, he’s already pretty introverted so these combine to create social anxiety, making it hard for him to reach out for support, worsening his situation and self-belief ad infinitum.
- I vetted him well before we were married... he is my rock, my leader and protector and we have a very traditional marriage... this has been disruptive for us both and I want to help restore him to the man I know is still somewhere inside. 

I do my best every day to:
- remind him that I believe in him and know he’s capable of finding a great job
- help him in any way I can 
- avoid creating any household burdens for him (I work full time in a high stress job but still cook our meals, do the laundry, get up early to walk the dog, plan our outings and meals, etc.)
- be emotionally and physically available (his love language is primarily physical touch) 
 - be a peer mentor to him (I’ve come out on the right side of my own tough job search and I have plenty of skill I share with regard to applications, interviews, and self-presentation)
- generally doing as much for him as I can (his secondary love language is acts of service so if he asks for something I do my best to help/accommodate. Usually it’s small stuff like helping him draft an email or watching a show he’d prefer over my choice)

It seems like it takes more than that to help someone break this cycle! If I could I’d want him to see a therapist but he’s one of those who had a terrible therapy experience and never wants to go again. "
8r6jb4,53,2018-06-14,Turning the tables,KayceeDirac,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8r6jb4/turning_the_tables/,"This is the story of how I (maybe) ruined the marriage of an MLM couple that tried to scam me.

I was working as a paid intern at a big tech company at the time- clear goals, clearly defined path to reach them, and knowledgeable from prior (albeit brief) experience with Vector &amp; subsequent research about MLMs and their shitbaggery. Basically, I was immune to their manipulations.
OR SO I THOUGHT.

While I'm at the Starbucks near the building I worked at, a really cute ~20 year old girl, shoulder length red hair and very bright blue eyes, approaches me and introduces herself, saying that she couldn't help but notice that I was programming and indicating that she too took an interest in technology, asking me about the kind of work I did and what sort of code I wrote. I was absolutely flabbergasted because women never approach me like this, and I was a sucker and hopeless romantic who thought love would sort of just fall into my lap like this.

We schedule dinner for the following Wednesday and up until then we're texting (friendly, nothing too suggestive at this stage) and she tells me about her family, hobbies, etc. One detail that stuck out to me was that she liked to play Duran Duran covers on the piano. This detail will come into play shortly.
I should note at this point that for a girl claiming to be interested in tech, she was extremely vague and unresponsive to my enthusiastic texts concerning network science and machine learning, which in retrospect should have been a giveaway that she didn't know shit about it.
But anyway.

So we meet up for dinner at the Olive Garden the following Wednesday night, I'm wearing as decent clothes as you might expect a 22 year old to be wearing, and in comes dream girl and another guy, who introduces himself as her fiancée. I'm trying not to let my bewildered and upset emotions show (I catch feels too damn early, I know, don't judge me pls) and my heart sinks like a stone the moment her fiancée tells me about the ""mentor"" who changed his life. Suddenly it clicked, I realized what I was dealing with (Amway most likely) and almost came close to crying. I didn't cry of course because I'm not a little bitch, but damn dude I'd been lonely for over two years prior to this date due to certain problems I was going through at the time, but I'll spare you the story. Anyway my sadness and feelings of betrayal must have shown because at that point, fiancée asks me if everything's alright, I take a deep breath, and I say no.

In a sudden burst of disappointment-and-resentment-fueled-inspiration, I turned to the girl and told her that I couldn't do this and that Adam (her fiancée) had to know the truth, that this wasn't right. I turn to Adam, who has a confused expression on his face, and I confess to him that Olivia (redhead heartbreaker) and I had a passionate sex-filled evening after her Starbucks pitch, during which she confessed that her network marketing job wasn't yielding returns and that the stress made her impulsively drawn to someone with a stable tech job.
Olivia starts protesting ""what the fuck are you talking about??"" while Adam is looking back and forth between us with his mouth agape, and I go on saying that I'd known beforehand what this setup was all about because Olivia had told me while we were in bed, and that she'd asked me to come meet for this pitch just once so that Adam wouldn't get suspicious about what might have happened between us.
Adam is still staring at us with his mouth agape while Olivia is beginning to cry and shout ""He's lying, I don't know what the fuck he's talking about!"" and at this point the rest of the restaurant is starting to quiet down and look at the commotion at our table. But I go on, and I say ""It's no use lying Olivia, I know that your conscience hurts as much as mine and that's why you're crying, but this isn't right, you're getting married and he has to know. It isn't fair to him that we made love behind his back, but it was a mistake Adam, she really truly loves you,"" and then I proceed to mention how she played ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and ""Ordinary World"" on the piano at my place. And after I slip this very specific detail, Adam shouts ""What the fuck!!"" and storms away from the table, with a tearful Olivia chasing him out of the Olive Garden, and leaving me sitting alone with everyone quietly staring at me.

And that's how I ruined a marriage"

I would like to contribute the percentage of my bi-weekly paychecks to make sure that I don't miss out on any of the ""free money"" that my employer will contribute.  Here is their contribution information: 

""The Company contributes 6&amp;#37; of your eligible earnings as a Basic Company contribution to your 401(k) account. You will be automatically enrolled in the 401(k) plan with a 2&amp;#37; voluntary contribution. You can choose to increase your voluntary contributions up to 75&amp;#37; of eligible earnings. The company matches 50&amp;#37; of the first 6&amp;#37; of your contributions, to a maximum company matching contribution of 3&amp;#37; of eligible earnings and a total company contribution of 9&amp;#37;.""

My last day for the internship is August 10th, and I'm making $19.30 at a 40 hour work week if that matters.

The first sentence makes me think that it doesn't matter how much I contribute to get their 6&amp;#37;.  But then the last sentence is what confuses me; should I increase my contribution to 6&amp;#37; per paycheck to maximize the amount they will contribute?"
8r6olr,1,2018-06-14,Life Advice and Prayer,mattortman777,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/8r6olr/life_advice_and_prayer/,"Hello,

I am a 27yo male. I am struggling right now with a whole lot of anxiety and need some advice/prayer/help. I have a bachelors degree in pastoral ministry, but after graduating from undergrad I have gone 5 years without being hired by a church. I have been applying to youth pastor positions. I feel like I wasted the last ten years pursuing my dream of becoming a pastor., and now its too late and expensive to get qualified to do something else that I would actually like. 

I do have experience 3 years of interning on 3 different church staffs. I just have never been offered a position after applying to hundreds of churches.

The last internship that I did was at a church in Maui, and after I stayed on the island for eight months working in a scuba shop. I was recently fired from the scuba shop and moved back in with my parents in Michigan where I have been for the last month. When I got home I instantly missed the Island, my relationships and the person who I was on the island.

I applied to a lot of different jobs back on Maui and was accepted to take a police examination. I know that Police application processes can take a while, so I also obtained housing and partial food through volunteering for a missionary ministry in Maui for the next 3 months.

I have been experiencing anxiety about a lot of things:

1. if the police application takes longer than 4 months to be accepted into the academy I will have no place to live on the island.

2. I have to take a polygraph test to become an officer, and I know they ask drug related questions. I have never done, possessed, or sold any drugs. But one time I was curious about steroids and tried to order them online, they were seized by customs and I was very relieved and vowed to never try that again. however I fear I will be disqualified if I mention this to them. I am hoping that they will just ask if I have ever used, possessed, or sold drugs which I haven't.

3. I am scared that having been fired from the scuba shop will prevent me from being hired, as well as the fact that I have had a lot jobs in the last 5 years which might reflect poorly on me even through most jobs that I have had I left to pursue a ministry internship.

4. I don't even know if I want to become an officer, it sounds scary, but it would provide me with a stable income something that I have never had before.

I have a lot of doubt in myself and a lot of fear. I feel like a loser with no hope. "

I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before don't be scared of trying again."

Late in the afternoon, the interns monitoring the various service bots and machines that kept the facility clean and running smoothly were preparing for their usual shift change. Stuck with the overnight shift, the intern due to take over stopped by one of the many vending machines scattered around to get something to drink as well as some snacks to keep himself awake. Arms full of junk food, he continued to the control room. As most of the bots were automated, his job for the night was merely watching the various monitors for anything abnormal. Usually, the only problems were bots getting stuck or being overturned as a joke. 

A few hours went by and things were still going smoothly. Even with the sugary snacks, the lone intern supervising the screens was having a hard time staying awake. Sure enough, he dozed off and his arm slowly slid down the control panel, knocking a can of soda over and spilling it all over the various controls. Maybe if he’d gotten a coffee instead, he’d have stayed awake and none of the following would have ever happened. 

The soda dripped further into the panels as the intern dozed, eventually shorting them out and causing the bots to go into a frenzied ‘deep clean’ mode. Ordinarily, this would not have been a bad thing, but whoever had written the cleaning program had specifically instructed them not just to clean the facility, but to eliminate whatever was causing the messes in the first place. The source of most of them were obviously the staff and other various residents.

 Those unlucky enough to find themselves surrounded by the hordes of slow-moving bots were being literally swept to death by brooms or slowly being poked to death by the tools carried behind the maintenance bots. In addition, the program also affected items currently plugged into a wall outlet. They all were on the same mission as the other bots, to ensure the cleanliness of the facility by eliminating the mess at the source.  

When the intern responsible for this woke up, every screen looked like something out of a very odd horror movie. One screen in particular showed an intern being pursued by a floor buffer up until the moment it ran out of cord and yanked its plug out of the socket. The hundreds, if not thousands, of bots were slowly spreading, making their way across the entire facility and beginning to make their way to those that resided outside.

I'm wondering what are the most interface/program do you use at work: MS SQL Server, My Sql, MS Access, Excel, etc. Which interface should I familiarize myself with first? I heard MS Access used to be popular but Access 2016 made some features unaccessable? I have learned the basic commands of SQL using MS SQL Server but I heard that only the folks in the IT department use SQL Server and that data analysts mainly use Access.

My situation is that I've recently graduated with a Economics degree and I'm trying to fake some work experience with SQL and VBA. I need to sound the part during an interview hence I need to get the details correct about what program I used to code SQL (and, of course I need to practice on that program.) I do have white collar work experience but it was only an 8mth paid intern position that didn't require SQL. "
8r70sr,2,2018-06-14,Internship Tax Question,oreosfly,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8r70sr/internship_tax_question/,"I'm a 21 year old student working as an intern at an investment firm this summer. Right now, I get paid weekly and I pay approximately $188 in federal income tax per paycheck. I'm claimed as a dependent on my dad's tax return (parents are divorced, he has custody).

From what I read, even as a dependent, I still get the full $12000 standard deduction. With my base salary and OT pay, I'm going to make approximately $13.8k this summer. I dumped some money into Bitcoin late last year and made the mistake of not selling it in December, so if I sell it now, I incur a $600 loss that I want to write off as a dollar for dollar deduction on my income. This means my income will be $13.2k. I also made $480 from a work study job, meaning my total income is about $13.7k. The school didn't withhold any income tax my paychecks for this job.

With the standard deduction of $12000, my taxable income should only be $1700, meaning I should get a sizable refund check during filing season, correct? I plan to file my own return.

If anyone could check for the accuracy of all this, I would appreciate it! Thank you"

8r8eb3,1,2018-06-15,Need help determining best Investment strategy with regards to a 1040NR tax paying nonresident (US/CAN),needHelpWith1040NR,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8r8eb3/need_help_determining_best_investment_strategy/,"Hello,

I am an intern from Canada working in the United States for 4 months under the J-1 visa class. This means I will be filing the 1040NR tax return. I have an investment account with a Canadian brokerage, Questrade, and was recently approved for an investment account with an American brokerage, Robinhood.

I was hoping to learn what the best strategy is for investing my US income. Questrade offers USD accounts in Canada, but I thought that maybe sticking with an American brokerage would allow me to make higher income. There are a few problems with investing in an American brokerage, that I don't know the answers to:

- I am filing a 1040NR when I'm done my internship - would investments in an American brokerage count as ""Income Effectively Connected With U.S. Trade/Business""?
- If it does, I'm assuming this is good. Is this correct?
- When I leave America, I will, of course, no longer have a US address, until I possibly return for my next internship within 6 months of departure. What kind of problems could arise from this?

With these problems, would it still be worthwhile to use my Robinhood investment account, or should I just open and use a Questrade USD account? What should I do?"

8r8yh1,1,2018-06-15,I [20M] don't know if my boyfriend [21M] still loves/likes me or what to do with this relationship.,throwaway540324,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8r8yh1/i_20m_dont_know_if_my_boyfriend_21m_still/,"My boyfriend means the world to me. But I can't tell how he feels about me. He was the first to tell me that he loved me. I remember last summer when we would video chat every other night and he would say goodnight with a little heart at the end. When we were apart, he traveled 2 hours to visit me almost every week. But lately it takes like 12 messages to get him to respond to anything and its usually ""lol idk"". It breaks my heart and it really makes me feel clingy but that was a span of the whole day and he doesn't have anything large commitments to do: no job, no internship, no plans aside from occasionally helping out his mother. I've confronted him about this and he says that he just isn't used to it. This is his first relationship and he's tells me that he's never had to chat or hangout so often with any friend so he isn't used to it. I asked him to try and maybe even a little goodnight when he sleeps would be a nice gesture, but all he does is type two letters ""gn"". It makes me happy that he remembers I asked, but since I told him to do it, it feels like he's just doing it out of obligation--especially since its only two letters. I ask a few times a week if I can visit. Most times he would present some problem or inconvenience that could happen, like the bus being too slow or no way to get home. The last time, he took twelve hours the day before to say that he doesn't know what his schedule would be. So I asked him if there was anything I could do to help him decide, then he told me that he just didn't want to say no. I had prepared on the possibility of coming over the whole day when he knew he didn't want to since the morning. I was visiting him; I would take a bus and a bike ride to see him, without him needing to bike more than ten minutes to the nearest mall or theatre or park. I asked him why it wasn't like this last year (when he videochatted and spent 2 hours on transit to see me) and he said that last summer was during the honeymoon phase so he had to do stuff to impress me. He said he enjoys spending time with me unless we are mad at each other, so I've buried my feelings every time he got on my nerve for not responding or replying with ""lol"". I feel so clingy looking at my messages because its just me talking or me saying good morning and goodnight without anything in between. I asked if this was more of a FWB type of thing, but he swears he has emotions for me--that he loves me. Aside from those words, I really can't feel the love from my end. He doesn't message, he complains when I ask to hang out unless theres a group (which means that we don't do anything remotely romantic, not even sit next to each other), he will never see us being romantic in public, and he hates gifts/romance-related holidays or any outlet that I imagine that he can express his love. He hates needing to rely on me and thinks that he should be able to do everything independently. He doesn't even want me to give head (though that may be because he said I suck).

I'm sorry for the clump of a message, but I'm just so confused on what to do. He's in the closet and in my friend group so I can't ask anyone that knows him or talk to anyone we know about this secret relationship and its just so frustrating to think about, but when I see his face, I remember our first date, the way he smiled, the way he planned every bus stop to save money for two broke college students (and a few more just to spend more time with me). I remember the one time he did agree to hang out with me a week ago and how I couldn't stop smiling at whatever dumb/weird/cool/exciting thing he said. Is there anything I can work on to better the way I feel about the relationship? because I'd rather lose myself than him.

tl;dr I don't even know what I am saying, but my boyfriend hates the way I show him love and I can't tell what he does to show me he loves me. Is there anything I can do to see his love or change so this relationship works?"

I just turned 21 years, I'm a second year student studying Computer Engineering. I have no debt and I currently have a job that pays the minimum wage in my country for 8h (I work around 15 hours per week, maybe 20 if it's a busy week). I was able to keep up the job and university at the same time.
In the summer of 2017 I made a website with a friend as an investor, but after creating the engine and launching the website he decided that he is not willing to invest that much (around 5000$). The website was able to produce some money, but it didn't have the cash flow required. 

For this summer I have 2 options, to work my current job and to improve and find funds for my website (which may or may not work) or go for a full time internship as a programmer plus holding my current job.
Do you think it is worth the risk financially to improve and to establish the website as a business? Or will it be just a waste of time and I should move on and focus on learning and having a stable position?

8rbnx4,4,2018-06-15,I am an intern at an IT company and I've been assigned a task that requires me to use JIRA for duplicate assets in our inventory.,khajitknowsbest,jira,https://www.reddit.com/r/jira/comments/8rbnx4/i_am_an_intern_at_an_it_company_and_ive_been/,"Hey guys, I've just started an internship this week and I've been asked to work on their asset management program, and create a set of rules (?) for JIRA so that when we input a set of assets in our inventory using JIRA, it will check to see if the assets are duplicates, if they are, JIRA will either ask to replace the current one, or to create a new asset and keep both.

Our assets consists of many information such as serial #, asset #, manufacturer name, model, etc.. The way we put our assets in the system is by using an excel spreadsheet with all the information in it. JIRA will then read every cell and match the attribute of the cell with what is described in JIRA, [like this](https://imgur.com/a/W6HJfmf). 

What I need to do is to have JIRA check in spreadsheet and see if there is any matching cells with our current inventory and if there is a duplicate, ask the user if they want to replace it or create a new asset.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!"

8rcbts,1,2018-06-15,(USA/CAD) Investment advice for J-1 intern filing Canadian and United States taxes,needHelpWith1040NR,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8rcbts/usacad_investment_advice_for_j1_intern_filing/,"Hello,

I am an intern from Canada working in the United States for 4 months under the J-1 visa class. This means I will be filing the 1040NR tax return. I have an investment account with a Canadian brokerage, Questrade, and was recently approved for an investment account with an American brokerage, Robinhood.

I was hoping to learn what the best strategy is for investing my US income. Questrade offers USD accounts in Canada, but I thought that maybe sticking with an American brokerage would allow me to make higher income. There are a few problems with investing in an American brokerage, that I don't know the answers to:

- I am filing a 1040NR when I'm done my internship, would investments in an American brokerage count as ""Income Effectively Connected With U.S. Trade/Business""?
- If it does, I'm assuming this is good. Is this correct?
- When I leave America, I will, of course, no longer have a US address, until I possibly return for my next internship within 6 months of departure. What kind of problems could arise from this?

With these problems, would it still be worthwhile to use my Robinhood investment account, or should I just open and use a Questrade USD account? What should I do?"

I met this great girl 4 years ago when I started university, even wrote about our first walks here when we started hanging out. She was in a bad relationship at the time and I was the person she talked to all about it, pretty gave me a How To on dating her, so I said to her plainly that if she thought her boyfriend was treating her badly then it was time to let him go, she clearly deserved better! 

A month later I told her that I deliver on better. We started dating and even though I lived in a foreign country (with breaks of about 2 months tops) we made it work perfectly for the first couple years. The problem was that we started dating in my first year, in March, by the time it got to May/June when exams were being held I was so damn focused on my relationship with this amazing new person that I'd spend all my time with her and then furiously, ineffectively, revise the night before and obviously fail. 

Failing wasn't really the problem, I got my results in August and that was a shitty day. The real problem was that I was too afraid to tell my Dad cause he's a bit of a mental case, abused me a bit when I was younger physically, then decided that was too far but verbal abuse was cool. So 13 years of walking on eggshells and never airing bad news because it just led to a whole world of mental torture, turned me into someone who avoids conflict religiously; I lied a lot. No way was I telling him I had failed my first year of expensive overseas university, not after he's just gone through his own mental torture leaving his job of 17 years and having huge troubles getting his severance pay. 

The decision was made and I didn't tell him, instead I got transferred to another course and the same uni, started fresh and ended up living with my girlfriend and a few other people. Life was great, even though I rented a room I was in hers constantly, got to the point we were basically living together. It was so good we decided why not make it 3!

3rd year. Complications. This is the year I'm meant to be graduating right? Well to my family yes, my gf and friends new my big secret. I just couldn't bare to reveal my biggest failure. Unfortunately my Dad was having it pretty shitty too. Finally got his severance which allowed him to live comfortably with my Mother and Sister, this brought the pressure off me significantly because I thought at some point I'd just tell him I'd fucked it and he would grudgingly pay for my final year. He had his severance, found another cushy job, fell back into his own ways and got let go (severance received around June of my first year, lost his new job around winter of my second year). So I'm in second year, Dad's just lost his job but it's alright he'll bounce back. 

My biggest regret is that at no point during this whole saga did I attempt to get a proper paying job (I did a 8 week internship summer of my second year but nothing apart from that). For the first and second year I was living pretty sweetly. I always thought my Dad would support me, childish and embarrassing I know please don't think I don't see this. I never bothered to try and get a job until my 3rd year, my Dad somehow spent all his severance, mostly because he lost his new job and had to relocate my mother and sister to my grandparents house. The only money that was coming in was from low paid and unreliable consulting work, but some of that now had to go to my sister who was at boarding school in the same country I'm in. 

Bringing it back to my girlfriend, she worked a summer job in first year, then started working at university in her second year. Her parents supported her by paying for her rent and sending her spending money now and then, but all in all from the money my Dad was sending me I usually had about 4 times what she had, so I was Mr. Big Bucks. 3rd year though I was no longer Mr. Big Bucks, I had to put mostly all the money my Dad was sending me to paying rent and bills. Everything else was going on weed to cope with stress and food because shit's important. I played dota 7 hours every night in the room I was renting, every night my beautiful girlfriend I had loved for the past 2 years would go to sleep at 11/12, she would most likely be working the next day at her retail job that was paying for a good portion of our food and occasionally some of my weed. I'd give her a kiss, tell her I loved her and trundle up the stairs to play Dota for 5 hours and smoke a joint or two. Then I'd barge (hard not to when the doors is squeaky as fuck) in at 4/5/6am stinking of weed and join her in bed. She never ever protested, except to tell me a couple times I was really cold! I even slept rough in my room a couple nights because I knew she was working early, she'd never really mentioned it and our time together was nearly always fun. 

We weren't having sex though, for about 2/3 months close to the end of university we didn't have sex and I chalk it up to Dota mostly. I mean shit son I'm a fairly good looking guy, she's told me many times as have her friends, my friends and my mummy (jk), but nothings less attractive than a bum who doesn't work, gets blazed and plays video games. In my defence I had completed my repeat year fine, and was well on my way to scraping by my second year. This didn't stop the whole not telling my Dad thing and what's worse is I'd let it get so close to results day without telling him, I got so close to graduation without telling him, I left it too late he'd already booked my parents and sisters tickets on little money. 

That was a breaking point in our relationship a bit. I could tell her patience was wearing really thin, especially since I was struggling with money yet still smoking and not trying to find a job. My parents arrive and awkwardly have to stay in my uni house with me, my girlfriend and two of my flat mates. Shit was really embarrassing. They'd booked a B&amp;B but arrived really really early for the fake graduation date I'd told them. All this time my Dad's asking for my results, I'm pulling hairs out when I'm alone with my girl. None of this looks good, how can it. 2 days before graduation my parents get a train to a different town because my Dad wanted to try and sell a couple things he'd brought over for some quick cash. I cowardly dropped the news on a phone call to them, I wasn't graduating this year, results just came in, I've failed 2 modules. That was bad but it was over right? Wrong I made more bad decisions. After my parents left I told them it was alright and that I could resit my 2 module exams. Another huge lie cause you can't resit final year exams and I wasn't in final year anyway was I (fuckkfbusdhauijrufhbew). More and more lies later I've sat the exam, but I've now got to move out of my current house. My gf has finished her degree, she's graduated, all of my friends have graduated. I need to somehow pay for my final year but there's no chance, cause I still haven't told my Dad. In fact, what I told my Dad is that I passed and I should be receiving my diploma by mail within the next month. Lies upon lies. Upon more lies. I managed to defer my final year in the hopes that I'd find a solution. 

Now I'm out of lies, a month goes by and I've got no diploma, I'm living on the couch of my friends living room (thank god I had this one good friend), my parents are calling and texting me everyday asking about my diploma so I just stopped responding completely. I smoked more weed and played more video games. Somehow my girlfriend still wanted to make it work, she was living with her parents and working in a town close by. Still in retail for the company she was working for in her 3rd year. But now I've gone from a guy in his 2nd year of uni playing video games and blazing it up daily to a guy who lives on the couch in the living room of his friends house, blazing it up, not looking for a job still playing FUCKING DOTA. I've got one pillow and a duvet that was lent to me by one of the girls in the house, the duvet was a Bambi duvet. I've been at this house staying on his couch doing the same thing everyday since October. I've had money occasionally. Did I get another pillow and a duvet to match? Nah dude I've been sleeping under a bambi duvet with one pillow for the last 7 months. She's visited about 3 times, last time she did was in February, I think the living room + bambi duvet + no job + the friend I was living with is not exactly someone she'd hang around with situation kinda fucked with her in a major way. I realised this and recommended that we no longer stay in 'mine' and that I visit her or we get an AirBnB, which was a swell idea really. 

Back to the problem with my lying. I've now come clean to my Dad right? Wrong I lied and told him that I'd failed but it's okay because he doesn't have to pay for university next year because I've been told I can get help from the Gov to pay. This was a lie I told to buy me time. The rules are that I've got to live here 5 years before even going to uni to apply for assistance, I've lived there for 3 all while at uni. I lied to my girlfriend, I told her my Dad new he was paying for university. 

This is the lie that broke her. I got drunk one night we were meeting up in this town, we'd gone clubbing with friends and I got into an argument with her about something really fucking dumb. It escalated into me drunkenly bashing her for making me feel awkward and stupid things like that. One particular thing I was set on was that we hadn't seen each other for about a month and when I came through the door she greeted me so unenthusiastically that it made me feel bad, worse is that I sat down next to her and she was being super one wordy and convos were going nowhere. It escalated more and soon enough we got on the topic of why I've not done shit this whole year, even though she's given me loads of chances to. I told her that I've been dealing with the fear of not returning to uni next year- shit. Cats out the bag, 'Why wouldn't you be finishing next year, what?'.

I think that was the final nail in the trust coffin. After that we went back to hers, I apologised, she did too. Then when I got 'home' we ended up having a discussion over what's happened to get us to this point where we argue so much about stupid shit. That's always been my strong point, I keep my emotions under the skin so that there can't be any conflict. You said something that annoyed me? Chilll man, don't bring it up you'll forget about it. It's not so easy with alcohol. Nothing I can say at this point can take back what my actions over these last 3 years, but this last year in particular I was given every opportunity to fix up look sharp. I threw it all away. 

We went on a break, it was alright, just don't talk as much and give me time to sort myself out. One day I get a message and she say's she feels trapped and that she wants my permission to open the relationship up, but it wasn't a free pass to bang everyone; more of a mental pass I guess. She went on two nights out after this and honestly they were the most painful nights of my life, I'd rather fail uni 10 times in a row than experience those nights again. I let her know how hurt I felt because of all this, she understood. A few days later we're arguing again. We agree to meet up and spend the night together, it was a nice time. We're still on a break so there's no hugging and kissing and all that but we still planned on sharing a bed together. Watched a film, had some pizza. She says she's tired but we haven't talked about us at all so I asked if she had anything to say, to which she replied No. So I said ""it's okay just listen then"". 

I told her how I was feeling and apologies for the past year, I know all the mistakes I've made and I know what I've got to do to fix it. I've hurt you badly and I want to do everything I can to remedy that because you really have changed my life, I can't imagine it without you at the moment. I want to make this work so bad and I'm willing to go through more mental torture if I have to just to keep us alive. I truly did think she felt the same way about me too. The key word is DID. You can only ask someone to put themselves through mental torture a couple times before they think to themselves 'Why am I doing this to myself'. 

She's got no respect for me anymore, she loves the idea of me so much and it's hurtful cause she says it a lot still, at this point she's deciding whether on not to end the relationship. Throughout the break she was so cold and unrelenting to get the point across that I'd done something unforgivable, but it also felt in a way that the 2.5 great years we've had meant nothing. I questioned her so much about that, how she can be so blasé about something like this. She assured me that it's a hard decision to make and that she did in fact love me very much, but that I'd changed and let her down so much that I was holding her back so she needed to make a decision. I pleaded with her to keep the break going for longer and to see whether she can love me again soon if I started acting rather than talking. Nothing I've said has convinced her. The other day I pushed her too far and even though the break was meant to be going on till the end of the month we reached a conclusion that nothing I could say or even do at the moment can convince her that we need to stay together, instead we should end it and see where we are in a year. Though we were perfect at the time, all of my mistakes and failures put so much strain on her image of me that she no longer looks at me the same. This is all even more painful because she keeps reblogging things along the lines of the title 'Perfect guy, wrong time' 'I want to be able to tell you it's going to be okay, but we both know it can't be true' just shit like that man. I've let this person who had such a high opinion of me down. The really shitty thing was in the 2 weeks running up to us meeting and having that bad argument, we were talking as if we couldn't wait to get back together and bang each others brains out, it was strange like we were almost rabid for each other. So I'm still riding that high of her wanting me badly and she even admitted that she wasn't just stringing me on, she was super hot for me. Too bad we both got too drunk and the way she acted at the start of the night made me sabotage the rest of it. 

I'm rambling now. I'm just so sad and lost, I'm full of so many regrets at 21 and I've smoked so much weed I feel I don't even know who I am anymore. I can't stop this nagging sensation that I need to know what she's doing or that I need to know how she's feeling. She wants to break up and she's told me it's happening, I know there's nothing I can say anymore to stop this from happening. 

We're still going to be friends, I'm fully aware that's a cliche. We've been talking since she gave me the last of my stuff (on Monday, we watched Solo). It feels healthy that it didn't end with us saying we never want to talk to each other again, it feels healthy we're still talking and it almost feels like this is the right thing to do. 

But I'm still in love and I want to fix my life for her. She doesn't want me to fix my life for her, even though she loved me more than anything for 2/3 years I've destroyed those feelings and she doesn't want a fairytale anymore I guess. 

I've gotta fix my life and then ask her if she wants me back, but I also feel like I kinda don't want to fix it alone. Shit idk what I'm trying to say and if you've read this whole thing I applaud you. I hate myself, I hate it all, I just want to scream into my own ears until I'm deaf. We were so perfect and I thought I could push the relationship to it's limits and now I'm stood here after having ripped it to shreds, with my head in my hands. "

I'm a fourth-year comp sci maj in YorkU. I didn't know what the 2018 Google Fall internship process would be like going in so I decided to share with you. I cannot share the exact questions but that really doesn't matter. You should focus on the general material anyway. Note: You have to choose one of C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python

Google Fall 2018 SE internship

Applied in late April.

May 2: an invitation to do a ""snapshot""
one is a multiple choice about your work behaviour.
second is a 90 minute 2-question coding test.

First question is always a string manipulation question.
Second question is at least one of {graph, tree, dynamic programming, NP-problems}.

(I passed.)

May 16: open-ended questions about what you know and what you want to do.

May 29: Double phone interview. The interviews are 45 minutes each (one 40-min question). There is exactly a 15-minute break between the interviews. And you use Google Doc to write your code. They always ask one random question to test your knowledge.

I didn't do well on one of them because the interviewer was using a terrible quality phone so I freaked out. It didn't help that he was talking to another person in the middle of the interview. I only did the recursion answer but they wanted the perfect dynamic programming answer (memo-ization is thus the missing part) so I got rejected. Really disappointed since the questions were easy :'(

Most of the material comes from EECS 2011 and EECS3101 though they are not enough so you have to independently study the remaining material. I'm going to apply again in 6 months now that I'm confident. Good luck everyone."

8rd38j,2,2018-06-15,Mentor negative criticism,IntershipHelp1111,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8rd38j/mentor_negative_criticism/,"Hello all, this happened today and I feel still in shock as if I was heartbroken.. 

So, I'm in my early twenties and doing an internship in a scientific field in a research center. 

The project I'm working on is admittedly complex and the solution is unknown. And the agreement is: I advance the project during the internship and if all goes well( project gets to a good point) then they'll keep me in order to complete my degree while working for them. 
I've been working for one month and a half and one third of time passed. 

My mentor is not my direct manager but he's the one following me technically: let's name him John. 

The technology used by this research center was completely unknown to me and both John and my manager knew it and therefore foreseen 20% of John's time as training and mentoring for me, John himself said during the interview that best case scenario it will take me 2 months of training to get used to the environment. 

It's my first ""real"" job and I was so excited at the beginning... 
The first 3 weeks John came to my office twice a day to teach me things and give me exercises to do, everything smooth and fine so far. He kept saying each time ""I know I'm giving you a lot of information each time I come to see you but time is little and we need to get fast to a point where you can work at your own and advance the real project"". 

The database of the company is a big mess and the technology I'm using doesn't have any resources online therefore I chat with John on Skype when I have a question, sometimes even for brainstorming. 

2 weeks ago I found a table on the database with a strange property and I asked John what it was. He answered he didn't know and asked me to investigate. 
As there are no documentation on this database, it took me half day of joining and filtering just to find out that it's a non coherent obsolete property. After telling him, he told me it took him 5 minutes to realise that but that was good training for me and that next time it will take me less time, I have to keep working hard. 

Last week John came to see me in my office only twice and one day, I thought I found a solution and I tried to explaining him by chat what I just discovered instead of thinking it through and writing a proper email (I then realised it was not working and said sorry). He then wrote an email to me and my manager saying that from now on I have to write my questions/thoughts by email and to keep chat only for small fast questions. 

I didn't really understand why he ccd my manager as he could have simply said ""I don't have time to understand your brainstorming on Skype, do it yourself then come up with your questions by email""... 

Finally, we come to today.. 
After lunch he asked me to speak with him privately: he stated that I am sometimes too slow, I keep digging too much and obstinate myself on something while I have to straight realise what is useful and what isn't. He also said that sometimes I ask questions multiple times ( today I asked him a question that he already answered 2 weeks ago, on the difference between two databases that I never used).  
He continued by saying that the two months left are too little and it's unlikely to have a concrete project to show at the end and therefore if that's the case than they won't be able to keep me later. 

When I asked what am I supposed to do if this is nearly impossible, he straight away denied saying so and tried to guide the perspectives in a more optimistic way: I have to do my best and come up with a solution that himself didn't find.. 

I felt too much criticised, I know criticism matures a person but I feel it was too harsh. Was he trying implicitly to motivate?  Was he trying to tell me I'm not worth keeping? 

I took that criticism personally and my life will probably suck for the next 2 months. 

Thank you a lot for who reeds this and gives me his point of view. Don't hesitate to ask clarifications..

Truthfully, I almost denied it since I told them I wanted to do part time during the summer and they kept trying to pressure me into doing full time during the interview(even though they advertised it as part time). I have another interview for a different administrative assistant part time next week, so if they offer me a position as well and it suits better I will most likely go there instead.

But for now, could anyone kind of explain to me what I could expect out of this accountant assistant position? The CFO explained it during the interview, but I couldn't follow most of it truthfully. From what I understand, I think I will just be entering a lot of paperwork(bills) into a computer?"

8rffnj,2,2018-06-15,"My [25 F] internship supervisor [40ish F] is making my life hell, and I feel powerless to change the situation.",10reportslater,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8rffnj/my_25_f_internship_supervisor_40ish_f_is_making/,"So I am in the 20th week of an unpaid, 22 week internship at a large government organisation, as part of a postgrad degree (7 out of 8th year of degree overall). There are a number of strict requirements to pass the internship including writing 20 comprehensive reports, and daily supervision.

The supervisor in this role is pretty much the 'gate keeper' for any progress. Styles of supervision vary, but my supervisor (let's call her Sandra) likes to closely check every piece of information  I work on. There is a lot of client work, and Sandra requires me to consult with her before every session, phone call, and e-mail. Basically, Sandra is making my life hell. There are a number of issues. The most significant issue at the moment is that she reads each of reports up to 8 times. Each read takes about 5-6 hours for her, as she goes through the report with a fine-tooth comb. Each time I get the report back there are many comments, which take me hours to go through. As a result, she has only signed 6 of the required 20, with 2 weeks to go.

Another issue is that I have no working relationship with Sandra. She will talk at me for the majority of our sessions, like a lecture. The majority of the time, it's describing why my thoughts and conclusions are incorrect, and why hers are correct. I have tried to propose some ideas and alternative ways of thinking, but they quickly end up in a smouldering pile of ash. There was one situation where we drove home from a client's premises together, and she spent the 20-minute drive explaining to me all the things I did wrong in the session. It felt like I was being tortured. This has had a huge impact on my confidence/self-esteem. It is disappointing at this stage in my degree, as I have never failed a course or evaluation. I'm having trouble feeling any joy/pleasure day to day, and feel very bleak about the future. I think I probably have depression at the moment.

I decided last week that I needed to confront the issue of the multiple drafts specifically. I proposed a plan to get the drafts down to 3, including me reading over them myself multiple times before sending, sitting down and talking through each comment of the first draft, and just trying harder overall to 'get it right'.  I added that it is affecting my confidence and I do not feel that I will get everything done in time. Sandra's response was that 7-8 drafts is 'normal' (I have spoken to colleagues, this is not true) and then she reiterated all the individual things I have gotten wrong in the past. So, placing the blame in my hands, to just 'do better'. She proposed no solutions. I have tried to understand why she is the way she is, and I think she is just pedantic/perfectionistic and cannot handle being wrong. I want to acknowledge Sandra can be a nice, caring person, and has helped me a lot.

There have been prior cases where a student has had a difficult time with a different supervisor, raised the issues, and long story short, ended up being kicked out of the program. I spoke with a colleague, Kim (not real name) who previously had Sandra; Kim told me that she would sit and cry during supervision, and the supervision seemed to 'like to make her cry'. Kim had to extend the internship for a month, considering abandoning our field of study altogether. I spoke to some colleagues more about what to do, and they have basically said; don't do anything, I am powerless, and any further attempts to address the issues will risk me being kicked out of the internship.

Guys, should I just suck it up and get through the internship? While I officially have 2 weeks left, I do not actually know how long I will have to stay, to complete everything. It now looks like I may need to stay another 6 weeks. I want to emphasise, this is all unpaid, I have no ongoing income at the moment. I have a supportive partner, and some savings. I'm waiting to start a job, but when the internship finishes. Thank you heaps for reading.

**TLDR; My supervisor is pedantic and stubborn, and is causing me to fall behind in my unpaid internship. I tried to address the issue, with no resolution. I may need to extent my unpaid internship up to 6 weeks and I already think I have depression.**"

8rft02,5,2018-06-15,Already considering possibility of residency swap (Surgery to Radiology),MrAndersonOB,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/8rft02/already_considering_possibility_of_residency_swap/,"Hey everyone. Just wanted to vent about my situation a little bit and hopefully hear some stories about any of yall that are/were in a similar state prior to starting internship.

It was a very difficult decision for me to settle on applying to surgery. I was really torn between radiology and surgery, even though I hadn't had a ton of exposure to either yet (I tried to get exposure to lots of different specialties during 3rd year, instead of honing in one or two and going in depth). My last rotation of 3rd year was surgery, and I had a good time and could picture myself being in the residents shoes.

What I liked the most about surgery was that it was hands on (and I had been told that I had good hands and should think about surgery, which of course gave me that warm fuzzy feeling inside), I could stay in touch with all of medicine as opposed to just honing in on one specific organ system or process, I would have the ability to make a large, immediate impact in my patients lives, and even though it shouldn't have been a big factor for me, I want to perform some sort of medical mission work in the future, and radiology didn't really seem consistent with that.  I always thought it was strange that people said ""don't go into surgery unless you can't see yourself anywhere else"", because that for me was not the case.  I could see myself doing a lot of things, but surgery seemed like it could keep me engaged for a whole career, instead of sitting in front of a computer all day.

After applying, I started having thoughts in the back of my head about whether or not I made the right decision fairly quickly. I can remember even during interviews thinking ""is this really what I want to do?""  Nevertheless, I was locked in at that point so I had nowhere to go but forward.  I have tried to keep all of the reasons that I chose surgery in my head often, but it seems like all that I can think about as intern year is approaching are the things that I won't like about it.  I love my free time and don't want my kids to think I'm never there, I am a pretty introverted person, so presenting on rounds and consults are always anxiety invoking for me (I hope that once I am doing it every day, that I will get used to it and learn to like it once I know what I'm doing?)

For reasons that I alluded to, but don't want to go into any further because this post is already pretty long, I am worried that I may have picked the wrong specialty.  Sitting in front of a computer all day is sounding pretty good for a person of my personality, instead of the path that I picked.  I know that it will take a few months of actually being an intern before I should act at all on these feelings, because I may have a complete 180 and love it once I'm in, but I also know that I would need to start getting LORs early for applications if I was to decide thats what I want to do.

I'm sorry this ended up so long, but theres a lot going around in my head about this decision.  If anyone can relate to my situation at all, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

TL;DR: Applied surgery over rads, but have been having second thoughts for months.  About to start intern year and full of anxiety about whether to try resident swap/apply for rads R2.

\-

\-

1 Month Update:  Still having strong feelings of switching. At times, I enjoy surgery, especially when I make important decisions and come up with plans that the attending agrees with, but on the whole, it is really hard for me to picture myself in the attending's shoes.  It just doesn't feel like this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I am interested in the theoretical side of surgery, like what procedures would you do in certain situations, but not always in the performance of them.  I can't speak from much experience yet though, of course.  Whenever we enter the reading room, I find myself feeling jealous of the radiology residents, wishing I could be where they are.  Maybe just a case of the grass is always greener, who knows..."
8rg3rp,1,2018-06-15,Really need some financial advice for my mom,heatedcanine,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8rg3rp/really_need_some_financial_advice_for_my_mom/,"Hello!

My mom is having some trouble making ends meet.

She is 49 but her retirement account is very, very lean due to my dad gambling it away on stock options (ouch). He also bought a house in Florida under her name but hasn't been paying mortgage, so her credit score is really bad.

She works in the textile industry in which job openings are rare, making it hard for her to transfer to an area with a lower cost of living. I mention this because her company is in NYC, an area that is stupidly expensive. She currently lives with a family friend rent-free but this is a temporary solution at best (1-2 years maybe).

Her gross pay is $2600 every 2 weeks ($70k/yr), but after taxes and putting as much as she can into her 401(k) she only has about $1100 left over, so $2200 a month.

Other info: No car or house, except for the mortgage on the Florida house she can't afford. She's divorced, has 2 kids that are both 19, with me being 2 years into college and my sister having dropped out and working full time. Thankfully, I'm able to pay for my own tuition immediately due to generous financial aid and summer internships and my sister is able to take out loans for only 2 years of college. I'm not exactly sure where my dad is, ~~but I believe he moved back to China (both my parents are Chinese immigrants) and is being supported by his girlfriend's (?) family.~~ he mostly stays in the Florida house.

Any advice would be highly appreciated! Right now, it seems like I'll be supporting her financially for the rest of her life, which is a bit of a bleak outlook. 

Thanks!"

I have some non-accounting related job experience and volunteer work. My GPA at university is 4.0 and my GPA at community college was 3.75. However, I don't have any internship experience or related job experience. My understanding is that going into senior year, students should be applying for full-time positions. But with my lack of experience and internships, I doubt that any company would hire me full-time. Should I delay my graduation a semester and attempt to apply for internship positions for the next career fair and then attempt to find a full-time position the year after?

My state college has B4, national and regional firms for meet the firms and I'll be CPA eligible regardless if I delay graduation."

**Manafortnight or Two in Jail**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A federal judge in Washington, D.C. sent President Trump’s former campaign chairman [Paul Manafort to jail](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/judge-sends-paul-manafort-to-jail-pending-trial/index.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** after investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller caught him [tampering with witnesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/paul-manafort-mueller-witness-tampering.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). It’s the little things.                                            
              
**Trump [bemoaned](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1007679422865006593) Manafort’s “tough sentence,” but it’s not a sentence.** (Guess this means Trump doesn’t understand either usage of the word “sentence.”) Manafort was awaiting trial on supervised release. The judge revoked his bail because he used his freedom to obstruct justice. Now he will await trial in a jail cell. We’re not sad about that!                                
               
**This is perilous for Trump, and good for those of us interested in the pursuit of justice,** because it creates new and enormous pressure on Manafort to cop a plea and cooperate with Mueller’s collusion investigation. This means we are very close to the Flynn, Cohen, Manafort “When I Flip, You Flip, We Flip” parody music video.       
                   
**Manafort is the only American Mueller has accused of crimes to plead not guilty.** Either because he fears retaliation, or because he anticipates a pardon, or because of a combination of the two, the threat of *conviction* hasn’t fazed Manafort at all. He already stands to spend the rest of his life in prison, so Mueller can’t use new charges as further leverage. But spending time in a jail cell, knowing he might never get out again, is just the sort of development that might focus his mind. That, or Vladimir Putin is already helping him dig his way out of there.                         
            
**Which is probably why Rudy Giuliani reacted to the news by [dangling the possibility of a presidential pardon](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-rudy-muller-pardons-trump-manafort-20180615-story.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) before him.** Maybe Rudes doesn’t realize Mueller can see him obstructing justice even when he does it through a New York tabloid reporter.

- **Admiring words for murderous dictator [Kim Jong Un](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un/index.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** “He speaks and his people sit up at attention.

**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**New reports say senior EPA staff [regularly felt pressured](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-aides.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) by administrator Scott Pruitt into helping him with his personal matters,** including calling an executive to get him Rose Bowl tickets and helping his daughter get a White House internship. They also say he wasn’t shy about using his position for personal gain, reaching out to a Virginia politician to get his daughter into law school. These aides say they felt like “foot soldiers” in Pruitt’s efforts to match the lifestyles of wealthier cabinet secretaries, because he’s an entitled little shit and corrupt as hell. Also, imagine being jealous of Wilbur Ross and Steve Mnuchin. Who knew anyone could be more embarrassing than Paul Ryan?                                    
               
**The Trump administration [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/us-china-tariffs-trade.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) it will move forward with tariffs on an additional $16 billion worth of Chinese goods,** bringing the total up to $50 billion worth of their products. China has [vowed to retaliate](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-hits-back-list-2018-6?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and called “all countries to take joint action, resolutely put an end to this outdated and regressive behavior, and firmly defend the common interests of mankind.” In other words, the kind of stuff our government said before Trump came along.                                           
 
**Democrats have decided to hold their [next convention in July 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/dnc-2020-convention-dates/index.html?utm_term=image&amp;sr=twCNNp061518dnc-2020-convention-dates1202PMStory&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2018-06-15T16%3A19%3A42&amp;CNNPolitics=Tw),** the earliest dates in more than two decades, in part because they’re anticipating an intense and crowded primary field, and now all their problems are solved and all that work Favreau put into his forthcoming podcast was for nothing. We look forward to flipping out about all the unintended consequences of this move in the months to come.

8rjeu3,1,2018-06-16,Try my luck with a business or work as an intern?,theredditornl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8rjeu3/try_my_luck_with_a_business_or_work_as_an_intern/,"I'm gonna try to keep it as short as possible. I just turned 21 years, I'm a second year student studying Computer Engineering. I have no debt and I currently have a job that pays the minimum wage in my country for 8h (I work around 15 hours per week, maybe 20 if it's a busy week). I was able to keep up the job and university at the same time.
In the summer of 2017 I made a website with a friend as an investor, but after creating the engine and launching the website he decided that he is not willing to invest that much (around 5000$). The website was able to produce some money, but it didn't have the cash flow required. 

For this summer I have 2 options, to work my current job and to improve and find funds for my website (which may or may not work) or go for a full time internship as a programmer plus holding my current job.
Do you think it is worth the risk financially to improve and to establish the website as a business? Or will it be just a waste of time and I should move on and focus on learning and having a stable position?

Thank you!"

8rl58r,3308,2018-06-16,My boyfriend [21 M] ditched me [20 F] to spend time with the boys right after my father passed,Skylar1023,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8rl58r/my_boyfriend_21_m_ditched_me_20_f_to_spend_time/,"My Dad unexpectedly passed away a month ago and I was the one to unfortunately find him dead, but that isn’t what this post is about. My boyfriend and I have been together for a bit less than 3 years. He has a full time internship  so I don’t get to spend a lot of time with him. 

Yesterday afternoon, I asked him what his plans were. He said nothing. I suggested that when he is off from work, him, his brother, and I should go bowling or to a movie. I figured including his brother who my boyfriend is super close with would make him happy. He said that he would like to do that and would contact me after he gets done with work. I based my plans around this and didn’t make plans with anyone else. 

About an hour or two after he gets off of work, he texted me that he is drinking with some guy friends and can’t come see me. I am surprised he would say this because I told him in advance this weekend I really need him because it’s my first Father’s Day without my father. I told him that he should have just not made plans with me in the first place if he wanted to hang out with the boys. He didn’t respond even though he read these texts. I just couldn’t imagine doing this to him if he was in my situation. In his mind, he thinks that I don’t want him to hang out with his guy friends, which isn’t the case. I just think that he should stick to his original plans and maybe be a little more empathetic to what I have been going through. Also for context, this isn’t the first time this has happened. Even a week after my Dad passed, he ditched me for his friends when I needed him most. I talked to him about it then. He didn’t think it was a big deal, but apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again, but here we are.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the really kind comments and especially those who are dealing with a loss of your own. It’s really difficult no matter how long it’s been so know that my heart with you too. Just to update on the situation, I still haven’t heard anything back from my boyfriend. I haven’t texted him since. I’ve been spending time with family instead. I don’t know what I was looking for when I wrote this post. My boyfriend always tells me that I overact so it’s hard for me to tell if my frustration is valid or not. I have realized that what my boyfriend did was not okay and I have been thinking a lot about how I want to handle this. I do really appreciate all the love and quotes and beautiful advice I’ve gotten. It was so unexpected, but I am very grateful. I am going to try to respond to some comments as soon as I can. Xx

Edit 2: I’m still trying to respond to people. I’ve spent Father’s Day with my Dad’s family. It’s been hard but the pain is tolerable. I’ve had a lot of friends reach out to me to tell me they are thinking of me and asking how I am doing. I haven’t heard a single word from my boyfriend. I’m not too surprised but it really solidified what everyone is saying. 

TLDR; my boyfriend ignored our plans to hang out with his friends"
8rm5zn,1,2018-06-16,[b4F] Overwatch: Harem Edition,KingRodent,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8rm5zn/b4f_overwatch_harem_edition/,"**I AM OVER 18 YEARS OF AGE AND AM SEEKING ANOTHER OF OVER 18 YEARS OF AGE FOR A FANTASY ROLEPLAY**

————————————————

*Brian blinked the sleep from his eyes, the wailing buzz of the alarm clock holding him from his sleep without warning. Groggily, he reached over to the bedside table and hit the button to shut it off. He didn’t need the snooze button. He could lay in bed for a few minutes without falling back asleep. Another look around the room reminded him of his unique position, a boon granted from God himself. The pale blue walls were a little more familiar today than they were the day before; where he was used to posters of bands and video games, instead there were paintings and whimsically written phrases. The typical mess of collectibles and homework on the dressers were now replaced with photographs, framed and positioned alongside each other. These pictures, of course, weren’t of him, but rather of two grown women by the name of Lena and Emily Oxton— the later of which slept peacefully beside him, adorned by nothing but leggings and a g-string. He could hear noises from the kitchen; Lena was most likely making coffee. And while he was loathe to leave Emily in the bed by herself, it was time to get ready for work.*

——————————————

If you know nothing about Overwatch lore and need a refresher about everybody mentioned in this post: Brian is the boy in the blue hoodie in the trailer, Lena Oxton is Tracer, and Emily Oxton is Tracer’s girlfriend– in this case, she’s her wife.

I’ll be playing the role of Brian. In my imagining of this prompt, Overwatch headquarters has been rebuilt and the team has been called to action once more. Also in this prompt: Tracer and her wife are massive pedophiles (or at least have a thing for young men.)! After the events of the museum robbery, Tracer and Brian crossed paths a few more times, finally electing to swap numbers after the umpteenth time. Not long after the two shagged; between that latex-covered butt and Tracer’s rampant desire for young boy cock, it was only a matter of time.

At the present moment all three parties are located in Bern, Switzerland, living in an apartment just outside of Overwatch headquarters. Lena and Emily have relocated from London due to Overwatch’s reassembly, and Brian is abroad from America under the guise of an internship with Overwatch– technically not a lie, but certainly not the whole truth either.

———————————————

My primary goal for this post is to build a harem of Overwatch’s finest, with Tracer and Emily as my ‘starter girls.’ To them, I’m their well-loved boytoy; all I need is to ask, and every one of my needs is sated (though occasionally with a chiding remark if my desire is especially kinky, or we’re in a public place). This goes vice-versa as well, and if you want to be done a certain way, I’m more than happy to play the bashful, eager-to-please hormonal teenager.


Although I have an excessive amount of kinks, my favorites are pregnancy/impreg, casual sex, public sex, cosplay, petplay, raceplay, drugs, beast, watersports, light/heavy bondage, sadomasochism, ageplay, willing abuse, tattoos, body writing, piercings and various others I’m probably not thinking of at the moment.


Typically I have no limits, but I’d like for this prompt to be fairly light-hearted, so I’d like to avoid scat, snuff, and gore. Blood is one hundred percent okay, so long as we aren’t shanking each other to make it, and I don’t mind bruises and black eyes so long as the characters specifically ask to be beaten in such a way.


I also play via KIK and Discord if chat or messages doesn’t work for you. My only requirement is that you understand I’m human and at certain times A.) am not horny, and B.) must attend work. In exchange, I will understand the same about you. Life happens, etcetera, etcetera.


I look forward to orange envelopes!"
8rmiz6,18,2018-06-16,I feel trapped,amneedinhelp,mypartneristrans,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/8rmiz6/i_feel_trapped/,"I posted here a little while ago with something else, but things seem to have gotten worse, at least for me. This is a lot of text, but I need to get it out, TL;DR at the bottom if it helps to organize this mess.

My SO of about 5.5 years came out to me as trans a little over 4 weeks ago (ftm, but I'm using ""he"" because he doesn't want to use ""she"" until he feels more like a woman). I was fairly overwhelmed with uncertainty when he came out, but that feeling, among others, has intensified to the point where I feel trapped. 

He came out to me about three days before we left for a five-week trip across Europe. I planned most of this trip during our last semester of college. At one point in the semester, we both had full-time jobs we were supposed to start after the trip. My job would pay well for an entry-level job, but I would have to move to random locations in the USA. His would pay about 2/3 of mine, but he was told he could work remote and he had already worked there for three years as an intern. We also had plans to get married in November, on our dating anniversary since that date was already special to us.

It started with his job. Sometime during the semester, his boss said he could only guarantee remote work if he worked on site as a fill time employee for 9 months. Then his job, plus the jobs of other interns were cut from the budget, and the salary of two others would be halved. So now he doesn't have a job anymore and doesn't have a solid plan for one. He wants to try being a freelance web developer, but has no idea how.

Then the semester got rough. We commuted to classes together, so we thought it would make the most logistical sense if we were on the same capstone project. Except he's a lot better at programming and web development than I am, so he often irritated at me being a slower and not contributing as much. This, among a lot of other school-related stresses caused us to drift apart. We had a lot of arguments that semester where I felt inferior and I wasn't smart enough for him.

So as I'm planning this trip that his parents very generously helped fund, I'm focusing on what would make us happy and feel close again. We decided not to take laptops to focus more on each other, only our phones and a tablet. I poured hours into this trip and still barely got our lodging and travel all booked. He wasn't as familiar with planning things like this, so it would be more efficient if I did most of the work, and at the time I was mostly ok with it.

Then we're getting ready to go on our trip. It's just a few days before we go, when he tells me he has realized that he is meant to be a woman. He was excited, saying it just clicked when he realized he could come out as trans, something he had never considered as a kid raised in small town midwest USA. I was floored. It seemed so random. He was almost anti-feminine in how he acted. He even used to be really uncomfortable with the LGBT+ community in general, but slowly got over that. So it was a shock for me, and those few days before we left felt like hell. But, the night before we left, I said I'd support him no matter what and would do my best to stick with it. 

However, my relationship felt shaken. I fell in love with a fairly masculine man that can no longer present and act like a masculine man. I have no idea who he'll be as a woman. I have no idea if he'll still find me attractive, if our families will accept him (or potentially us), etc. It felt like my relationship was a sturdy rock that I could lean on in tough times, and that rock turned to sand in the uncertainty. But we still had this trip. I thought I could do it, make the most of it, especially if we focused on rebuilding the relationship after this semester and tried to feel close again. But keeping the focus off the uncertainty of his transition was hard. We spent more than a few hours with me just crying because it felt like our relationship took a massive turn for the unknown. Because of that, I decide that getting married now is probably not a good idea. Even though it was my decision, I'm sad that's gone.

Then I found out where my job would be sending me: small Midwestern town about 3.5 hours south of my SO's hometown. It's not near anything, it doesn't seem to have any real LGBT community, and it doesn't even have a real airport. Even if he wasn't planning to transition, I would *not* want to live there. That was last night, and I'm still in Europe. 

I think I lost it from there. I know if a lot of positives that can come out of this, but I just can't seem to focus on them. I feel like absolute shit. I'm just crying at everything and I can't seem to hold it together. I have one person I could possibly confide in, but they're 8 hours behind me and at an important event so I don't want to burden them. I can't tell my family, who keep saying that town is going to be nice, that would out my SO. I can't tell my closest friends because that would out him as well, and they're 6-9 hours behind.

I've been stuck in countries that are already a bit overwhelming for me with nobody but my SO, and it's too much. I've only got 6 nights left but I'm still looking up flights to take me home. It feels like my world melted before my eyes and there's nothing I can do. It might all turn out fine or better, but I feel like I'm in shock. I didn't eat dinner and I'm hungry as hell, but im so emotionally frazzled that I can't eat without crying. And that was when I tried to eat a single cookie. My SO says he doesn't know what to do with me and it's getting too much for him but it just makes me cry harder.

I'm scared over the uncertainty, guilty and shameful about not being 100% on board with it, and angry that he told me when he did. He admitted that he told me as soon as he thought about it without looking up anything about how to approach a long term partner. It feels like he didnt consider that it might be too much for me to handle before a trip like this. It also feels like he didn't consider how much effort I put into this trip to make us feel close again. I'm overwhelmed by everything and I'm frequently staring at nothing and spacing out. I feel like I can't get close to him again because I'm too busy trying to handle myself. He says he's never seen me like this before, and I have no idea what to do. I feel lost and trapped.

I can reach out to a therapist when I get back, but two weeks after being home, I travel to the other side of the US for training, then I move to the Midwest to start work.

It helped to get this out since I don't have anywhere else besides my SO to go right now, so thanks if you read it. I know my situation could be a lot worse, but it's the least stable I've felt since leaving an abusive parent and I'm having a hard time coping and enjoying this once-in-a-lifetime trip. Any thoughts, advice or concerns are appreciated.

**TL;DR:** My SO came out as trans just before a 5-week vacation abroad. That plus a series of other not so great events has me feeling overwhelmed and trapped. My SO is trying to help, but it seems like we can't get close. I don't have the support to make it emotionally.

Where I almost drove off the road. My brain was also telling me to drive off the road which made me terrified. I now can drive about 500 yards and have to turn back. Can only ride in a car for maybe 5 miles. I am agoraphobic. I have an internship but my second shift I got a panic attack from an elevator and haven’t been back (one of the best companies in the world). All I do is think about what has happened in my past. I’ve been in my room the past year just watching tv. I’m scared to go walking or something because I feel like I’ll get a panic attack. I don’t even think I really have anxiety all that much anymore but I had it so bad for so long that I’ll never get over this. My thoughts 24/7 is you got a panic attack once in this situation it is going to happen again. Which I’ve had one in almost all situations."

8rpa96,0,2018-06-17,I don't want my miserable adolescence to be a scar I carry with me for the rest of my life.,IveGotIssues9918,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8rpa96/i_dont_want_my_miserable_adolescence_to_be_a_scar/,"June 16th, 2018. About 11 PM. I've been home for ten days now, with almost nothing accomplished. As usual, I'm procrastinating. I need to find a summer internship soon, but most of the ones through the program I was accepted to must be full by now. I've been ignoring most of the e-mails. Advance registration for college classes starts in two days, and I have yet to create a mock schedule. Graduation is in nine days, and I have no idea who's going to be able to come (there's a limit of four guests per graduate? I think? Idk, I haven't been to high school physically in ten days- I slept through my last day of classes, for God's sake- and mentally in about two and a half months). I wasted most of my day on YouTube and Reddit, and now I'm checking my Snapchat. I see on the story of an acquaintance from middle school that she's at prom. I check the story of a new friend (can I call her a friend yet?) from college. She's at prom too. She has a stretch limo with about 12 people. They're all dressed up and hyped up- just as I'd imagined myself and my vast circle of acquaintances from sophomore year would be on our prom night. My dress would look like Tiana's from Princess and the Frog. We'd get a party bus. Afterwards, we'd rent a hotel room and trash it, or maybe go to Six Flags the next day.

My prom was nine days ago. I didn't go.

If you'd told me that six months ago, I would've cried my eyes out. Back then, I was spending my free periods scrolling through prom dress sites. My aunt took me to a bridal boutique to look for my dress. I finally overcame fear of rejection and asked my friends if I could be in their limo. We had a group of about nine people, and I was so excited. I'd just gained admission to one of the best universities in the country. I had it all planned out- get straight A's second semester, enjoy prom and graduation, get a fun internship and make money, then go to college and crush it. But two and a half months ago, the day after I bought my prom dress, my ""friends"" told me they didn't want me in their limo. I'd feared this forever. Since freshman year, I hung out on the fringe of this group- a group that was constantly changing due to the usual dramatics of high school. I never knew what was going on. I never got invited anywhere. They talked about their plans in front of me as if I didn't exist. But in these last few months, I'd almost felt like I belonged. Old ""insecurities"" cropped up when they made a mean joke about me or didn't include me in their plans, sure, but that was just my ""social anxiety"". 

It wasn't ""anxiety"". These people were *NEVER* my friends. I should've accepted that three years ago. But after being bullied and excluded in late elementary and middle school, I was used to my ""friendships"" being one-sided, manipulative, and often abusive. I thought this was all I deserved. That day, as I sat crying in the school bathroom wishing I could die and leave this cruel world behind, was when I realized that it wasn't.

So I stopped taking it. I didn't talk about the ""situation"" with them even though they wanted me to. I sat in class alone, left the building to get lunch, walked through the halls seldom saying ""hi"" to people I knew. I'd show them that I didn't need them. I wasn't the awkward, dumb, boring, ugly prude they and countless others before them made of me. I was beautiful, brilliant, interesting and fun all on my own, and I didn't need their conditional, backhanded validation to prove that.

Three days after my worst nightmares came true, I joined the group chat for my graduating class at university. For the next two weeks or so, my phone was a natural extension of my arm. We talked about everything from our Rice Purity scores to the cringeworthy poems we wrote as kids to whether the combination of victim and asshole was 'asstim' or 'victole'. I was four months late, but my newfound self-respect spurred me on, and I found myself gaining an inexplicable notoriety. My jokes are funny? My experiences are relatable? You private messaged me because you want to be friends?

A few weeks later, I was on campus for the admitted students event. I didn't attach myself to the first people I met like I tend to (although my first in-person acquaintance from that day is the one whose prom Snapchats inspired this post), but rather ""drifted"" and allowed myself to meet different people. It wasn't completely smooth- I've never sent so many ""where are you?"" texts in my life- but the social interactions weren't anxiety-ridden, but fun, and the alone moments weren't painful, but full of possibility. I was the person everyone wanted to meet. When I got home and realized I had to go back to high school, I started bawling.

The week after, me and two other girls who were also ditched by their ""friends"" confided in each other about their plight. One of them suggested we all go to prom together. I said sure, I'd invite my friends who graduated last year, and we'd reclaim that night. But it just... didn't happen. As the day got closer, I was dreading it instead of being excited. I never called anyone from last year. One of the girls decided she wasn't going because she didn't have the money for it, and she didn't feel right sharing that experience with people she didn't care about. I started to see her point. I hadn't made an appointment to get my hair or makeup done yet. My face was breaking out. I didn't want to go to prom without the experience- that would be *more* depressing than just sitting at home. So, with one day left to buy a ticket, I decided that this day I'd been dreaming of since I was a little kid watching teen movies was never going to happen.

I knew it was the right decision, but still, I felt the void instantly. The night before, the girl who'd tried to get me to go sent out a Snap of her getting ready. I replied, ""I want to be happy for you, but I'm just really brokenhearted right now"". (I'm so grateful that she's been so understanding throughout all of this.) She sent back, ""I'm so sorry. You'll get your chance.""

*""You'll get your chance.""*

The first thing the one sympathetic witness to the betrayal said to me when we went into the bathroom and I started to cry was, ""You don't really find your crowd in high school, but in college."" Excited for freedom from my miserable situation and spurred on by what I hoped was my blossoming popularity (but I was popular for the first few weeks of high school and look how that turned out), I allowed myself to hope. It was the same kind of hope that comforted me when I was in eighth grade and my senior trip got rained on in more ways than one, or when I was a junior doing math problems on a Friday night in hopes of a shot at my dream school: I will be happy in the future. I imagine myself a year from now, dressed up for a college formal. The guy I met at the admitted students day who I'm trying not to crush on right now is my date. This trust fund frat boy is shattering expectations by having a black scholarship girl on his arm, and we're both important on campus, so it's kind of a big deal. He and my friends know that I didn't go to prom, so they're giving me that experience. Us girls go to get our nails done and take pictures for Instagram. He shows up in a limo and places a corsage around my wrist. Or I imagine myself 12 years from now (30 is a good age), at my wedding. I must have a big Princess Tiana ball gown. The venue must be picturesque, and the bridal party must be at my beck and call at all times. I'm not mean about it- well, sometimes I am, but everyone goes easy on me because they know that I'm broken. I cling to my mother-in-law because my own mother has been gone for 15 years.

But I don't want to carry that scar. I don't want to spend my life trying to make up for something I'll never experience. I'm afraid that my college life will be just that. I'll run for Class Board because I didn't make student government in high school. I'll try out for the dance team because I wasn't a cheerleader in high school. I'll party every weekend because I was never invited to a real party in high school. Even if it *does* work, there will always be this side of myself that I'm trying to fight. I feel it now. In college group chats, comparing dining plans and sharing memes, I'm the ""happy girl"". Sleeping until noon, neglecting my responsibilities, or feeling heartbroken looking at other people's prom pictures, I'm the ""sad girl"". 

Last night, I dreamt that my fake friends from high school showed up at my college. They humiliated me in front of my new friends, telling them every embarrassing mistake I made, that I followed them around for 4 years, that I just *seem* like someone to know until you really get to know me. I woke up in tears. I want to be the ""happy girl"" in college. I really do. I want to never use this ""sad girl"" throwaway account again, and only need the ""happy girl"" main account that at least three of my new friends know. But I know that, eventually, the ""sad girl"" will come out. And when she does, I'm terrified that I'll end up right back where I've always been."

8rpplm,30,2018-06-17,"Brenda, from Accounting",AriadneBeckett,JustNoFamFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoFamFiction/comments/8rpplm/brenda_from_accounting/,"Natasha peered into the cell. A little old lady with gray hair sat within, sketching on a yellow legal pad.


“Why hello, dear!” said the inmate, jumping to her feet with a charming smile. “You must be new here. I’m Brenda, from accounting. Have you heard from my granddaughter?”


“I’m Natasha,” she said, returning the smile. There must be something wrong. There couldn’t be any possible reason for this woman to be in a black site prison on a hippo-infested island off the coast of South America. She looked like she belonged in an office cubicle, gossiping about the new intern and eating hard candy from a dish on her desk.

“No, I haven’t heard from your granddaughter. But I can try and find her and find out where she is?” suggested Natasha.


“That would be just lovely, dear,” said Brenda from Accounting. “My poor dear son, he married this evil woman. Just evil. First she stole my son and turned him against me, then she used her devil vagina magic to control him completely, and now they won’t even let me see my baaaby. Can you believe that? My first grandchild. A baby needs his gramma, you know?”


Natasha blinked. *Devil vagina magic* was a bit… odd. Maybe Brenda from Accounting wasn’t all there. But Gramma being a bit off didn’t usually warrant indefinite detention as a terrorist. Something had to be very, very wrong here. She flipped through the file folder on Brenda Cairn. Her eyes widened as she scanned the police reports and the CIA summary. 


“It says here you — tried to hire ISIS to blow up the dildo factory your son worked at?”


“Oh, yes.” Brenda’s face took on a dreamy expression. “My golden boy. My sweet little momma’s boy, the one who would never fall for some gold-digging schemer. Eric is such a wise old soul, such an artist. I saw it in him right from the very start. He sees the beauty we all miss, even in what the rest of us call arson, or vandalism. He’s a visionary, and he endures so much from this horrible world. Now if only he’d find a nice woman and give me grandbabies….”


“Awww,” said Natasha, still frantically skimming files. “So - he got fired from the dildo factory?”


“Yes, he had the worst boss. This terrible, terrible woman. I think she wanted him, deep down, and knew she was too fat for him, and that made her jealous. And she was threatened by his talent. That’s really what it was, she was threatened.”


“I see,” said Natasha. She closed the file and frowned. “So what excuse did she give for firing him?”


“It was totally fabricated. She said he was sexually harassing the female employees with the merchandise, and making them feel scared. Scared! Can you believe that? My baby wouldn’t hurt a fly. She was just jealous that he wasn’t interested in her.”


“So you hired ISIS to blow up the factory?” asked Natasha. Maybe Brenda from Accounting had mild dementia?


“Yes, dear,” said Brenda, looking a little impatient. “I didn’t mean it! I mean, I would never! I just wanted to scare that evil woman, I mean, just a little bomb or something. Like a firecracker. You people always blow things out of proportion. I just want what’s best for my baby. Who hasn’t gone a little Mama Bear now and then? Who locks up a little old lady for wanting the best for her son?”


“Ma’m, do you know what ISIS is?” asked Natasha.


“Of course, dear. They dress up in masks, and hack computers and tweet bad things about the President and Scientologists. They’re very nice, even if they do break the law.”


“I think you’re thinking of Anonymous, which is a computer hacking network,” said Natasha. “ISIS is a brutal Muslim extremist terrorist army that murders innocent people in cold blood.”


“Whatever, dear. Could you be so kind as to have that small native man bring me some tea? I think he’s a ho-mo-sexual, but he makes good tea anyway, not like that stuck-up bitch my poor boy married.”


“So - this is a different poor boy than the one that got fired for brandishing dildos at his co-workers?” asked Natasha, trying to keep all of this straight, and starting to wonder if there was even a point.

Brenda was a little nuts, but clearly harmless. Definitely not a terrorist. Was a single word of this even true? If you took any average American granny and held them in solitary and subjected them to enhanced interrogation, they’d go nuts. This poor woman just needed a nursing home and a good psychologist.


“Oh, yes, dear. So sad. She turned him against me. Now it’s like I don’t even have him, and my poor grandbaby. I think she’s abusing them. He should never have married a colored woman, they’re all low-class gold-diggers. When I get out of here, I’m going to get custody of that poor child if it’s the last thing I do. They can’t keep a child from his gramma! He’s mixed, you know. But I don’t care, because he’s my baby. There’s nothing like a grandma’s love, and the Secret Service won’t even send me pictures! They blocked me on Facebook, can you believe it? Saying I was a threat to the President?”


Natasha sighed and closed the file. Yep. Totally bonkers. “That does seem extreme, I’m sure you’ve never even met the President.”


“Of course I have!” said Brenda. “You think I haven’t met my own daughter-in-law? They tried to dis-invite me to the wedding, can you believe it? But I came anyway, and my dress was prettier than hers. Women these days - she had the nerve to wear white, and you *know* she was no virgin.”


“Your…. Low-class, gold-digging, devil vagina-having daughter-in-law is US President Khalsi Andorra?”


“Of course, dear. That bitch wouldn’t even take his name, do you believe it?”

I planned on seeing her then it flip flopped screwing with my emotions causing me to focus my frustration on her, but realizing it’s not even her fault. Not to mention she is now 1 and half hours away versus 4 and half. She also would have had the apartment she is staying in, all to her self tonight and we planned for me to come over Saturday and spend the night, and have Sunday to trip around. She’s in a new living situation for an internship. It just feels like an opportunity lost. On top of that this weekend was kinda the only weekend I’d be able to get to see her until two weeks from now. 

It just keeps stacking..... 

I’m tempted to just go get her tomorrow and bring her here. But then that’s a whole other can worms... I’m done.

8rpzx0,2,2018-06-17,[acne][routine help] Recent breakout; feeling down about my skin,courtercup,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8rpzx0/acneroutine_help_recent_breakout_feeling_down/,"Hello fellow Skin Care Addicts,

I \[26F\] live in the US and I am looking for advice on a couple different things:

1. what is causing my recent breakout?!
2. evaluation of my current routine
3. tips on how to feel better about myself during a breakout

**Skin type**: not completely sure tbh, more on the oily side I think with dry patches, sensitive

**Background**: In high school, I had pretty consistent acne pretty much all over my upper body (not terrible but couldn’t get rid of it) and horrible big blackheads that completely covered my nose. I went on accutane when I was 17-18. It completely changed my life! All though I had horrible dry skin throughout the process, It completely cleared my skin and made my nose look practically poreless. However in the last few years my skin has begun to decline again and my acne is getting worse. Not to mention I am starting to get some fine lines and wrinkles that I would really like stop in their tracks. 

**Current situation**: I normally get a few small pimples around my mouth every month (hormones) but they go away in less than a day or two, other than that my skin has been doing well since the accutane. However in the last three weeks I have gotten pimples all over my face (forehead mostly, cheeks, mouth, and nose), neck, and chest that do NOT want to go away. I have gotten my first cystic pimple since high school on my forehead which is also covered in smaller pimples. I am not sure if this is related to the use of a new moisturizer and/or sunscreen from CeraVe (I have stopped using it a week ago, started using 3 weeks ago) or if it because I started working a serving/dishwashing/cooking job (on top of my internship at an office job) that gets hot, greasy, and leaves me feeling pretty gross. I have also been lacking sleep because of both jobs getting home late and waking up early. I should also mention having skin issues gets me extremely down and self conscious and I won’t relax until I feel better about my skin.

**Current Skin Care Routine**:

AM

* wash face w/ Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (used since 15 yo then stopped for the last 3 years; previously used St Ives Green Tea blackhead scrub, stopped a month ago)
* pat dry
* 100&amp;#37; Pure Brightening Serum (used since February)
* Olay Complete Lotion All Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Sensitive Skin (used since 15 yo; tried to use CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion but started to breakout, not sure if related to lotion though)
* 100&amp;#37; Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream (used since May)
* makeup (minimal, no foundation just blush and mascara)
* then CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with Sunscreen (used since May; stopped using because of breakout)

PM 

* Remove most makeup w/ Cetaphil Gentle Makeup Remover (used for about a year now)
* wash face w/ Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash (used since 15 yo; use to remove mascara as well)
* pat dry
* Pixi by Petra Glow Tonic To Go Pads (tried before for a short time, just began using in routine)
* 100&amp;#37; Pure Brightening Serum
* 100&amp;#37; Pure Retinol Restorative Overnight Balm (used for about a year now)
* 100&amp;#37; Pure Super Fruits Eye Balm (used since February)

OTHER

* Shea Moisture Peace Rose Oil Complex Sensitive Skin Mud Mask (maybe once a week after showering)

TL;DR:

what can I do differently in my routine (listed above)? 

What can I do to prevent my job as a server from affecting my skin SO much?

How can I feel better about myself when I am having a breakout?"

8rra21,15,2018-06-17,Saw it on a mutual friend's Facebook post and just want to share it,redmeatball,aznidentity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/8rra21/saw_it_on_a_mutual_friends_facebook_post_and_just/,"I rarely talk about things like this, but I feel compelled to say something. I was getting lunch with my family, when this white man started shouting expletives at us. For being foreign. For not speaking English. And then he threatened to ""kill those F-ing people."" It was humiliating and frankly, quite frightening. It generally does not bother me, but when it involves my family, it is hard to remain quiet.

Quite honestly, this is nothing new. I have had people roll down their car windows and hurl derogatory words in my face; usually the only thing they can come up with is the old ""go back to ___ (insert Asian country of choice)"". As an intern at Duke, a patient kicked me and the bedside nurse out of the room because we were both ""foreigners"" and requested ""an American doctor"" (guess what sir, I am your American doctor). I get asked all the time why I don't have an accent and why ""my English is so good"" (am I supposed to have an accent because I look different?). The ""where are you from?"" question is inevitable and ""Buffalo"" never suffices because they want to hear ""Taiwan"" or some other exotic place (in my mind, I answer, ""well before Buffalo, I was in my mom's uterus""). Or the ""what kind of oriental are you?"" (well sir/ma'am, today, I feel particularly like a vase, but sometimes I'm in a rug mood). ""Do you eat pizza with chopsticks?"" ""Can I touch your hair, it's so black."" ""I have this Korean/Japanese/Vietnamese etc friend, you might know them since you are Asian."" I could go on and on and on. While mildly frustrating, most of these questions actually open up avenues for dialogue in the right setting.

I have always been very aware of my ""otherness."" I have even been forced to check the box ""other"" rather than ""Asian/Pacific Islander"" because someone in the office decided that I was not qualified to be a ""Asian/Pacific Islander."" When I was younger, this sense of ""otherness"" bothered me immensely. People would laugh at my name, so I made my parents switch out my Taiwanese name so it wouldn't be called out during attendance; this way, I could attempt to avoid the snickering and jeering and being poked at with pencils. On my first ever school bus ride, kids yelled ""ching chong chang"" at me, shoved me around until I hit my face on the back of a seat and my tooth got knocked out; I vowed never to take the bus ever again and so my parents drove me to school or I walked. They laughed at the shape of my eyes (""my mom is Chinese, my dad is Japanese and look what happened to me""), so I learned to look down and avoid eye-contact. They laughed at my ""weird"" bento boxes for lunch, so I asked my parents to stop packing tasty Taiwanese food and opted for the alternative (and much less tasty) PBJs in a sandwich bag. I never cried. But I tried everything in my power to assimilate, to be more ""American,"" and less Asian, less ""other.""

Like many others in the US, my parents are first-generation immigrants and nothing short of amazing. They came here with nearly nothing but the clothes on their backs and a bit of pocket money. They worked hard, learned English, and jumped over countless hurdles, so that my brother and I could have and experience the things that they could not. Many people know little about living on the hyphen and the Asian-American story except for the rhetoric of the ""model minority"" stereotype which does no one any good and only serves to perpetuate racial burdens. The uncomfortable truth is that the story bears more scars than can be outwardly seen and that it has endured more than just ""sprinkles"" of racism. Racism knows no boundaries, knows no colors.

I can't exactly pinpoint when the light bulb went off, but I stopped caring about fitting in and started embracing myself. I am so grateful for the people around me who embrace every quirky and awkward ember of my being and for a God who loves unconditionally. My close friends know that I am fiercely, fiercely proud of being Taiwanese-American (for anyone who is unclear, let me help clarify: Taiwan is a tiny, but mighty island in East Asia and a proudly independent and democratic country with a strong, brilliant female president). I am proud that I can speak three languages and can pick up anything with just a pair of chopsticks. I bring my awesome rice-filled bento boxes to work and drink my bubble tea. I wear my full Taiwanese name on my white coat. I am also now incredibly adept at Asian jokes and poking fun at myself.

From inside the restaurant, I watched the man walk back to his SUV and kindly open the door for his lady friend before getting into the driver's seat. Sir, you are likely a decent man and I hope you were simply having a bad day or perhaps something about ""us"" stirred discomfort or fear, but I hope that one day, you might open the door to others - you just might be pleasantly surprised.

I am just about as imperfect as one can get and there are certainly many things that I need to work on, but instead of reciprocating fear and hatred with fear and hatred, I hope that I can meet people where they are with the kindness, compassion, and love that my parents taught me. Racism may know no colors, but love also knows no colors."

At the time I was at 76 kg (167 pounds). Since a year ago, a lot has  happened. I have not been able to listen to KFGD lately because I have longer hours at a new job, but am also properly being paid as an Engineer and not an intern anymore. 

I've been exercising more than ever, with boxing sessions daily. I let myself go at the end of 2017 in terms of dieting, peaking at 81 kg (178 lbs).

This year I'm finally steady on a diet, down to 70kgs (154 lbs). Like someone once recommended, I'll try to get a six pack before I'm 30. At least to be able to say I did it.

Congratulations to the Greg and all the crew responsible for KFGD for a year of excellent content.

8rsyah,14,2018-06-17,19 [F4F] - Anyone interested in chatting with a coal miner?,halcyoneffect,lesbianr4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbianr4r/comments/8rsyah/19_f4f_anyone_interested_in_chatting_with_a_coal/,"Hey there! I’m working in Alabama this summer as a coal miner and am looking to make some new friends outside of work. My friends from school live several hours north, so we talk when we can, but it’s just not the same as being together. The other interns I’m working with are alright, but I miss having someone to talk openly with and not having to be shoved back into the closet. In addition to literally being the only female on the day shift at my mine, it gets pretty grating. 

Disclaimer, though: I do work some long and sometimes odd hours, but I’m very willing to talk when I can and on any platform. So if that’s here, discord, voice chatting, etc., I’m willing to do it. 

So here’s just a few things about me (interesting or not? You tell me):

• I’m a 19 year old (20 next month) junior majoring in Mining Engineering, hence the coal mining job.

• I play the snare drum on my university’s drumline, play drum set as a hobby, and have played concert percussion for 9 years, so I’m a huge fan of listening and playing all types of music!

• My main platform is PS4 but I also play some PC.

• Some of my other hobbies include reading, traveling, occasional movie/TV watching, and collecting fountain pens

I will say, I also love hearing people talk of the things that they’re passionate about. I love learning from people with a genuine interest in sharing things that are special to them. So if anyone has something that they’re passionate about, regardless of what it is, tell me! In return, feel free to ask me any questions. 

So with all of that said, would anyone be up to getting to know each other? I’m happy to just be friends or if things go well, maybe something more."

What to do with $90k USD?,PFthrowaway12qwas,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8rtdwh/26_yo_canadian_student_attending_us_college_what/,"Throwaway account. I'm a Canadian student currently studying in the US, with plans to wrap up my bachelor's in computer science in May 2019. Thereafter, I plan to go straight into the software industry. I have no student debt, car loans, or mortgages to speak of. I currently have a summer internship, and during the school year, I have a part-time job; both do not offer any benefits such as employer sponsored-plans.  

Between my mom and me, we have $90k USD sitting in high interest savings accounts. It's getting only 1.65% interest, which is too low. Also, we would like diversify. Regarding my mom's situation, she is a stay-at-home living off alimony. She also doesn't have any debt. So, we don't ever touch the $90k.  

As a lurker, I generally see a trend regarding the things suggested (Roth IRA! Vanguard! Housing! 3-6 months emergency fund!). So here's some of my thoughts; please correct any of my misconceptions. I would like advice on what I should do with the money, as it's substantial.  

I'm skeptical regarding the Roth IRA, as I am **not** a US citizen or PR. I'm afraid that I might run into difficulties down the road regarding taxation, retrieving my money, etc. Should I opt for something like Vanguard? I'm mildly paranoid that the market is due for another crash sooner rather than later, due to how stupidly well it's performed for the past 2-3 years. Are there other funds I should look into?  
 
The current city I'm in has palatable housing prices, but again, I'm not a US citizen, and cannot obtain a mortgage to finance a $180k townhouse. My hometown's economy in Canada is still mired in the doldrums, along with the housing prices. Vancouver and Toronto are way out of my league at the moment.  

5-7 years from now, I would like to begin a software start-up. I'm trying to build my name up in the local industry first and gain more knowledge in general.  

Please send advice, thank you. "

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I’d like to know how common it is to land a summer internship at a quant fund/prop shop as an undergraduate in Europe and what it is usually required to get it.

I’m currently in the end of my 2nd year of undergraduate of mathematical engineering in Italy and I have a somewhat good work experience as a software developer (web development and data analysis).  I have also interned in Dublin 2 years ago and I’m coming to Münich this summer to work at a startup in the energy sector. A couple hackathons won and, regarding financial markets, two related projects, one of which is more serious and blockchain related.

I’m very interested in the applications of predictive models and mathematics to financial markets and I’d really like to have a first hand serious experience of it, potentially through an internship next summer.

In you experience, what would I need to maximize my chances of success?

Thank you very much for your attention."

My main question is in my situation, what would your next steps be in order to better my chances?  Should I go back to college to get internship opportunities again?  Should I somehow find a way to convince a department to let me volunteer/shadow the crime analyst unit?

Also, what sources are available to learn these skills and put them in practice to show I’m trying to use my new skills?"
8ruqve,3,2018-06-17,17/M4A/US I would love to make a few new friends! Looking for meaningful contact if possible,ThiccThrowawayy,MakeNewFriendsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/8ruqve/17m4aus_i_would_love_to_make_a_few_new_friends/,"I guess what made me post here was in a highschool where several of my friends went, someone shot himself in class. I knew the victim from acquaintances  and he seemed to kinda just be separate? from everything. I never thought that that would happen to me but given my current situation I feel like I should probably involve myself in some more social interactions and kinda regain my sense of self. I am currently attending college (summer semester) where I am takin a few premed classes and working on some research. All of my friends are a couple states away and my roommates, while pretty chill, are these super swole dudes who just kinda smoke pot constantly. Needless to say, I would love some interaction aside from my hs friends texting me to hang, realizing that I'm far away, and then kinda just ignoring.

So some stuff about me: I come from a single parent Asian household. My dad was basically a tiger-mom who cracked down on me for all things academic. Eventually college came around and he offered to pay if I went to the school that he loved for a major that he loved (Cornell and Chemical Engineering). I ended up deciding to go to a much less prestigious school on a scholarship and I joined a BS/MD program which triggered him to no end as he never wanted me to be a doctor. As a result, I have been ""disowned"" for the past couple weeks and I ended up taking a job as a research intern at the uni I'm attending in order to make some money for living expenses. Unfortunately, I went from living as a sheltered asian kid in a supportive if strict asian household to living by myself with no support (given that I maybe talk to 3 of my friends regularly and my dad refuses to talk to me). That being said, I still think I am a pretty positive person and I enjoy having fun and making others laugh. A typical day in my life is waking up, going to work, going to the gym, and then just chilling on the internet for the rest of the day. I enjoy rap and hip hop, I have been to several concerts by some amazing hip hop artists and to JMBLYA as well. I play league of legends almost obsessively and I am trying to level up to 30 right now. I enjoy reading a great deal, and I also love mathematics and statistics. I am looking to connect with other teens my age +/- maybe 2-3 years. I am not looking for anything sexual as I got out of a pretty bad breakup when I moved and I would honestly rather just make friends. PM me if you are interested, I try to keep in contact through snapchat so I can send you mine there."
8ruve1,3,2018-06-17,I Yelled Because of Baby Carrots: Why I Can’t Wait to Move Out,StrikingCombination,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ruve1/i_yelled_because_of_baby_carrots_why_i_cant_wait/,"As I often do, I felt that there is not enough space at home. Not enough space to be by myself. Don’t have my own room for privacy. Not enough freedom to come and go as I please and now, I can’t eat baby carrots. Baby carrots aside, my need for space stems from the fact that I’m a twenty-year-old Asian male who still lives with his two siblings and two very concerned, “loving” parents who also happen to be very religious and homophobic - which isn’t the best scenario because I am gay and in the closet. I chose to still live at home during my college years to save money and for the most part, I’m happy with my decision (will be graduating college debt free and with two internships under my belt). However, there are days (particularly Sundays) where I just feel frustrated and “trapped” - and the last thing I want is for my parents to be in my business, telling me how to live my life, and instructing me on how to behave. Physically, the house my family currently lives in is also small. Like two bedrooms for five people small. So, I guess in both literal and figurative senses, I need space.  Anyways, back to the carrots. 

It was just a simple comment but it was enough to set me off. I was lying in bed feeling this overall moodiness when my dad walks into the room.

“I’m going to the groceries; do you want anything?”

 “Not really. But maybe baby carrots?”

“NO! Not baby carrots! Don’t eat baby carrots! It’s soaked in chlorine and it’s bad for you. I read it online and there was this report about how baby carrots can stay in your fridge for three months and still look the same because of all the chlorine. Look it up on the internet” 

My father continued this concerned parent speech for another minute then walked away. 

When he was gone, I had so much rise inside me. In addition to the whole coddling/controlling vibe, I’m not sure what set me off. Maybe it was the Facebook, internet science vibe behind the whole thing. I just felt it was so stupid how he has such a negative attitude towards me eating baby carrots. It’s stupid how he is acting on a fear which was not backed up by legitimate facts. And now because of this fear, he told me I can’t eat baby carrots. But I love baby carrots.  

I managed to hold it all in until I made sure he was well away from my room. However, I could not hold it long enough. I just had so much frustration in me that I had to let out a scream. 

“DAAAMN ITTT!” 

And of course, because this house is just so small, my mom – who was on the same floor as I – heard my scream and immediately went inside my room. She started making a fuss, blowing things out of proportion and then calling my dad to come in and get involved. And now great, my dad’s back in my room.

So I had to explain that I am frustrated because of the carrots and now look like a bad guy. I then get lectured at for the next five to ten minutes about proper behavior and how it should not be such a big deal that I do not eat baby carrots, about how I should handle myself, etc.  I’m told that I should act like a grown adult (fair enough) and apologize to my dad – which I don’t find fair at all. I yelled when no one was in the room, where it was not directed towards anyone!  So why does my dad get to be offended and I am told to feel bad? This house is so small that I can’t vent in peace!  

When I move out, I’ll eat so much baby carrots with my future boyfriend that we’ll both die from chlorine poisoning.

8rv62y,187,2018-06-17,My experience of over 400 days on NoFap,boilerup1234,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8rv62y/my_experience_of_over_400_days_on_nofap/,"Hey guys, I'm here to give my story and answer any questions if needed.

So I started NoFap when I was 18. I tried to lose my virginity and couldn't get it up. Super embarrassing right? I had also struggled very heavily with social anxiety and depression. A quick google search of why I couldn't get it up and of course I was then immersed into the world of NoFap and it has been a part of my life since then. I came for many of the reasons you all did as well. Fixing ED, improving confidence and/or depression, etc. 

As you all know, quitting is fucking hard. For a good 2 years I would be on and off. Had a 5 month streak, then many times struggling to make it a few days. I remember how hard and how daunting it was to quit. How intense the cravings were and kicking myself every time I slipped. I often wondered ""Does it get easier?"" And the answer is yes actually! From my experience, the first 2 weeks are by far the hardest. So please do everything you can to just make it 2 weeks. I have found that if given that context it will be easier to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The next 2 weeks are also challenging, but doable. After 1 month is when things start to improve. And I just kept going. There will always be random urges, there will always be times like that, that have challenged me over the past year. I just didn't give in. I like to look at NoFap as a lifestyle, not a diet. Don't 'try' to quit porn like you would 'try' a diet. Make the diet your lifestyle. Have the mindset that porn will never again be a part of your life.

Benefits:

So this is what everyone is most interested in of course. I always looked to progress reports for motivation and found it rare to see over 1 year posts which is why I wanted to chime in. I will try to keep it real with you guys here. No glorifying it, just my raw experiences.

\- Mild fatigue decrease

\- Slight energy increase

\- Social anxiety drastically decreased

\- Depression highly decreased\*

\- ED completely eliminated

\- Highly increased confidence

\- More dominant/assertive

\- Much more driven

\- Excelling professionally

Looking back on this journey I can honestly say I truly experienced all of those things. It was amazing how much my social anxiety decreased. It took a really long time, but it constantly improved and improved. And as my anxiety improved, so did my confidence. I started taking no shit from people and became comfortable in most situations. I can talk to girls and guys with ease. My anxiety isn't completely gone, I still get extremely nervous doing public speaking and prefer to hang out with close friends as opposed to large groups of people, which can make me nervous. If you have social anxiety you'll always have it, but it becomes so much more manageable that I never even think about it anymore, which really is a blessing.

As for depression, I definitely think it helped me. However I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and quitting porn went hand in hand with finding medication that I am stable on, so I think they both helped each other. I feel like a normal person now.

School wise I was lazy as hell before I quit. I didn't put in any effort at all compared to what I do now. My GPA has increased every semester, I landed an internship, founded a fraternity, and now I'm after doing undergraduate research I'm working on my own project and could even get a paper published before I graduate. Before that I was a sub 2.2 student who played video games all day.

I successfully lost my virginity, dated girls, chased girls....all of that stuff. Before NoFap I never did anything with girls. It really changes your drive and how you naturally gravitate towards meeting women. I got my first girlfriend, then I went on to have like 5 more since I started my first streak at 18 (I'm 21 now). I have a normal sex life now and that's all I can ask for.

Final advice:

This section is the most important of all so please listen closely. All of the things I benefited from are great and all, but NoFap merely removed the chains that were holding me down. We are all capable of great things, but the terrible addiction of porn and masturbation holds you back. What you come to realize after quitting is that it's not NoFap who changes your life; it's you. NoFap was the first of many different things I changed in my life. It gave me the newfound energy and drive to go out and do the things that would make a meaningful difference. It removed the social anxiety enough to where I could get my foot in the door, and grow through experiences. It made the depression milder, allowing you to go and naturally improve it on your own. I made major changes to my lifestyle:

\- Started eating very healthy

\- Worked out more (cardio is the most important of all)

\- Quit all drugs/drinking

\- Being very mindful of health in general

\- Meditation

The mind and the body are very connected. Treat your body well and it will in turn treat your mind well with improved mood and energy! Very important. I also began yoga and meditation which is great to learn more about yourself and de-stress.

My key take away is that NoFap is a catalyst for a tsunami of positive change in your life. Stay on NoFap, but take every opportunity you have to improve yourself in any way possible. Self-growth is the #1 goal. Also rest assured because you will be in a completely different state of mind once you have quit for a long time and it will be much more easier to make these changes.

I still feel depressed sometimes. I still struggle with generalized anxiety/stress. A lot of times I feel like I'm just going through the motions. But where I'm at now is certainly a hell of a lot better than where I was before. The difference now is I just have different problems. The brain is always searching for homeostasis, so if you win the lottery eventually you will settle into a routine and feel the same old same old. There's a lot of talks about superpowers, and how I am now certainly is like a superpower in comparison. I'm not super high on life, but I'm not sad either, just content. I'm just a normal person now. Don't get sucked into the whole 'NoFap superman powers x100 pulling bitches bro' stuff. It's not like that, but it's something so much more long lasting and peaceful.

I hope this information was useful to somebody. I'm probably not the greatest writer or most sympathetic person, but I know I liked reading others experiences so if anybody gains something from this then my job here is done. Good luck guys. Always remember it gets easier, it gets better, and it's so worth it."

It's just me and my cofounder, and he's working somewhere else as an intern part-time.  My girlfriend just wants things to be stable; she's very conservative.  Maybe that means we should break up.  But I don't want to break off the only stable thing when I'm under all this uncertainty.

I'm not sure when we'll make our first dollars.  I'll go to incubators asking for money (I applied to YC this summer, but they never give feedback when they reject.  I'll apply again this Spring), but I don't know how to deal with any of this.

I realize I'm very privileged to speak English, to have a college degree, to even have a chance to pursue this wild dream of mine.  But I really wish I had a friend in my corner who wasn't telling me how crazy we're being.  My cofounder is interning at Uber presently, so I'm left alone most of the day to code.

My GF didn't want to come out to SF, and I kind of get why.  She's pre-med and applying to gap-year-jobs right now, so she doesn't have time to be super supportive like she often is.  It's hella expensive out here, and it's unclear where the next dollar is coming from at this point.  I want her to feel secure, but more important has to be my long-term interests, considering I have no control over when she decides to fucking leave me and rip my heart out.  


How does one cope with uncertainty?  Adulthood leaves less direction than I ever realized.  This makes it hard to criticize anyone who goes for a ""safe job"" doing consulting, banking, engineering, or medicine.  I just want the next paycheck to be assured; I just want 2 million users and ""safety,"" because I'm tearing my hair out and yelling at my loved ones just thinking about all the work we're gonna need to do.  Should probably go meditate.

I hope anyone who's ever looked for a job, started a business, or waited for college application results to come back can relate.  Somehow I imagine a lot of you strangers out there on the internet can be more empathetic and understanding than my own fucking parents and even cofounder, who keeps insisting he's not worried at all.  He's really built like a tank, I swear.  Either that and/or he's not aware of his own feelings.  Fucking Indian coders, man.  Hella reliable, hella smart, hella insensitive"

Someone to dirty chat, sext and cum together with and talk about the day! If you're gay, bi or straight it all works!

We can talk about fantasies, girls we find hot, find new ways to make each other cum. If you have a gf you want to use here we can do that too! Bonus if there's footage for us to enjoy! ;)

We can see Whether the new intern is into you or not. Let's also talk about your day and other non-sexual things and hopefully that makes the experience all the better!

I am just tired of people endlessly staring at me and being nice to these people by smiling to stop them from staring. (and sometimes people even keep staring.......)

I am tired that my family keeps saying things like ""he, him and his"". This combined with saying my old name and my new name constantly next to each other kinda left the ""new name"" thing with a bad taste.

I am tired of my dad, his ""jokes"" like grabbing me at my foot, shoulder, neck or head and telling me to put soap in my mouth.

I am tired of some parts of my family telling me ""how i should live like a woman"". Like inviting me to go shopping with them and then hissing that i must wear a dress or skirt and do this and do that. Or that not doing the operations proves that i am not transgender. Or do a intervention and decide how i should do my makeup (with a ton of deadnaming me in the process!!)

I am tired of waking up, feeling like i am suffucating and crying in the middle of the night because what ever i try, i just cant find a internship, get kicked out of my room at the end of this month, it feels my family doesnt really accept me, society sees me like a freak/issue/ or something else

I am tired of my psychiatrist only wanting to deal with the diagnostics and surgery instead of all these things above. I understand that it is a busy time and that want to move along but i have been dragging with these issue's for months and months..

Sorry for being so negative, but i could't handle it anymore after yesterday's birthday party where i was stared at like a freak, hissed at that i should wore a dress and i needed to prove myself to a part of the family that i am a actual person where you can have actual decent conversations with.

**update!** Thanks to your comments and some friends I decided to get some help. 💛"
8rxe5c,1,2018-06-18,Dr Jules Cotard,[deleted],CotardsSyndrome,https://www.reddit.com/r/CotardsSyndrome/comments/8rxe5c/dr_jules_cotard/,"&gt; Dr. Jules Cotard (1 June 1840 in Issoudun, Indre – 19 August 1889) was a Parisian neurologist who first described the délire des négations. Cotard's syndrome or Cotard's delusion comprises any one of a series of delusions ranging from the fixed and unshakable belief that one has lost organs, blood, or body parts to believing that one has lost one's soul or is dead. In its most profound form, the delusion takes the form of a professed belief that one does not exist. Encountered primarily in psychoses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Cotard's syndrome has also been described in organic lesions of the nondominant temporoparietal cortex as well as in migraine. Cotard's delusion is the only self-certifiable syndrome of delusional psychosis. Jules Cotard, a Parisian neurologist and psychiatrist and former military surgeon, was one of the first to induce cerebral atrophy by the experimental embolization of cerebral arteries in animals and a pioneer in studies of the clinicopathologic correlates of cerebral atrophy secondary to perinatal and postnatal pathologic changes. He was the first to record that unilateral cerebral atrophy in infancy does not necessarily lead to aphasia and was also the pioneer of studies of altered conscious states in diabetic hyperglycemia.

&gt;Education
&gt;He studied medicine in Paris and later went on to work as an intern at Hospice de la Salpêtrière, where he worked for, among others, Jean-Martin Charcot.
&gt;Career
&gt;Cotard became particularly interested in cerebrovascular accidents (commonly known as 'strokes') and their consequences and undertook autopsies to better understand how these affected the brain. In 1869, Cotard left Salpêtrière, and at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he joined an infantry regiment as a regimental surgeon. Cotard moved to the town of Vanves in 1874, where he remained for the last 15 years of his life. He made particular contributions to the understanding of diabetes and delusions. In August 1889, Cotard's daughter contracted diphtheria and he reportedly refused to leave her bedside for 15 days until she recovered. He eventually contracted diphtheria himself and died on 19 August.

8rxz7u,17,2018-06-18,Don't Rely On Time to Heal Your Pain,greenteamask,GriefSupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/8rxz7u/dont_rely_on_time_to_heal_your_pain/,"Hello.

I had a family of 7, 4 brothers, a dad, and mom. I was the only girl, number 4. My childhood was okay, though I had to overcome traumatic events that still haunt me to this day, I feel as though I was blessed. I had a good education, kind parents, fun and loving brothers, and close friends. Yes, I was, and still am, lucky to have the life I have been given, although not perfect. My dad is the second oldest in a family of 9. Though they live apart in their adult lives, whenever my dad and siblings would get together, they would laugh and reminisce together long into the night. 

I always imagined that is how my brothers and I would be when we were older. Getting together and just enjoying each other’s company. But the light heartedness that came with the reunions of my dad and siblings was no longer possible anymore, not after May 17, 2016. It could not happen without acknowledging the gaping hole left in our small sibling group. 

My brothers and I are within two years apart of each other, besides my youngest brother who is 4 years younger than I. I remember admiring my brothers for being strong and adventurous. So I always tried to be like them. I remember playing outside with them, building forts, chasing after them in my poorly made skates while they raced down the hill on scooters, losing ‘war’ because I was incapable of properly aiming a wooden stick and saying ‘boom’ (I’m sure there was some amount of cheating going on), powering my way through boring games of football, and always getting hurt roughhousing. It was fun though. 

Since we were all so close in age, we spent the majority of our grade school to high school careers attending the same schools. My third oldest brother and middle child, N, had the responsibility of picking me up in grade school(though he forgot more than a handful of times) and coordinating our pick up in high school until he could finally drive us home. 

Out of all of my brothers, I admired N the most. His academics seemed to come easy to him (if he actually tried that is), he had a large group of long time friends, and he was fun to be around. What I believe made him so popular to be around was the fact that he was so genuinely kind and caring. I felt it too. He made normal things like the ride home entertaining and made everyone feel safe to be themselves. He was someone to rely on. Since I’m gushing about him, it’s obvious, isn’t it? He died.

I was a junior in high school and APs had just finished. I was 4 seasons, almost 5 seasons, deep into Game of Thrones and needed my fix. Before 3rd period, I texted my dad for the HBO login information. He replied almost instantly, though unfortunately, it was not the answer I wish I had gotten. “I’m coming to get you from school,” he said. 

My dad is a very smart man. He values academics and would for no reason other than a flu allow me to skip class. I thought that it was strange and I scoured my brain for a dentist or doctor appointment I may have forgotten about. I asked him why, but he would provide no further information. I was left to my thoughts.

The only other thing to happen that day was the arrival of my mom and brother, N. N had just finished his freshman year at university and my mom had ridden a train out to help him and his friend drive N’s car home. They were about 5 hours out when I had checked FindMyiPhone that morning around 6. The previous winter break, my brother had gotten home and picked me up that same day, so I assumed that he would pick me up, not my dad and especially not at 10am in the morning. I checked to see where they were and to my distress, they were at a hospital.

I immediately texted them both, “are you okay?” I then looked online for any accidents that may have happened on the route they were supposed to take home. The first one I saw was “2 dead, 1 injured,” I was about the ball until I realized that the date was wrong. My dad arrived about 10 minutes later and my mind was going a million miles a minute and I’m sure my pale face was even paler when I left that classroom.

I decided the worst thing that could have happened was a broken leg. 

I asked my dad about it in the car. I told them I saw that they were at the hospital and asked if they were both okay. “Your mom’s okay, just a few bruises,” he avoided my question. “What about N?” I asked. He softly patted my leg and said, “He’s okay too.” It could not have been worse than a broken leg. Definitely not.

When we arrived at my little brother’s school, I had gotten a response from mom, “I’m very very sad.” I was going to stay in the car and respond, but my dad insisted that I got with him. So I did.

When we arrived home, my oldest brother had arrived and we sat in the living room together. “There was an accident. Your mom’s okay,” he hesitated, “but your brother succumbed to his injuries.”

I cried. My little brother cried. My oldest brother was stoic, but obviously distressed. The next day he was also fly out and meet my mom while arrangements for the body were made. My dad called my second oldest brother who was away doing an internship. He also cried, a lot, but he would only admit this to my dad much later. My dad called my grandma and grandpa, who told my relatives who were not already informed from my oldest brother’s facebook post which he made shortly after my dad told us. My dad spent the rest of the day making arrangements, taking calls from concerned people, or answering the door to meet people who came to comfort us. I spent the rest of the day crying alone whether that was in the bathroom, in my room, or somewhere outside. 

My dad informed my school and my little brother’s school that we would be taking a short break. My late brother was an alumnus of both and had graduated high school only a year prior, so they were very obliging. They made an announcement over the intercom at my high school. I received many texts that both, from close friends, people I barely knew, and people I had never met; texts that I never responded to.

My brother was driving for most of the night, so in the early morning he gave up the driving position to my mom. He was in the passenger seat, my mom was driving, and his friend sat behind my mom. But, my mom was tired too. She has insomnia, and can barely stay asleep in a comfortable bed, much less a car seat. So I have no doubt that she barely slept that night whether she was trying to stay awake consciously or not. However, my mom is stubborn; as are her children, so I doubt she would have admitted that she was tired. After all, she has always wanted to be the superhero parent.

She fell asleep. If that wasn’t clear enough. Around 6 in the morning, the car swerved off the road and rolled multiple times. My brother was asleep when it happened and never woke up. My dad told me afterwards that, “even strong boys can’t save themselves when their heads hit the cement going 70 mph.” There was massive internal bleeding, though I’m not sure exactly where. They were almost an hour outside of the nearest hospital and my mom, a first aid specialist, could not resuscitate him. We had no cards in our deck and my family’s luck had finally run out. 

*My brother died. He died. Dead. Gone forever. His bruises would not heal. His hair would not grow. They took his organs out and filled him with embalming fluid. He was just a body, but it hurt so bad. To see him dead. Without a heart. No breath. He would speak no more with his mouth sewn. He looked oddly different, but he, that body, was my brother. He could no longer pick me up from school or fangirl over naruto. He wouldn’t see his girlfriend anymore, or make new memories.* 

N. was gone, forever.

At first, his absence was a black hole in my life; sucking away any happiness I felt. It was so blatantly clear that there was something missing and I needed to know “when will this pain end?” The answer? It’s not ‘with time.’ It’s not. Time doesn’t do shit. The answer that I found is that you get stronger. Eventually you can get through minutes without crying, then hours, then days, then weeks, then months, and then years. The pain will never lessen nor leave your heart. It always comes back and, sometimes, it feels heavier than it used to be. 

You can fill a hole in your life with something artificial like alcohol, drugs, or even talking about it. When your high ends or when there is no one to speak to, you only have yourself to rely on. The hole will always be there. The pain will always be there. 

You owe to the one you lost to learn how to deal with it and become strong enough to live without them physically present. Never forget them, think about them every day, and don’t rely on time to heal your emptiness because it won’t."

I honestly don't know why I'm making this post I'm just so lonely and need to release it somewhere I think... I don't even really want solutions because my hypomania has never led to severe danger I just spend a bit more (also, hasn't broken me yet) and my emotions take quite the rollercoaster that I'm not necessarily used to since I only have had these episodes for about 5 years now (probably 4 or 5 genuine episodes of hypomania followed by a year or two of depression). I only got diagnosed a year and a half ago and I was only taking Adderall to combat the ADHD I was also diagnosed with, which was working for me because it helped me focus on what's going on in my life and around me rather than being stuck in my head all the time (plus actual meds to treat bipolar scared the shit out of me) but now I can't afford it so I'm not sure how long this episode is going to last. I guess my main fear is it turning into a real problem because like I said I haven't done anything too dangerous or to break my living situation yet... so I'm venting. Hopefully this doesn't get deleted I don't use Reddit often I just know different subs have different rules of what is worthy(?) of a post and what isn't..."

The only sounds in the room are your whimpers, your harsh breaths as you gasp for air, and the soft squelching of my fingers pumping in and out of your pussy. ""P-please, I'm s-so...""

I spread my fingers slightly inside of you, curling them up against your walls for added friction as my thumb slides over your clit in slow, cruelly slow circles. You're bent over my desk, your body trembling under mind as I lean over you, my hand wrist deep in the front of your unbuttoned slacks as my fingers work your slick little cunt.

But when I feel you get close, I stop. I let you fall forward against the desk, groaning with frustration as I slowly lick your juices off of my fingers. ""Interns with boyfriends don't get to cum. Remember, baby girl?"" I press my lips to the back of your neck, sucking at soft, sensitive flesh as you shudder. ""You know what you have to do.""

I'm interested in an RP where a 'straight' girl has never had an actual orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college, and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her orgasm several times before the evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss just fucked her brains out.

The boss wants to have a Sugar Mama/girl relationship with your character, but she resists, insisting that she's 'straight' and that she has a boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again throughout the work day, reminding her of the actual orgasms they had the night before.

So, will you dump your boyfriend and let your rich, older lover spoil you and fuck you raw?

Kinks: anal, cunnilingus, strap ons, public sex, clothed sex, mind break, mommy/little girl, age play, incest, breasfeeding and more

Limits: snuff, gore, any toilet play, and diapers

This time i would love to switch roles. But if you don't like to it's not a criterion for exclusion.

Please write me as long as can see this"

No, it’s not a Dave Chappelle skit, it’s real. In the above picture, [congressman Earl Blumenauer](https://blumenauer.house.gov/) and [Portland mayor Ted Wheeler](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/wheeler/) celebrate the opening of [Green Hop](https://www.facebook.com/gogreenhop/) with owners Nicole Kennedy and Karanja Crews. The “marijuana dispensary” was started with a $96,000 “Portland Opportunities Industrial Center” grant, specifically designed for black folks.

[Portland Tribune reports](https://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/398600-293200-new-dispensary-gets-96k-grant-for-apprenticeship-program):

_Local officials and statewide dignitaries hailed the opening of a new marijuana dispensary in North Portland as a welcomed step for African Americans too often locked out of economic opportunities.__“This is more than a store. It’s a representation of equity,” said Karanja Crews, co-owner of the Green Hop pot shop located at 5515 N.E. 16th Avenue, during a ribbon cutting ceremony on Saturday, June 16.__Saturday marked what would have been the 47th birthday of the late rapper Tupac Shakur — an appropriate date for an event billed as opening of the world’s first hip hop dispensary. The space is festooned with vinyl records by “2Pac” as well as Nas, Wu-Tang Clan and A Tribe Called Quest.__Freshly coated in green paint and yellow trim, the two-story craftsman home in the Vernon neighborhood has been restyled with signs promising “420” deals and an apparent “Garden of Weeden” inside the storefront just a half-block from Northeast Killingsworth Street.__Many politicians praised the entrepreneurial spirit of Green Hop’s two young African American co-founders, Crews and nurse and teacher Nicole Kennedy, for fighting against the current of gentrification and racial discrimination. __“Less than one percent of this industry — that’s going to be larger than the NFL in five years — is African American,” noted Rep. Earl Blumenauer. “Nothing makes me feel better than watching you open this establishment.”__“This is the will of the people in this state… and this industry needs to be treated the same as any other,” added Mayor Ted Wheeler. “The City of Portland will be here with you 100 percent.”_**_A $96,000 city grant distributed via Portland Opportunities Industrial Center will create the Green Hop Academy Program, an apprenticeship open for African American young people, ages 21 through 24, who are interested in working in the marijuana business._**

_The ring of the cash register means more revenue generated by the city’s three percent recreational marijuana tax that was championed by Commissioner Amanda Fritz._[Willamette Week continues to pour on the fluff](http://www.wweek.com/potlander/2018/06/12/green-hop-brings-cannabis-and-hip-hop-together-in-north-portland/):

**_Green Hop calls itself “the world’s first historical hip-hop dispensary.” But for co-owners Karanja Crews and Nicole Kennedy, rap isn’t just the theme. It’s the thesis._**

_“Hip-hop has taken the brunt of the backlash to controversial music genres,” Kennedy says. “There’s a lot of stigma around it, and its content is more policed than other genres—just like cannabis.”__**The thread that connects hip-hop and cannabis is one of misunderstanding and social condemnation.** It also reflects the story of Portland’s black community, and the North Portland neighborhood where Green Hop now resides.__With Green Hop—which celebrates its grand opening this week—Crews and Kennedy are bringing a piece of that culture back to the neighborhood. Inside the converted green and yellow Craftsman home, vibrant graffiti murals cover the walls, and classic records from Nas, A Tribe Called Quest and Dr. Dre are on display. **Strains even have nicknames like Illmatic and Grandmaster Flowers. For the two owners, the “hip-hop pot shop” concept has less to do with marketing than paying homage to the artists who inspired them.**__Kennedy, who has worked as a nurse and medical assistant for the past decade, became fascinated by the medical potential for cannabis. Kennedy also taught nursing classes, and met Crews while attending his unique local teaching conference, [Teaching With a Purpose](http://teachingwithpurpose.org/). **The conference draws hundreds of educators to Portland every October, and always features scholars, workshops and concerts with artists like GZA of Wu-Tang Clan.** They quickly discovered a common interest in opening a dispensary, which they believed could help reintegrate the black community back into North Portland.__As soon as a business plan began to form, they saw an opportunity to incorporate vocational training to further assist young people of color in finding employment. **They created the Green Hop Academy, an internship program in collaboration with POIC, a nonprofit that mentors at-risk youth. GHA teaches young people of legal smoking age employable skills in the cannabis industry, through classes that include certification by the [Sativa Science Club](https://www.sativascienceclub.com/). Some of Crews’ former students have enrolled and since graduated from the program.**_[The Portland Mercury adds](https://www.portlandmercury.com/sneaker-wave/2018/06/06/20376261/sneaker-wave):

_When I got word that (A) there’s a new Black-owned cannabis business in town and (B) it’s the “first historical hip-hop dispensary” in the country, my first thoughts were, “How in the hell has no one else done this yet?” and, “Aw, how cute and special and dope that this is happening in Portland.”__“I admire Green Hop’s commitment to supporting African American youth in developing the skills and expertise needed to thrive in the cannabis industry, and share their goal of increasing the participation and success of people of color in an otherwise white-dominated field,” Commissioner Fritz said in a press release.__“The link between hip-hop culture and the normalization of cannabis is a natural partnership,” said Mayor Wheeler. “Green Hop dispensary’s mission to promote community health and wellness, and increase economic opportunities for people of color is something the City of Portland wholeheartedly supports.”__While city officials are making an effort to foster a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the hip-hop community, KC adds that there’s still work to be done before equity is achieved.__Situated in a green-and-yellow house with an interior decked out with vibrant graffiti and iconic albums, the Green Hop collective hopes to be a constant reminder of the artists who paved the way for legalization by normalizing the consumption of dope through hip-hop music and culture. KC specifically cites rappers like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nas, and Tupac, who unapologetically smoked cannabis in the 1980s and 1990s.__“We’re just trying to pay homage,” KC says, adding that in the future, he’d like to have greats like Nas, Redman, and Method Man perform at one of their block party concerts._**_Green Hop recently partnered with Portland Opportunities Industrial Center and won a grant to assist in their Green Hop Academy Program, which provides apprenticeships for African Americans aged 21 to 24 who are interested in working in the cannabis industry. The team says they’re excited to create opportunities for more people of color, including jobs, internships, apprenticeships, and more._**

_Green Hop is already creating strong ties with the local hip-hop community. On August 18, the dispensary will host the Green Hop Fest Block Party, and KC’s already gotten hip-hop duo Dead Prez to commit. Recently Green Hop signed on to be a sponsor for the Thesis monthly hip-hop showcase at Kelly’s Olympian—they’ll hook showgoers up with deals and goodies this Thursday._

I’ve been using Kratom for nearly 3 months daily, dosing several times through the day while at work M-F. I was abusing Kratom and I think it also put me into a reflux flare, so I decided to taper off over the course of like 4 days and didn’t have anything yesterday and also none so far today. 

Back at work I’m struggling because I have to constantly be on to assist patients, interns and volunteers. It’s a non profit clinic so we’re basically staffed by volunteers. I have to train our full time intern and our part time intern and I want so fucking badly to take a teaspoon of green Maeng da. It did things for me that coffee no longer does. And now I gotta be careful with coffee because of my acid reflux so I’m only drinking cold brew but sparingly. I know that’s even asking for problems lol. I’m just so fucking tired and lethargic and a little depressed now without it and dunno how I’m going to get through the week."

It’s the first time in my life I’ve been on my own. At college, I’m only 30 minutes from home and I get to see my folks a lot. 

I grew up playing golf. Dad always went on the weekends and sometimes after work, but he usually gets out too late to play during the week. When I was a little kid, I would tag along and hunt for balls and tees that people lost or left behind while he was playing. I got to ride in the cart, learning all about life from him. He’d let me hit some wedges and putts, and I was hooked. I got one of those kids sets, and we’d play a local par three course. It was nothing special, just turf mats and some greens, but it was our thing. He would make time after work so that we could could play. 

Eventually, I got my first full set. I remember coming to meet him in the driveway one day after work, and he had a set of Nike super-improvement irons for me. It was the most special feeling in the world. I started playing really competitive golf in high school. We always played on the weekends, I got better, and eventually I started getting to a point where I could finally play as well as he did. I remember how once a year or so, we’d sneak off to golf galaxy and get a new club. “Don’t tell your mom!!” he’d say, and we’d laugh. I don’t think I appreciated how invested he was in seeing me enjoy the game. I was so concerned with beating him, and trying to be the high school team’s #1, I struggled really hard to just ~relax~ and enjoy the game. 

I didn’t try to take my game on to the college level - I’m trying as hard as it is just to get an engineering degree - but we’ve never stopped playing. There are tournaments at our course back home we play in, and he’s my partner for the member-member. I still really love to compete. It’s taken me a long time to finally play with a cooler head, and it’s helped. I’ve been playing a lot out where I’m interning, shooting some really great, consistent rounds. I’ve carded a lot of rounds under 80, including a 76. When I’m playing just nine, I’ve managed par a couple times. I shot -2 in high school 9 hole once, but 18s I’m plenty happy just to break 80. Unfortunately, the couple weekends I’ve been home, I’ve played poorly. 

I came home this weekend for Father’s Day, and I shot my personal best at our home course (a 77 - with three doubles and four birds, it’s a super tight, treelined course) this weekend with him and my mom. He hasn’t been able to play as much this year, with the weather and work, but he played well for the first time this year. I can’t begin to describe how special that felt. 

I love you, dad. I love this game and working on it every day that I can. I hope that someday I have kids that grow to love it and hunger for it as much as you made me feel about it. Because, at the end of the day, it’s a love that we share, and I want to play this game with you forever. I hope I get to help grow my kid’s games just as much as you helped to grow mine. 

Happy Father’s Day, everyone. You dads out there mean the world to us - and while we can act like snotty kids sometimes, we appreciate what you gave us with this game and with life itself.

8s0w44,7,2018-06-18,"Father's Day was a shit show. I bought into the ""things have changed for the better"" statement.",alyfern23,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8s0w44/fathers_day_was_a_shit_show_i_bought_into_the/,"First off.... I feel like I should've known better so I don't want this post to come across as me asking for sympathy. 

I've known my dad was a narcissist ever since my therapist told me about 5 years ago. I've never had a good relationship with him. However, about a month and a half ago, my parents invited me over because my dad basically wanted to try and explain why he's been an asshole my entire life. I wasn't expecting the dinner to go well, whatsoever, but to my surprise my dad not only apologized to me, but he also told me he was proud of me and that he loved me. 

I almost fell over. All I've ever wanted was to be able to have a mediocre relationship with my dad. After that visit, things seemed to be looking up. I would call or text him and I not be as nervous about it, but everything came crashing down last night and that's putting lightly.

So they invited me over for Father’s Day a week ago. I said I would be there considering that we'd been on such good terms over the last month.   


Yesterday, an hour before I was supposed to be over for dinner, my mom texts me and says my ""dad doesn’t want to do anything now so no need to come over for dinner"". I knew immediately that my dad must be throwing a huge tantrum about ""his day"" not being perfect. Even though, as you all know, nothing is ever right nor good enough when it comes to a narcissist and holidays are THE WORST!! 

I was relieved that I no longer had to go over there, but I got a text about 45min later from my mom saying “come over for dinner”. At this point, I was just angry because I knew my mom was giving into my dad's bad behavior. I wanted to enforce my boundaries at that point and not go, but my sister begged me not to leave her alone (she's home for the summer for an internship). I text her back saying ""I've decided to make other plans. I'm enforcing a boundary that I've always had trouble truly enforcing and I think this is the perfect time to do that. I'm going to reschedule dinner with them for another night"".

2min later, I get a call from my dad. Seeing his name pop up on my phone, instantly put me into my old mindset where I feel like I can't say no. I could tell he was extremely irritated. He said he'd ""lost track of time""..... yeah right and that he expects me to be over for dinner. All I could say was, okay. So I went. I walked in and he didn't even say hello, and then when we sat down for dinner he literally yelled at me for over an hour and a half about my relationship with my boyfriend and how much he can't stand him. (He doesn't like him because we have an age difference) and how if we ever get married he won’t be at the wedding and that he’s not sure what to tell people when they ask what I’m doing with my life because he's embarrassed to tell them. I told him that was a personal problem that he needed to figure out on his own and that he should just tell people the truth. 

He told me he was mad that I didn't apologize to him the night he apologized to me a month ago, because apparently I have just as much to be sorry for. (I have NOTHING to apologize to him about. NOTHING. Other than being sorry that I've put up with his BS for so long).   
   
 My sister finally had enough of it all. She told my dad that she was tired of him yelling at me for hours every time I come over... which is rare. That pissed him off even more. He yelled at my mom that there was no reason for him to be there so he left. But came back to get his gun, and left his phone at the house. So my mom was worried that he was going to do something to hurt himself because I guess he’s been depressed. I left at that point, because that’s him throwing a ridiculous temper tantrum and trying to control and manipulate. He also never opened the gift I got for him, which I actually spent a lot of time picking out because I thought we were on the verge of a breakthrough with our relationship. 

Needless to say, I'll be enforcing my boundary next time, and for those of you that question when to enforce your own boundaries... it's better to be safe than sorry. "

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

8s1s7h,4,2018-06-18,New here,nebulastars20,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8s1s7h/new_here/,"Hello, im new to this support group. I am 20 years old this year and sadly it took me 20 years to realise that i live with childhood trauma. This year is filled with pain, endless tears and challenges. I start to realise that my family isnt perfect to what the child me perceived. My parents are constantly arguing everyday, throwing hurtful words and never did discuss things like what normal adults do. My mum is a narcissist. She treats me like a therapist and not as her daughter, constantly invading my privacy every time im in my room just to complain to me about my dad. As a result, i take on many roles, My mum has an unreasonable expectation of me, i had to be the ‘perfect daughter’ , i had to do chores (gender stereotype), listen to her rants about my dad even when im studying for exams and when i dont do it, i will seem like the most heartless person ever and she will start guilt tripping me. 

The thing is, im not the only child, i have siblings but i feel as tho i am facing this shit alone.  I have 2 brothers, A and B. And one married sister. My sister was once in my shoes, but now shes married and  living her best life. One of my brother, A, is 28 years old n jobless for years, is the golden child of my mum. He gets away from everything. For eg, if i was using my phone in front of the presence of my mum during my free time, i will get scolded , cursed etc. But when my brother does it in front of her, she acts all blind. Talk about double standard. There was once my mum, asked for some of my money during my internship because she needed to buy groceries. Hell was i mad, bcos i was the youngest child and was still studying at that point of time and my brother was the oldest in the family but did not get asked for his money. There was once, i had an emotional outburst that i argued with my mum based on the favoritsm she has over my brother, but she goes all defensive over my brother. 

My mum have hypertension since she gave birth to me. But one of the most traumatic experience that i had when i was a child was, there was once my mum was super angry(i cnnt remember what reason) she pointed knife towards my face and was threatening me. The child me was confused, like was that a normal thing? I remember hiding below the living room table crying bucket of tears and no one was there to empathise. I had to soothe myself. There was also once , i got pulled harshly from the roots of my hair by my mum forcing me to come bcos i didnt want to join the family for festive due to my major exam. My mum is unpredictable. Despite all the scary encounter, she wont apologise. She can act all normal afterwards like nothing had happened. And then suddenly become angry again. I live in confusion trying to predict her mood. Ill talk about my dad and my other brother B some other time, they all have a fair share of manipulative character.

Both my parents are emotionally unavailable. Living in toxic family is mentally and emotionally exhausting especially when youre an empath and you unconsciously take in their negative energy. I struggled with depression and anxiety living in this dysfunctional family and it sucks more trying to hide from them that im going for therapy.  I just hope to move out soon with my sister after she gave birth and get her own housing. I feel like im losing my sanity at times. 

(Thank you for taking the time to read my story, love you all endlessly, we are all strong and we will survive this toxic environment💖)"

I’m just seeking some advice because I honestly don’t know where to go from here. I thought that Econ and accounting was where my passion really was but after getting rekted by Econ 1 and Econ 2 I’m really unsure of where to go from here. After getting a bad grade in Econ 1 I studied so much for Econ 2 to make sure I’d get a better grade but I think that the curve completely screwed me over. I went to CLAS, CLAS drop-in, every section, did the reading a week in advance, and consistently did practice problems. I scored the average on my Econ 2 exams and ended up doing even worse than I did on Econ 1. The averages was surprisingly high this quarter. My GPA has been getting lower quarter by quarter and it has made me feel terrible. I’m at a loss for what to do because I don’t have an interest or passion for any of the other majors and I’m not sure if  I can catch up at this point. I also think that my GPA has pretty much ruined my chances for potential internships or grad school. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks. "

We have a large number of products, and each product takes some amount of money to initially create (graphics for the cover, paying editorial staff, etc.). This is a one-time cost. Then there are costs to actually print/distribute the books. For example, book 1 costs $20,000 to initially create and costs $10 per unit to manufacture. My question is: how do I allocate (or account for) this initial one-time fixed cost in the final per unit cost of the product? Everything I read online assumes that you know the number of units sold (or will sell) when figuring out the costs per product. However, since we don’t know how much each product/book will sell, I don’t know to figure these initial costs into the costing model. Thanks!"

The company website is www.gateworks.com, it's a pretty small company with &lt; 50 employees but it's been a great place to work. We would be looking for a 3rd/4th year CPE that's at least gone through CPE357 and a couple of the digital design classes. During the internship you'd be working with low level firmware written in C and bash scripting for regression testing. There's also a fair amount of hardware troubleshooting on new designs so it's perfect for people that enjoy both hardware and software. Depending on your interest there's plenty more to learn about general Linux development and microcontrollers. If things go well then the possibility of full time employment is there as well. 

If you or someone you know would be interested or has questions then please feel free to pm me! Thanks.

EDIT0: We'll be accepting new applicants/resumes until the end of next week (2018-6-29). The following week we'll be scheduling phone and/or in person interviews.

I've been here and JNMIL, for myself and for FH. He always reads my posts and we are just extremely grateful for the support as we navigate his justnofamily. Thank you. 

So you guys helped him with his decision to attend SILs graduation. He decided not to go. He was invited very late, we had no reason to expect an invitation. Why? That's because the last time he saw her (3 years ago) he'd been kicked out of his house while working for money and finishing his degree with an online class AND an unpaid internship. Why you ask? Because SIL got caught going to gay-straight alliance meetings and blamed her SG brother because years before she'd told him she thought she was bi, and he told her not to tell the parents. Because MIL is extremely pray-the-gay away and previously took FH for exorcisms as a child. So, to protect her. At this time, he was not allowed to interact with her at all. That was never officially ended, either. Just rug swept like it never happened. 

He decided he felt like he should go out of fear, obligation, and guilt, and decided ""no I can't make it"" was a complete sentence. We traveled 1200 miles to my home city for a impossibly short weekend to work on wedding stuff and take engagement photos that same weekend. There really wasn't time to travel to fh's home city to pretend to be a happy family.

Someone somewhere was playing a violin. He got messages from FILs side (grandparents, aunt and uncle) beseeching him to come see them as they are in from out of state. 

He politely replied that he would have loved to have seen them, but we had made advance plans in devilvaginas home city for wedding prep, and the late notice combined with not expecting an invitation made it impossible this trip.

This worked some serious magic. And actually ended up opening up a positive line of communication with FIL's side of the family. Take that MIL. 

We had a pleasant weekend. 

Then we had to tackle letting MIL know she wasn't invited to the wedding. That was today. 

FH doesn't want his abuser at our wedding. Even if that means FIL and SIL don't come. We've know this for about 300 days, judging by my post history. FH is sure in his decision, and me and my family back him regardless. (Two year engagement what what)

Thank you u/ejdknit for the preferred method. FH called FIL and told him directly. ""We are only inviting you and SIL to wedding.""

FIL asked him to reconsider. FH said ""we only want people who love and support us at our wedding"" FIL had no argument.  (!!!!)

FIL said ""I'll have to talk to your mother about this. It may only be me who comes, or only SIL, or both of us."" 

FIL said he was glad FH told him. (!!!) 

FH stood firm and didn't JADE and I'm so proud. 

So it went better than expected. FH had a bit of a cry at the idea of FIL not attending the wedding. Said it made it real. Said if he doesn't come it's his loss, and he meant it about people who love and support us. He says he feels a huge weight off his chest. 


So now we wait. See what MIL does. Probably a) play the victim b) blow a fuse c) mount smear campaign 

Or some combination. Regardless. It's done for now. It feels right. And we owe a lot of that to your support. So thank you.

I am a 23-year old student from Sweden that just moved to NY for an internship at a market research company located in Hoboken, NJ. I am currently living at the company apartment and am looking for something more permanent.

About me: As mentioned, I am a 23-year old student from Chalmers University in Sweden. I just finished my B.sc. in industrial engineering and management, and just got hired as an intern for a year at a market research company. After this year I plan on going back to Chalmers to finish my 2 year m.sc. 
On my spare time I enjoy going on adventures, going out grabbing a beer, excercising various sports (lately i've been quite into badminton), playing video games, and much much more.

Please contact me via PM if you need any more information about me.

Take care!"
8s5crf,0,2018-06-18,"To study now, or to study later - that is the question",mattressmoney,LSAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/8s5crf/to_study_now_or_to_study_later_that_is_the/,"So, I took the June LSAT and, although I didn't feel like it went horribly, I still feel like I didn't do as well as I could've done. I didn't realize how much anxiety would factor into my test, as I've done plenty of practice tests and figured I had nothing to worry about. For reference, I didn't complete the final LG section, and only was able to come up with two BS answers, while bubbling in A for the other 3 for it since I froze after the setting it up. This isn't unusual, and I've hit my desired 170 doing this before, but I went fast to get there and certainly made mistakes elsewhere (possible -5, or even -7 tbh). And, although the other sections were perfectly fine time-wise, I don't trust my anxiety-addled brain to have nearly flawlessly executed them. 

With that said, I'm going to assume I'll have to retake the LSAT. I'm debating on whether to take it in September or in November. If I do September, I'll have the benefit of being able to start studying, now, with basically the same skill set as I left off with. The problem is that, I'm working an internship rn and I am just absolutely mentally exhausted after work, and studying for the LSAT is super difficult. I could take it in November/December after I've finished and have been in school, however that means that I'll have to recover my skills/habits and this would preclude me from doing a fall internship or, likely, from seriously applying to law schools straight out of undergrad - even though I peg my wanting to do that to a 10% chance. What am I to do?"
8s5l1o,23,2018-06-18,24M moving out. Mom (54F) is devastated but refuses help. I'm worried about her... what can I do?,marsmarl,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8s5l1o/24m_moving_out_mom_54f_is_devastated_but_refuses/,"Earlier this month, I (24M) moved out from my mom's (54F) house for real for the first time. When I was in college, I actually did live away from home in dorms in this same city for all four years (about 1.5 hours away), and even did an internship on the west coast for four months. My mom was generally fine with it, even with some surprising glimpses of support. But now, I think she is in a very different place. No pets at home, turmoil with a neighbor, and if I'm not around, the only thing she pours her time into is work (which involves a lot of working from a now very empty home).

To me, this seems like textbook empty nest syndrome, but what also is stirred into the guilt pot is the fact that my mom had to endure over a decade in court to regain custody of me as a child and ""now I am abandoning her"". Deep down, I do appreciate the hardship she went through and feel like I was raised in a better place for it, but at the end of the day, as harsh as it sounds, I didn't choose that and don't feel like it is healthy to frame that as my debt to repay. It feels extremely co-dependent and toxic to expect this of me. She is not dependent on me financially or for health or anything like that. My mom is constantly bringing up how she didn't abandon me, and my pointing out that she is comparing the situation to her young \*child\* is brushed away instantly.

She feels that I could live at home and take public transit up to the city (many people do this; it makes for a very long day, but isn't uncommon). I know I could very well do this, but I want to live here in the big city. I want to live on my own, I want to have my own room in an apartment, I want to be surrounded by young people in an area that actually has things going on. And of course these reasons are selfish, but I feel like not inherently bad reasons. My mom is grasping at straws saying I'm only doing this to keep up with my friends and I think I'm \*so\* grown up at 24 years old (you know, mid-twenties, over half a decade since I've legally been an adult).

It's not healthy. And it's not that I think I'm in the wrong. It's that I know my mom is short-tempered and stubborn at her worst, and I worry that my choice will have her make very rash and drastic decisions as a result. I remember a very shocking moment from the past, when I got my first girlfriend in college, my mom was in similar shambles for about two months, and when I returned home from school, I found out she gave away (""gave away"") 2 of our 3 cats while overwhelmed with stress and coping with my decision that she interpreted as something that would pull me away from home... It wasn't to spite me and whenever it comes up now, it's with intense regret and sadness. I'm glossing over how fucked that entire situation was, only using it to point out the she has made severe decisions in the past and I am genuinely worried with how she is coping mentally and where this might lead her...

I keep suggesting counselling because this is a VERY common thing that MANY people go through. But she has had to go through counselling in the past (custody battle) and has a negative perception of it and disregards this advice. I recommend her getting out into the community and pursuing hobbies, and finding meaning elsewhere, and she is not receptive to that either. To be fair, she has pursued volunteering and yoga and things like that in the past, but is quick to burn bridges and become fed up with groups and people. She has no close friends and has cut contact from all of her family. She spends most of her time solo now. Working at the computer until late, going for walks, some events in the community here and there, but I'm worried she is not happy and hasn't \*really\* realized she is not happy and this is the tipping moment where she feels all of that crashing in at once is crumbles.

I know I'm not in the wrong. I'm just here living my life. But my god, the guilt... I get calls late in the day from my mom, just weeping saying how this is not fair and how she didn't abandon me and she fought so hard to have family. I'm worried for her. I'm worried about what she might do. As a result, I've been visiting home more often than I should to appease here and keep her ""stable"". It definitely sets a bad precedent, but she is in shambles and I'm genuinely concerned she is a few steps away from suicidal. I always knew my moving out would be a huge storm to contend with. I have no idea how to help someone who doesn't want help, but can not even imagine how I would cope if something serious happens in response to my decision.

**TL;DR** Mom is taking my moving out extremely hard. I know what I'm doing is fine and normal, but genuinely worry that she is losing will to live. She refuses any recommendations for therapy or finding hobbies. What can I do?"
8s5oid,20,2018-06-18,"CMV: From an economic perspective, post-secondary tech graduates in Canada have no reason to stay in Canada for work when the opportunities in America are so much greater.",NoblesseNobleman,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/8s5oid/cmv_from_an_economic_perspective_postsecondary/,"I'm an undergrad student majoring in computer science at a large Canadian university (also a Canadian citizen).  Around 15&amp;#37;  of my peers who work in related tech fields plan to stay in the country for personal reasons such as family.  The remaining 85&amp;#37;  plan to move to the US for work after graduation, and for good reason.

The disparity in compensation is simply astounding. In America, working as a software engineer for a mid to large company as a NEW GRAD can easily give 130k-150k USD in compensation. In Canada you'd be very fortunate to be offered even 80k CAD in comparison. Throw in the conversion rate and you could easily be looking at 2.5x the level of compensation. The number of perks offered at some of these companies also contributes to the disparity; you can survive off eating company provided food at many places, along with gym memberships, haircuts, childcare services and many more. That level of perks is something that is quite rare in Canada. A large portion of American tech corporations also offer excellent healthcare benefits along with compensation, so that throws Canada's healthcare advantage out the window.  NYC, Austin, and Seattle all have similar costs of living in comparison to major Canadian cities like Vancouver and Toronto while offering far greater compensation.

Even now as an undergraduate, I have a friend working at an internship for a larger tech company in Vancouver at 21$ CAD an hour (roughly 3000 CAD a month), while another friend in the same circle is making 7250 USD (9425 CAD) a month at Microsoft in Seattle just a two hour drive away. With housing completely covered.

I simply don't see an economic reason for me to bring my skills to the Canadian workforce when I can be offered so much more in America. It also doesn't help that some places in Canada even brag about paying its tech workers less: [http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/city-of-vancouver-criticized-for-boasting-about-low-pay-of-its-tech-workers-in-amazon-hq-bid](http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/city-of-vancouver-criticized-for-boasting-about-low-pay-of-its-tech-workers-in-amazon-hq-bid).

It's a shame because I do feel that Canada is such a great place to live in.  I do feel slightly safer in Canada than the states overall, and I also feel that the cities tend to be a little bit cleaner, but that is nowhere near enough to incentivize me to stay. Also, please refrain from bringing in politics to the discussion!

Edit: This is regarding new graduates in Canada given an opportunity to work in America.

8s683q,4,2018-06-19,Career Advice - Negotiate Raise/Find a New Gig/Lower Expectations?,cosmetichemE,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/8s683q/career_advice_negotiate_raisefind_a_new_giglower/,"Hey r/ChemE - I'm seeking some opinions on my particular situation.

So I'm a 2014 graduate (BS, ChemE, 3.5gpa). I started as a R&amp;D lab technician at a major cosmetics company in the summer of 2014 (hourly, temp, low pay), then was hired on as a R&amp;D process engineer the following spring in April 2015 (salary, benefits, permanent). 

My job mainly consists of scale up for new products, travel to plants for new launches and troubleshooting existing products, working with relevant regulatory documentation (SPF products). I've also gotten the opportunity to work as a manager for summer interns over the past two years,  having someone work under me for 12 weeks on a project of my design. Since I've started in the engineering department, I've been promoted once, associate engineer to process engineer.

Here's my issue: I started at around 68k, 5% bonus potential. Today after 3 review cycles, yearly raises, and with a promotion under my belt, I am at 76k, only 11% higher than my starting salary, with 0 change in benefits, bonus potential, etc. I'm pretty disappointed with this growth, especially given that I've clearly become one of the more trusted, valued members of the team in my age group. I travel the most out of the group in any age range (up around 30% when the position lists at up to 10%). I have been given management opportunities that others haven't, both in high level projects, and managing/training entry team members. I feel I've taken on the responsibilities of someone who is more well paid than I am. If you're saying to yourself that the salary numbers seem alright - I live in a very expensive area (Greater NYC).

So my question is: what do you think I should do? Are my expectations for early career growth just too high and I should just appreciate my pretty good situation? Should I attempt to negotiate a bigger raise? How would I go about that? Should I just cut bait and find a new job in a cheaper area?

Let me know what you think r/ChemE!"

I made this appointment in April while I was depressed but for a couple of days I've been feeling like my very motivated self again, I've made some big plans and applied to dozens of internships I'm honestly not really qualified for (but somehow my confident attitude has helped me in the past).  

If it turns out that I got the internship (feels like I did good on the programming test and waiting for their response) I'm the most excited about I don't want to feel dull because of the Tegretol (this is a software engineering internship) and I'd like to use this headspace to study 15+ hours a day so I can actually contribute something.

So is it a bad plan to just ride this out and when I feel the depression creeping back in (I can always tell when it starts) I start taking Tegretol?

I'm not your intern.",HimawariHyuuga,IDontWorkHereLady,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/8s6swu/no_sir_im_not_your_intern/,"In my line of work, we usually get invited to different places to speak. One time, I was invited by a company as a guest lecturer. I arrived bright and early - perhaps way too early, since there were no people in the conference room and nobody from the HR office greeted me. 

Since I had an hour to kill, I sent a quick text to my contact person to let her know I had arrived. She responded that she was on her way, and that I could wait in their staff lounge for the meantime.

I followed her texted instructions to locate the lounge, then settled into the couch for a quick round of Summoner's War while I waited. 

About twenty minutes later, a tall, balding man entered the lounge. He was frowning, with 'grump' written all over his facial expression. He clattered around in the kitchen area, banged a few cupboard doors, and then turned around to face me.

""You!"" He pointed at me with gritted teeth. ""Get me a damn cup of coffee if you want to keep interning here!""

I stood up. ""I'm sorry, but I don't work here--""

""Oh, shut  up."" He lunged forward so he was right in front of me. ""You lazy, entitled brats think you can just sit and play games on your phones all day!""

At this point, I realized he thought I was one of his interns, and that he was not open to discussion. It wasn't an uncommon occurrence, either. I'm a tiny, baby-faced person and I'm often mistaken for a highschooler. 

Still, I was not in the mood to be yelled at. I took a deep breath and attempted to explain again, but once again he interrupted me with a tirade of abuse.

At this point, the door opened and a tentative intern - a real one - meekly informed him that he needed to head to the conference room for a seminar. The man glared at me and left, and after a couple of minutes, my contact person arrived to collect me.

When we arrived at the venue, the room was packed and one of their vice presidents was reading my CV by way of introducing me to the participants. When he announced my name, I stepped in, thanked him, and shook his hand warmly.

I will never forget the look of horror that crossed his face when he realized that he had yelled at me and called me lazy earlier.

Does anyone know if the founders have said much about their philosophy on staffing for customer support and focusing on quality/ ethical returns experiences? 

In the US at least I know that tech companies will often outsource their customer support labor to maddening automated telephone menus and/ or extremely underpaid overseas employees reading off of a similar flow chart of answers that the telephone bots operate from. Or to interns. I think it's pretty rare here to have customer support staff who are as skilled or paid for their skills as they need to be to run a noncorrupt company. ReMarkable could garner critical support and stand out above the other companies by simply having tech support and return policies that satisfy customers, buying them widespread trust and therefore time to make the software changes they need to to make the product we all are so freaking psyched about. I think focusing on that aspect is the cornerstone of any sustainable business. 

ReMarkable staff, if you're reading this, know that LOTS of people read the Amazon customer reviews and talk and pay attention to which companies are worth buying from versus which will just lead to getting stranded with a piece of expensive defunct product. Customers that don't get to return defunct products get MAD and talk. Your product can help people!! Help your employees help your customers and you will establish a brand that people trust, admire, and brag about all over the tech blogs and other less visible spheres of communication. &lt;3

Monday morning I looked at his Instagram and all his pictures of us were gone. I obviously was like wtf so first I texted him. When he didn’t respond I called him and he said he didn’t know what happened but they were all up. 

Sure enough I went back and there they all were there. A little later in the day I discover the archive button on Instagram. I’m sure that’s what he did. When I confronted him about it, he said he didn’t know what that was and that they all just came back up as soon as he logged back into Instagram.

I want to believe him, I really do. We were doing well and I was about to tell him I loved him. But I can’t get the idea out of my head that he did that because he was talking to another girl.

Just a general and brief review of what has been happening in rookie mini-camp, organized team activities, and mandatory mini-camp. Regular training camp will start on July 26 so expect more then on all open practices.

---

**General:**

- As this is all the early stuff there are no pads, so take all notes with a huge grain of salt.
- Former players Brandon Jackson (RB), Jarret Bush (DB), and Nick Barnett (LB) are back as coaching interns.
- Other than Bulaga, McCarthy has no concerns about player availability for the start of real training camp.
- A brief fight breaks out during team drills. Patrick (G/C) was punching a defensive player in the stomach.

**Offense:**

- Graham (TE) has really connected with Rodgers (QB) early in camp. Connecting on many big plays.
- Allison (WR) is locked in at WR3 so far.
- Kumerow (WR) getting a lot of looks on offense.
- Aaron Jones (RB) taking snaps lined up outside like a WR.
- Rodgers (QB) opens red zone team period with TD pass to Graham (TE).
- Marcedes Lewis (TE) with a nice over the shoulder TD catch from Kizer (QB).
- Ripkowski (FB) &amp; Kerridge (FB) the first two out each practice.
- Kyle Murphy two real nice reps in o-line drills.
- Really like the first impression of Tim Boyle (QB). Live arm with good accuracy and demeanor.
- For one day the first team OL is Bakhtiari (OT) - Patrick (G/C) - Day (C) - McCray (OL) - Pankey (OT).
- As noted, McCray (G) is getting all the first team looks at RG.
- Tonyan (TE) showing off his hands on a quick pass from Hundley (QB). Explosion after the catch too.
- Valdes-Scantling (WR) standing out the most of the rookie receivers.
- Kizer (QB) throws a beautiful 44 yard pass to Kumerow (WR) who catches the over the shoulder pass.
- 22 yard Touchdown pass to St Brown (WR) from Hundley (QB) to end first two minute series.
- Hundley (QB) hits EQSB (WR), covered by Alexander (CB), in back corner of end zone for TD.
- Emanuel Byrd (TE) had three straight TDs in red zone period. Someone to keep an eye on.
- Boyle (QB) throws a 37 yard TD to Michael Clark (WR) in two minute drill. Good drive by Boyle.
- Next play EQSB (WR) drops an easy pass over the middle. Having some drop issues.
- Devante Mays (RB) with another nice run. He’s looked good today.
- Moore (WR) showing up early and often pulling up really difficult TD pass over Pipkins (CB) in the back corner.
- Nice run with great vision and a precise and well-timed cut by Jamaal Williams (RB).
- Rodgers (QB) threads needle to Geronimo (WR) on the sidelines who makes contested catch with House (CB) in fantastic coverage. Not sure if feet were in but a gorgeous throw/catch. Next play back to Allison for TD.

**Defense:**

- Ahmad Thomas (LB) gets a pick at end of pass under pressure period. Defense fired up. Second pick of day.
- Rodgers (QB) gave some unsolicited praise to CB Goodson during interview session.
- Alexander (CB) is on a different level in fundamental drills. Ability to flip his hips and explode is the real deal.
- Pipkins (CB) and Brown (CB) both looked real smooth in corner drills too. Honorable mention to Waters (CB).
- Jaire (CB) with great coverage and a diving pass breakup covering Jake Kumerow (WR).
- Josh Jackson (CB) bringing the pressure on a corner blitz for a “sack” on Brett Hundley (QB).
- Josh Jackson (CB) breaks up a pass from Tim Boyle (QB) in end zone.
- One player consistently standing out on defense in camp: Vince Biegel (EDGE).
- Jackson (CB) this time with great coverage on Davante (WR). Mirrored him across field and stuck with him.
- Raven Greene (S) looking good in camp, grabs another pick in the red zone.
- Alexander (CB) routinely getting praised for coverage, if a bit grabby, throughout camp against all WRs.
- Montravius Adams (DT) with a “sack” on 3rd down. Split Spriggs (OT) and McCray (G).
- Waters (CB) looked good so far. Plays confident and has good agility and toughness.
- Alexander (CB) snaps a pick off Rodgers (QB) off a back shoulder pass intended for Allison (WR) in red zone.

**Special Teams:**

- Triner (LS) gets first reps at long snapper. Bradley (LS) put last three snaps on ground.
- JK Scott (P) is punting again today. He has some tremendous hang time on his kicks. It’s impressive so far.
- Monty (RB) getting first look as the return man.
- JK Scott (P) punting from midfield (pinning the football deep), here were his final 7 unofficial hangtimes: 3.93, 4.13, 4.62, 4.23, 4.55, 4.45, 4.55. Took some time to get going, but pretty consistent once he did.

DR. V: Lying is an ugly habit. But, that’s my opinion. So, I’ll just ask this once, are you sure you want to stick to your current story? ( she sighs ) I don’t care either way. Honestly, I wanted to just terminate you. But, it’s the twenty-first century, my colleagues have changed things over the years.

0198: ( after a long moment of silence, he clears his throat ) I wasn’t looking for it. It just—

DR. V: ( finishing his sentence ) ...popped up out of nowhere? I’ve heard that one before. The first two times, sure, I entertained the idea…

0198: I thought it was some kind of joke! Jesus, I didn’t even think about any of it until I started thinking about it all!

DR. V: Everyone is aware of it, you’re just the one idiot that seems to think you’re in a fantasy novel where you’re the only one to stop the apparent danger.

0198: Do you— do ANY of you actually do any good? Do you? What the fuck is even in that bottom level?!

DR. V: If I told you, I’d have to edit it out of the audio. I don’t want the extra work.

0198: What are you going to do to me? Kill me?

DR. V: ( putting her pen down and leaning back in her chair ) Detached.

0198: What—

DR. V: That’s one word that I’d use for myself. I’m going to be very honest with you, █████, and that’s something I rarely do. But, for you, a man who I thought would have been dead after his first day, I’ll entertain the idea of being as honest as I can be. Or, at least as honest as I can manage.

0198: I’m going to die…

DR. V: When you came here, what was the first room they showed you? I suggested 0005, but, that was considered too much. “Ease them into it.”, that’s what L said. So, which was it?

0198: ( quietly, almost a whisper ) the girl…

DR. V: That’s no better, but knowing if someone can handle that sort of situation is important, I guess. 0019. She wasn’t mine to handle, I think I was still working with Z on 0012 during that time. You see, 0012 seems docile enough, but, it only became that way after we realized it missed the moon. ( chuckle ) Any idea what it was like to tell Z that I was going to put in a window?

( a small pause, dr. v seems to hum in response to an answer 0198 didn’t give )

DR. V: You start to piece together what he is actually feeling after a while of working with him. But… ( she tries to gather her thoughts ) Right. 0019.

0198: How old is she?

DR. V: How old does someone have to be to get pity from another?

( 0198 is silent, as if slowly realizing what dr. v means. )

DR. V: Mm… You had a daughter. I suppose 0019 felt they would gain the most pity from you with that idea. However, I wonder if you would want to know what she looks like to me?

0198: I don’t think you would pity anything. You don’t look like you pity anyone but yourself.

DR. V: I suppose you feel I deserve that. But, if you knew as much as you think you do, you’d know the answer.

0198: What, does she look like a vacation to you?

DR. V: She can’t take on those kinds of mirages. No, when I first was introduced to her, she shifted her form several times. I think she was confused, most of her go-to forms weren’t getting her anywhere. Not with me, at least.

0198: That proves my point.

DR. V: She isn’t a child, you know. She’s fairly old, actually. I believe her age is around ██ years, but that’s an educated guess. Gray hair, long and down to her knees. I asked L why they hadn’t bothered to get her a chair to sit in, and she gave me a puzzled look. As if I knew something even she had forgotten about.

0198: Wouldn’t ...I mean, she’d get pity in that—

DR. V: Logical thought remains at times. You see a child and consider the life they won’t get to experience if they continue to reside behind a thick wall. Or, in her case, with her hands cut off and her lips sealed shut. Shifting for visual response was the best she could settle for given her other tricks were dealt with accordingly.

0198: Her mouth— it’s sealed shut?? What the fuck—

DR. V: I guess she didn’t let you see that. I’d of personally let her keep her mouth. Sound canceling headphones could fix that, but, like I said, I wasn’t involved with her. She has a chair in her room because of me. She’s in pain.

0198: Maybe because you fucks cut her hands off and—

DR. V: ( ignoring him ) 0019 is suffering from her own stigma. A secondary side effect that must have manifested between the time she was captured to even now. I know she didn’t feel that pain her entire life, she wouldn’t have been so uncomfortable and pitiful if she had lived with it for so long.

0198: How do you know she didn’t just find the one thing that got you to pity her?

DR. V: That’s a clever boy, now you’re showing your smarts.

0198: So?

DR. V: █████, I said I was going to be honest with you. And, I’m afraid I was lying about something… but, never mind that. I’ll answer your question. I know it wasn’t a mere trick because I could see the one thing that told me she was in pain.

0198: What was it.

DR. V: No one bothered to give her a change of clothes during her time here. If they had seen the blood that trailed down from her stomach, they would have bothered to look for her kin before it was too late.

( there’s a moment of brief silence. 0198 seems to be processing what was said. )

0198: ...what the fuck…

DR. V: I had some of the interns perform a ceremony and cremation with her present. It doesn’t make her like this place, but it gained me some of her respect. I’m not a complete monster.

0198: ...What… did you mean by you having lied to me before?

DR. V: You didn’t find anything special, █████. Not in regards to knowledge, at least. But, if you hadn’t been so curious, maybe you wouldn’t have been in this situation.

0198: What situation? What— ( 0198 begins to become more panicked ) What the fuck is going on?!

DR. V: We can be cruel. I know that, but it’s apart of the job. I mean, it’s not like we decided to make a petting zoo. But, I suppose the pity I have now is knowing 0019 could have been without her pain. Now, she’s going to hate me. It’ll be like any other day.

( 0198 is no longer listening, instead, he is trying to get up from his chair. he is tugging at his restraints and screaming. he is resorting to vulgar language before he is heard to be in extreme pain. dr. v continues to speak normally despite this. )

DR. V: The baby was interesting. I felt like I owed it something, which is odd, I never felt much over what we keep here. I think it even thought of me as a parent.

( 0198’s screams are loud, and his anguish is obvious, until there’s a sound of flesh tearing apart. then nothing. )

DR. V: Truth be told, it couldn’t be content with just having it’s odd form. It wanted more. Even knowing it would kill it…

DR. Z: You could have let me handle it.

DR. V: This is my lesson, so why make you do it. I’m already going to be dealing with the paperwork, unless…

DR. Z: No.

DR. V: Eh. Worth a shot.

[ END OF AUDIO. ]

Note from Dr. V:

“I apologize for my weakness. In the time we have all been working together, I was always the one being distant. But, I guess I have my weaknesses. I won’t allow this to be a repeated event. As of ████████ ██, 0019 has been terminated. I made the decision with Dr. Z. The room she was in will not be reused. It will serve as my reminder. When we try to be humane, we should remember to plan two graves.”"
8s8hrt,9,2018-06-19,What's your experience with job/opportunities in Canada?,_foxwhite,3Dmodeling,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dmodeling/comments/8s8hrt/whats_your_experience_with_jobopportunities_in/,"Hey all, I've been thinking about moving to Canada for some time, and need proper advice regarding that.

So, shortly about me: living in UK (originally from Poland), working as a programmer atm. I've been diving into 3D modelling few times, starting, shortly after stopping, again starting, and so on. My original idea after coming to UK, was to learn properly 3D, as I know only basics. I used Blender and most recently Maya, and I don't mind using either. I'm really into video games, especially VR and that's what would probably be my main target if I decided to go that way.

Now onto the topic. Can anyone describe their experience with opportunities in Canada? What companies are exactly looking for? What software is more preferable, what other programs it is useful to know? Where in Canada are a lot of video game studios? I know only of Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal for now.

As for education, any good universities or good private schools, courses? (But not crazy expensive) I've done some reasearch already on that, and the very good ones are really, really expensive...

Preferably, I would want to move to Canada asap but I still gotta save some money so it's not that important. I gotta spend some time to actually learn, which is most important after all. This is my main question here actually: How good should I become to even consider moving there, and having a chance to get a job somewhere? (junior or paid internship even) It's a pretty general question, I realize that, and that it might be difficult to answer but anybody with some useful experience/info (Canadians very welcome;) )regarding my whole ""plan"" will really help me, and might help me realize how I should approach all this. If you need more info about me, let me know.

Thanks a lot!

Bottom left box is the info about whatever territory you currently have selected. You can see how previous days battles have gone for a territory by clicking on the logo beneath the day.

* **Enemies: Florida, Clemson, Michigan**  
  
* Other contributions we can use on top of your action votes each day is memes and recruiting. If you know other Badger redditors or where they gather please encourage them to join in the game. Our power seems to have plateaued and we'll need more as end of game approaches. If memes are your thing the meme game in /r/CFBRisk is as strong as anywhere on reddit.

* Please Keep Recruiting! Every soldier we can get is one we can use somewhere! Don't make alternate accounts or bots to vote for us but if you can convince your friends to help out we would appreciate it! Your Facebook group chats, discords, twitter, anywhere you think we will have sympathizers.  
  
**New Developments:**  
  
* Well we have 2 territories still, just not the same ones. Whyoming and Syracuse. [We were actually outnumbered in every single territory we had sub 40% odds for winning any territory.](https://i.imgur.com/mopCoU9.png) We are split 1 west 1 east again.  
   
* If you are just joining us today DEFEND WHYOMING     
	
* It was a bad night for the reds overall, lots of land lost our West and alot of fires to put out. Stanford got wiped in the East so they will be in the west. Bama is low on territory again.	 
  
* Florida had some ungodly RNG, they won pretty much everything they fought in. But this also spreads them very thin to attack and defend everything. Michigan consolidated more territory but Ohio took Ann Arbor so that should rile up the base to defend things. GT is mostly good save for 2 red spots. Chaos is down to 2 spots, and they aren't easy departure points either.    
  
* If you aren't on the PM bot, and want to be, please message us!     
  
* In the event Wisconsin is eliminated we are not sure what path we will take. We WOULD ask that everyone keeps playing, be it as chaos to sabatoge the blues or as a blue player. The reason for this is to 1) help our alliance atleast win, and 2) help people gain more turns played for awards and a potential bonus next season for playing a long time in this one.  
  
* Job. So my internship started Monday, and as such the way orders getting messaged out will be at essentially one of 3 times. It could be in the morning before 8 A.M., during the noon lunch hour, or after I get back from work. The goal is to have the first of the 3, and then noon, and then Worst case is right after work. We have been working with Red Command to streamline the process so you can get your orders as soon as you can.  "

**About Me**

My name is Joseph Leszner, and I am a graduate student in the Master of Human Kinetics program at the University of Ottawa. I am a student member of the Canadian Sport Psychology Association (CSPA), and training to become a Mental Performance Consultant (MPC). I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, and have also obtained my Mental Health First Aid certification from the Mental Health Commission of Canada. I am a former competitive video game player, and have played in many high stakes tournaments. The highlight of my career was competing for $70,000 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was during this experience where I started to understand how various pressures could influence my performance. My goal is to provide you with the support that I wish I had when I was competing competitively. I believe that by increasing self-awareness and positive thinking, you can learn to make more effective choices, increasing the likelihood that you will perform optimally when you need to. It is extremely important to me to develop strong relationships with the athletes I work with, because it allows the work we do together to be the most effective.

**What is a Mental Performance Consultant?**

An MPC is similar to a sports psychologist. The main distinction between the two is that sports psychologists make clinical diagnosis (i.e. depression) and focus on performance, whereas MPCs just focus on performance. The job of an MPC is to help increase the likelihood that athletes will perform optimally when they need to, in sport and in life. We help athletes accomplish this by teaching them various mental skills. Gaining self-awareness, thinking more positively, goal setting, improving focus, and enhancing self-regulation strategies are some of the many skills that can be learned while working with an MPC. The goal is to teach, inform, and support athletes in the practice of these mental skills for optimal performance and living. We can accomplish these goals through individual and/or group consultations, as well as mental skills workshops.

Note: MPCs are not clinical psychologists and therefore cannot diagnose and treat mental disorders.

I will preface by saying this will be a temporary thing, but can be good money if you have some spare time.

I'm currently in the process of building out a web-store for my father. It's on Magento 2 open source. The website has been live for about a week, and everything looks stable. If a problem were to arise you would be expected to assist me on correcting issues on the back end.

Otherwise you will be adding all our products into the webstore using custom attributes to match the products you're adding. A spreadsheet will be provided for you to reference your data points from.

I dated and was engaged to her for 7 years. I moved across country so she could do her internship and residency and fellowship. Through the course of this the sex started to change, she did not want to have sex with me when she used to all the time. I provided for her and changed my career path so that she could be on an upward trajectory. Then right before we are supposed to move across country so that she can work she decides to tell me ""I just don't love you anymore it feels like we have been roomates"". I gave her space and then went to stay with family. I later came back to the house and she was with another guy there and it absolutely crushed me. I told her to get out and then started to pile her stuff. She came back and I broke down and said I wanted her back (I was in a state of shock). She said she needed time to think about it. I left again and then checked my facebook messenger and there was a message from 2016 that she had been cheating on me with another guy for over 5 years... I confronted her about this and then stopped talking to her and told her family. A week later was her graduation from her interventional cardiology fellowship and I was not there, she cancelled the graduation party. Apparently her family came, but I received a call at 1am from her and she was crying and saying how her family abandoned her. At the end of our conversation she said I love you, and I said it back to her (stupid of me). Anyways then I sent some angry texts about exposing her and she said she did not know what was happening to me. I snooped around and I'm pretty sure she is marrying this new guy. Which totally crushes me even more. She never came clean, she always said she was messed up in the head from her father cheating on her mother all the time. I literally moved the world to be with her and supported her all this time and she doesn't care. I am pretty sure she moved across country now, I still have to go back to the rented house and get all of my stuff out. I honestly for the last month or so of DDAY have been wanting to get her back. I know some of my past habits were bad, but she cheated for our whole relationship.. How does one get past that? I had everything planned out and we were engaged. The real fucked up thing is she still has facebook and has all of our pictures up there including engagement photos? How did I fall in love with a monster like that? I don't even know why I am writing this I just am super down. I have been working out twice a day and like the gains but that doesn't really help me keep my mind off of it. It's like I am experiencing that same moment over and over again. She is not regretful and was gas lighting me the whole time. Any advice on when this gets better or how to forget about her? I initiated NC by not texting her for the last week but I am worried and still wonder where she is.

Edit: Just blocked her on facebook it felt good. Time to gain some peace of mind.

Edit 2: Well some friends forced me to go out and introduced me to some girls. I ended up getting a bit lucky and I feel like a new person. Not only am I attractive but successful and will only continue to grow as a person. Thank you to everyone for your kind words, not sure if I am fully over it but holy shit I feel much much better about myself than I did 24 hours ago."

If you are an athlete in the Ottawa area, than this post is for you! My name is Joseph Leszner and I am a graduate student at the University of Ottawa. I am currently in an applied sport psychology program, training to become a mental performance consultant. As a mental performance consultant, my job is to help athletes increase their chances of performing optimally by teaching them various mental skills (positive self-talk, imagery, etc.). For my program, I am required to obtain 400 hours of internship experience working in this position. I believe that all athletes can benefit from this type of training, which is why I am offering my services to all of you! A typical session will normally last from 45 minutes to 1 hour. If you live in the Ottawa area we can find a place to meet in person, but if not we can do our sessions over Skype (Hangouts, FaceTime, etc.). If you are interested in receiving some free mental performance consulting, or have any additional questions, please send me an email at [mentalperformanceconsulting@gmail.com](mailto:mentalperformanceconsulting@gmail.com). In your email provide me a little information about you, your sport, and what you hope to get out of this experience. Even if you don’t have a specific concern to address, I can teach you various mental skills to enhance your already effective performance. Below is some additional information about me, mental performance consulting, and what you can expect to gain from this experience. Look forward to hearing from you!

\*Note: if you are a national athlete I will not be able to provide you with this service.

**About Me**

My name is Joseph Leszner, and I am a graduate student in the Master of Human Kinetics program at the University of Ottawa. I am a student member of the Canadian Sport Psychology Association (CSPA), and training to become a Mental Performance Consultant (MPC). I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, and have also obtained my Mental Health First Aid certification from the Mental Health Commission of Canada. I am a former competitive video game player, and have played in many high stakes tournaments. The highlight of my career was competing for $70,000 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was during this experience where I started to understand how various pressures could influence my performance. My goal is to provide you with the support that I wish I had when I was competing competitively. I believe that by increasing self-awareness and positive thinking, you can learn to make more effective choices, increasing the likelihood that you will perform optimally when you need to. It is extremely important to me to develop strong relationships with the athletes I work with, because it allows the work we do together to be the most effective.

**What is a Mental Performance Consultant?**

An MPC is similar to a sports psychologist. The main distinction between the two is that sports psychologists make clinical diagnosis (i.e. depression) and focus on performance, whereas MPCs just focus on performance. The job of an MPC is to help increase the likelihood that athletes will perform optimally when they need to, in sport and in life. We help athletes accomplish this by teaching them various mental skills. Gaining self-awareness, thinking more positively, goal setting, improving focus, and enhancing self-regulation strategies are some of the many skills that can be learned while working with an MPC. The goal is to teach, inform, and support athletes in the practice of these mental skills for optimal performance and living. We can accomplish these goals through individual and/or group consultations, as well as mental skills workshops.

Note: MPCs are not clinical psychologists and therefore cannot diagnose and treat mental disorders.

I am an engineering intern working at a small electronics manufacturing company. I am tasked with finding a way to customize a configuration of Windows that is preloaded with our necessary software / drivers and can be quickly and conveniently installed on our machines. We have approximately 20 Windows 7 Professional based POS computers that are of interest right now. A future solution for other computers with different hardware / software may also be needed later.

From what I have learned up to this point, I have determined that making an AutoUnattend.xml file and using Windows 7 AIK to rapidly deploy fresh installations of windows is the ideal solution, versus simply cloning the harddrive of one of the computers. 
I am currently testing my “autounattend.xml” using the latest VirtualBox 

Since I am studying EE and not IT, I had to google for information.

I followed this tutorial:
[Windows 7 64-bit Unattended Install with WAIK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYg9yHXD0WM&amp;t=135s)

**Primary Problem:**

*  1. The auto installation stops at “[Where do you want to install Windows?](https://i.imgur.com/jgmFjkA.png)” instead of completing the installation automatically. This happens both in VirtualBox and on the hardware I am testing.

**Secondary Problem:**

* 2. The computers seem to all be installed with OEM licenses of Windows 7 Pro.  Will this cause issues later with trying to mass deploy Win 7 Pro on my company’s computers?

I will be finishing up my bachelors in network design and management in December and am wondering where I can hope to enter the IT field and how difficult it might be to find a decent job.  I am using an education program through the VA that has allowed me to get several certifications while attending school, A+, Network+, Security+, and CCNA.  I should have CCNA Security completed by time I graduate also.  I have no work experience in IT but I did 6 years in the navy as an electronics technician, a lot of hardware troubleshooting and some software but no networking.  Although not exactly IT, I am hoping it will help some.  My biggest concern right now is that I live in a small area and am having a hard time locating an internship for the fall semester.

Should I prepare my ego for a help desk position and work up from there?  Any advice on how to market myself (school, certs, military exp.)?  Thanks"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I started cutting right at the end of May. I am 20 y/o 6'0"" and went into the cut weighing 191 lbs. I have been lifting for about 3 years, but I'd say for the first year I wasn't really watching how I ate really. Anyway I am down to 186 lbs as of this morning. I was wondering how long it takes to really notice changes in your looks (looking really defined and cut). I have been taking progress pics too and I've noticed slightly more definition in my chest and when I flex my abs.

Everyday I eat 2 Eggs and 2 servings of egg whites along with a shake consisting of greek yogurt, lots of baby spinach, frozen fruit, protein powder, and water. I have an internship from 9-5 so I'll have that breakfast around 6:45 and won't eat lunch til 12. My lunch is two turkey and cheese wraps (sometimes one will be tuna). I'll also have a protein bar and apple as snacks throughout the day at my internship.

Then I'll go home, work out, have a protein shake after, along with whatever mom makes (usually grilled chicken or a burger without a bun.) And then later on usually still hungry, I'll eat a greek yogurt and maybe some cold cuts on a rice cake.

I know I didn't list out my specific macros, but was wondering how that general diet seems? Definitely eating at a deficit. And also how long does it usually take to see big cutting results? 6 weeks?

Thanks, and I can post my progress pics for reference if needed."
8sahhf,82,2018-06-19,What it's like to dropout after 1L year,formerlawstudent17,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/8sahhf/what_its_like_to_dropout_after_1l_year/,"I decided to write about my experience of dropping out of law school because when I was trying to decide whether dropping out was the right move I found it incredibly difficult to find good advice or hear about another dropout’s perspective. If you turn to parents they will likely tell you to stay in school. If you talk to people who haven’t attended law school, then a lot of times they are going to tell you to drop out because they think law school is insane. If you talk to your friends in law school then they will most likely tell you to stay in school because that’s what they’re doing. 

This short essay will provide a little insight to my experience with dropping out of law school and why I did it. First, I had a 3.4 GPA and an LSAT score of 158 (74th percentile). I applied to about 7 schools ranked anywhere from 18 to 75. I got a decent financial offer at a school ranked 58 to where I would’ve paid only 15k total for tuition for 3 years, and would’ve been set up very nicely to practice law in my home state. However, I also somehow got accepted to a school ranked 26 with basically no scholarship located out of state in a major city. The fresh out of undergrad me thought it would be the best to go to the best school I got into. So without any regard for the amount of debt I’d be taking on from attending a higher ranked out-of-state school in a major city I chose to go to the school ranked 26. “Oh yeah, you’ll be top of the class no problem and the debt won’t really matter because you’ll land such a good job” I naively told myself at the time. I really let the law school application game get the best of me. In hindsight, I would’ve made the most sense to go to the school ranked 58 and only take on 15k total in debt for 3 years of tuition.  

Let’s flash forward to when grades came back after first semester 1L year. “Shit. Balls.” I thought to myself as 2 C+’s taunted me on my transcript. My GPA was about a 2.75. I quickly came to the realization that law school wasn’t quite undergrad. I had legitimately given my studies my all and had come up short at the finish line. Rather than be a “quitter” after that 1st semester I decided to take on another 25k in addition to the 25k from the first semester and run it back for another semester with a “new game plan” that would improve my GPA. I hit the books even harder. I spent hours upon hours studying that second semester, I did every required reading, and participated regularly in class. I felt incredibly confident after taking my finals at the end of the semester, and when grades came back I had gotten an even lower GPA than my first semester. It was at that point that I started to seriously considered dropping out. However, I went ahead and started my summer internship at a personal injury firm. I was incredibly bored with writing memos for some asshole of an attorney who would in turn make a shit ton of money off of me. Ironically, my supervising attorney actually got demoted to law clerk because he had butchered a case so badly, and consequently the firm had to let me go midway through the summer because my supervising attorney had essentially assumed my position. It was at this time I knew it was time to call it quits.

Was dropping out of law school easy? Absolutely not. Am I glad I did it? Hell. Fucking. Yes. I’m incredibly fortunate to be at a job that I work 40 hours per week or less and make 80-100k per year at the age of 25. Let’s revert back to what it was like to drop out though. I would be lying if I didn’t say that I was letting my bad grades bring me down. I think it’s about every parents dream for their child to be a doctor or a lawyer. So it wasn’t easy to put in a call to my dad, who is a successful personal injury attorney, and let him know that I was calling it quits on the law. “What the hell are you gonna do with your life?” he asked. “Well, I’m applying to jobs right now, dad.” I replied. Needless to say that response wasn’t very well received. 

In addition to disappointed parents, I experienced a great deal of grief about the financial burden I had just gotten myself into through. 50k in debt seems like a ton of money when you haven’t started working a full time job yet. However, now about a year after dropping out I’m at a job working 40 hours per week or less and making 80-100k per year so I don’t even think twice about my student loan payments. And 50k in debt is certainly better than about 150k in debt had I finished school.

On another note, I was very fortunate to have made a great group of friends during my time in law school, and we still remain great friends today even after I dropped out. I also continued to live with a law student after dropping out. At the end of the day, if you’re worried about disappointing friends you’ve made in law school by dropping out just remember that your “real friends” (shoutout Kanye) will stick by you whether you’re a law student or not. You may feel that they judge you or think less of you for dropping out, but at the end of the day they probably respect the hell out of you for having the balls to drop out.    

Finally, it can be tough to cope with the fact that you can no longer identify as a law student or future attorney. I think we often define ourselves too strongly by our career paths and dropping out may put you into somewhat of an identity crisis. Just know that there are plenty of people in this world who have no idea what they want to do—whether they be 18 or 65 years old. Remember that law school is a bubble and that you can still be successful outside of it. Don’t look at the other people in your law class who were ranked top ten and are landing 20k summer internships through a jealous lens. Be happy for them. If you’re dropping out because your grades were too low then just remind yourself that letters on a piece of paper do not define you one bit. Grades—and especially law school grades—are not indicative of intelligence, total earning potential, or even happiness. If anyone is interested in me providing tips for how to spin dropping out of law school into a positive thing during job interviews, then I’m happy to do that. 

In summary, I’m not advocating that everyone needs to drop out of law school if they have bad grades. There are plenty of successful attorneys who didn’t make good grades in law school. I dropped out in part because I went to law school for the wrong reasons. I didn’t know what I wanted to do after graduating undergrad, and I thought that having a law degree would guarantee me a lot of money. While this may have been true for our parents’ generation, a law degree doesn’t really guarantee anything in today’s job market. Also, if you’re just going to law school for “the money” then it makes sense that you will likely hate the course material. I do find the knowledge I obtained during my one year of law school to be very beneficial for my real estate position. Additionally, I can appreciate how law school has taught me to “think like a lawyer” and that has helped me in many aspects of life. However, I’m incredibly glad that the law school chapter of my life has closed and that I cut my losses after 1L year instead of taking on an additional 100k in debt for the remaining 2 years of school. I hope that my perspective provides valuable information for those considering dropping out and that it aids them in deciding whether to stay in school or call it quits.       "

A month ago I had a friend refer me to the company he works for and immediately a recruiter from that company reaches out to me to schedule a phone screening. That went well, so they schedule a technical interview over skype which also went well. Then they decide to schedule a different type of skype interview where I review a document with a use case in it and I do a presentation answering some questions about the use case for 15 minutes. I schedule it for two fridays ago at 11AM (at their request) and I get in my suit, join the skype meeting room and wait for a half hour, and none of the developers/recruiters I was supposed to interview with showed up. The next monday I get in touch with the recruiter to find out what happens, and they ghost me for three days before I go on LinkedIn and find their manager and complained to her about what had happened. She apologizes and agrees to reschedule the interview at yesterday at 6 PM, again at their convenience. So I go through the whole ringer again, prepare and go into the skype interview, and \*\*again\*\*  nobody showed up but me. Completely pissed off, I decide to wait until the next day to get in touch with the company again. So last night I decide to have a couple of beers and play some CS:GO to blow off steam, but at 10:30 PM in the middle of this, my phone goes off, and it's one of the recruiters I was supposed to interview with. He says he apologizes for missing me earlier, and that he has to do the interview right now. So i exit out of the game and immediately start scrambling to answer his   questions. Which were all about the intricacies of the REST API and the SOAP API and how to run a springboot server with maven, things that I only vaguely knew about. To make matters worse, he speaks in the worst indian accent I've heard in my life and the phone connection was garbage, so I had to constantly be asking him to repeat what he said. The interview didn't go well at all. It wasn't at all what I was told to prepare for. And the guy definitely seemed to think so as well.  Today they shoot me an e-mail claiming my lack of preparedness is why I didn't get the job.

Fuck you, Capitalism. Fuck anyone who says the economy is doing well or that the job market is good. this is as close to a job i've gotten in six months with a BS in computer science and an IBM internship. This system is so rigged, I am completely broken. I have no clue what to do with my life now. I'm giving up on doing anything related to CS because of this half year nightmare. I'm too young to justify killing myself but too old to make anything of my life."
8sb5lq,0,2018-06-19,Is Josef Mifsud the Pimp of Russiagate?,mystic_teal,WikiLeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/8sb5lq/is_josef_mifsud_the_pimp_of_russiagate/,"The Australian state broadcaster has a three-part series on the current state of Russiagate.  Nothing spectacularly new, but a good in-depth summary of the situation so far in all it's florid, psychotic glory.

https://iview.abc.net.au/show/four-corners/series/2018/video/NC1803H018S00

Part Two is interesting as it delves into the relationship between Josef Mifsud and Simona Mangiante (since March the Mrs Papadopolous)

Curiously Ms Mangiante was not the first associate of Mifsud that he attempted to hook George up with:

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/russia-inquiry-trump.html

&gt;In a recent interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Mr. Mifsud said the Russian woman who met Mr. Papadopoulos was “a simple student, very beautiful.” He suggested Mr. Papadopoulos hoped for a romantic involvement, adding, “Putin had nothing to do with it, a lovely invention.”.....she was in London discussing a possible internship with Mr. Mifsud, a friend of hers, the morning before the meeting with Mr. Papadopoulos. He insisted that she had no connections to the Russian government and never portrayed herself as Mr. Putin’s niece, despite the court records unsealed by Mr. Mueller.

Happily Mifsud is oversupplied with good-looking interns and it appears that one of them, Simona Mangiante, is the true reason the Russiagate inquiry was instigated

https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/romantic-encounter-set-off-australias-role-in-triggering-donald-trump-investigation-20180105-h0e34r.html

&gt;It was a chance romantic encounter by George Papadopoulos that set in train the events that led to the Australian government tipping off Washington about what it knew of Russian hacking efforts to swing the US presidential election.

&gt;Fairfax Media can reveal a woman in London with whom Papadopoulos became involved happened to know Alexander Downer and told the Australian High Commissioner about Papadopoulos, a newly signed staffer for Donald Trump. Downer, being a canny diplomat, followed it up and arranged a meeting with the young American, who was mostly living in London at the time.......The romantic link explains that it was a random connection of Papadopoulos to Australia's High Commission that sparked the meeting. One unanswered question is whether Papadopoulos had boasted to the woman of his Russian connections and this was a subject of interest to Downer.

So Simona informed Downer and Downer informed the FBI.

Simona, however, has nothing good to say about Josef Mifsud:


36:25 of the ABC documentary discusses her work at Mifsud's  The London Centre of International Law Practice

&gt;They never paid me and they said ""don't worry, you have to think big"", they told me, ""just have to think big, you don't have to think about the salary.""  I though everything was a facade for something different.  I thought everything was extremely unclear and unprofessional.  And my feeling he was the most shady person I ever met.  

And at 46:40 Simona Mangiante gives her opinion on George (and by extension her own) historical significance:

&gt; George is the person who was the target, identified by Mifsud, to offer those hacked emails.  He [George] decided to cooperate with the FBI and is putting his knowledge fully at the disposal of the government.  So as I said, it is a piece of the puzzle, but it is an important piece and his contribution is going to make a difference

I think she is lying and she knows she is lying.  Mifsud didn't offer anybody any hacked emails, he raised the speculation that the Russians had Clinton's deleted Secretary of State emails and tried to arrange hock-ups in Moscow (in every sense) for Papadopolous and that is it.

Notice how Josef Mifsud has become the Russian stand-in the absence of any Russians in Russiagate.  And someone who has actually no connection with any of the Wikileaks email caches is being put forward as the infamous ""Russian cut-out""

I dare say George Papadopolous will, after the impeachment, quickly slip back into obscurity, but it would be fascinating to find out what happens in the marriage between him and Simona.

Also I wonder how many more female interns Mifsud had working for him?  It seems to be the way to do intelligence work these days."
8sbbgf,1,2018-06-19,[M4F] Overwatch: Harem Edition,KingRodent,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8sbbgf/m4f_overwatch_harem_edition/,"*Brian blinked the sleep from his eyes, the wailing buzz of the alarm clock holding him from his sleep without warning. Groggily, he reached over to the bedside table and hit the button to shut it off. He didn’t need the snooze button. He could lay in bed for a few minutes without falling back asleep. Another look around the room reminded him of his unique position, a boon granted from God himself. The pale blue walls were a little more familiar today than they were the day before; where he was used to posters of bands and video games, instead there were paintings and whimsically written phrases. The typical mess of collectibles and homework on the dressers were now replaced with photographs, framed and positioned alongside each other. These pictures, of course, weren’t of him, but rather of two grown women by the name of Lena and Emily Oxton— the later of which slept peacefully beside him, adorned by nothing but leggings and a g-string. He could hear noises from the kitchen; Lena was most likely making coffee. And while he was loathe to leave Emily in the bed by herself, it was time to get ready for work.*

——————————————

If you know nothing about Overwatch lore and need a refresher about everybody mentioned in this post: Brian is the boy in the blue hoodie in the trailer, Lena Oxton is Tracer, and Emily Oxton is Tracer’s girlfriend– in this case, she’s her wife.

I’ll be playing the role of Brian, fresh out of his sophomore year. In my imagining of this prompt, Overwatch headquarters has been rebuilt and the team has been called to action once more. After the events of the museum robbery, Tracer and Brian crossed paths a few more times, finally electing to swap numbers after the umpteenth time. Not long after that the two hooked up– what with Tracer being everybody’s wet dream, she could only cross the horny young man’s path so many times without getting her ass tapped.

At the present moment all three parties are located in Bern, Switzerland, living in an apartment just outside of Overwatch headquarters. Lena and Emily have relocated from London due to Overwatch’s reassembly, and Brian is abroad from America under the guise of an internship with Overwatch– technically not a lie, but certainly not the whole truth either.

———————————————

My primary goal for this post is to build a harem of Overwatch’s finest, with Tracer and Emily as my ‘starter girls.’ To them, I’m their well-loved boytoy; all I need is to ask, and every one of my needs is sated (though occasionally with a chiding remark if my desire is especially kinky, or we’re in a public place). This goes vice-versa as well, and if you want to be done a certain way, I’m more than happy to play the bashful, eager-to-please hormonal teenager.


Although I have an excessive amount of kinks, my favorites are pregnancy/impreg, casual sex, public sex, cosplay, petplay, raceplay, drugs, beast, watersports, light/heavy bondage, sadomasochism, willing abuse, tattoos, body writing, piercings and various others I’m probably not thinking of at the moment.


Typically I have no limits, but I’d like for this prompt to be fairly light-hearted, so I’d like to avoid scat, snuff, and gore. Blood is one hundred percent okay, so long as we aren’t shanking each other to make it, and I don’t mind bruises and black eyes so long as the characters specifically ask to be beaten in such a way.


I also play via KIK and Discord if chat or messages doesn’t work for you. My only requirement is that you understand I’m human and at certain times A.) am not horny, and B.) must attend work. In exchange, I will understand the same about you. Life happens, etcetera, etcetera.


I look forward to orange envelopes!"

Asking for help on a throwaway account because it’s a little embarrassing for me and some friends know my reddit account.

Long story short, I am a 2018 Hokie graduate in BIT, with no internship experience, unemployed, and will be returning in Blacksburg for at least the Fall semester with no real purpose. Obviously I intend to start my career somehow and was at least planning to attend Business Horizons one last time, but other than that, I have no real reason to be in Blacksburg.

Given my scenario and how helpful i’ve seen this community I have a couple questions and hoping I can get some help:

- Are there any jobs I can apply/do in Blacksburg that’s at least related to my career field? Specifically one career-related? I’ve looked into the Jobs at VT but not too sure if there is a good BIT-like job willing to hire a recent grad for part or even full time.

- Is there anything I can do short-term to help with my current career situation? I currently live in Nova, but have had some job offers in places like Winchester and Baltimore so they’re pretty out of way. I want to reach for companies such as Accenture or even EY, but idk if it’s even possible anymore.

- Has anyone ever been in my situation before? Specifically a BIT grad with no internship and graduated from Tech? If so, what did you do? Tbh i’m discouraged. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve just had some complications that have prevented me from focusing on internship search. 

Thank you all for the help in advance. Go hokies!

8sc179,52,2018-06-19,[OC] I recently became a fan,Shadowing234,IntoTheBreach,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntoTheBreach/comments/8sc179/oc_i_recently_became_a_fan/,"So a couple months ago I was looking for game that would be a new experience for me. I liked rogue-like games but most of them seemed boring and uninspired with the same dungeon crawling theme. Then I stumbled upon FTL: Faster Than Light. I watched a couple of videos to see what it was like and how it played, mostly from the likes of LethalFrag and Asher Games. Once I found out that the game is about you controlling one of many different unlockable ships and you have a crew having jobs within it while cruising through the galaxy with hundreds upon hundreds of different events that could happen, I was sold.

Problem was that I had no money, I always asked my parents for money to buy games with. However, four weeks ago I started my first ever job - a summer internship working in a fund management company in NYC. After finally earning money in my life, I used some of it to purchase FTL. Man is that game fun! I have been playing the game for the past two weeks still haven't unlocked all the ships and variations and I'm not even close to getting sick of it. Seeking for more content of this like, I discovered Subset Games released another game: Into The Breach.

I began doing research on this game as well like I did for FTL. I watched videos of streamers like Day9, a popular Hearthstone streamer, play the game for hours and the game looked really cool. The game seemed just as cool as FTL did when I watched that for the first time. I thought since Subset Games sold me with their first game, there was no way that they could make me dislike ITB. I was right!

After a few more weeks of working at my job, I thought I could spare another $15 on ITB because I believe that this will definitely be a worthwhile purchase. And so last night I finally bought the game and played it until 12:30 AM until I knew I had to stop to get enough sleep for work tomorrow. I really enjoyed the game my first time playing it, the Rift Walkers is such a fun squad to use; pushing everything around is fun and creates lots of situations for bonus damage.

But anyway, if anyone has still stuck around with me to this point I just want to say that Subset Games makes absolutely fantastic games. FTL and ITB being the first things I buy with money I earned for the first time really shows how much I support them, and I really hope to see more from them in the future in terms of updates and new games.

Thanks, a new fan."
8scqtt,1298,2018-06-19,[Residency]Why you should do Diagnostic Radiology- Resident's perspective,babblingdairy,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8scqtt/residencywhy_you_should_do_diagnostic_radiology/,"Background: I’m a soon to be chief resident (PGY-4, 3rd year radiology for another week) at a mid tier academic program in a big city. Traditional route med student who didn’t know they wanted to do rads until the beginning of 3rd year. Love the field and think there’s a lot of misconception among med students of what it entails. Recently finished boards and have been meaning to do a write up for those interested (or undecided) about radiology.

&amp;nbsp;

**Radiology years:**

&amp;nbsp;

* PGY-1: Intern year- can do a preliminary medicine, surgery or transitional year. Do the easiest thing you can, and if it’s in the same city as your advanced, sweet.
* PGY-2: Radiology R1- The ACGME says 1st year residents can’t take call, making this possible the easiest year on your entire training hours wise. You will be overwhelmed by a completely new way of looking at medicine, but you won’t work nights or any (or very many) weekends. You should be studying to prepare you for….
* PGY-3: Radiology R2- The hardest year of residency work wise. Very call heavy. I worked almost 3 months of night float, and more weekends than I can count. However, this is still better than what people in a surgical or medicine residency go through! 
* PGY-4: Radiology R3- Boards. So radiology does this weird thing where you take a monstrous CORE exam at the end of this year, which is actually only a “Board Certifying exam”.  It’s incredibly difficult, requires months of preparation, with a 80-90% pass rate (but remember, this is a group of nerds with a Step average of 240+ you compete against). There’s an annoying physics section. Time “off” to study is variable per program, but you will be studying several hours a day starting in the winter. The actual “radiology boards” is taken 18 months after residency (during your actual job), and is a joke with close to 100% pass rate. Most programs also allow residents to go to Washington DC for a month (paid for) for AIRP, a radiology pathology lecture course. It’s like being a med student with no responsibilities and no tests for a month. Great for those who don’t have a family to leave behind.  
You will also apply to fellowship this year. Most fellowships are going towards a match (except Body, Chest), and you will apply and interview second half of the year.. Annoyingly during boards prep time. You also find out where you match a couple days after you take boards. Vast majority of fellowships are 1 year, and everyone does one.
* PGY-5: Radiology R4- Boards behind you and majority of call behind you. Most programs let you dictate your schedule, with “mini fellowships” of 4-6 months in your subspecialty of choice. Usually in something to compliment what your actual fellowship is in.

&amp;nbsp;

**Typical day:**

&amp;nbsp;

An example of a typical day of a resident on a diagnostic rotation, such as Musculoskeletal.

8:00 AM Arrive and start “dictating” the studies on the list, which would be plain extremity x-rays or MRIs (knees, shoulders etc) depending on your seniority. This involves dictating a preliminary report of the study, that won’t go out until the attending reviews it.

9:00 AM Go perform a joint injection (fluoroscopic guided hip or shoulder injections mostly, for steroid and pre-MRI arthrogram).  These occur anywhere from 2-5x a day, and usually take 15-30 minutes depending how fast you are. You do all the set up and the attending will come to watch when you’re actually injecting.

10:30-Noon Go “sign out” the studies (xrays, MRIs) you’ve read with the attending.  This is usually sitting next to them while they look over the study and your reports, going over findings and occasionally pimping you.

Noon-1pm: Conference, half are pure didactic and half are case based. Radiology makes it really easy to have a hundred images of different pathologies and going around the room having residents work through them/answer.  Radiology is also much heavier on conferences than other specialties, averaging around 5 hours a week in most programs.  This will go way up for R3s during board studying time.

1pm-5pm: Repeat of the morning

&amp;nbsp;

Other diagnostic rotations would include Neuroradiology, Ultrasound, Body CT, MRI, Breast etc and they all have their own procedures including lumbar punctures, myelograms, thyroid biopsies, breast biopsies etc. There are a lot of procedures outside IR, something I wasn’t aware of before residency. This varies by institution however.

&amp;nbsp;

**Call:** Overall hours wise as a resident you will not be there that long unless call is involved.  Call schedules vary so much among programs that saying mine won’t really help, but R2 year is the busiest with around 1-2 months of night float, and 10-15 weekend day coverage. Radiology doesn’t have separate residents on for different specialties for call (such as a MICU night float, cardiology night float etc) so at most you will have 1-2 residents in the hospital covering ANYTHING radiology related. This includes for us 

1. Dictating every study done on hospital inpatients (minus ICU chest xrays), everything coming through the ED &amp; multiple satellite urgent cares. A car crash with 4 passengers at once? You’ll have 4 CT Chest abdomen pelvis, CT Heads, CT c-spines and an xray of every extremity that hurts on your list at once, with the ED calling you asking for results. It’s overwhelming and exhilarating (for some)

2. Answer calls/pages for anything radiology related, including review studies with surgeons on call, questions about what to order etc. 

3. Performing any diagnostic radiology procedures, including: septic joint aspirations that need fluoroscopy (hips), fluoroscopy guided lumbar punctures, esophagrams for perforations, intussusception reductions. 

4. Fielding IR consults, meaning gathering all the info, consenting, calling in the team and IR attending to perform it. Sometimes we scrub in on these but usually the diagnostic part is so busy we can’t. Some programs with bigger IR sections will have fellows on call to handle this.

Call as a resident is always in house, you will probably never sleep. It is very different that how other specialties handle call. A busier call lets us enjoy a lighter regular schedule.

&amp;nbsp;

I love radiology as a field, and try to convince every med student to do it. Here’s some reasons why:

&amp;nbsp;

**Pure medicine, no BS:**
I believe the 2 big reasons someone pursues medicine are the humanitarian aspect and the science aspect. I leaned towards the latter, and most people I’ve encountered in radiology are the same. My biggest gripe about intern year was how little medicine you do. Pretty much all the data gathering and analysis, including differential for a service could be done in an hour, but you spend the remaining 12 hours calling consults to regurgitate information, call social services, and essentially act as a secretary. This obviously reduces are you become more senior, but hospitalists still do this. Radiology is just you and a study, trying to get information out of it. Non-compliant patient with crazy abscess? I diagnosed it on CT in 5 minutes and told the clinician, now it’s their problem trying to get him to take antibiotics. Diabetic with necrotic pancreatitis? I diagnosed it on CT in 5 minutes, and wash my hands.  You can help so many people, so fast, because you are just doing medicine. Never have to deal with insurance issues, getting someone in a nursing home, trying to get a consult to see a patient. Never have to deal with getting “dumped on” at 5pm, because even if a MRI comes on the list at 4:59? I’ll read it in 10-15 minutes, vs an hour admitting a new patient.  


This gets me to the next point: **You control your own pace.**  There are no nurses you are waiting to get labs, no attending sleeping at home you’re trying to get to round (we do have attendings that read out studies slower than others, but magnitudes less painful than rounds, and this disappears when you’re an attending yourself). You don’t have to wait for pancreatitis to resolve to discharge a patient, you just sign the study and you’re on the next one. Never have a million checkboxes to do for the day, just clicking on study at a time (with procedures thrown in).


**Interacting with colleagues more than patients:** If you love patient interactions, radiology is probably not for you. However, you can still be plenty social in radiology. The only difference is you just spend the entire day talking to coworkers (who are in the same rooms as you) and a bunch of consulting clinicians. I really enjoy talking to clinicians about studies and reviewing them, as opposed to a patient who doesn’t know anything about their care. A perfect medium would be the ability to just review studies with patients who are interested, but don’t think that’s going to be a billable code anytime soon. 


Finally: **It’s like learning a new language.** Every service thinks they can read their own studies (and some can), but vast majority of clinicians have no clue beyond a basic xray.  I still remember telling a pulmonology fellow, when I was an R1, that the pneumothorax he was worried about was just a skin fold. Even early in your training, your abilities will surpass that of attendings in other fields and it feels… awesome. To have someone call with a study saying “I have no idea whats going on” and you know what it is 2 seconds in, is a great feeling. This feeling will only get exemplified in private practice, where everyone is more reliant on radiology.

&amp;nbsp;

So how do you know if radiology is right for you? Here a some characteristics I think that may be a sign that it’s for you.


**You liked the first 2 years of med school more than the 3rd year.**  I was miserable 3rd year, because most specialties have the social work mentioned above, and you’re never in control of your own time. Even intern year was better, but I didn’t really ever enjoy coming to work till I started radiology residency. I have a great social life, but I really enjoy coming to work and just having it be me and my work, with some interactions with colleagues. It’s very similar to studying a bunch the first 2 years (with more free time).


**You are organized/efficient.** The people I see struggling most in radiology are those who are slow. This does not mean they make bad radiologist, on the contrary, I would want a slow methodical radiologist to read my scans. But to be able to keep up with the pace that the field demands and enjoy it, you have to have some sense of speed. Being a techy is also related somewhat, but we’re definitely a minority even in radiology.


**You do not have an ego.** Radiologist will get shit on by every speciality, “clinically correlate” etc etc, and some specialties such as ortho or neurosurgery will pretend you don’t exist. But you have to be ok with not being in the front seat of patient care, and making contributions behind the scenes.

**You are a good test taker.** Radiology is essentially one big test. Staring at the screen, coming to an answer. This will also help with the CORE exam..

&amp;nbsp;

Dismissing some misconceptions about radiology:


**AI-** I’ve literally never heard a radiologist bring this up as a viable threat. We are 20+ years from this making any significant impact, and when it does, it’ll just make our lives easier. We’ll have a 50% unemployment rate from machines before radiologists are actually put out of jobs. Do not worry about it.


**Outsourcing-** Also not a real threat. Clinicians want to talk to their radiologists, which is why not every radiologist is a teleradiologist. There’s a handful than get US board certified and go overseas to read US studies, but this is so rare that it’s a non-issue (and doesn’t save that much money). Teleradiology is definitely a big thing (reading studies from states away), but is seen as a last resort by most due to poor compensation.

&amp;nbsp;


Some real downsides to the field:


**You will work hard.** Attending radiology is not a cush 40 hour work week. This exists in some settings (VA especially), but most are pushing 50-60 hours, with 10+ hour days. These days are BUSY, reading studies and doing procedures non-stop. If you want to have a lot of downtime at work, radiology is not for you. To make up for this, most private practices offer 8-12 weeks of vacation, which can only happen because we have no continuity of care to worry about. Working harder for the same amount of pay is universal in medicine however.


**You always have to be “on”.** You can have a bad day as a hospitalist, maybe half-ass some physical exams and be ok, but if you half-ass some studies, I guarantee you’ll hear about the cancer you missed on the chest x-ray in a few years. Majority of my misses as a resident have been when I’ve been pushing myself to read faster than I should, or was in a hurry to finish. Radiology is unforgiving.


**Attending life is harder than resident life.** As above, your hours get worse (no nights though, that's usually taken care of a hired nighthawk service) and days more stressful because of all the litigation risk, but the pay and vacation are there for that. I’m sure med students are very interested in pay, but I don’t have information that can’t be found online (see doximity compensation report). Of note, the regional variation is huge and you can make family med money in downtown of a big city vs surgical subspecialty money by going rural.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope that helps. I feel like the whole application process and score averages have changed since I applied so not sure how much help I can be of that, but some things: Step 1 is big, research isn’t really (I had nothing). The tier of program only matters if you want to do academics, location is way more important for connections.

We've only ever had a couple of misunderstandings but 99.9% of the time were amazing together. Just because it'll come into play later, the first fight my gf and I had was over a trip to NYC I couldn't afford at the time. My only means of income were from a part time bar-tending gig that I used to pay for gas to and from my internship. She bought both of our plane tickets because it was easier, I was going to pay her back before we went. Fast forward a couple weeks, my manager started cutting my hours severely because he heard I was looking for full time employment in corporate america and would be leaving soon. This left me with an avg. weekly bank account of about 150$. Obviously, I was upset because I love NYC it's one of my absolute favorite places in the world. When I told my gf she was less than sympathetic, recalling / paraphrasing she said something along the lines of ""I don't think I can date anyone who backs out of something like this last minute, I need people to do what they say they are going to do."" again a little less than sympathetic but I got her point. I told her I was sorry and payed her back for my plane ticket (thanks mom and dad). Over the next couple of months we only had one other ""fight"" and it was a complete misunderstanding on both of our parts, complete wash, all good. Fast forward to now and I'm in a similar situation. I'm in a group chat with her and her cousins, who are giant fans of this band called the String Cheese Incident. One of her cousins texted the line up for Float Fest in Austin this September, and String Cheese is the main act. They come from a wealthy family and all immediately bought tickets. She asked me if I'd be interested to go and I said I'd buy my ticket when I could budget and afford it. I make just over 50k a year, but pay ALL of my own bills because the crash in '08 decimated my dads business and my parents aren't in the position to help at all, but I digress. Fast forward again to today, she fwds me an ad that says ""last chance to buy tickets before rates go up"", and in my head I say fuck. There is just no way I can swing this thing, this week I have all my bills besides rent due. I tell her this and she replies back ""It's okay, I just wanted to get a definitive answer"" this kind of irked me because of her trying to be deceptive but its the text she sent after saying ""This is becoming a pattern."" which immediately infuriated me, I sent her back a wall of text with a bit of colorful language sprinkled in, none of which was directed at her but used to describe my frustration. I pretty much laid out why I was mad, that I wanted to do these things but sometimes the money just doesn't work out, that I was sorry and I loved her but I'm not perfect. I even apologized for being so fiery but communicated that this really hurt my feelings. She replied back saying that I shouldn't talk to her in that tone of voice and that she was going to ignore my last text I sent her and that she wouldn't respond unless I acknowledged that me lashing out was rude to her. 

Guys I'm so frustrated right now, I chose to not text back immediately because A) in my head replying back that I was wrong would instantly negate some of the points I was talking about that really upset me and B) I didn't want to say something that I would regret later. I really don't know how to address this situation, I really do love her but her unwillingness to see my point of view upsets me. Am I wrong here? If so how can I do better in the future?

Any help is appreciated.

I'm extremely depressed, currently working retail with a bachelors degree helping Toys R Us with their closing sale, have broken down multiple times over the last few weeks. I want to work in marketing and project management in the games industry. That is my dream, competition be damned. But unfortunately, the game job search did not go well -- applied for multiple positions, only one company even emailed me back, and that was to tell me they had an applicant lined up for hire before me. No interviews. Nothing.

I leave my internship next week and have been trying to look for work around me in my town. Orlando, where I originally wanted to move, is way too expensive, so I won't be moving there. And just today as I walked in, my girlfriend showed me 3 pages of apartment complexes she called, nearly none of which are available or carry anything less than a 1-year lease, and our time is running out. She's stressed. I'm stressed. And it's looking like we may have to move back in with our parents.

In addition, certain members of my family are pressuring me to get a job, telling me they were working full-time at my age. They helped me get this degree, and now they want to see something from it. And currently, I don't have anything.

I feel like an absolute failure, and feel like the last 5 years have been complete waste of time and money. In addition, there are days where I get so depressed I don't feel like I want to keep living anymore -- I can't afford a therapist. But I also know that there are people who love and care about me, things to be done, and dreams left to be fulfilled.

This is a lot, and I'm sorry, but I'm just in a dark place right now. I hope life gets better soon..."
8sdbqj,8,2018-06-19,An important (I think) essay I wrote...please share with the world,anxiousrandoredditor,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8sdbqj/an_important_i_think_essay_i_wroteplease_share/,"An Analysis of Anxiety and Depression

By a sufferer of MDD, OCD, GAD, PTSD and Panic disorder

Something desperately needs to be said for those who use &amp; abuse the term “anxiety” and the term “depression.” First, a very brief background about myself; I have a B.Sc. degree with a premedical concentration from a top 100 University with university scholar status. Throughout my education, I’ve been awarded various scholarships including a STEM scholarship and a summer research scholarship. As both an extracurricular and capstone project, I have been a team lead for research in neuropsychology which resulted in a published study and presentations at various conferences, and I have also performed microbiological research on gene identification. Finally, just before graduating I completed a 6-month internship at top 5 research hospital in a pediatric neurosurgery laboratory as a research assistant and anesthetist.

Information regarding my background has been included for the sake of scientific credential; but of course, this post is anonymous, therefore it will not be verified. You’ll just have to take my word for it if you’re serious about the content I’m writing. 

In modern psychology, articles have been popping up left and right about ‘youth’ or ‘millennial’ depression. Great. Raising awareness is generally a positive thing, but romanticizing it is **not**. Allow me to clarify: it is not a trendy, hip, or ‘in’ thing to be ‘depressed’, just because you’re a millennial doesn’t mean you are depressed, or any more or less exposed to such issues than were your predecessors. Let me explain. 

Everyone at some point or another experiences *situational* depression and *situational* anxiety. These are **normal**. If you do not experience situational stress under, well, stressful situations, then there is something wrong with you. On the other hand, there are clinically diagnosable forms of anxiety and depression. The two diagnosable forms often go hand-in-hand as comorbid disorders, but not always. Well what’s the difference?

The difference is whether or not the symptoms are persistent and occur without identifiable stressors. Clinical depression is now coined *major depressive disorder*. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th addition (the book PhD psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illness) states the following:

DSM-IV Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 

• Depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for more than two weeks. 

• Mood represents a change from the person's baseline. 

• Impaired function: social, occupational, educational. 

• Specific symptoms: at least 5 of these 9 present nearly every day: 

1. Depressed mood or irritable most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). 

2. Decreased interest or pleasure in most activities, most of each day 

3. Significant weight change (5&amp;#37;) or change in appetite 

4. Change in sleep: Insomnia or hypersomnia 

5. Change in activity: Psychomotor agitation or retardation 

6. Fatigue or loss of energy 

7. Guilt/worthlessness: Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt 

8. Concentration: diminished ability to think or concentrate, or more indecisiveness 

9. Suicidality: Thoughts of death or suicide, or has suicide plan 

DSM – V proposed (not yet adopted) anxiety symptoms that may indicate depression: irrational worry, preoccupation with unpleasant worries, trouble relaxing, feeling tense, fear that something awful might happen. 

Screen for conditions that may mimic or co exist with Major Depressive Disorder: 

• Substance abuse causing depressed mood (eg. drugs, alcohol, medications) 

• Medical illness causing depressed mood 

• Other psychiatric disorders: mania, hypomania, bipolar, schizoaffective, schizophrenia, etc. 

•Bereavement unless sx persist for &gt; two months or show marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation. 

So, what does all this *really* mean? It means that to be considered diagnosable for a depressive disorder, one must be evaluated by a licensed physician who can verify whether or not the symptoms listed in the criteria match what you’re going through based on fairly extensive, non-biased questioning. I would encourage anyone reading this who hasn’t already to google search the DSM 5 criteria for anxiety disorders; it is a little more complicated and ought to be taken just as seriously.

Often, I keep my mouth shut when I’m around people who whine and moan about their problems (people in my boat know exactly what I mean). This includes those who use social media as an outlet to post jokes and meme’s about killing themselves, being depressed, or ‘having anxiety.’ Seven out of ten times, I want to tell them to fuck off because it’s not a trend. And yes, a joke is a joke, and sometimes I laugh, but the reality is that serious depression will usually cause people to recluse, avoid others, not post about their depression, and not find much of anything funny. As I said before, *everyone* experiences minor levels of depression and anxiety…*minor.*

For a final reference point, I’d like to share with the community some of the persistent, debilitating symptoms that I encounter *every day of my life*. Having a long (8 years) of various physicians, ER visits, and therapy sessions, my diagnostic profile consists of major depressive disorder (MDD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Panic Disorder. Quite the list, but I don’t let it define me. If you met me, I can just about guarantee you’d never know I carry this burden. Usually sufferers don’t want people to know; it’s embarrassing and can create stigmas. You often get looked at differently. 

So anyways, here is a **day** (365 of those in a year…) in the life of what I experience; and many, many like myself also experience:

**MDD**

\- Anhedonia - the feeling of not finding interest in *anything*. This feeling is the worst, because when going through it you care about nothing. Not like a, “oh I don’t give a fuck about anything because I’m cool” but like a, “I wish I cared what people see and feel around me. I wish I cared about my job and had the energy to go to work. I wish I cared enough to get out of bed, but* nothin*g excites me.”

\- Hypersomnia during the day - *excessive fatigue* from the wasted mental energy on loops upon loops of depressive and obsessive thoughts. Could easily sleep 70&amp;#37; of the day away, its like an escape from the torture of existence.

\- Irritability - for no good reason, everyone and everything around you becomes unbearable, worst of all, yourself.

\- Sadness - not the crying kind, worse. In fact, crying feels beautiful. If you can cry, cherish every waking minute of it. Losing the ability to cry when feeling overwhelming emotions of neutrality and despair is almost the worst feeling in the world.

\- Significant appetite disturbance and weight loss; nearly **5 pounds per week** (in my case)

\- The inability to find pleasure in even the gentle, small things. No sense of euphoria- broken dopamine/reward system (i.e. loss of interest in sex, working out, caffeine, video games, anything, especially the otherwise exciting and fun things)

**OCD**

To quickly clarify, refer to the DSM 5 criteria. Obsessive compulsive disorder is far from ‘being neat’.

\- Washing hands after everything because you’re literally *convinced* that your hands have come into contact with a biohazard.

\- Minor aches, pains, and abnormalities aren’t ignorable. Every little feeling inside you comes off as ‘danger,’ and cognitively you begin to rationalize them as being ‘worst case scenario.’ For example, I have a headache. I never get headaches. I must have a brain tumor. With OCD, thoughts like these **will not** go away without cognitive coping techniques. Many times this results in visit after visit to the doctors, and despite being medically cleared, you fail to believe them and seek alternative opinions and live in a constant state of irrational fear.

\- Panic attacks often result from OCD worry, this often leads to calling 911 because you *actually think you’re dying*. Its very hard to articulate, unless you’ve truly experienced it.

**PTSD**

\- Waking up *every single night* at least 3 times, often more than 5 times

\- Waking up is accompanied with dizziness, cold sweat, and other panic symptoms

\- Often leads to a full-fledged panic attack and lack of REM sleep

\- This leads to cases of insomnia, which exacerbate daytime depression and anxiety

\- Dreams and flashbacks aren’t always present or memorable, but when they are, they suck. They suck bad.

**Panic Disorder**

\- The kingpin of symptoms

\- Its not, “I think I’m dying,” it’s “I’m dying!”

\- ER visits, emergent dosing of benzodiazepines and other anxiolytic agents

\- Agoraphobia and not wanting to leave your house for anything; I don’t care if it’s 1,000,000 dollars; money doesn’t matter in the slightest when you’re severely depressed and afraid of what your own mind is capable of

**GAD**

\- *A sick and fucking demented version of all of the above in one big torment soup*

\- Leads to conscious derealization, depersonalization, and dissociation

\- Won’t leave the house, won’t go to work, won’t talk to friends. Won’t, won’t, nope.

These horrifying realities **often** result in people being hospitalized for days, weeks, or months. On many occasions, heavy medication and CBT therapy can take years to be effective. Many people with these conditions have trial-and-errored dozens of medications with a hope that just one would provide even a little bit of relief. 

If you read this and still don’t understand, *ask someone* about their experiences. If you read this and can relate, *I sympathize with you.* If you read this and have something ass-like to say, I don’t care, I won’t be reading it.

I don’t like to come off harsh and arrogant about this topic, but it’s a serious topic about serious conditions that are all-too-often played off as some kind of normalcy among everyone. People with these conditions struggle for years to overcome it, doing *everything and anything* in their power to make it stop. In too many instances, the way people make it stop is via suicide. Never tell someone ‘it’s all in their head.’ Yeah, no shit, that’s the problem.

Thank you for taking the time to read this rant/essay. Please take the major points to heart; it likely effects someone you know, and means *a lot* to those of us who suffer when you make a conscious effort to understand."

Respect, Love, Support, etc.  I would trade every physical item in my life, if it mean't I could have those things I listed above.

- You were my biggest bully.  I used to get made fun of for weeks on end by my 'friends' at school.  It would always go the same.  Put up with it for about 6 months, punch them in the face, wait a month and they would start all over again.  You were a bully I couldn't touch.  I couldn't walk away.  To this day you still bully me.  You always said to me that, ""you wouldn't of liked me if you new me in high school"".  That is true. 

- Leaving for college was a relief.  I was finally on my own.  But it didn't last long.  I had to move back in to afford grad school.  I helped out around the house.  Had a 40/hr a week internship in the summer, full time student in the winter.  I still found time to help out, and hang out with all your 'friends'.

- Your yelling, without a doubt, led directly to me develop anxiety.

- The constant criticism made me seek out other ways to become happy.  I could never be happy with myself or my accomplishments.  I used weed and benzos to escape from the world.  Only time I was ever truly happy until I found my fiancee.  I have 4 years of college under my belt, another three to go to get my doctorate, and yet you still call me lazy and unmotivated.

- You cannot accept that there are other ways to live a good life than what you prescribe.  So what if I like to be alone sometimes.  Who cares if I like to sit during concerts and tailgates.  The only one who appears to care is you.  You care because it 'makes you look bad'.  Ridiculous statement really.

- You have ruined every concert, every sport, and every family event for me.  I hate going out in public with you because you are truly embarrassed of me.  You yell at me under your breath when talking to family or friends when I excitedly speak about a topic I love.  

- I honestly wish, with every fiber of my heart that you loved me dad.  I really honestly do.  I want you to be proud of me. I want you to love me unconditionally.  But I know you don't.  We will have a big fight any you will tell me you love me, but I don't believe you. You don't act like it.  You have made my life so much easier by giving me the tools I need to succeed, while at the same time tearing me down piece by piece.  You have taken my sense of self-worth and confidence, and I'm not sure i can ever get them back.  I will always be depressed, and my depression will always be at it's worst right after a negative conversation with you.  If you knew that one day I was praying for a car to hit me and kill me so that I wouldn't have to be depressed and anxious anymore maybe you would care more.  I'm far away from that point in my life now, and I would never even try to hurt or kill myself, maybe because I'm too pussy to do it.  I have to make it another three years, and there is no way I can cut off contact with you because it would destroy my mom and she doesn't deserve that.  Three more years, and I will have my own place, and I will do my best to just forget about you.

8sdma5,0,2018-06-19,Lack of money and support is taking a toll. How to supplement my income/higher paying jobs to look for?,homegirldev,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8sdma5/lack_of_money_and_support_is_taking_a_toll_how_to/,"Hi all. First time posting here. I’m an undergraduate university student in California and have always paid my way through college on my own. This past semester, I had to get help from family and friends in order to pay rent and feed myself.


I figured I would be able to make good money this summer and be ready to finish my last semester in the Fall, but it is getting to be too much. My parents are mostly out of my life. My Dad can help sometimes, but it feels obligatory cause we don’t talk otherwise. My boyfriend used to help me out, but I broke up with him for good reasons. I’m currently already working 3 jobs, one of which is an unpaid internship b/ I really need the experience since I am graduating soon. I’m looking for a 4th job but haven’t heard back yet.


I have $1100 due in a month for rent and food (food is included in my rent, a blessing &amp; a curse) and I only have $100 to my name. I’ve used up all my savings throughout this past semester. Honestly, I’ve never been this low on money before, and it’s really hard because my boyfriend was my main support. I talk to my friends, but I try not to burden them too much.


I’m seeing a therapist next week cause I can get a couple free appointments at school. But, I still don’t know how to supplement my income to be able to pay rent in a month. I’m also concerned because once school starts, I can’t work this much anymore. Not having money is starting to impact other parts of my life (not seeing the doctor or dentist when I need to, not being able to do little things that I enjoy cause I’m working so much and can’t afford to, etc.)


Looking for any advice. I feel like I’m drowning.


TLDR; college student running out of money. Don’t have enough income to live on - lack of support from family. Ways to supplement income or jobs to get or any advice please"

I’ve heard from many upperclassmen that research experience is probably the best thing going for an undergrad when applying to graduate school, but I haven’t heard much about internships. For context, I’m still debating whether I will go into academia or industry after getting a PhD. I’ve been framing my thinking with respect to the fields I am interested in researching in grad school, ex. working in the tech field after researching solid state physics or quantum computing, or perhaps working as a data scientist after doing computational work, etc. 

I guess the essence of my question is, does getting an internship as an undergrad give me an edge over other grad school applicants? And if so, what kinds of internships would prove to be the most interesting on a grad school application? "

I'm currently 20 year old engineering student residing in the Toronto/GTA area. I'm currently doing an internship and to say the least it's been a stressful experience, but at the end of the day this increases my job prospects, right?!

So I'm hoping on one of my days off I can meet up with an amazing woman who can show me a great time. I'm a quick learner so I'll definitely pick up on what pleases you and what doesn't quickly, giving you more time to enjoy yourself without having to constantly teach me. I love to please others and through doing this I hope to relieve some of my stress and maybe some of your stresses as well. 

My birthday is coming up (June 21), so this experience would probably top my list of presents so far!

Some hobbies of mine include running, outdoor activities (I love free climbing), relaxing with the latest new Netflix shows, and cooking.

We can meet up for coffee or grab a bite to eat and get to know each other more before we get down and dirty. Hosting is possible (but can only do so for certain days on limited hours as I live with roommates), we can meet at a hotel or Airbnb, and I can definitely travel within the GTA.

Again because this is a two person experience, I promise to respect any boundaries set beforehand and make sure you feel as comfortable as me before anything occurs.

Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!"
8segtw,2,2018-06-19,How should I start learning SAS,blackcurrant552,sas,https://www.reddit.com/r/sas/comments/8segtw/how_should_i_start_learning_sas/,"Dear community,

I recently finished undergraduate, and will be studying in graduate program biostatistics this fall. But frankly speaking, I have very few experience in using software language.  I have shallow experience with R, doing pharmaceutical data manipulation during my undergraduate capstone course (mainly ggplot2 and rshiny).   Since I sort of missed the time period of recruiting summer intern, I decided to start studying software more indepth.  

Just how should I study SAS? It was easy to learn R despite having no programming backgrond at all thanks to abundant, easy-to-read resources popping up just by googling ""R guide"".  However, same is not true for SAS. 

 I downloaded free university edition for SAS, but I am just not sure how to begin.  Seems that all guides are either hundreds dollar pdf file or couple of thousand dollar courses. 

Also, it seems that SAS is frequently used together with other things like SQL, Stata, etc.  Should I learn them before SAS or after?  My understanding is that they are data management language. So you manage data with SQL and you manipulate with SAS. Am I understanding correctly?

Last thing, I heard there is an official certification for SAS proficiency, unlike R.  Are those worth getting? Would it help me start career-building professionally?

Thank you for your help."

I was hoping for a bit of guidance from anyone experienced. I have recently acquired a grad role in one of the Big 4 (audit and assurance) and am working part-time before I start my role next year. At the moment I am struggling quite a bit with simple tasks, such as tie-ing financial statements to the TB and mapping accounts.

Why? I did not study accounting at university.... I have majored in Economics and Finance and am one semester out from obtaining my Bachelor degree. During my summer internship, my lack of knowledge did not matter too much because as a vacationer expectations were generally a keen attitude and willingness to learn. 

Since then, however, I have growing concerns that moving into an accountant role will put pressure on ensuring I understand a lot more than I do. I don’t want to let any engagement teams down or those working around me. 

Can anyone provide any insight as to how important accounting knowledge is before starting at the Big 4? If so, where might I get a head start for someone who has not done accounting?

If, by chance, you are wondering why I am at the Big 4, I want to learn invaluable accounting skills and be able to read companies on paper as I figure this is a great skill moving forward. 

Thank you."
8sfihc,11,2018-06-20,Final Fantasy Type-0 still doesn't work on Windows 10. Still being sold.,Exegete214,FinalFantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/8sfihc/final_fantasy_type0_still_doesnt_work_on_windows/,"A month ago Final Fantasy Type-0 was broken by a Windows update which made it crash every time a video plays, meaning that the game never even makes it to the title screen.  Other than a dashed off comment left in the Steam forums by community manager Dan Seto nothing has been heard from SE about it since.  They are still selling the game despite the fact that it does not work on the most current operating system.

We're all familiar with the fact that SE does not care about making their PC ports at all good, but this is a whole new level.  At least their shoddy FFVI port is playable.  And at least their shoddy FFXIII series ports are playable on most systems.  In this case, if you have Windows 10 and you haven't been somehow preventing the automatic and aggressively pushed updates, you paid $30 for absolutely nothing.

Now look, I know that fixing bugs can be difficult.  However, in this case I find it hard to believe that a coding intern with access to the game's source code could not kludge up a solution within 30 days, especially since the nature of the problem (which is the way videos are encoded) is known.  Which leads me to believe SE are simply not bothering to fix the issue at all.

Maybe I'm wrong about that... but I'd still like to see some pressure put on SE to let them know that we haven't forgotten about this.  If you've purchased FFT-0, please leave a negative review on Steam.  Their overall score is still ""mixed,"" which is ridiculous for a game that flat-out doesn't work.  Hopefully this will prompt them to either get started on fixing this or to pull the game off Steam and issue refunds if they've decided to write it off.

[And if you use Twitter, leaving some polite messages here expressing your unhappiness that a Steam FF game is just broken and unplayable and nobody at SE seems to care would be a decent thing to do.](https://twitter.com/SquareEnix)

[Or maybe this account would be a nice place for your polite but firm messages.](https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy)  Especially on that pinned tweet asking for your favorite FF memories.

8sfomt,2,2018-06-20,Auto-Generated Fanfic from Stream,ScottWritesStuff,ScottWritesStuff,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottWritesStuff/comments/8sfomt/autogenerated_fanfic_from_stream/,"Hi.
My name is Serenity Darkmoon Raven and this is my story. 

A year ago got a job working for Green Lantern Corps. I am just a intern, but already I am fitting in like ""one of the boys"" (I am a girl though!)
In fact my boss, Steve, has taken a real shine to me and has said he will let me play around with one of Green Lantern Corpss big things.

I cant wait!

Despite working at Green Lantern Corps, I am also friends with Tuli and most of her entendrege. I know Tuli and Serenity Darkmoon Raven and Shrek and Scott and Ego Filled Roblox Noob. I met them all awhile ago in my backstory and these days I had known them awhile. 
I call on them for help (or, more often, they call on me for help!) quite often.
By co-incidence, this was one of those times!

""Hay Serenity Darkmoon Raven we need the help of you and the Green Lantern Corps again""
""Sure thing Tuli my man you know you can count on the Green Lantern Corps!""
""Its you I count on, Serenity Darkmoon Raven"" said Tuli causing me to blush 
After that I put down the phone and started telling everyone else whats up.
""Ok, gang"" I said to the rest of Green Lantern Corps.
""Tuli has asked for our help. It seems Taliban is upto their old tricks, and we are the best people to take them down!""
""They are after the Stolen eyeball, but we have to get there first else we are all doomed to a hellish futurpoclypse!""

""What do we do?"" said Green Lantern Corps
""That's easy. We do what the Green Lantern Corps always does - fight evil""

 
In the darkness of that night, away from the preying eyes and ears of those who would judge, some strangers slipped by unnoticed.

But they were not strangers, they knew each-other. And they knew each-other much closer then any of their friends did realize.
They knew each-other both inside and out. But their friends did not know this. Their friends could not know. Their friends should not know this.
Nor could they know. Because it was night, and thus away from their viscous, judging eyeballs.

""Is it safe?"" said the first stranger, who was not a stranger to the other stranger but will remain a stranger to us for the moment.

""I think so. Its dark so none of the others should see us here, even if they are nearby. I think our secret is safe.""

""Good. I couldn't take their judgement right now. My life is too stressful as it is. If it wasn't for you I don't know what Id do.""
""Don't worry Tuli, I will always be here for you - waiting in the dark""
""Thanks, Steamskunk. I will always be in the dark for you too""

With that the two shadows embraced - an embracement in the night full of passion and romance.
I assembled by normal team: 
Team Serenity Darkmoon Raven!

It was Me,Tuli,Serenity Darkmoon Raven,Scott and Scott, and the team was led by me.
 When it came to planning, I took charge.
I assembled everyone from the assembling room and told them to goto to the planning room.


For a moment time seemed to slowed down. Tuli wondered why. Tuli turned around slowly (due to the time seeming to have slowed down).
Then the explanation - Steamskunk was secretly looking at her. Looking at her in that special way.
Tulis soul lit up like a beacon in the night - even though it was day.

In all of this. In all of this mess. They had eachother, even if eachother was the only ones that knew.
Steamskunk turned away at that moment - Time jumped back to normal as Tuli was no longer transfixiated by Steamskunk.
Fortunately no one else had noticed.
In the planning room we evaluated the data we had.

""Ok, we know that Taliban is trying to find the stolen eyeball. This is probably so they can use it to dominate our friends and family""


""Now I have called our friends at the UN and they have narrowed the location of the stolen eyeball down to Hogsmeade.""
""Cant they do better then that?"" said Serenity Darkmoon Raven
""No, its only UN""""
""-sigh- stupid UN.""
""yeah.Green Lantern Corps always has to keep bailing UN out of trouble..

""Well,  I guess we are of to Hogsmeade!"" said Tuli.

So we all leaped onto our Green Lantern Corps Brontosauruss and went there!

Some time later in their secret hide-away ;

""I am glade we found a way to survive all that and still be together""
""Yes, our plan seems to have worked despite all the events""
""Do you think anyone spotted us?""
""No""
""No""
""Yes""
Serenity Darkmoon Raven emerged from the shadows of the darkness.
""I know everything"" she said. 
Tuli and Steamskunk gasped. Their secret was finally revealed!

""I dont love Steamskunk like you do"" said Serenity Darkmoon Raven ""but I have always lusted a bit after them. So you see if Steamskunk spends the night with me - I will never tell anyone.""
Tuli breathed a sigh of relief. That was, after all, a reasonable request. They agreed to the bargain.
""Phwee...thats something we can go along with"" said Steamskunk relieved.
Serenity Darkmoon Raven was happy, and Tuli and Steamskunk thus got to live happily ever after together. With no one but Serenity Darkmoon Raven and themselves ever knowing.
Once we got there we found our worst fears had already come to pass; 
Taliban was already there. Taliban petrol's were all over the city, searching in every cave network and tower.

""They are looking for the stolen eyeball!"" said Steve.
""We have to beat them too it!""

We began sneakily and stealthy running around the city. Unlike Taliban, we had more information about where to look.
 
After a period of time looking, and with Tulis help we found it before them.

""There is it is! At least!"" I said, pointing to the stolen eyeball hidden by a weird palace.
""So it is"" said Steve, suddenly grinning.
""I guess then this charade is over!""

Steve pulled of his mask and suddenly his face was Steamskunks!
I stood gobsmacked in the face.

""Yes, that's right Serenity Darkmoon Raven &amp; Tuli, it was me all along I, Steamskunk was Steve the whole time!""

 ""I don't understand"" said Tuli. ""Why?""

""That's easy. I knew I could never find the stolen eyeball without your help, and I knew you would never help me. So I became CEO of Green Lantern Corps, and employed Serenity Darkmoon Raven. After that it was simply a mater of earning your respect, creating a threat and waiting for you to call Tuli""

""creating a threat? You mean Taliban? ""

""Yes, that's right! Taliban is just a bunch of actors I hired. It was all a elaborate set up to make you lead me to the stolen eyeball""

 ""gosh, how could we have been so foolish"" said Tuli.

I was frozen still. My life had been a lie. I had believed in the Green Lantern Corps. Believed in what it stood for. Believed in the good work we had did. But it was a lie. It was all a front. It was all Steamskunk all along.
I pressed though the pain though. Maybe Green Lantern Corps was a lie, but that didn't mean what its cause was meaningless. It didn't mean I had to surrender, to give up..

""No. I fight for Green Lantern Corps and I will never give up. Regardless of you..""Steve"" "" (I said that last part sarcastically).
""That's right"" said Tuli. ""You might have fooled us. Made our lives a lie and stood in front of our nose the whole time, but you can never take away our spirit""
""you foolish fools. You are already defeated"" said Steamskunk 
""I had a whole army at my command!""

Just then we were surrounded.
We were about to give up again when I remembered something.

""You can't fool us again Steamskunk! These people are just actors!""
With that me and Tuli started punching and kicking them, using our ice when needed.
As they were actors they were easy to take out, leaving just Steamskunk.
""Nooooo...my fake army....""  

 ""And now its time for you!""

In perfect syncro-heroism me and Tuli leapt at ""steve"", pulling of a massive ice karate-chop combo.
 
""Arg..."" said Steamskunk as she ran towards the stolen eyeball. 

But we did it again and again till he fell unconscious. She was just a few meters from the stolen eyeball,it had been a close call. 

""We won...but now what?""  said Tuli.

I looked around at our devastated lives. 

""Only one choice. We rebuild Green Lantern Corps and repair the years of damage it was secretly doing to this world""

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8sgcsx,8,2018-06-20,Why Toru Hagakure has the potential to be a top hero: an analysis [slight manga spoilers],DrStevesMagicDrink,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8sgcsx/why_toru_hagakure_has_the_potential_to_be_a_top/,"Yeah, hot takes incoming.

For anyone who needs a quick refresher, Toru Hagakure is one of the 'background students' of Class 1A, holding seat number 16 in the class and number 1 in my heart. She fits in quite well in the background, as her quirk is invisibility. Except, as we discovered in chapter 108, that's really not all there is to it.

During the Hero License Exam arc, Toru passes the first part of the exam by using her real quirk, light refraction (bending light through her body), blinding her competition and allowing her to take out her targets. While we don't really know the limits of this quirk since we haven't seen much of it, we do now have strong evidence that Hagakure is a mutant-type, meaning her invisibility is permanent and not by choice (of course, this could all turn out to be a lie if the theories of Hagakure being the traitor turn out to be true, but I seriously doubt that for several reasons). And even if Hagakure isn't a mutant-type, she still holds this completely new (to us) power that almost feels like a second quirk.

And yes, I know that's impossible, hence the 'almost'. But the ability to bend light adds so much to her already top-of-the-class stealth capabilities. She exists at the top in that category just by being practically undetectable, but now we know that if an opponent catches her, she can temporarily blind them and either get away or attack while they're distracted. 

So, a completely invisible person who can bend light to blind their opponents? Already you have someone who'll be almost impossible to get a hit in against, which I don't think is talked about enough. When you're invisible, you don't have to dodge. But obviously, there's still something in Hagakure's way of reaching the levels of 1A's 'Big Three', and that's combat capabilities. Hagakure's quirk doesn't really do anything to enhance her physical strength. However, this doesn't mean game over for Toru. We've seen other heroes in the class with the same problem manage it. Yaoyorozu relies on her battle instincts (which are near the top of the class), Uraraka picked an internship that would train her against her weakness, and Ojiro relentlessly trained in order to make his quirk combat capable. For Toru, training with Ojiro or a Gunhead-type is probably her best bet, as martial arts skills will be super important and necessary for someone like her.

Physical strength is probably the point that most needs to be improved. While Hagakure will pretty much always have the advantage of getting the first hit on her opponent, that hit needs to do something. But honestly, when you think about everything our characters have been through, plus all years they spent training just to get into UA? I don't think Hagakure is gonna get bent out of shape over having to lift a couple of weights. If she can get her conditioning right and learn some good martial arts skills, she'll be an incredibly hard-to-handle defensive-based hero.

Now this may seem like a stretch, but stop for a minute and remind yourself about one of the current top heroes, Best Jeanist. Objectively consider his costume, his character design, and his power, and ask yourself, does this guy seem like a top hero or a joke? Truthfully, it doesn't matter what he seems like on first appearance. He took an incredibly weird quirk that most people probably wouldn't have thought to become a hero with, and trained himself to the top, even facing down the strongest villain we've seen (losing, but saving several other heroes from a horrible death). Best Jeanist, who I originally thought was written in as a joke, turned out to be one of the best heroes we've seen. Appearances aren't everything. Please consider everything I've laid out here. I truly believe that, with the right training, Hagakure holds some of the highest potential in Class 1A."
8sgsqw,9,2018-06-20,"Almost all ""entry level"" jobs all require work experience",MotherGiraffe,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8sgsqw/almost_all_entry_level_jobs_all_require_work/,"So after googling things like ""entry level actuary"" and ""actuarial analyst"" into a few job search engines, it seems like 90% of them require 2-5 years of relevant experience. I'm not quite at the point of applying for these positions yet (I still have 2 more years of college and plan to apply to as many internships for next summer as possible. I have FM passed and plan to sit for P soon), but seeing this is pretty disheartening.

Am I just looking in the wrong places? Are there really this few entry level jobs for people just out of college? Also, when the time comes, should I just apply to all of these places anyway for the slim chance that they notice me?"

8shdum,5,2018-06-20,The things that block recovery (for me),randomnobody72,rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/8shdum/the_things_that_block_recovery_for_me/,"It's been just over 3 years now and in a lot of ways I have moved on and forward in my life and recovery. But I know there are a few obstacles for me that I haven't figured out how to maneuver.

* No one knows what happened to me except me and my husband. I feel like sometimes thoughts of what happened and symptoms of PTSD get in the way of my relationships with other people. I don't feel like I can ever tell anyone because the shame is so strong, the guilt, the self-blame, the embarrassment. I'm not sure that anyone would understand and I don't think I have the words to explain it as I've not talked in great detail about it to anyone. I have written about it a bit but never shared that with anyone.

* I am married and was married when it happened. I had been with my husband for 11 years when it happened, together since we were teenagers and I had never been with another man sexually (unless you count some CSA in my past). I'd always been 100&amp;#37; faithful and honest with him until it happened and then I damaged him trust enormously. Because of how much I hurt him I can't talk to him about it. I don't want him to have it 'in his head' when we are having sex or something. I don't want him to see me as damaged. He wasn't able to support me with it in the beginning of my recovery because he was too hurt by my lies and so I was left alone to struggle through the darkest moments of my adult life. I haven't figured out how to talk to him about it. 

* It happened aboard (E. Africa). I was doing a student internship for a couple of months (with some others from the degree). I was raped on the second last night that we were in the country  by a person me and my friends had (stupidly I now see) trusted. So basically I got raped and then I hopped on a plane and blocked it from my memory/thoughts. I was too ashamed and confused to tell my friends who were with me what happened. I felt so disconnected from everyone and from my own body. This feeling would last for a whole year before I began to be honest with myself and husband about what happened. We are now 2 years on from me getting help for the rape and I still haven't told these girls and I'm scared that no one would ever believe me now. It being abroad can make the memories almost dreamlike/distorted. 

* The details of the rape that haunt me. I get snippets of the event and surrounding events that are especially disturbing to me. It was an incredibly physically and psychically painful experience that I think of as the worst in my adult life. However I prolonged my own suffering by allowing the man who did it to stay in touch with me over FB for a year after it happened. He actually flew to my country (for his work as a musician- doing gigs across my country) so he could see me and it was the flashbacks and trauma associated with these conversations (him messaging me about seeing me again etc) that pushed my mental health over the edge and forced me to confront what happened. I don;t know it was all very confusing and disturbing. I blame myself for all of this. he is since blocked but...

* I check up on him every so often as he is high profile and I can usually find info. For instance yesterday I read a tabloid article that mentioned how in 2015/6 he broke off his relationship with his manager and his career stalled because he was ""frustrated and depressed with his love life"" and that he had turned to drugs to heal his heart. This has fucked with my head because this would have been during the period that I blocked him and he sent me messages over a course of about 7-8 months trying to get back in touch with me. 

* I work in mental health.... and I feel I can't access services because I know most everyone who works in the services that would be best placed to help me. My job requires a lot of networking and I'm sort of the 'face' of the service I work at. And I don't want anyone calling to question my ability to do my job which is a high pressure and high responsibility one. I feel that I am managing fine at work but my self-image and personal relationships are definitely suffering.

Ok this has been long and I thank anyone who reads and replies to this. I just needed to get some stuff off my chest. I checked up on the man who raped me yesterday and it sent me for a tail spin and I ended up in a bad state mentally so I needed to check in with myself. I'm sharing it because keeping it in feels suffocating sometimes.

Is this even possible? I tried using ""npm build"" and just got a blank HTML, later I found that you still need to use a local host to pass information to that HTML (Pushstate-server).

8shp4s,3,2018-06-20,Tips for a student in LA.,Jeff2307,LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/8shp4s/tips_for_a_student_in_la/,"Hi guys,

I'm a student from The Netherlands and in February I'll be doing my Internship in LA. I don't really know what to expect from LA so I thought I'd ask Reddit for help.

The first question I had was where I'd be able to find a reasonable apartment for a student. Are there any websites I could check out? I already looked on Appartments.com and Craigslist but most of the apartments are unfurnished and generally not really meant for a 6 month stay. So if I can get any recommendations here that would help out a lot. 

My budget would be around $1500. It doesn't have to be big but preferable something that's just clean and modern.

Any tips on neighbourhoods I should avoid? I'd be working on the border of Carson and Torrance so I'd probably try to get there through public transport or is public transport not really advisable and I should look into getting a car?

Any tips are very welcome!"

&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht ‘IND-beleid bekeerlingen geregeld onzorgvuldig’? 1&amp;#41; en met de inhoud en de bijlagen van de aan u gerichte open brief van Stichting Gave?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke verklaring geeft u voor het feit dat Stichting Gave in 50% van de onderzochte dossiers, waarbij Gave over dezelfde informatie beschikt als de Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst &amp;#40;IND&amp;#41;, moet concluderen dat de IND het besluit &amp;#40;de afwijzing&amp;#41; onzorgvuldig en ondeskundig heeft genomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe verklaart u dat er door de IND niet inhoudelijk wordt ingegaan op de conclusie van Stichting Gave dat IND-medewerkers te vaak onvoldoende deskundigheid laten zien in bekeringszaken en dat er volgens Gave met regelmaat sprake is van vooringenomenheid bij IND-medewerkers, terwijl Gave hier in de afgelopen maanden met regelmaat voorbeelden van naar de IND heeft gestuurd? Ook heeft Gave op 27 maart 2018 een adviesbrief naar de IND gestuurd, waarop geen inhoudelijke reactie is gekomen. Hoe beoordeelt u dit in het licht van uw voornemen om deskundigen op een goede manier bij het asielproces te betrekken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe beoordeelt u het eerdere commentaar van de commissie-Plaisier en de forse kritiek van Stichting Gave in het licht van de aangenomen motie-Groothuizen c.s. &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 34775-VI, nr. 67&amp;#41; over de geloofwaardigheid van bekeerlingen? Hoe staat het met de uitvoering van deze motie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Klopt het dat, ondanks eerdere toezeggingen van u aan de Kamer dat de rapporten van onder meer Stichting Gave en de commissie-Plaisier inhoudelijk moeten worden meegewogen, deze rapporten zonder inhoudelijke motivering ter zijde worden gelegd door de IND of door de rechter?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid om onafhankelijk te laten beoordelen of de stelling van Stichting Gave juist is dat procesvertegenwoordigers van de IND ter rechtszitting stellen dat de rapporten van de commissie-Plaisier en Stichting Gave niet relevant zijn voor de individuele beoordeling &amp;#40;bijvoorbeeld omdat ze aangeven dat de IND zelf ter zake deskundig is&amp;#41; en daarmee van tafel worden geveegd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bereid de zes oplossingen die Stichting Gave verwoordt in haar tweede bijlage, &amp;#40;Kritiek en oplossingen voor de IND&amp;#41; voor het verbeteren van de beoordeling van bekeerlingen, over te nemen? Wanneer u een of meerdere oplossingen niet wilt overnemen, kunt u dan per oplossing beargumenteren waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord vragen 2 tot en met 6 en 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
De IND heeft de expertise om tot een zorgvuldig en deskundig oordeel te komen over de  geloofwaardigheid van een bekering. Van belang hierbij is dat de IND een integraal oordeel geeft op basis van het hele dossier van de vreemdeling, waaronder bijvoorbeeld ook actuele informatie over de situatie in het land van herkomst. Daarnaast weegt de IND ook informatie van derden mee. De weging van de waarde van een verklaring van een derde is afhankelijk van de gegevens in het volledige dossier en de inhoud van de door derden ingebrachte gegevens. De conclusies van Stichting Gave ten aanzien van de onzorgvuldigheid en ondeskundigheid van de IND worden door mij dan ook niet gedeeld.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals u bekend is, zal ik uw Kamer voor het zomerreces een reactie sturen op de motie Groothuizen c.s inzake de geloofwaardigheidsbeoordeling van lhbt-asielzoekers en bekeerlingen door de IND. Alle input die daarbij geleverd is door bijvoorbeeld Stichting Gave, maar ook de Commissie Plaisier, wordt daarbij betrokken. In de brief aan uw Kamer zal ingegaan worden op de in deze schriftelijke vragen aangesneden onderwerpen. Ook de positie van rapporten en verklaringen van derde partijen zal daarbij uitdrukkelijk aan bod komen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7

Antwoord vraag 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het klopt dat er bij de beoordeling van bekeringsaanvragen tot op heden sprake was van een vaste gedragslijn, welke door de Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State geaccordeerd is. Deze gedragslijn is vastgelegd in een intern informatiebericht van de IND. De gedragslijn geldt niet enkel voor de gehoren, maar betreft het hele beoordelingskader van aanvragen waarin een bekering als asielmotief wordt aangevoerd. In de eerdergenoemde brief die uw Kamer voor het zomerreces ontvangt, zal ik het toetsingskader kenbaar maken.

8shv3o,27,2018-06-20,Free Sport Psychology Services for Competitive Rowers,jleszner,Rowing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/8shv3o/free_sport_psychology_services_for_competitive/,"Hello competitive rowers! My name is Joseph Leszner and I am a graduate student at the University of Ottawa. I am currently in an applied sport psychology program, training to become a mental performance consultant. As a mental performance consultant, my job is to help athletes increase their chances of performing optimally by teaching them various mental skills (positive self-talk, imagery, etc.). For my program, I am required to obtain 400 hours of internship experience working in this position. I believe that all athletes can benefit from this type of training, which is why I am offering my services to all of you! Sessions would be conducted over Skype (Hangouts, FaceTime, etc.). A typical session will normally last from 45 minutes to 1 hour. If you are interested in receiving some free mental performance consulting, or have any additional questions, please send me an email at [mentalperformanceconsulting@gmail.com](mailto:mentalperformanceconsulting@gmail.com). In your email provide me a little information about you, your sport, and what you hope to get out of this experience. Even if you don’t have a specific concern to address, I can teach you various mental skills to enhance your already effective performance. Below is some additional information about me, mental performance consulting, and what you can expect to gain from this experience. Look forward to hearing from you!

\*Note: if you are a national athlete I will not be able to provide you with this service.

**About Me**

My name is Joseph Leszner, and I am a graduate student in the Master of Human Kinetics program at the University of Ottawa. I am a student member of the Canadian Sport Psychology Association (CSPA), and training to become a Mental Performance Consultant (MPC). I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, and have also obtained my Mental Health First Aid certification from the Mental Health Commission of Canada. I am a former competitive video game player, and have played in many high stakes tournaments. The highlight of my career was competing for $70,000 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was during this experience where I started to understand how various pressures could influence my performance. My goal is to provide you with the support that I wish I had when I was competing competitively. I believe that by increasing self-awareness and positive thinking, you can learn to make more effective choices, increasing the likelihood that you will perform optimally when you need to.

It is extremely important to me to develop strong relationships with the athletes I work with, because it allows the work we do together to be the most effective.

**What is a Mental Performance Consultant?**

An MPC is similar to a sports psychologist. The main distinction between the two is that sports psychologists make clinical diagnosis (i.e. depression) and focus on performance, whereas MPCs just focus on performance. The job of an MPC is to help increase the likelihood that athletes will perform optimally when they need to, in sport and in life. We help athletes accomplish this by teaching them various mental skills. Gaining self-awareness, thinking more positively, goal setting, improving focus, and enhancing self-regulation strategies are some of the many skills that can be learned while working with an MPC. The goal is to teach, inform, and support athletes in the practice of these mental skills for optimal performance and living. We can accomplish these goals through individual and/or group consultations, as well as mental skills workshops.

Note: MPCs are not clinical psychologists and therefore cannot diagnose and treat mental disorders.

**Example Discussion Topics**

• Maintaining focus during competitions.

• Confidence issues.

• Creating pre/post performance routines.

• Motivation.

• How to make effective competition plans.

• How to manage emotions during competitions.

• Managing distractions.

• Managing negative thoughts.

• Implementing positive self-talk.

• Learning various relaxation techniques.

• Integrating visualization/imagery into training.

• Learning how to set effective goals (short and long-term)."

* *Newbies*: The game interface is [here](https://vote.redditcfb.com/cfbrisk.php). You get one action a day that can be chosen in the bottom right box. Bottom left box is the info about whatever territory you currently have selected. You can see how previous days battles have gone for a territory by clicking on the logo beneath the day. Top right box is team info. If it doesn't say Wisconsin you need to go to /r/cfb and get your flair changed to WI flair. Top left box is your ranking breakdown. Your overall ranking is the median of the 5 rankings. Make sure to click the link on the bottom ranking and visit all 20 of those links for an easy ranking upgrade.  
  
* *Private sub*: /r/BadgersCFBRisk to discuss strategy, diplomacy, outreach, etc. Visit there and go through the motions to get in or message a mod.  
  
* *Discord*: Talk to /u/ArtificialBadger for an invite. There's also a link in the private sub.  
  
* **Allies: We're a part of the Red Alliance which includes Nebraska, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Alabama, Texas A&amp;M, Stanford, and Virginia Tech.**  
  
* **Enemies: Clemson, Michigan**  
  
* Other contributions we can use on top of your action votes each day is memes and recruiting. If you know other Badger redditors or where they gather please encourage them to join in the game. Our power seems to have plateaued and we'll need more as end of game approaches. If memes are your thing the meme game in /r/CFBRisk is as strong as anywhere on reddit. Please throw some memes together to support Wisconsin and Team Red (WI, NE, AL, TX A&amp;M, tOSU, OK, Stanford, and Virginia Tech).  
  
* Please Keep Recruiting! Every soldier we can get is one we can use somewhere! Don't make alternate accounts or bots to vote for us but if you can convince your friends to help out we would appreciate it! Your Facebook group chats, discords, twitter, anywhere you think we will have sympathizers.  
  
**New Developments:**  
  
* Yet again we have 2 territories, but now they are both out East. As it stands that means we are back to fighting Michigan and Clemson, but we will no be using our full force instead of half of it.  
   
* If you are just joining us today DEFEND PENN STATE     
  
* **Orders will be going out around Noonish Central today.**
	
* The reds were able to clear most of the blues out of texas, and are on the door of Gainsville. Ohio pockects continue to cause problems for the blues.	 
  
* Michigan and Florida had some massive gains, and the west looks a little blue. This is partially due to large territories and partially due to having alot of them.    
  
* If you aren't on the PM bot, and want to be, please message us!     
  
* In the event Wisconsin is eliminated we are not sure what path we will take. We WOULD ask that everyone keeps playing, be it as chaos to sabatoge the blues or as a blue player. The reason for this is to 1) help our alliance atleast win, and 2) help people gain more turns played for awards and a potential bonus next season for playing a long time in this one.  
  
* Job. So my internship started Monday, and as such the way orders getting messaged out will be at essentially one of 3 times. It could be in the morning before 8 A.M., during the noon lunch hour, or after I get back from work. The goal is to have the first of the 3, and then noon, and then Worst case is right after work. We have been working with Red Command to streamline the process so you can get your orders as soon as you can.  "

8sj400,1,2018-06-20,"I crunched some numbers for living expenses through december, wanted some advice",roberthinkey,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8sj400/i_crunched_some_numbers_for_living_expenses/,"So just a background, I'm going to be a Junior in college starting in late August/early September. I will be living with my girlfriend starting August first, and while we haven't made our final decision on where to live, most of them fall between 800 and 900 a month, including pretty much everything except electricity and internet which in total should run us an extra 50 bucks per person total. 

So heres what I have (only doing my side of the financing, my girlfriend is more than able to pay for her part):

I make about 12.5 an hour working as an intern at a law firm and over the summer I'm working 40 hours. This position will go until December (date hasn't been decided) and it starts July 2nd, and I am currently finishing up my current job which pays about 12 an hour but I only work like 30 hours a week if I'm lucky. 

So neglecting my current job and just looking at my income starting July 2nd, and assuming I have zero in savings I figured I will have about 1500 by semptember 1st after all payments and taxes.

Here's how I got that: 40 x 12.5= 500- (500x.16(~tax rate))= 420 per week. 420x9 (number of weeks I can work full time)=3780. 3780-850(avg security deposit and first month rent(my cut)) =2930. I am also considering financing a car starting in July, which will end up costing about 320 bucks between insurance and car payments. I also added an additional 200 for gas money which I think is an over estimate since I am really only using it to commute to school and partially to work (metro runs right by work so would probably utilize that). So that means an additional 520 bucks per month for car. 2930-1040 (2 months, bringing me to Sept.) = 1890. Then we'll say 250 for food and any other utilities per month, putting me with savings of about 1640 or so.

Then from Sept on, I am able to work 24 hours a week, at the same wage, so 24x12.5=300-48 (tax)= 252 a week.in addition to this income, my uncle pays for my text books and gives me an additional 300 a month for food (he's very wealthy and this was the same deal he gave both my sister's going through college). So 252x4 (monthly income from work)=1008+300=1308. If we take the same numbers above and apply them here for payments and what not then it should come to coming to an additional 113 or so dollars a month. I know that doesn't sound like much, but I was very liberal with numbers (gas and food) so I think I could make this an additional savings of ~200 a month. Which yet again I know isn't a whole lot, but I'm still in University so I'm not expecting to be savings large amounts per month... But I think that my savings coming into the year (~1600) and additional 200 for at least 3 months sets up a decent emergency fund for a college student.

I know that the temporary position can create some concern over my financial status, but this position should allow my to get another position at the same lawfirm (gfs family is good friends with one of the partners) or another law firm in the area. Also, considering my state min. Wage is ~11 I don't think it will be difficult picking up another job around what I would be making.

Also, if it comes down to it, my University typically sends me a refund in both October and March for the amount of ~1500. This is typically from over financial aid, and I try to not use it but if it absolutely came down to it, it is there. In the past I invested part of it got a decent return, repayed it and kept the amount I got from investing (I know, super dumb and risky strategy and don't plan on doing it again).

Anyways, I know this plan kind of violates the 30% finance rule, but can people please bring up biggest concerns other than that? I currently am renting and understand my monthly food price/utility prices. But I still feel like I'm missing some big things. Thanks!

8sj8cm,1,2018-06-20,My [25F] husband of 3 years/partner of 8 years [26M] is going through an extremely rough patch and I don't know how to help,LateInvestigator,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8sj8cm/my_25f_husband_of_3_yearspartner_of_8_years_26m/,"My \[25F\] husband of 3 years/partner of 8 years \[26M\] is going through an extremely rough patch and I don't know what to do. Job disaster, self-esteem collapse, I'm tired and sad and don't know where to go from here. We have had a tumultuous past 3-4 years. He was quite emotionally abusive as a result of his own upbringing (think invalidating my opinions/worldview consistently, correctly things about me that objectively did not need to be corrected) and it took me several years for him to acknowledge what was happening and finally, in the past few months, he has begun therapy. He loves me a lot and wants to better for both of us. He loves therapy, and has really progressed a lot in how he treats me over the last 6-8 months.

We are both graduating from professional graduate programs this month, and I have job offers from four organizations in our industry (I have been offered every job I've applied to). I work freelance right now and am already pulling in 60-70k a year, am looking to have two publications in my field later this year, and work closely with several former professors. Overall, I am doing extremely well.

My husband is graduating from the same program and struggled with the internships. He has had 3 job interviews with no success. He has work that pulls in say, 30-40k a year. It does not look like he will have work in his field at any point in the next year. He is absolutely demoralized by his own lack of success and also by my comparative success.

He tells me daily I deserve better and berates himself for all of the pain and suffering he has caused me. I have wanted to stick with him through everything, but this is all making it very difficult. I guess where I am is... if a person repeatedly tells you that you deserve better when things are objectively not great, then you start half-wondering if maybe they're right.

He wants me to do things like... ""lower my expectations of his earning potential"" so that he can lower the expectations for himself and be content to make 30k for the next few years while he tries to get off his feet. The problem is, I don't have expectations around earnings, I just have expectations that he works at all, in any capacity, and barring a mental health or health issue, that this work is full-time. I do not care if it's minimum wage, I earn more than enough to support us right now.

I guess the issue is he has expectations for himself that he struggles with and then he tries to put the expectations on me/he tries to ascribe them to me.

I don't know what to do. How do I help this while preserving my own happiness and sanity? We have both been through a lot, but I feel like I've been shouldering so much for so long and I am tired. I feel like the family would fall apart if I took a break on anything - planning, working, organizing, socializing. It's a lot on one person.

What should I do to help us?

I put all of my emotional weight on him until he couldn't take it anymore and broke it off. He recently moved to LA for a new job, and he already had too much on his plate to worry about me too.

That summer I spent three months in a foreign country for an internship all by myself. It was just me inside my room, and all my thoughts just bounced off the walls. I spend every night regretting everything I did. I cried myself to sleep just thinking about all the good memories and all the things that I could have done. I couldn't believe how stupid I was to throw this away. I couldn't and to this day, I still can't. 

A few months after we broke up. I saw a picture of him that he posted on Facebook. It was his birthday, and he was having a nice dinner with his family. I saw how happy he was, and I couldn't take it for some reason. I deleted him off everything. I thought I would be able to get over him that way, but I didn't. 

Last September, I decided to visit a counselor for the first time. I was put on antidepressants. And I'm glad I did it. I am in a much better place now. My thoughts are clear and I don't feel depressed every single day anymore. 

A few days ago, I saw his name on an app that I had forgotten about. And suddenly all the memories and longings came rushing back to me. I decided to message him, and apologized. I felt like I was so toxic for putting all of my burden on him way back then. And of course, being the kind of person that he is, he forgave me and even apologized for not being able to help me more. And it seems like he is okay with being on speaking terms again.

But now I can't stop thinking about him again. I want so badly to tell him how I still have feelings for him and they have never faded one but. I want to tell him how much I miss him and his voice and his smile. I want to tell him to give me a second chance and how I am better and I can be better to him. But it all feels so pathetic. I can't help but think that he is already over me and he has well moved on. He probably is content right now just being single and focusing on his career. Or maybe he already is in another relationship. But either way, I can't shake off this feeling that I threw away a chance of my lifetime."

I'm really curious about the question I asked above - **What is, in your opinion, the best strategy to maximize the time in your 20s?**

Possible answers include:

* maximize for money
* maximize for health
* maximize for social skills
* maximize learning
* ... something else

I know that you should physically exercise and practice game (as I am already doing - but maybe I'm wrong), but the thing that currently troubles me is my career. Let me note that I am far from a master in any of these areas, in most of them I'm merely a novice (or not even that), so I can't say that I've had an internship in a company in that branch for any of the fields.

I like games, movies and cartoons, so naturally I liked game development, movie making and animating. However, since all of these are very hit-and-miss fields and require a lot of capital and/or teamwork to accomplish (and, most importantly, a lot of *time* to even get decent at something of the 3, and then you have to find a team and work for peanuts with the probability of making some serious bucks stacked against you), I decided that I will do these when I have enough capital to acquire a team to execute on my ideas or that I'll pursue these as a hobby when I'm financially independent.

So I narrowed down my focus to two areas - information security and research related to artificial intelligence. I like them both. I like information security because I always liked the idea of gaining access to something you shouldn't have had access to. I liked the idea of hacking since I was a kid, I just really love it. Then again, research related to artificial intelligence also draws me, because I feel that there are some really important issues that need adressing.

Life-style wise, I think that information security freelancing would be the best option for me, since in my 20s I'd like to travel to game in different countries and see the world. If I was a researcher, I'd probably settle in a city and researchers don't get paid as much as information security consultants (as far as I know).

But as you can see, my main premise is that I'm optimizing for money here. I dropped movie making, games and cartoon making. Sure, I'm not super-uber passionate about it, but I dropped it because I think it is safer to have a lot of money, *then* do these, than to not have money and depend on your next game being a big hit or starving to death. Also, I might get financially independent when I'm 30 and then start a PhD and transition to research in artificial intelligence, but that's when I'm already financially independent and have preferrably traveled the globe and don't worry about money so much. *Again, I unconciously optimized for money here.* I also took lifestyle considerations into account. I've travelled to about 5 different countries in my life till now (I'm 21 and a half) and I liked it. However, that doesn't mean that I would like travelling all the time and lacking a consistent city to live in. Maybe I like to travel 1-2 months a year, maybe travelling for 6 months would tire me. I don't know because I never tried.

There are so many variables out here that I'm having trouble figuring out what I should focus on in my career - is it prioritizing information security, while learning about artificial intelligence in my free time? Or is it the reverse? Do I take my (hypothetical) ideal lifestyle into consideration here? How do I know if I would even like travelling, gaming around the globe, having a lot of money? I mean I like *the idea* of it and it sure as hell sounds nice, but I don't know if I would actually love it.

Any advice, books or resources on this topic would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!"

I currently make 12 bucks an hour as a data scientist intern at my local university. I rent a shitty apartment and drive a 04 civic. My parents are both retired and I'm 26 so this year I applied for medicaid. At least until I graduate this fall (MIS is my major so hopefully I get a job fairly quick). I was accepted and picked a provider in the state of Michigan. I did pay for a dentist appointment at my old office and was told I have several cavities which would total around 800 (that's with a $100 ""lower rate plan"" fee for those uninsured). They don't take state medicare like most dentists. What are other options as far as dental goes? I was thinking of opening a credit card that offers 500$ if you spend 3000 in 3 months as I'll have to spend that in tuition in the next month or so anyways to negate the costs a bit.

I have made a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/reddups) and finally deployed my [Heroku app ](https://my-crypto-search-react.herokuapp.com)using React using the coinmarketcap API to retrieve values of popular cryptocurrencies. However, i feel like my resume could improve since i did not take any internships (any thoughts on this?  hah. )  


I feel like I could improve this app by incorporating Nodejs so i could use different API's such as [LastFM](https://rapidapi.com/dimashirokov/api/LastFm/functions/getTopArtistsChart?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=FreeMusicAPIs_LastfmFunctionsGetTopArtistChart)'s to show the trending artists, add the artist name and album cover, etc. and also include the coinmarketcap above, as sort of an interest page for myself. (The extension was also something i made in my interest to make my time on the laptop more healthy)  


The problem is, I can't seem to find any good resources to show me how to use react and node together, unfortunately.   
Does anyone know where I can find some good resources?

8sljw1,332,2018-06-20,"[Residency] Obligatory ""Why you should go into otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery/ENT""",pandainsomniac,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sljw1/residency_obligatory_why_you_should_go_into/,"Seeing the recent post about radiology and the comments about wanting more posts about different fields made me write this.  Hope this helps!  I will try to follow the same format as the other post to try to keep it as organized and standardized as possible.  

Background:  I'm a recent graduate at a mid-tier program in the southern U.S. originally from the west coast.  I originally wanted to do ortho vs. neurosurgery, but stumbled upon ENT late in my third year.  It offered me everything I wanted with a relatively more laid back lifestyle.  I will be moving to a smaller city soon (110k population), doing private practice with 4 other ENTs where the call and clinic/OR schedule is very manageable.  

Breakdown
    PGY-1: Most programs now are integrated at this point in time.  I think there may be 1 or 2 that still has a full general surgery intern year but from everything that I've heard, most intern years for ENT are similar to a transitional/prelim year in surgery.  When I was an intern I did 3 months of ENT, while currently our interns do about 6 months of ENT.  The other 6 months usually include different fields including neurosurgery, general surgery/elective surgery, OMFS, ER, and Trauma surgery.  

    PGY-2: Our program front loads call so 2nd year is usually the most time-consuming.  When I was a 2nd year we took about 11-13 days of primary call (24 hr call) including 2 weekends (3 if we had a 5 weekend month).  Our new schedule is a lot more lenient since we consolidated one of our rotations back into the city so we have a bigger call-pool.  Our PGY-2, PGY-3, and PGY-4s only take one weekend of call now, which is a lot nicer.  The learning curve is relatively steep at first just because most medical schools don't really prepare you for ENT, but usually after a few months you get the hang of it. During our 2nd year we rotate through a big underserved hospital, and a large community hospital.  Our community hospital rotation is by far the busiest because we have all the subspecialities represented (Neurotology, Rhinology/skull base, Facial plastics, Head &amp; Neck Oncology, Pediatrics, General, Reconstructive/microvascular).  As a PGY-2, you get to operate a good amount starting off with a lot of bread and butter pediatric procedures (tonsils, adenoids, PE tubes, etc) and you are in the OR a fair amount ""holding hook"" for our big head and neck cases (free flaps, etc).  Usual morning:  Get to the hospital about 15 minutes before the rest of the team to print out the list, write down the vitals, test results, drain outputs, pre-op your patients, then round as a team, floor work, surgery/clinic, etc.  

    PGY-3: This year is probably the most laid-back responsibility wise because you aren't an upper level so you don't have to worry about many of the upper level responsibilities but also are more advanced than the lower levels.  This is somewhat the sweet spot because you get to do a good amount of facial plastics and learn how to perform good sinus surgery.  We also have a private practice rotation where you can rotate with one of our affiliated staff to see the private practice lifestyle and have a decent amount of free time.  Our PGY-3's rotate through a big community hospital, the VA and private practice during this year.  Usual morning:  show up to rounds, write notes, then pre-op patients and surgery/clinic. 

    PGY-4: This year is when you start stepping into the more advanced head and neck cases and start doing more ear surgery.  You only take approximately 4-6 days of primary call but you are usually at the hospital for longer hours because of the bigger head &amp; neck cases (i.e. laryngectomies with bilateral neck dissections with free flaps- can take anywhere from 8-16 hrs).  You also get to protected time with our otologist which is nice because you get to see a very subspecialized side of ENT that you definitely don't get much of an opportunity to explore during medical school (Tympanomastoidectomies, stapedectomies, surgeries in conjunction with neurosurgeons to remove tumors, cochlear implants, etc).  This is also the year get a protected research block and apply for fellowships should you be interested in pursuing a subspecialty. Usual morning:  rounds, notes, help with orders, pre-op, surgery. 

   PGY-V:  At this point you are relatively familiar and comfortable with most procedures and are using this year for fine-tuning procedures while serving as the academic chief and taking care of many administrative duties for your respective site.  My program only takes 3 a year so by the time your are a PGY-5, you are usually separated at different sites for the whole year.  Usual morning:  Rounds, help w/ notes, make decisions on the most complicated patients, preop the big cases, surgery.
 
Extra:  Every resident takes the yearly in-service exam, which is generally held in March.  It's 300 questions (I think) and it gives you a breakdown of the fields in ENT to better help you improve for the following year.  One of the biggest draws for me going in ENT is that it offers such a wide array of procedures since I tend to get bored pretty easily.  One day you can be doing PE tubes and tonsillectomies, the next day you can be taking off half of a mandible and harvesting a fibula to replace the missing bone and reconnecting vessels under the microscope, working with the Da Vinci robot, doing sinus surgery with CT stealth navigation and playing with endoscopes, etc.  

 Our call breakdown (different depending on which program)
PGY2: 1 weekend of primary call (2 if it's a 5 weekend month) plus about 7-9 primary call days throughout the week.  Our new 2nd years have a buddy call system where you get an upper level during the first 2 months to ease the new residents into our call.  If you get killed during the night or weekend we send you home the following day.  

PGY-3:  1 weekend of primary call plus 5-6 days of primary call.  

PGY-4: 1 weekend of primary call plus 2 days of regular primary call.  One week of backup per month at our big community hospital (only have to go in if the other resident needs help- rare)

PGY-5:  Only 1 week of backup at our big community hospital per month.  Rare that you go in. 

Job Market:  I think when I matched there were approximately 280 spots in the country and now there is closer to 300.  The job market is similar in that you will most likely get paid more if you go to a smaller city as many docs tend to congregate to the bigger cities.  I grew up in a smaller city doing a lot of outdoorsy things and have always wanted to go back to something similar so I targeted the smaller areas and had no issues getting multiple interviews.    

Personality:  Having always known that I wanted to go into surgery, I was always gunning for something surgical in medical school.  There are many stereotypes in the surgical fields (some are true, some aren't), but ENTs are relatively friendly folks who don't really operate under the militaristic hierarchy many believe to be a part of surgical fields.  I'm a quiet, soft-spoken person for the most part and after rotating with the field, I thought my personality fit in well with most of the staff.  Hope this helps a little.  Feel free to shoot me any questions as I have a very chill schedule for the next few weeks!

Scariest call situations: usually airway related. Peds airways are the scariest for me because kids tank fast so you have to act quickly. The adult airways can obviously also be difficult (angioedema, ludwigs angina, malignancies) but the adult airway is a lot bigger thqn a kids so you have a little more time. Also...carotid blowouts are scary and they suck to deal with. 

Edit: sorry about the formatting. Too lazy to figure it out"

Please help,majormongoose,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8slzyf/is_my_mom_a_telltale_narcissist_please_help/,"I'm in college, my parents are what every college could ask for, they pay for me, check up on me, and support me. However I'm always on edge because when I was younger (and even today of course) my mom belittled my efforts in just about anything and always told me I had to get off my ass and do shit. It was great that pushed me back then but now, I have summer classes and a good internship and she still calls me to nag and tell me about what I need to do when I'm fucking 20. All she does is work really and she has no artistic or creative outlet and she thinks it's a waste of time that I pursue them, I think she just wants me to end up as miserable as her despite her saying all she wants is for me to be happy. 

It's just hard to trust someone that is so flip floppy and gave you some form of ptsd from belittling your efforts and life choices. In 6th grade she made me stop talking to a group of friends because they were a bad influence. It's funny because then I had to start hanging out with the worst kids in town and the kids she told me to stop hanging out with are all in college and are respectable by her credentials. I told her I resented those things she did to me when I was younger and that it isn't right just because her parents also ""gave a shit"" (abused her). 

My sister says it can't be abuse because we never got the belt but I'm not so trustful or naive. I see the guilt tripping and I get that my mom has a right to be happy, but is it right to be happy by living through your kids? I will surely never let my kids feel like I had to make every sacrifice in the world for them and that their efforts and life decisions are laughable, that's not what love is about. 

The worst part is I see that in myself too. Talking down on friends behind their back, using my things to get people to like me, withholding them when they misbehave, i definitely have a lot of narcissistic tendencies. It's just devastating realizing my mom isn't the happy person she always pretends to be, and idk how to save our relationship but also avoid being like her and letting go of the past trauma. "

There’s just one problem. **She wasn’t actually at the parade.

Happy Pride, Oregon! #LGBT #pride #loveislove

There’s just one problem. **She wasn’t actually at the parade. The pictures she posted were from previous years’ parades.** Instead of actually partaking in the 2018 parade, as she makes it appear, **she was attending a [fundraising junket with leftist Californian billionaires](http://www.wweek.com/news/2018/06/17/gov-kate-brown-continues-strong-out-of-state-fundraising-with-a-gift-from-apple-billionaire/)**, including Lorene Jobs, widow of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, and Patagonia founder Ivon Chouinard.

Let’s dive a little deeper into this. Here are the pictures from previous years’ Pride events that Kate Brown recycled.

Here’s one of the pics she posted on June 17th, 2018:[](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/./Screen-Shot-2018-06-20-at-3.03.37-PM.jpg)Here’s the original picture, from 2017:

The picture of her with the two little girls? That’s been recycled three times now. It was originally from 2015, recycled for 2016, and used yet a third time for 2018.

Why do I always get so stressed out whenever I try to do something to better myself? Whether it’s reading, applying for internships, practicing coding or whatever, I just can’t bring myself to do it because I keep getting so anxious and I end up just going back to watching tv or whatever. I used to feel the same way about working out, but now I work out pretty much everyday and I keep my diet decently healthy. That’s pretty good compared to what I did when I was younger. I just wish I had that same drive with things that’ll actually help my career and make myself a smarter and more knowledgeable person. Maybe I should try that Brilliant thing that keeps getting advertised on YouTube videos.

8snrii,86,2018-06-20,I asked my girlfriend to help with the household chores and she got angry and said she is going to stay with a friend,Inetro,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8snrii/i_asked_my_girlfriend_to_help_with_the_household/,"So, this just happened and I am very worried.

For background, my girlfriend suffers from depression, PTSD, and shows signs of bipolar. She is on medication and sees a therapist regularly but has been declining lately. We have been together for 4 years, this is nothing new and I have been and always will be by her side through it all.

As of about 4 months ago, I have been handling a majority of the household chores (dishes, laundry, taking out the trash, sweeping / mopping / vacuuming) because she has been having a hard time finding the energy.

2 months ago we were in school so I had time during the day between my college classes. Our schedules were opposites so when I was home I could clean and when she was home she could sleep. It worked out well. For the past 2 months I have been working full time at an internship so I have been feeling the stress of that and more tired than usual. She is on her summer break so she is sending out resumes online and trying to handle her mental health issues.

Before I started at this job, I asked if she could take on more of the chores to save me some of the energy during the week, because otherwise my weekends will be full of cleaning. She happily agreed and said I should try mot to worry.

Well, that plan kind of fell through. Some examples are that I asked her to take out the recyclabes because they were starting to pile up, its just taking them down the elevator to 1st floor and separating them. She said yes, of course, they would be done. Cut to two weeks later and I am doing it myself on the weekend because they were getting hard to manuever around.

Another example are when I asked her to do the rest of the dishes (some cups, 6 bowls, and some cutlery) because I filled the rack and wanted a break for the day. I did them the next day because I couldn't strain the noodles for dinner.

But on the weekends, she always makes comments like ""Baby, youre so stressed, you should take a break. You don't have to do everything, you should rely on me more.""

So onto today! We had a fire 4 floors below us  yesterday and we both killed our arms/legs bringing our cats down 9 flights to safety. So I said I would do the dishes today and just push through it. She messaged me back saying ""Don't worry baby, I got it"". Well, 5 hours later, she asks me to do them and I do them. But while I am doing so, I tell her that I feel like I have been doing most of the chores lately and it would really help if she could do a load of laundry this week (she hates it, but its well overdue and we have at least 3 loads to do).

Well, this set her off and she said ""Sorry for being a pain."" Then she started packing, and left to stay at a friends place. I tried to talk to her before she left but she wasn't responding to any of it.

...what do I do? I feel so drained, and useless. I am so lost right now.

EDIT: She came back to grab some things, I heard her crying and some gagging sounds, and walked in on her choking herself with a cord. She broke down and I was able to get it out of her hands.

Apparently she has been putting on an act to seem ""better"" than she feels and it has been exhausting for her. She didn't want anyone to worry about her. I am going to contact her therapist and explain what has happened and take their advice. Thank you for your comments everyone, I am not sure if it will work out but I do love her and I am going to be there for her until we can have a calm talk about our relationship going forward."
8snuc0,7,2018-06-20,Parents will not let me make a two hour drive by myself. i'm 22 (and in need of advice),25amaterasusano,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/8snuc0/parents_will_not_let_me_make_a_two_hour_drive_by/,"My parents are a narc and an enabler. Lately I have been living with them while I work in order to pay off my recently acquired student loan debt, as well as car insurance on my parent's car that I do not own, and saving for a wedding in a couple of years. My parents assured me that living at home with them would be just like I was a stranger paying rent. My fiance lives two hours away in a large city working at an internship, and before the summer began, we agreed to come visit each other fairly frequently. 

Currently my dad (the narc) rides with me to work everyday. This started because he needed the car also and also as a way for him to give me pointers as I got back into driving after being away from it at college. It is now a month later and he still rides with me, constantly pointing out minor flaws in my driving when asked why I need him to still be in the car, but otherwise going on about what a safe and smart driver I am. I do not have the means to move out yet, but my fiance and I are now looking for jobs in the city she is in so that I can get out of this house.

I also wish to drive down to the city to see her, as I haven't in several weeks. So far, she has driven here twice, and I would like to drive to her for once. They refuse to let me do because they say I never got onto the highway when I was driving in high school, and for this trip I would be doing so in rush hour. I pointed out that I have in fact made an hour long trip on the same highway before, and that the best way to get experience is just by doing it, and that I am 22 years old and the idea that they can just say I do not have permission to see my fiance is ludicrous to say the least. They are now saying because it is their car, they can choose who takes it, which is perfectly valid reasoning if they needed the car. However, in the same breath, they say ""this isn't about the car. It's about your safety."" They are so full of it they cannot even see this inherent contradiction. They also call me selfish and say I'm being ""uncooperative"" when I say that I am 22 years old and want to drive to see my fiance. They don't see me as an adult and never have, despite numerous people saying that I am mature like an adult and deserve to be treated like one.

They have offered me two choices. One is for my fiance to drive here and pick me up, and I would have to pay for the gas. My fiance is not at all keen on this because she has already driven down many times and is tired of it, as this would be right after work. The other option is one parent rides in the passenger seat while I drive up there, then takes the car and leaves when we arrive. Then they will come pick me up and let me drive back. We don't like this either as it lets my parents dictate how long we get to stay together. My fiance and I are tired of my parents always trying to find ways to control my life now that I am growing out of their control. They always gaslight and use misleading arguments containing logical fallacies to get their way, or they just try to guilt you into their position. My fiance's view of this is that since this is the first family matter that involves her and her choice, she does not want to set a bad precedent or they might do this stuff more and more knowing they can get away with it. She wants to show them that the crap they pulled with me growing up will not work on her/us anymore. She was thinking of using extortion, saying for example that since she has to come pick me up, she may not be able to come to my mother's birthday next weekend, or the family reunion the next weekend.

My view is that my parents have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If we accept, then they can now baby my driving forever. However, if we turn them down, then I do not go to see my fiance and my parents are happy that I'm staying home with them. Therefore, I don't think that any precedent or lesson will be learned from this, and I do not want to punish myself trying to punish my parents. I don't want to cut off my nose to spite my face. I am afraid she would do this, and all we would end up with in return is a summer without seeing each other. I agree we need to fight and do something, but my position on that has always been to do so when I have to means to support myself, so I can duke it out and leave and still have food to eat and a place to stay.

Obviously I want to set this precedent though, because I do not want them to do this when I'm living on my own. What should I do in this situation? Any and all help is greatly appreciated."

8solpe,4,2018-06-20,Girlfriend [20] doesn’t get along with my family.,Piratelife101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8solpe/girlfriend_20_doesnt_get_along_with_my_family/,"Me [21] and my girlfriend have been dating for over three years now. I was finishing up my senior year of high school and she was in her junior year when we first met. It was actually two weeks before prom that her boyfriend (a friend of mine at the time) had broke up with her and I was just trying to be a good friend really. I had never really been in a relationship at the time, with my longest relationship being maybe a month. I just was the kid who focused on school. Student of the year, graduated with a biomedical science certification, and had gotten into a 10 ten university in the county. 

From here, is where the story really starts. I had never had sex at the time and she had with a few different people. A few weeks in, I was extremely attracted to her and it just happened. We used protection (important later on), but it had broke, so I bought her Plan B. A few weeks go by and she never got her period. Inexperienced little me thought she was pregnant after she was 9 days late, so one night I spilled the beans to my mother that I had had sex (we NEVER talked about that kind of stuff), and that she hasn’t gotten her period. A few days later she did get her period, but because of the awkwardness me and my girlfriend kinda just parted ways for the summer. I was getting ready to go to college and she was still in high school. Right when school was getting ready to start up, we started to talk and hang out again. Eventually, we started dating again and had a beautiful fall. I was in a program with the university where I go to school during the summer and spring and not during the fall, so we would hang out everyday basically. Things were great for the most part. Once spring came around, I would drive home on the weekends to see my family and see her. My parents had a rule that she could stay until midnight, but no later. Well one weekend I was only able to drive down for one night and it was a night my girlfriend had to work until 11:30 and then the next day she was going out of town for a week. We didn’t want to go multiple weeks without seeing each other, but the rules are the rules. Anyways, she walks in the door at 11:45 and my mom says “hey, it’s 11:45, just letting you know” or something along those lines. My girlfriend starts slamming doors and going out to her car, so I go after her and talk to her. Then she starts calling my mother every name in the book. I didn’t realize I left the door cracked to the house and my mom came to the door and heard it all basically. Then my mother starts yelling back for like 30 seconds and my girlfriend leaves. I go to bed to sleep it all off and once I am in bed my mother comes in and sits down next to me with my dad on the phone and they lecture me on how to speak to your parents. From my perspective, I wasn’t the one yelling, but I took it all and relayed how they felt to my girlfriend. They had a bumpy relationship for a little bit, but that stuff eventually faded away and things were okay.

 Now let’s fast forward to after she graduates high school. First I need to give you some background information. My parents got married at 20 and started there own business. Things were slow at first, but around when I got to high school, business took off and because of that, they are able to pay my way through college and as I went into my sophomore year of college, they bought a condo in my college town and rent out all the rooms. Back to the story. Now that she was graduated high school, she started to look at a college that is sisters with my university. We talked about living together, and eventually we brought it up to my family. At first they were not on board ( the whole leave at midnight thing), but once she explained she doesn’t have any money to get her own place and she didn’t want to drive from her moms house an hour and a half from campus every day, my dad said okay. She lived there for free. No food cost, no housing, ect. This took place for a year and a half basically. We would all go on vacation together; things seems to be okay for the most part. They would argue every now and then, but nothing like I mentioned earlier. 

Throughout that year and a half, she had a dog back home. Her mom worked all the time and had no way of being home enough to take care of it really and my parents had a no pets rule for the condo. On a few different occasions, she had asked to bring the dog up until she found him a place to live. They insisted no and instead let the dog stay at their house for a week when she had lined someone up to take him. Well that person fell through and my girlfriend mom had to watch the dog again because it had chewed up power cords and other stuff, as well as pick on my parents dog. From there on out, my girlfriends mom took care of the dog and the issue passed. Now to present day. About 3 weeks ago, my uncle went out of town and asked my parents if it would be okay if the cousin who lives with me could watch the dog for 3 days at the condo. They agreed. From here my girlfriend texted my parents about how they were hypocrites and bad parents, and this that and the other. My mom and girlfriend would text back and fourth all week until my mom just stopped texting back. She also would call me a pussy for not paying my way through college and all this other stuff. I told my girlfriend that what she said is uncalled for and that she needed to apologize. Regardless of if it was hypocritical or not, that isn’t how you treat potential family. My girlfriend texted back a few days later saying she wanted to meet or call to apologize. My parents would call me and say that what was said was uncalled for and that they needed some time. Meanwhile, this was occurring on my 21st birthday and my parents wanted to see me, so I drove to where they were for the weekend and just got all of this stuff off of my mind. (This would be Friday and Saturday). 

Saturday night around 10pm I get a call from my girlfriends mother saying my girlfriend was in an accident and she doesn’t know how bad it is. I was an hour away, so I told my parents and my mom rode with me to go see her in the hospital. I stayed with my girlfriend in the emergency room the entire time until she was released, except for a 5 minute span where my mom came in. I don’t know what was said or if anything at all was said. My mom came back out to the waiting room and I went back in. She ended up having a broken foot, her face was bloody and her knuckles were all busted with the jointed jammed. Since then, she has packed up her stuff from the condo and is staying with her mom for now while she goes to the doctors and deals with lawyers since the accident was the other persons fault. For the past two weeks we have just been in this weird waiting game or something. I want my family to have a relationship with what I picture as my future spouse, but I also don’t want my future spouse to treat family like this. I would like to think this is the last time something like with would happen. I guess I am just waiting for if my parents will talk to my girlfriend or not. In the mean time, we have see each other twice and we would kiss.  For the past week now, she has been texting “sexy/sweet things” that would imply she is in the mood, but because her foot is broke and she has to have someone drive her around, she can’t act on them. Like I said, it’s this weird state and I don’t know what to do. Do I try and have a relationship with her regardless of my family gets along with her? Do I let what my parents say decide this relationship? 

Kinda related, but also not, I am about a year away from graduation and have had job offers in a few different states with a few governmental organizations. While I don’t pay my way through college, I don’t think that negates the work I have put in or dictates me as a “pussy”. Like isn’t that a parent’s goal in life; to be able to pay your kids way through college, so they can focus on there studying and internships. I could understand if I was out partying and blowing my families money, but I have never drank or smoked. I have been to one party to DD for my friends. I go out to eat once a month and the rest of the month I make my own food. I just feel as if that is the responsible and proper thing to do, not something that makes me a pussy or a titty baby. 

**TL;DR;**:Maybe I am reading into the whole name calling thing too much, but those are my thoughts and I look forward to any advice. I know this is very long, but I wanted to provide as much background as I can. "
8somf8,42,2018-06-20,"I'm a virgin, but I'm a little slut at heart - and a story about my first kiss",UntaintedAPeekInside,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/8somf8/im_a_virgin_but_im_a_little_slut_at_heart_and_a/,"I have *finally* created a Reddit account where I can really be me and I am so excited. 

Ever since I was a little kid, I remember masturbating all the time. I would get in trouble for doing it in public, but I didn't understand why. I was just trying to feel good, and it felt *so* good. My mom finally told me that I could only do it alone in my room, so I did. I spent so much time in my room constantly touching myself and moaning.

Puberty didn't help that at all! It made it worse. All I can think about is getting fucked as hard as I can. Every time that I'm sitting in lectures or in meetings at my internship, I am so horny I can hardly focus! I squeeze my thighs together and rock back and forth, and I know people notice. And that just turns me on even more. I love showing off.

Some guy cat-called me today and all I wanted to do was suck his cock. I bet it was a beautiful one.

ANYWAY I promised you a story and I'm going to deliver, because I love telling it.

I'm a bisexual girl but my daddy has never let that shit fly. I'm actually engaged to one of his business mates (he's a younger guy, only eleven years older than me) and that's why I have to stay a virgin. But that doesn't stop me from playing around ;) As long as I'm back in my dorm by 1 AM, I'm in the clear.

So my first kiss was when I was graduating grammar school. It was with my best friend. She was so cute. Puberty had given her these huge boobs, and she didn't really have a flat stomach - I would watch her undress every day after gym class and when she took off her shirt, a little pudge would flair out as her pants gripped her hips. I always thought that pudge was so sexy. 

I don't even know how it happened, but we were at a party one weekend and my best friend was being super flirty with the boys. She and another girl, who were known as the class sluts, started kissing each other trying to turn them on. I was watching it and getting so jealous! I kept wanting her to kiss me, but she never even looked. I don't know if she even knew I was interested. Finally I decided I had to take a chance! I didn't want to go into high school never been kissed, and I wanted to kiss her. So when we were in the living room and drinking a little bit I kept making eye contact with her and willing her to do it, and then finally I kind of touched her arm and she smiled, and she pushed my hair back behind my ear and looked me in the eyes, and I guess when I didn't stop her she moved forward and we kissed.

*It was so awesome!!!!!!*

Her lips were soft and she parted mine and then ran her tongue over my lower lip. Then my mouth opened more and she pushed her tongue in even further and I felt so connected to her. We kept making out for I don't know how long, and I left feeling like I was the luckiest girl in the world!

I'm 19 now and I still touch myself thinking about that kiss.

8sotpy,1,2018-06-21,Ranting about NMom and stuffy ideas about older siblings marrying first. Tips appreciated.,figuring-out-life,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8sotpy/ranting_about_nmom_and_stuffy_ideas_about_older/,"I have just recently found this sub, and felt I should share my story.

My family is weird, I don’t know if I’d call my mom an nm but she fits the profile very closely and my SO who is helping me through all this shit also agrees that she might be an NMom, 

Anyhow let’s go back to Easter a day of forgiveness and love, for Christ.... for most people.

I was at an internship for an accounting firm bc I’m still in school, I could not drive home bc to long of a drive.  My SO offered to drive while I slept in the car back to his home town for Easter so as to not be alone.  Fast forward to Sunday we had a great time with his family. Then I get the call.  Mom is pissed bc I did not call or talk to them all day, and chose SO’s family over my own, how I’m not the daughter they know.

We get over all this shit then for my birthday(yes mine) my SO comes into town after starting his job, I’m in grad school for another year hence I can’t go NC or LC(they are helping me get through masters).  He leaves and NMom goes off yelling about how they don’t know my SO (of three years) and how I can’t marry him until after my OS marries, and not until I move home. Pro tip you actually have to ask someone questions to get to know someone not just address there girlfriend. This is also not the only reason they give for us not being good together, they use religion as another excuse.  Bc my relationship with my SO is totally there business (highly sarcastic) 

I’m just so done with everything bc I can’t get away, I can’t have a conversation with them and they bait me into yelling so they can reprimand me.

Any tips for the next year to not somehow explode? 

Edit: the reason the Easter thing hit so hard was that my Edad was the one to call me and acted like everything was fine then said the words « would you like to talk with your mother » (not actually a question) then she yelled at me... like a surprise attack.

Sorry if I sound spoiled this is my first time posting and I’m a little all over the place. "

What can I do?,Can_O_Murica,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8sp1tl/my_debit_card_got_skimmed_and_all_my_money_is/,"I just moved to a new city for a summer internship. Ive been here less than 2 weeks, and I went to fill my rental with gas only to find my card was declined.

I checked my account and there's pennies left. Somebody hit up a bunch of gas stations with my info and withdrew/spent all my money. I've got enough food for a few days if I'm careful, but only enough gas for 1 more trip to work and back. I don't have any cash. 

I still have money in savings, but I'm worried that if I transfer it, it'll just get withdrawn by whoever has my information. My bank is 1000's of miles away, so if they send me a new card, I may not get it until the middle of next week, which is longer than I can go without spending any money.

My bank is closed for the night, I'm calling them as soon as they open tomorrow morning. Is there anything that can be done?"
8spqwk,7,2018-06-21,Need Some Support for an Engaged Medical Fiance,supermut555,MedSpouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/8spqwk/need_some_support_for_an_engaged_medical_fiance/,"Hi All,

I did a Google to search if there was a support system for significant others/spouses of medical students...I'm glad I found something with people still posting to it.

I'm a 31 year old male who is currently engaged to a 29 year old medical student in her third year.  A little background on our relationship.  We have been engaged for one year, but have been together for seven.  We are currently doing the long distance relationship (two years now via different states) thing and it is HARD, and only seems to be getting hard as of late because she is so stressed out about the following:

1. Taking her Step 1 COMLEX test, coming up in one week
2. Moving to another part of the state to start her third year internship
3. Third thing is most likely trying to maintain a relationship with me without trying to constantly dump on me about the stressors of school

I feel that the past few months we have had a fight every few weeks about something nonsensical.  Tonight's argument was about payoff of her credit card debt.  We had previously discussed this and I agreed to pay for half of the debt and that her parents would pay the other half.  In her culture, or how I perceive it, there is an inability to ask for help/pride issue, help being her parents.  I cannot solely shoulder the financial responsibility of supporting her because I have my own commitments I have to make.

I asked her, in what I perceived as an adult conversation, whether or not she had paid off the rest of her credit card balance (she is normally very responsible).  She said no, she had to pay for some items recently (car fixes, moving costs, etc.), which is fine.  However, what irked me the most was that there was still a rolling monthly balance on the credit card.  We had made a plan and a pact (two months ago) that she would pay off the rolling monthly balance to zero, that didn't happen.  Yes, I did get visibly upset, but I proceeded to try to have an adult conversation about it, where she immediately shut down (a lot of crying and being mad at me).  Once she shut down I tried to have an adult conversation, but it wasn't happening so I did the last thing I should've done and also got mad.  I started cursing, yes I am sorry already, and she hung up on me (she never hangs up on me), which is an unallowable in her book.  I texted her letting her know that it wasn't right to hang up on me and her response was ""I'm stupid remember I don'pt know how to do anything right"".  The complete emotional shut down seems seems to be a common response to any adult conversations I try to have with her.  I'm not sure what else I can do.

I already understand the trend here, but it seems a bit unfair to me that every time there is a board exam our relationship gets put on hold.  Am I being selfish?  I am trying to see it from her perspective, where she feels that this is another issue on her plate that she doesn't want to deal with.  Should I expect this for another four years?  I'm a bit lost for words...

Thank you for any advice, reality checks, anything that you all can throw my way.   I just need a sounding board from others who can relate.  I'm sad and frustrated because I want the woman I love/want to spend the rest of my life with to be happy.

EDIT 1: I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU EVERYONE THAT HAS RESPONDED.  This is the first time I've actually had any insight into what I should be feeling or expecting and it has been seven years together and over two years on the medical school path.  I will take my time to respond to each of you in time, but THANK YOU AGAIN.  "
8sptry,3,2018-06-21,Had a lot of weird dreams today and yesterday - a sign?,ManSoldWorld,DreamInterpretation,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/8sptry/had_a_lot_of_weird_dreams_today_and_yesterday_a/,"The dreams:

-Me and my dad were driving on a congested road. He bumped against the side a bit, and then I chastised him to be careful. We get to a gas station late at night, and then, two men pull up, shoot him as he's filling the gas, and they drive off. He dies.


-I was standing in the kitchen of my home with my mom. She was talking bad about my dad, something apparently related to an issue from long ago, and he was on some foreign business visit. They used to fight a long time ago, so knowing that, I was telling her not to fight with him when he gets back. Her literal words were, ""I'm going to have a big fucking argument with him.""


-I was in an apparent Groundhog Day setup, but I wasn't there. I saw a male and female brunette speak, with an exchange that went like this.


FEMALE: ""Between this time and that one, everything's changed, but he's still the same.""


MALE: ""The reason these problems have happened is because everyone looks for something wrong blatantly, rather than letting it come to them.


-I was in a meeting at my internship, and as I stop to check a ping on my phone, my department's head comes over and whispers to me to not do it, but there's something ominous and threatening about her tone. As if me doing it could cost me my 
job.


-Me and my mom are in the kitchen at our house. There are bags under her eyes, and she looks at me and begins to sob. ""I've been doing cocaine"", she says. My dad comes in, asks what's wrong, and she says it again, and he gasps and hugs her.


-I was driving on a road in a town setting. I see a man, a woman (both in their 50s), and another woman (in her 70s) being accosted by cops. I remember feeling annoyed because they were walking across the road to get to the sidewalk. When they got on the sidewalk and were being put in handcuffs, I mutter ""Fucking idiots"", and drive off."
8spv29,14,2018-06-21,The Banshee and the job,Quirkybumblebee,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/8spv29/the_banshee_and_the_job/,"This is a really light tale, and something I wrote up because I find it amusing. She's not really and evil bad guy here, but I thought I'd try to put a smile on some faces!

I got a job, guys! I signed a contract with a school district a month ago, which means fiance and I have been searching for an apartment (plan to buy a home when I'm tenured). We applied for one today and if all goes well, we're the proud renters of a beautiful apartment. All SUPER good news. I'm extremely excited to take this giant step towards our future together. Eeep! Also, we just celebrated 5 years together, which means less than a year until we get married!!! 

Now, I wouldn't be posting here if there wasn't a little mild panic, though, would I?

Banshee graduated college! We are all very proud of her, especially since she graduated from a prestigious school and was probably the last kid my parents ever thought would as she was not the brainiac of the family. Unfortunately, the twit wasn't bright enough to realize that there's a reason most her friends did internships and other sorts of jobs while she said it was too hard. It's hella hard to get a job in the area she wanted to live in with no experience. So, guess where she's been living. 

Yup, with Mom and Dad (and my brother and myself). It's been fun. She goes from happy to down right angry. Any time I call her she gets immediately cranky because ""what if someone calls for an interview??"" OK, sorry but Mom and I kinda need to know what kind of cake mix (She made a Breath of the Wild cake for my brothers birthday) you wanted NOW and you haven't answered the text I sent ten minutes ago. It's been walking on eggshells. Not because I don't want to upset her, but because being around her is VERY draining for me. I've legit been hiding in my bedroom under the guise of packing when, really, I've just been watching The Flash, Arrow, and currently going back and forth between Queer Eye and The Crown. Or obsessively playing The Sims 4. I finally got mods so it's super fun. 

Anyway, after a while of hiding and tiptoeing around, I realized my friend was leaving a job at a law firm to go to law school this summer. Now, normally I wouldn't care beyond congratulating her, but I got in contact with this friend about Banshee taking over her job after the following occurred: 

One week ago, it looked like things with this apartment were definitely going to come through. Banshee immediately makes this her project so she can stop focusing on unemployment and throw herself into something new. 

""Oh, Bee, I can't wait to hang out in your apartment. We can decorate and cook and make it look so cute..."" Basically, 'let's pretend your apartment is mine. Since I've lived in an apartment before and you haven't I know how to decorate it' She said this MULTIPLE times and started talking about recipes she'd teach me. 

Panic alarms are going off in my head, and I said, ""What makes you think you're going to be hanging out at MY apartment?"" So, I mean little shiny nub of a spine. 

""You're just going to be playing video games or watching Netflix (OK, true) you need my company if you're going to do anything (OK, not true)"" was her response. 

The conversation didn't continue because Mom knew exactly where it was headed and changed the subject. Thanks, Mom! /s

After that, I reached out to the friend with fingers crossed and asked if Banshee should apply for that job. We'd discussed it a bit before, but friend wasn't sure since Banshee didn't have the 2 years experience the firm preferred. Friend had asked, and they said to go for it anyway cause they're desperate. So, I relayed that to Banshee and she argued with me about how it was pointless since she didn't have the experience. Despite the fact that the firm said if she had a lot of experience with research and writing (she had to write a thesis to graduate, so yes she did) then they'd love for her to apply. 

So, after a lot of back and forth and asking me to proof read writing samples, she did. And she had a phone interview two days later. And an in person interview two days ago. And she got the call yesterday that she's been hired. I'm definitely happy for her, just because she's a pain in the ass doesn't mean she should fail. Honestly, I think this environment will be good for her. Though her superiority complex won't be great. She's already a ""Well, I went to a fancy school. You went to the one 20 minutes from home. Your education wasn't as good as mine"" type of person. Oh well. She still asks for my writing input despite her fabulous education. *SIDEEYES* 

But, that's how I helped Banshee get a job in her desired area of living. All because she started to suggest invading my apartment, and I'll admit, I feared getting kicked out if I had a screaming drama queen in my hallway my first week of living there. 

Also, she starts next week so, SO LONG GIRL. "

He was so cute and even tried to teach me Portuguese and laughed about my accent of speaking French. Turned out my internship company is right across the street of his company, he was so upset when I told him that I am going back to my home country, but later I explained to him that I will come back, he became so happy. We both love computer programming and football. 

So we had sex (I don't do random fuck, just the walk and talks made me felt very comfortable and wanted to do so); later we went back to each other's campsites, he didn't come back to look for me I thought it might because that I was not at my campsite since I was at the concert. So later my best friend suggested me to find him on LinkedIn since I know his company and I found him, also found him on Facebook!!! He has a gf for more than 4 years!!! I've asked him if he was alone (indirect way of asking him if he was single, and he said yes). 

So now, I am so lost, I don't know if it is necessary to text him on LinkedIn to say that it was inappropriate of cheating and lying. I told my close friends about this, and they said I should. I don't really know how to deal with it.

8sqrzr,715,2018-06-21,I'm Heccu and this is how I became the MSB interviewer.,Hency_Heccu,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8sqrzr/im_heccu_and_this_is_how_i_became_the_msb/,"Hello fellow redditors and HotS fans.  
  
  
My name is Heccu and I am the interviewer from the last MSB in Stockholm/Jonkoping, Sweden. It took me some time to think what to write, but I decided to make a reddit post about how I got to work with Blizzard.  
  
*“But WHY?” (insert meme here).*  
  
Because I am sure that many of you will be able to relate to my story. It might not change your life, but it can be “food for thought” for some of you. :)  
  
Let me start by telling you that I am EXTREMELY proud of myself for what I managed to accomplish. Right now I am talking not only about esports, but also about how I changed my life in general. The person that you see right now is the result of my hard work on myself. It’s the result of me fighting my inner demons for 10 years. It might not look like it right now, but I was a stay-in teenager with complexes. I never was into partying and I spent all of my time playing computer games and watching anime (finished more than 250 titles). In 2008 I decided to start doing something to stop being so antisocial. That’s when I started cosplaying. Since then I pushed myself out of my comfort zone by hosting events, making interviews and streaming. This might sound extremely cheesy, but my greatest enemy was never reddit or twitch chat. It was always myself.  
  
**Why did Blizzard offer me to do interviews during MSB and not someone else?:**  
I believe that only a Blizzard representative can give an answer to this question, but I think that  there are multiple reasons for that.  
  
**My history with “Blizzard” games:**  
In 2010 I started playing WOW. In one year I got into my realm’s TOP 10 hunters (PVE).  
In 2013 got into Hearthstone Beta. Played a bit for fun, but nothing serious.  
In January of 2015 I started playing Heroes of the Storm. I managed to get to Master in HL 3 times.  
P.S. I will not mention ALL non-Blizzard games that I played. I am here to tell a story and not to advertise games and Korean MMORPGs. :)  
  
**My history with ‘Heroes of the Storm” esports:**  
I am the type of person who gets frustrated by being bad at something that I like. The best way to improve is by learning from those who do said thing for a living. This is why I started watching professional tournaments and I never stopped since then. It is impossible to mention ALL the tournaments I watched, but I know the ones that I visited and watched LIVE:  
2015 WCA EU Pro Qualifier - GamesCom (Cologne, Germany)  
2015 Road to Blizzcon (Prague, Czech Republic)  
2016 ESL Heroes of the Storm Championship - IEM (Katowice, Poland)  
2016 ESL Heroes of the Storm Championship - GamesCom (Cologne, Germany)  
2017 HGC Phase #1 Western Clash (Katowice, Poland)  
2017 HGC Phase #2 Western Clash (Kiev, Ukraine)  
2018 HGC Phase #1 Western Clash (Katowice, Poland)  
2018 HGC Mid-Season Brawl (Stockholm/Jonkoping, Sweden)  
This year’s MSB is the only HotS tournament that I got invited to. I had to cover all travel and accommodation expenses for all the previous events on my own. Considering that I am a student without a fulltime job - it was not easy.  
  
*“But WHY?” (insert meme here).*   
  
Some people spend their money on expensive clothes, or partying. Tournaments and competitive play are things that I find very interesting, so I spend all my pocket money just to travel alone to watch HotS tournaments. Everyone gets to pick their own hobby and this one is mine.  
  
**My “Heroes of the Storm” content creator experience:**  
I’ve been streaming HotS 3-5 hrs EVERY working day for almost 3 years. A year ago I started making interview videos with HGC pro players on my youtube channel and recently I started working with Heroes Hype.  
  
**I share the same values as the company:**  
  
This is entirely my own opinion, but it seems to me that I and people from Blizzard share similar values. We think that passion, patience, consistency and hard work is the recipe for success. It took me 3 years to prove that I have all the qualifications above.  
- I am passionate about this game. During 3 years Heroes is the only game I streamed and I spent a lot of my savings and time to visit various HotS tournaments.  
- I am patient. If I decide that I want to do something - I keep on doing it until I achieve it. I did not drop streaming, when I had 5-10 viewers for over half a year. I did not stop making interviews when they had low views.  
- I am consistent. I don’t jump to stream a hyped game that I don’t care about just to get new viewers and followers. I don’t want to build a community that is not interested in HotS. As long as I’m doing something that I care about - the number does not matter.  
- I am hard working. For almost a year I had an absolutely insane schedule. Every working day I would spend 8 hrs at the internship and 3 hrs streaming at home. I had absolutely no free time, because outside of these 11 hrs I also needed to attend university lectures, do homework and produce youtube content. Even this intense working load did not force me to quit the things I like and love.  
  
**Evaluation of my MSB performance:**  
I was extremely happy to see that I got more positive than negative responses from the community. I managed to noticeably improve in just 1 week (from groups to playoffs). Unfortunately I looked a bit weaker than the rest of the talent that was invited for MSB. This does not make me sad even for a second.  
“But WHY?” (insert meme here).  
Because many MSB talents have years and years of experience. They had their fair share of ups and downs that made them the people they are right now. Most members of the community did not get see how HotS casters started their careers. For me it is the start of a great journey.  
  
Why and how do I stay so calm? The two people in esports who I look up to the most as hosts and interviewers are Sjokz and Anna Prosser Robinson. Right now they are doing an amazing job at what they do, but it was not always like that. If you look at Sjokz´s 6 years old and Anna´s 9 year old interviews - it´s day and night with what we see today. I know that the things I want can be achieved with hard work and I never had problem with working hard. :)  
  
I know that I still have things to learn and ways to improve.  
  
I don't think that my accent is something that can stop me from pursuing a career in esports, but it’s something that I will work on. There are many examples of people who were accused for having an accent at the beginning of their esports careers. The first two examples that come to mind are Deficio and Sheever. Both were getting hated in the beginning for their thick accents. Many years passed and now they are fan favourites. You can still hear that English is not their native language, but no one cares, because they improved on the way they talk. I did not follow Khaldor´s, Grubby´s or Tod's careers from the start (was never a SC fan), but I can see that even now they can sometimes get accused by some people for having accents. Does that stop any of these people? Nope. So it will not stop me. :)  
  
I don't think that my knowledge of English can stop me from pursuing a career in esports. I had private 1 on 1 English classes for 12 years. I've been streaming in English for 3 years. I've been living in a foreign country and studying in English for 2 years. Anyone who met me in real life or watched my streams can attest of the fact that I derp and make mistakes only when I am too excited or nervous. :)  
  
Some say that “what doesn't kill you makes you stronger”. Well... I’ve never felt more alive. :)  
  
If you have any questions - fell free to DM me. :)

Only problem is I have another addiction,zoochadookdook,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8sr9o8/today_is_day_7_one_week_mark_only_problem_is_i/,"So I've been to time to my internship every day this week, haven't had a hangover, have made it to classes at the gym and my second job (teaching wrestling/building in home servers) every weekend and taken on a for sale by owner home commission. I also finally got those car parts ordered, a dental appointment in, walked the puppers and just generally feel more productive. I actually got handed free beer at soccer the other night twice during playoffs (they give you pitchers....being an adult with sports is fun) and handed them off to someone else. NOT easy to do when you're sweaty and hot and didn't plan ahead and bring water.

HOWEVER

I drank a 8 pack of la Croix in a freaking day. Hate the taste, respect the bubbles. I went for a 12 pack of krogers seltzer water for $2.50 plus deposit last night and already downed 3. I thought being sober was supposed to be cheaper!?"
8srmyo,1,2018-06-21,"[M4f] Looking for a long term chat/rp partner. Details, scenes and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8srmyo/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood afternoon DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"
8srt97,1,2018-06-21,$12k/mo selling chocolate and donating all profits to animal rescue.,youngrichntasteless,ecommerce,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/8srt97/12kmo_selling_chocolate_and_donating_all_profits/,"Hey - Pat here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Sarah Gross Feoli of Rescue Chocolate, a brand that makes Dog-themed chocolate.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Dog-themed chocolate.
* Revenue/mo: $12,000.00
* Started: January 2010
* Location: Brooklyn, NY
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 0

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

I’m Sarah Gross Feoli, the founder and owner of Rescue Chocolate. While our products are only for humans to enjoy, we donate all profits to various animal rescue organizations. I began the company in January 2010, and in the past 8 years have partnered with hundreds of different rescue groups on fundraising.

All of our chocolate bars and truffles are vegan, fairly traded, organic, handcrafted in small batches in Brooklyn NY, and delicious. Each flavor highlights a different issue important in the realm of animal rescue. For example, Peanut Butter Pit Bull calls attention to the fallacies of breed-specific legislation. The Fix urges people to spay and neuter their dogs and cats as the most important step in reducing the numbers of homeless animals. There are links on our website where our customers can get more information about these issues.

Our retail customers are chocolate aficionados, animal lovers, local foodies, and anyone with a sweet tooth. On the wholesale side, we are carried at gourmet groceries, pet stores, veterinarian offices, vegan shops, and natural food stores.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I’ve always been interested in animal welfare, and grew up with at least one or two dogs in the house at all times. During middle school and high school, I volunteered at my local animal shelter in Shreveport, Louisiana. I also became a vegetarian and then a vegan during those years. (I chose the vegan lifestyle primarily out of compassion for animals. Later I learned that it is also beneficial to the environment and one’s health as well.)

My love for chocolate didn’t happen until my mid 20s, after I had moved to New York. I enjoyed visiting the artisan chocolatiers in the city and sampling exotic varieties. For a short time, I worked at a raw vegan chocolate factory in Queens where I developed a best-selling flavor.

Then I adopted a homeless pit bull.

Rescue Chocolate was born, and started turning a profit in the second month of its existence. I had no business background. In fact, I had been a professional ballet dancer in college. But I learned the business basics on the fly. It helped that I did not have to set up my own factory and train my own employees. I use a co-packer, and I can run my ideas through the executive chef there.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

When coming up with flavors for the bars, I usually just go with what I like. Occasionally I’ll run a very informal focus group or online survey to get input from others. I pay attention to trending ingredients. For example, for awhile there was a bacon craze. You were finding bacon in every kind of dish from entrees to desserts. I came out with a soy-bacon chocolate bar called *Fakin’ Bacon*. Another example is artisan salt. My *Mission Feral Fig* bar contains one called fleur de sel. My line of *Like White* bars and truffles contains chia seeds and other ""superfood"" ingredients. I don’t go this route only to get in on fads but also because all these ingredients are really tasty!

My husband is a graphic designer, so he is responsible for the branding and the look of the products and the website. My pit bull is the company mascot, so her photo appears on almost every label. The bars are wrapped in colorful metallic foil with a white paper oversleeve, which allows for a fun yet luxurious look.

I found my manufacturer through a chocolate consultant. Yes, there really are such people. The relationship has been great over the years. The co-packer is convenient to me in Brooklyn, and is fairly flexible in accommodating my manufacturing runs.

There were very few start-up costs. I put the initial outlay for the first run on my credit card. Since this is a sole proprietorship, I did not have any legal fees for setting up the structure. I do pay for liability insurance, to which riders are attached each time I go out to food festivals and sell direct to the consumer. When I outgrew the storage space at the factory, I rented out a small storage facility. This is where I do all the packing and shipping. (Someone else might be able to operate out of their home, but I don’t trust myself to have all that chocolate stock at my fingertips!)

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

To create a website, I used one of the templates on Shopify. I then had a series of designers customize the look. I can add and subtract products, change prices, offer various discounts, and track where the sales are coming from, all very easily. In the beginning, I paid a photographer friend of mine to take mouth-watering shots of the chocolate; now I can do that on my own.

Originally, I used Paypal to process payments. Then Shopify created a system of its own, which I use for the online sales. I still do some invoicing of wholesale customers through Paypal. For email blasts, I like MailChimp. Our e-newsletters go out a couple of times per month, and they have a very upbeat vibe.

Aside from the cost of goods sold, the biggest cost for running the business was and remains postage. Sometimes people don’t understand why they have to pay shipping, since Amazon and the other big players offer it for free. But I don’t do the kind of volume where that makes sense. When people pay for shipping, that means there is more money available for me to send to the animal rescue beneficiaries. Shipping gets pretty expensive in the warm-weather months, because I have to express-ship with ice packs and insulation. Therefore, sales do tend to slow way down in the summertime.

I launched in the days before Facebook had its draconian algorithms in place. Every time I got a ""like"" I could be sure that new people were learning about Rescue Chocolate. It doesn’t work like that anymore, so probably advertising would be an important component of launching a business today.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

I post on social media platforms as often as possible. The e-newsletter is particularly effective, especially when it includes a discount for loyal customers. Getting our name out in mainstream/traditional media is helpful too. I try to respond to all media requests for quotes or articles. Rescue Chocolate is also able to appear as a sponsor for many festivals and fundraisers if I make an in-kind donation of chocolate.

We also have 2 specific ways of spreading our message when we partner with rescue groups. The groups then take it upon themselves to do the marketing for us, because it benefits them. One method is similar to the Girl Scout Cookie model. We sell our chocolate to the group at below-wholesale rates. They then resell to their own supporters at the regular retail rate, keeping the difference. The second method invites all the groups’ supporters to order Rescue Chocolate online, and indicate the name of their rescue group at check-out. We give the group $1 back for each bar ordered that way.

Even without a storefront, I like to sell to customers in person at various pop-ups and events. Not only does this lead to sales on the spot, but my booth will always have an email sign-up sheet so that I can continue to contact those people and close sales down the road.

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

Rescue Chocolate has been profitable from the very beginning. However, as with most food items, our margins are not very large. When we add in the mandate to donate a portion of every sale to charity, the margin gets squeezed even further. People know they can get mass-produced chocolate at the big-box stores very cheaply, so not everyone is willing to spend more for higher quality. Our fair-trade and organic certifications are fairly pricey, and the market simply will not bear increasing the price of a 2-ounce chocolate bar to compensate fully. For these reasons, we are not in distribution. There is not enough room in the model to pay a distributor.

About half of our sales are online, and the other half is wholesale. We have drop-ship arrangements with a few other online sellers (that specialize in either vegan products or pet-related products). We are no longer available on Amazon or in Whole Foods. In the past, we did bow down to those giants and tried to play by their rules. But we found that the few pennies we earned did not justify the headaches of dealing with them.

We plan to continue to expand gradually so that we can keep the focus on a quality product and on raising money for even more grassroots animal welfare groups. At the moment, we only ship to customers in the United States. If we can find a non-exorbitant shipping option, we would like to ship internationally as well.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

While our co-packer is known for accommodating small runs, sometimes we would prefer to order even less of a certain flavor than is possible. In trying to meet the factory’s minimums, we might wind up with too much of a perishable product at a slow time of year. Conversely if we try to compensate for that and don’t insure the next run in time, we might find ourselves with dozens of orders that we can’t fulfill.

From time to time we have hosted student interns. For the most part, I’d advocate not doing so. Even though these are not paid positions, the amount of training time they required--and the mental space to worry about them--turned out to be a net loss. Except for the very first intern I ever had! He was a firebrand from Lyon, France. He brought in quite a few new customers. I hadn’t realized at the time that he was the exception to the rule.

We make our animal welfare donations every month, and that is a way of erasing the negatives. Even if our profits are way down for a given period, at least we know we are still making a positive difference in the world.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

Shopify provides the forward-facing website and a simple back end. The only 3rd party app I use regularly is Converso which is fairly good at convincing abandoned carts to return by utilizing a small automatic discount. For shipping I really like Ordercup which is fully integrated with Shopify and can find the cheapest shipping method for any size order. As noted above, Mailchimp does my email blasts. I also like good old Google Alerts for keeping on top of the trends in the chocolate business as well as for finding media mentions of Rescue Chocolate. And unbelievably, my accounting is all done on Excel.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

My inspirations are not specifically related to my chocolate business but to my life in general, of which the business is a big part.

An early influence in my understanding of what happens to unwanted animals in this country was the No Kill Advocacy Center website. The director, Nathan Winograd, pioneered strategies for getting the kill rate way down at animal control facilities all over the country. (There used to be 18 million dogs and cats killed every year in America. Now the number is down to 4 million.) He shares his innovative ideas through conferences and on-site visits. He and other people like him give me hope that the problem can be completely solved one day, through all kinds of incremental efforts. My contributions through Rescue Chocolate are small but important.

For me, a ground-breaking book on the health benefits of a vegan lifestyle was The China Study by T. Colin Campbell. Since it was first published back in 2005, there have only been more and more scientific studies adding to the chorus. This continues to validate my decision to sell a vegan food product such as dark chocolate.

Influential podcasts are: The Tim Ferriss Show (along with Ferriss’s book The Four Hour Work Week , This Week In Startups, and How I Built This (for continued inspiration).

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

You don’t have to know every last detail of running a business before you launch. You can learn on the job. Even if you have the best MBA credentials in the world, there will still be problems that arise that can only be straightened out using common sense.

Find something that you are passionate about, and keep that fire burning underneath all of your everyday activities. Your passion will drive you to increase sales, and master bookkeeping chores, and make cold calls, and do whatever else it is that you might not otherwise care for. Going through the motions as a disinterested automaton might work when you’re somewhere in the middle of the corporate hierarchy, but it doesn’t work at all when you are running your own business."

Since they made this position up, I have no one to teach me how to do anything and ive only had 2 data analytics classes so im sort of learning as I go. I am trying to make a stacked bar chart but am running into problems. I have my data broken up by department in my college into 3 different columns as Lower division hours, Upper division hours, and Graduate hours generated by Fall semester of each year. I am trying to make a stacked bar chart where each bar is a department broken into LD,UD,G so I can compare them side by side but am unable to do it as I just end up with them next to each other or they're stacked but only by year. If someone tells me how I could upload the Tableau file if that is easier. Thank you for your help."

&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden van de minister voor Buitenlandse Handel en Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, mede namens de minister van Economische Zaken en Klimaat, op vragen van het lid Leijten &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over de Dutch Trade and Investment Board &amp;#40;DTIB&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het artikel ‘Deze club heeft al dertien jaar invloed op ons economisch beleid &amp;#40;en toch kent niemand hem&amp;#41;’ over de DTIB?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Is de DTIB of zijn opvolger, de International Strategic Board &amp;#40;ISB&amp;#41;, dat specifiek opkomt voor de belangen van Nederlandse internationaliserende bedrijven, een lobbyorganisatie? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Onder welke voorwaarden wordt een organisatie al dan niet als lobbyorganisatie aangemerkt? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat is het verschil tussen een adviesorganisatie en een lobbyorgaan? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
Indien DTIB of ISB als adviesorganisatie wordt gezien, hoe voorkomt u dan dat de organisatie bedrijven in staat stelt intern te lobbyen? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 9  
Heeft de DTIB een mission statement? Zo ja, hoe luidt dit? Wat is het doel van de DTIB of de ISB? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2, 3, 4, 5 en 9  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Dutch Trade and Investment Board &amp;#40;DITB&amp;#41; en zijn opvolger de International Strategic Board Nederland &amp;#40;ISB-NL&amp;#41; zijn geen lobbyorganisaties, maar platforms voor publiek-private samenwerking van &amp;#40;regionale&amp;#41; overheden, kennisinstellingen en bedrijven. Zoals beschreven in de Kamerbrief ‘Investeren in perspectief’ &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 34 952, nr. 1&amp;#41;, is het doel van de ISB-NL de samenwerking tussen departementen, kennisinstellingen en bedrijven te verankeren en daarmee de kennisbasis, het innovatieve vermogen en de internationale positie van Nederland te versterken en bij te dragen aan de SDG’s in Nederland en wereldwijd. Ik acht deze samenwerking van groot belang voor de totstandkoming van effectief overheidsbeleid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Kunt u aangeven waarom een adviesorganisatie de agenda van internationale handelsmissies mede bepaalt?    
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
De DTIB en ISB-NL bepalen de agenda van internationale handelsmissies niet, maar adviseren daarin. Deze adviezen acht ik van belang om tot een goede afweging te komen van te organiseren economische missies en om de effectiviteit van deze missies door publiek-private inzet verder te vergroten.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7   
Kan de brief van DTIB aan informateur Schippers tijdens de Kabinetsformatie 2017, waarin onder andere aandacht wordt gevraagd voor de winstbelasting en de 30%-regeling, worden gezien als lobbystuk? Zo nee, waarom niet? Wat is het verschil tussen een adviesstuk en een lobbystuk? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de brief die u aanhaalt, informeert de voorzitter van de DTIB de informateur over het Team Nederland adviesrapport &amp;#40;april 2017&amp;#41; van de DTIB Stuurgroep onder leiding van de heer Buijink. Dit openbare adviesrapport was het resultaat van een brede consultatie van publieke en private belangen en is uitvoerig besproken binnen de DTIB. Voor het overige verwijs ik naar het antwoord op de vragen 2, 3, 4, 5 en 9.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8  
Zijn er vergelijkbare adviesorganen waarmee ministeries met enige regelmaat contact hebben? Welke andere adviesorganen zijn er waar &amp;#40;hoge&amp;#41; ambtenaren of bewindspersonen bij betrokken zijn? Kunt u een uitputtend overzicht verstrekken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn veel adviesorganen waaraan overheidsorganisaties, bedrijven, kennisinstellingen en/of andere organisaties deelnemen. Het verschaffen van een uitputtend overzicht zou een aanzienlijke inspanning van het ambtelijk apparaat kosten en acht ik niet opportuun.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 10  
Is de samenstelling van de DTIB of de ISB transparant? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, waar is de samenstelling vindbaar?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 11  
Kunt u een overzicht verstrekken van alle personen die zitting hebben genomen in de DTIB/ISB of één van de werkgroepen en per persoon aangeven wanneer zij zitting hadden, wat hun toenmalige functie was en wat hun rol was binnen de organisatie? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 12  
Welke huidige bewindslieden hebben zitting in de DTIB/ISB of in één van de werkgroepen? Sinds wanneer hebben zij zitting in de DTIB/ISB? Waar kan deze informatie worden opgedaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 14   
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe kan er democratische controle plaatsvinden op het maken van beleid dat mede is ingegeven door DTIB of ISB, wanneer overleg- en adviesorganen geen notulen meer opstellen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 15  
Deelt u de mening dat het niet langer maken van notulen van bijeenkomsten de schimmigheid waarmee DTIB/ISB is omgeven alleen maar doet toenemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 16  
Deelt u de mening dat organisaties waar zoveel verschillende ministeries en &amp;#40;oud&amp;#41; bewindspersonen bij betrokken zijn, notulen dienen op te stellen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 en 16  
&amp;nbsp;    
De DTIB en ISB-NL zijn adviesorganen die geen beleid maken. Dat publieke en private organisaties overleggen over de effectiviteit van beleid en nadenken over verbetering van beleid acht ik van groot belang voor de totstandkoming van effectief overheidsbeleid.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De actieverslagen van de DTIB zijn openbaar via de website www.internationaalondernemen.nl. De DTIB heeft 14 jaar bestaan in vele samenstellingen en met verschillende werkgroepen per periode. Het verstrekken van een overzicht van alle personen die zitting hebben genomen in de DTIB en haar werkgroepen met hun functies en rol acht ik niet opportuun. De samenstelling van de DTIB in juli 2017 was als volgt:  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Dhr. J.M. van Keulen &amp;#40;VNG Internationaal&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op dit moment wordt de ISB-NL samengesteld op initiatief van de minister van Economische Zaken en Klimaat en mij. De leden, agenda’s en actieverslagen van de ISB-NL zullen openbaar worden gemaakt. Daarbij zal wel rekening gehouden moeten worden met bedrijfsgevoelige informatie en moet worden gewaarborgd dat gesprekken binnen de ISB-NL zo open mogelijk gevoerd kunnen worden. In de handelsbrief die na de zomer aan de Tweede Kamer wordt voorgelegd zal ik verder ingaan op de doelstellingen, samenstelling en werkwijze van de ISB-NL.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 13  
Vindt u het gewenst dat DTIB/ISB gebruik maakt van vergaderzalen van ministeries? Kunt u uw antwoord toelichten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 13  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gezien de samenstelling en doelstelling van DTIB en ISB-NL acht ik het niet onwenselijk dat gebruik wordt gemaakt van vergaderzalen van ministeries.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 17  
Welke kosten zijn, direct en indirect, gemoeid met het bestaan en het onderhouden van DTIB/ISB?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 17  
&amp;nbsp;    
De kosten voor de DTIB bedroegen de afgelopen twee jaar de catering van vergaderingen en drukkosten voor het Team Nederland rapport en zijn derhalve beperkt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 18  
Worden reacties op WOB-verzoeken altijd op de website van het betreffende ministerie geplaatst? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, waarom is dat bij dit WOB-verzoek niet gebeurd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 19  
Welke andere reacties op WOB-verzoeken zijn ook niet online geplaatst? Waarom zijn deze niet geplaatst?    
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 20  
Bent u bereid te bewerkstelligen dat de Kamer, via de verschillende departementen, periodiek op de hoogte wordt gesteld van alle gedane WOB-verzoeken en de reacties daarop? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 18, 19 en 20  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ingewilligde Wob-verzoeken over documenten van de kerndepartementen worden op de website www.rijksoverheid.nl geplaatst. Het Wob-besluit inzake de DTIB is, nadat het naar de verzoekers is gestuurd, abusievelijk niet gepubliceerd. Dit is inmiddels alsnog gedaan. Er is geen overzicht van Wob-besluiten die niet zijn gepubliceerd. In de Kamerbrief van 5 april 2016 &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 28 362, 8&amp;#41; is uiteengezet dat er in individuele gevallen aanleiding kan zijn de Kamer te informeren over de openbaarmaking van documenten als ook waarom het informeren van de Kamer over alle Wob-verzoeken niet praktisch is.)

8sswwv,3,2018-06-21,How to keep from checking their social media?,Stopdrinking111,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/8sswwv/how_to_keep_from_checking_their_social_media/,"Hi all,

I have a dilemma. I’m now 1 week no contact and my ex has already rebounded with some guy who looks exactly like me (hence the no contact). 

I removed her on all social media and blocked her. However I still find myself checking her twitter likes about once / day. 

When we went on a NC break like two years ago, we would “sub-like” content on Twitter that we both knew we would see. It was sort of fun and not as serious as this no-contact. 

Flash forward to now: I’m still finding myself opening Safari, going to Twitter, and checking her likes even though she’s blocked. 

Just yesterday, she liked a tweet saying, “Bestfriend, if you’re reading this right now, I miss you, you bitch” which really threw me for a loop. My mind immediately jumped to “OMG that’s me she’s talking about” but then realized she could be talking about her other friend who just left for an internship. 

I spent ALL DAY breaking down who it could be in my head. 

How can I stop myself from finding loopholes to check up on her? "
8st39q,4,2018-06-21,"You know, ""My Journey"" kinda bugs me.",GreekDudeYiannis,Scrubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/8st39q/you_know_my_journey_kinda_bugs_me/,"I absolutely love the series, and I'm currently on my 10th or 11th time rewatching the whole thing, though this time with my girlfriend, and I gotta say, I think this is an episode I'll skip in future runs alongside ""My Musical"" (though this is because I'm not a terribly huge fan of musicals and dislike it when actors who can't sing well try to sing, I just find it so cringey). There's a couple of things that are sorta weird with this episode as a whole, and if you're down to read why, I'll explain it to ya.


But first, here's the synopsis, copied straight from the wiki:


""J.D. is jealous that Sean Kelly is back in Elliot's life, and also worried that his relationship with Turk will change now that he and Carla have set a date for their wedding. He can't understand why Turk is so reluctant to acknowledge how close their bond as best friends is, and in particular to go out and celebrate their friendship. A patient of Turk's makes the reason clear: He is gay, and the resemblance of him and his life partner to J.D. and Turk is uncanny.


Meanwhile, Carla discovers an unmarked urine specimen, but no one else seems to care about identifying it, and so it becomes her obsession. At last the Janitor, who is frightened of Carla, finds the label identifying it.


Although Elliot is happy to be with Sean again, he doesn't want to be a couple, because he was devastated the last time she dumped him. Elliot assures him that she won't put her job ahead of him now that she's not an intern anymore, but she is forced to cancel their first date and realizes that the hospital always has to come first. She admits this to Sean, but promises that she will give as much of herself to the relationship as she can if he is willing to give her a chance; he accepts this promise.


After Turk discusses his problem with J.D. with his gay patient, who makes him feel better, Turk and J.D. do go out for a celebration, and their friendship is restored.""


I find it to be an odd episode but lemme give it some credit. The B-stories are solid. Carla trying to figure out who the pee belongs to is great, and I like how Elliot learns a lesson about how to manage her priorities in the workplace and in her personal life. Those and the little side gags are solid, just like any other episode. Even the parallel with Turk and J.D. and the patient and his husband is funny. However, there's a couple of points about the main story that really bug me.


1) It hasn't aged well. First off, I understand that sitcoms in the 90s and early 2000s didn't really know how to tackle the topic of homosexuality, and this wasn't a necessarily bad way to do it. However the ""That's gay"" jokes sorta feel weird in our world nowadays. I'm not a totally PC guy, but as I've gotten older, I feel kinda weird hearing, ""That's gay"" when referring to something that isn't traditionally masculine/something that's traditionally feminine. It's just kinda odd, and the jokes don't really land as well in today's current social context. 


2) The conflict feels manufactured. Turk and J.D. are best friends, and have been shown to have been friends since their freshman year in college. So they've been friends for roughly 8 years until this point. It doesn't really make sense for Turk to be uncomfortable spilling his feelings with J.D., especially when he's done it several times before in the show. Hell, even going back to the very first episode, he tells J.D. that he loves him in a genuine way. It doesn't make sense that he'd suddenly be all weirded out about just hanging with J.D. and getting deep. I mean, he's talked to J.D. about falling in love with Carla, getting ready to marry her, feeling rejected by her when she wouldn't say yes, and giving J.D. his opinion on his feelings towards Elliot, and NOW he decides he's feeling awkward about sharing how he feels about stuff? It's just inconsistent and it doesn't mesh well with what we know about Turk so far. 


3) Turk isn't shown to be all that homophobic before this episode, and even since then he isn't weirded out by the concept. Like I said, he's obviously not afraid to tell another man that isn't his family that he loves him. In the season 2 premier, they slept in the same bed when Carla kicked him out, and Turk keeps cracks jokes about them being in bed together, yet it's J.D. that's uncomfortable by the concept of being in bed with a guy. I forget which episode this next bit comes from, but once in season 1 I believe, J.D. mentions Turk felt up a transgendered person, and his response was, ""Baby, he/she had a body that was rockin'."". He doesn't back away from his potentially having done it, if anything, he doubles down, something a homophobe probably wouldn't do. He's obviously comfortable enough in his sexuality to say out loud that he Loves J.D., to share a bed with another man, and to admit he felt up someone who might've had the same downstairs parts he does. So why does the man on man action make him uncomfortable? Like I said in the previous bit, it just feels manufactured for the episode and inconsistent with the character we've known up until this point.


4) While I'm knockin' down the episode, I looked at the wiki and found out there were a few inconsistencies. Copied from the wiki: ""In the scene with Sean at SeaWorld, Elliot is already wet before the dolphin actually flips water on her."". ""When Turk and J.D. are talking to Will Quinn for the first time, approximately five minutes into the episode, Turk says that they did not have a car in med school. However, it was revealed in ""My New Old Friend"" that J.D. has had Malik since he was 17."". ""When J.D. throws the chart out of the window, there are two errors: Turk's stance changes from standing upright to leaning on the bed and Turk is holding a patient's chart at the end of the scene, despite not holding a chart throughout the scene."". Might as well mention it if I'm throwin' fuel on the fire.


5) Super nitpicky, but the whole Journey thing feels almost unearned and the ending sequence is too damn cheesy for my taste. I mean damn. I'm all for my silly stuff, but why is Elliot on a train if we know she has a car (which we even saw earlier in the episode)? We don't even get that many references to Journey throughout the episode to really justify calling it, ""My Journey"". J.D.'s love for the band gets mentioned once at the beginning, and that's it. It doesn't even feel like much of a journey has taken place in this episode, so why name it after the band or have their song play at the end? It feels like someone just wanted to make that ending sequence and did whatever they could to justify making it.


Overall, the B-stories and gags in this episode are just as good as all the other episodes, but the main story is just really off. It kinda dates the series when you see it, the conflict between J.D. and Turk feels forced, and Turk suddenly is homophobic when we've seen before that he isn't. The episode doesn't strengthen their relationship or give it some new context to deepen it. If anything, it feels like they were 2 steps back when it began and then got on track to how they always were. It's just really odd. Like I said, in the future, I'm probably gonna skip this one. 


What do you guys think?"
8st4j1,4,2018-06-21,I messed up by lending my cousin money,filthyuglyweeaboo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8st4j1/i_messed_up_by_lending_my_cousin_money/,"Late last  year I was living overseas for an internship. My cousin drove me to and  from the office each day and I was grateful for that. This will factor  in later.

A few months ago when I got  back, I lent my cousin close to $300 (thereabouts considering the  exchange rate). He said it was to help him get started on his business  venture. I had a good experience with him paying me back when he  borrowed smaller amounts ($20-$50) and I felt guilty if I rebuffed him  considering how he helped me out. So with these factors, I thought why  not, he needs a helping hand and he's family. He promised me to pay it  back within a month.

When it came to the  month I sent him a message asking how its going. I don't get a response  for a couple of days. Initially I think its just he's a bit busy. But  then I remember how quickly he responded when we were organising how we  were going to transfer the money. I resort to contacting his wife to ask  him to respond to me. A day or so after that, he responds saying his  venture is going well and that he could pay it the week after.

A  week after that and nothing. I ask the wife again and still nothing. I don't  know if I should keep chasing it up but I feel like I've given him  enough chances without being too overbearing. It's not so much the  amount itself (though it is a factor) but that he promised to pay it  back that has started to sour my opinion of him. Also the fact that he  hasn't responded much less given any explanation as to why he hasn't  come up with it. If he had given an explanation like the venture failed  and he needs more time or something like that I would be more ok with  it. I don't know if I can trust him in the way I did before. At this  point I'm considering the money a write off.

I  was stupid. I shouldn't be lending money to anyone regardless of the  situation. Unless I am giving it away without expecting it back. Lesson learned.

**tl;dr :** I lent money to my cousin and now he won't respond to my messages. My mistake for lending it in the first place."

So, i've been called for an interview (In July) as a Business Intelligence Internship. The company is a Multinational consulting IT company, and i'm kinda freaking out about the interview.

I have a master degree in Computer Science, and my general skills for this job are:

BI theory knowledge;

SSMS - Relational DB, Snowflake and Star Schema Architectures, Querys;

SSIS - Integrating information to/from multiple sources ;

SSAS - Deploying a cube (Dimensions, Facts, Measures, Hierarchy, etc);

SSRS - Haven't learnt it on College; Learnt alone the basics of it;

My question is: What should i focus to prepare myself for this interview? As i said, my knowledge is pretty much what i've learnt from College ( I've actually pointed that in the CV ).

All the help is highly apreciated."
8stdpi,7,2018-06-21,Transitioning into Dev/Engineering from Consulting,2jz_powa,cerner,https://www.reddit.com/r/cerner/comments/8stdpi/transitioning_into_devengineering_from_consulting/,"What's up Cerner peeps!  For the last few years, I've been working as a Solution Architect for Revenue Cycle, and have been a Revenue Cycle analyst FTE for other hospital sites directly previous to my position here with Cerner.  I'm currently going to school to become an SE simply because coding, dev, and app design really interest me.  I've used C, C++, Javascript and SQL for personal projects here and there, so working with code would not be something completely new to me (not to mention, CCL :P)  I can definitely foresee myself working with a dev team in optimization for patient accounting tools/Revenue Cycle, if the opportunity were to present itself.

Has anyone themselves transitioned to, or have personally seen people transition from consulting to engineering/dev @ Cerner?  I'm only asking because I notice that a lot of SEs start either as interns, or are hired as FTE SEs from the get-go.

I really see a ton of opportunity for optimization and improvement with patient accounting applications, especially after utilizing a lot of these tools and tables for the last few years, and I think that's why dev really interests me!  Any input or advice is greatly appreciated here."
8stfpo,151,2018-06-21,[SocJus] Feminist Activism Masquerading as Education,ScatterYouMonsters,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/8stfpo/socjus_feminist_activism_masquerading_as_education/,"Thought some might find it an interesting read. The article obviously goes into more detail than I will. It's nothing that hasn't already been obvious - that women's studies serve to create activists in part, and as it says in the ""National Women’s Studies Association’s Constitution,"" the underlying goal of women's studies departments is “transform[ing] the world” to one “free of oppression.”

The author of the article goes into some examples where the politicized agenda ""reveals"" itself, such as in ""experiential learning"" programs run by campus Women's Centers which she notes are usually affiliated with Women's Studies departments. ""Not only do women’s centers approach issues in terms of a specific ideology, they also mobilize students to put that ideology into practice,"" she claims.

She brings up University of Nort Carolina at Charlotte as an example, and a program titled ""Gen-X: Where Academics Meets Activism.""

&gt; Students admitted to the program function as a “community” where they usually live in the same housing and attend the same classes. Gen-X students focus on “social justice and activism work” and are required to take a class on “Gender, Activism, and Leadership.” According to the course description: ""This course will take students beyond the books and the classroom—into the real life experience of activists, leaders and agents of positive social change. Making the personal political, students enrolled in this course will select and complete a community activism project focusing on a gender issue.""

And what do they do? Well... as she notes, while the program's website doesn't state what kind of ""real life"" experiences such students participate in, in its promo video:

&gt; Gen-X students are seen holding “vote now” signs and wearing Planned Parenthood stickers. Gen-X’s director, Jennifer Byrd, told her students in a class discussion “don’t tell me there isn’t a need for activism…thank you radical feminism! Right?”

&gt; Additionally, according to this Feminist Majority blog post, Byrd participated in a 2014 voting campaign on campus where UNC-Charlotte students wrote about why they were voting for then-Democratic candidate for Senate, Kay Hagan. Byrd posted pictures of students with signs that read: “I’m voting Kay Hagan for U.S. Senate because… I support feminist ideas” or “I support safe abortions.”

She also brings up a prograrm at UNC-Chapel Hill, called ""Moxie Project,"" a collaboration between the Carolina Women’s Center, the Southern Oral History Project, and the Department of Women’s and Gender Studies:

&gt; The aim of the program is to train students through coursework and internship experience to be feminist activists in their local communities. One former Moxie Scholar said: “Without this internship I don’t think I would have ever reached this point of urgency in my activism.” That activism, however, often appears to be specifically activism for left-wing policies. As Carol Teal, a former partner with the Moxie Project, said, ""It is absolutely imperative that we inspire young women leaders…The future really dependents on attracting progressive young women…so it is absolutely essential that we build a pipeline with young women who care about participating in their democracy.""

She notes that activities and content that's promoted in the Moxie Project align with ""progressive"" political agenda.

&gt; For the first few years of the Moxie Project, students participated in paid internships at Lillian’s List, an organization that “recruits, trains and supports progressive women, who are champions of reproductive freedom and equity for women, to run for public office in North Carolina.” As a program requirement, Moxie Scholars are required to create a final project to present to the supervising staff and faculty. In the 2013 group presentation, the students held signs with defamatory language about the Republican Party and the North Carolina General Assembly.

&gt; In the group presentation, one Moxie Scholar who interned with Lillian’s List said: I went with other individuals from Lillian’s List to listen to the senate “debate” the bill. The NC Legislature seems to be perfecting the art of the low blow; targeting so many groups that the only individuals left unscathed are the minute portion of the population… I left the General Assembly that day in tears. I’ve been crying for the women of NC every day since.

While another student claimed that:

&gt; All education, whether in the field of English, Biology, or History, is inherently political—especially in a public university system, threatened with the closure of entire campuses… and budget cuts.

She also lists some other organizations that Moxie Scholars have worked with, such as:

&gt; The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL Pro-Choice), the NC Justice Center, and Women AdvaNCe (a progressive-leaning, pro-choice non-profit).

While this year, the Moxie Scholars will take a course called “Women and Politics” which has the following course description:

&gt; A comparison of men and women as political actors at the mass and elite level in America. Topics considered include the “gender gap,” the women’s movement, abortion, and the Equal Rights Amendment.

&gt; Students will then put what they learned into practice in their internships with the heavily Democratic Town of Carrboro, Women AdvaNCe, the North Carolina Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and the Pauli Murray Project (a social justice project inspired by the life of “activist, scholar, feminist, poet, and [female] priest Pauli Murray”).

The article also notes that despite its partisan leanging, the Women's Center has received generous support from the state:

&gt; According to data from the North Carolina General Assembly, in the 2013-2014 academic year, the Carolina Women’s Center received $126,902 in funding from the state. That year, the Moxie Project was completely funded by the university’s provost office. However, according to a 2017 newsletter, the Moxie Project is now fully funded by private donors. Nevertheless, the Carolina Women’s Center’s staff still dedicate 100 hours per fiscal year to the project, which is still paid for by the university.

&gt; A quick look around North Carolina reveals other examples of similar politicization. UNC-Wilmington’s Women’s Studies and Resources Center is also steeped in radical feminist values. For one, in collaboration with NARAL Pro-Choice, the center sponsors an “Activist in Residence Series.” In the 2014-2015 academic year, the center invited Emily Letts—known for filming her own abortion—to speak to students. Letts, with the help of NARAL Pro-Choice, filmed and collected the stories of students’ own abortion experiences. (In fact, UNCW, along with UNC-Chapel Hill and UNC-Greensboro, grant students course credit for interning with abortion provider Planned Parenthood).

8stmu7,48,2018-06-21,[First Impressions] Carlos Santos for Skoatiebolaget Oak Balmoral and Astorflex Greenflex Dark Khaki,minhu,goodyearwelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/8stmu7/first_impressions_carlos_santos_for/,"(First post ever, long time lurker, constructive criticism is appreciated)

[CS Album](https://imgur.com/a/oYYQDn2)

[Greenflex Album](https://imgur.com/a/qHvzXWR)

**Background:**

Due to the recent sales run by a couple companies that sold shoes I was interested in, I decided it was time to finally fill in my basic needs for formal and casual wear as a college student. I had my eyes on the Carlos Santos Oak Balmorals for a while now, and when I saw that they were on sale for $210, I couldn't help but pull the trigger on them. Even though further markdowns later dropped them down to $180, Patrik at Skoak was willing to refund me the difference in store credit. I will probably be using that to purchase a pair of black oxfords to round out my internship needs for July-Dec (Business Formal 4/5 days).  I was also looking to find a pair of suede crepe soled derbies or chukkas for my casual rotation. Initially, I purchased the Grenson Oscars from the Mr. Porter sale, only to sadly find out that they JUST sold out their last pair in my size as the order processed. I finally settled with the Astorflexes on the END. sale, thinking that at $90 with shipping, they'd be of good value.


**CS Impressions:**

With the 388 last, I was pretty much in the dark as to how it fits. I emailed the sales team at Skoak, and they highlighted that it was a roomy last across the board and that I might need to size down to an 8UK for a snug fit from my 9.5D, but that an 8.5UK should work. My naivety led me to order the 8.5UK pair, only to find that I could easily fit a finger behind my heel and that my toes were swimming in space. The return process was straightforward and I received the 8UK pair a week after, with the fit being near perfect.

*(warning: crappy Samsung Edge 7 Pics)*

At first, I was worried that the abnormal broguing pattern might look a bit weird on my feet. However, they look subtle yet unique enough to add a bit of flair to my outfit. [On Feet Pic](https://i.imgur.com/oG859Vy.jpg)

So far, they have shown tight [creasing](https://i.imgur.com/SSrFfrv.jpg), and a [well-constructed sole](https://i.imgur.com/LpC6gNv.jpg). The chiseled toes also really compliment my other pair of [oxblood/brown(depending on lighting) Crockett and Jones for Barneys](https://i.imgur.com/C11X02T.jpg), an eBay steal, which are more almond shaped. In addition, the CS's also surprisingly have good arch support that keeps my feet snug and comfortable. One slightly noticeable flaw in the shoes is that the [soles' side sanding](https://i.imgur.com/B5LE9Si.jpg) doesn't appear to be uniform, and [the sole's don't match up exactly](https://i.imgur.com/LKxSlVH.jpg). However, for this price, this is a minor flaw that will go away with wear and won't bother me visually when I'm wearing them. Overall, for the price, I am extremely satisfied with Skoak's customer service and product offerings, and I now really understand how Carlos Santos blows Meermin and Allen Edmonds out of the water.

**Astorflex Greenflex Impressions:**

Out of the box, the color was a [lot more neutral](https://i.imgur.com/cLUVSZa.jpg) than I thought it was going to be, which gave me a sigh of relief. I'm personally just not a fan of deep mocha browns. The shape of the shoe compares with the Carlos Santos was a lot more bulbous and shapeless, for the lack of a better word. While I do understand that this is how more casual shoes normally look, I would have liked some more curves and shaping. There also is a [stitching flaw](https://i.imgur.com/CzRk7N7.jpg) on one shoe that isn't on the other

Another criticism I would add is that the shoe is 2 eyelets instead of 3. I purchased an 8UK, following the advice to round down to your nearest whole size. However, even after that, the shoes were a bit loose, so I inserted some [thin deodorizing charcoal+leather inserts](https://i.imgur.com/5ZLUBPf.jpg) from my sneakers. They fit a lot better afterward, but they could still be a bit tighter around the ankles. 

Criticism aside, I really appreciate how the crepe came darker, so that dirt and grime won't change the color of the soles as drastically. Furthermore, they came with a pair of sleeker waxed flat laces, which I appreciated. Having owned Bushacre 2s, which I threw out because the sole was super uncomfortable, and seeing my friend's CDBs, I would say that at this price, Astorflex is of more value. The leather lining felt a lot more substantial, and the shoes didn't cave in as easily.

8surn1,516,2018-06-21,[Residency] Why you should do General Surgery - Attending's perspective,Nysoz,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8surn1/residency_why_you_should_do_general_surgery/,"Credit to  /u/babblingdairy for the template and starting this.

Background: I'm a relatively new board certified General Surgery attending at a rural hospital with \~70 beds. Going into medical school I always wanted to do Family Medicine so I never really studied and was near the bottom of my class first 2 years. Starting clinical rotations, figured out that I didn't like FM as much as I thought I would and figured out how awesome surgery was. I then really focused on becoming the best candidate possible. Went to a DO General Surgery program that was a level II trauma hospital with rotations at the sister level I trauma hospital. Ended up usually scoring +75th percentile on the absite and inservice exams every year.

**General Surgery years:**

* PGY-1: Intern year - Usually mixed with IM, ED, MICU, SICU, trauma rotations. The few surgery rotations that you get you're mainly focused on floor work and bedside procedures (central lines, arterial lines, chest tubes). Depends on how efficient you are at the floor work and sometimes can scrub in minor/major cases and suture skin or start learning the basics of the procedures.
* PGY-2/3: Junior resident - You're becoming more efficient with floor work and getting a basis of knowledge. Less fluff, more general and sub specialty surgery months. Rotate through Vascular, Thoracic, Trauma, SICU, Transplant, Pediatric, Colorectal surgery months. Start to be able to good at workup and differentials and starting plans and comfortable taking care of any surgery patient and bedside procedures. In cases, you're doing the more bread and butter cases with graduated responsibility.
* PGY-4/5: Senior/Chief resident - You're becoming more comfortable doing big cases and now walking junior residents through minor/straight forward cases. You'll get a few electives to see if you want to pursue a sub specialty, but mainly general surgery months where you're the chief of the service and run everything. The attending still has the final say, but you're mainly it.

**Typical day:**

An example of a typical day of a resident on General Surgery where I was at.

5:30-6:00 AM - Arrive and get sign out from the night team. The medical students showed up at 5:00-5:30 to help get the list ready, but with EMRs now they didn't have to show up so early anymore. Look up the patients on your rounding list vitals, labs, radiology, I&amp;Os, nursing notes and such. Once you get your info you start team rounds.

7:00 AM - Meet up for breakfast and run the list. Go over plans for everyone, what should be written in notes, orders to be put in.

7:30 AM and on - Morning cases start. Those that are assigned cases will go and do cases through the day. Interns and students will complete floor work, notes, orders. Once done they'll join in the OR when possible. Seniors and chiefs will be updated throughout the day during cases as needed. Between cases, the chief of the service will round with different attendings by themselves or as a large group depending on who's around. Once done with cases for the day, afternoon rounds and clean up any other pending issues. Down time is reading/teaching students.

Consults through the day will be seen by interns/students, then reported to the upper level resident, then seen with attendings through the day.

530-600 PM - Night team arrives and gets sign out for any changes and new patients.

**Night float:** Our program had a night float month where we had a junior and a senior resident on 5 nights a week. They took care of trauma codes, SICU patients, night consults, overnight cases with the on call attending. We found this to be much better than taking traditional q3-q4 nightly call. Nights were variable from watching netflix all night to 12 consults and cases/traumas all night.

**Call:** Usually had to cover a weekend or 2 a month depending on the number of in house residents. Chiefs had slightly less call but still did in house call. 

Reasons to do General Surgery:

**You get to do surgery.** It's no real surprise and it'll be figured out quickly if you're the type of person that likes procedures or not. As a General Surgeon, you get the training and knowledge to deal with just about anything. This is especially true the more rural you get if you choose. At my hospital, I can do anything in the abdomen I feel comfortable doing. If I want to do some select Thoracic, Vascular, or Gyn cases I can as well. I typically manage bread and butter general surgery procedures with upper and lower endoscopy.

**You get to save lives.** This may be a bold statement, but it's true in some circumstances. Perforated viscous, massive bleeding not amendable to other interventions, necrotizing infections, ischemic bowel? Only surgery will save the patient's life, nothing else will. 

**You can cure cancer.** With a lot of early stage cancers, surgery will often be the only intervention a patient will need. Some may need additional chemo or radiation, but surgery in the mainstay treatment.

**You can improve the quality of life of patients.** Symptomatic gallstones, hernias, and any other number of chronic issues that effect their day to day life. A lot of them are miserable from pain or nausea that won't get better otherwise. Patients are miserable, but after healing from your intervention are a whole new person. They can now live their life without misery. It's an immediate gratification not seen in a lot of medical management.

So how do you know if General Surgery is right for you? Here a some characteristics I think that may be a sign that it’s for you.

**You like anatomy and physiology while working with your hands.** You appreciate anatomy and physiology as the basis of the body. You enjoyed anatomy lab and cadaver dissections in the didactic years.

**You enjoy taking care of patients and making a difference in people's lives.** You like talking to people and figuring out what's wrong with them. Often times you'll be able to figure out if you can help them or not. If you can intervene, you have the opportunity to help them in ways no one else can.

**You dislike rounding for hours and clinic.** Yes you'll need to do both in General Surgery, but it's generally abbreviated and focused on what you can help out with or not.

**You don't mind hard work and long hours if it means taking care of patients.** General Surgery hours can be rough and the long, but at then end of the day it's about truly making a different in people's lives.

**You love the OR and doing surgery.** This is one of the most common phrases you'll hear. You have to love being the OR and don't want to be anywhere else in the hospital or clinic. A chance to cut is a chance to cure. The ability to heal with the feel of cold hard steel.

Dismissing some misconceptions about General Surgery:

**General Surgeons are assholes -** It's true that some surgeons are assholes and yell and treat people poorly. That doesn't mean you have to be. You can be happy and enjoy life as a General Surgeon. You can treat everyone with respect and be a pleasure to be around. The nature/stress and hours of the work can make it difficult, but not impossible. Everyone I interact with says it's a pleasure to work with me. I never yell or throw things. I never lose my temper and I'm always willing to explain things to anyone. I also usually play 80s music in the OR so people like that too.

**You can't have a good work life balance -** Residency is tough for everyone. Even more so for surgical specialties. As an attending sometimes it gets worse, but it also can get better. Your job can be whatever you want it to be. I might be difficult to have it at first or not located where you want to be, but if you only want to work 40 hours a week, you can. Keep in mind the more you work the more money you make. The less you work the less you make. The majority of your compensation revolves around procedures.

You can have kids and a family. You can have your hobbies. Realize that you will probably have call responsibilities and your life will have to accommodate that. With good partners, you can schedule call around your family and other things you want to do, but probably not all of them.

I personally have around 30 hours a week of scheduled work between office, hospital rounds, and scheduled cases. On top of that is 10 days a month of ER call from home which can vary between no calls or consults to working all night. Being in a rural area, I have to go back in to operate maybe 5-10 times a year.

Some real downsides to the field:

**You will work hard.** Residency will be one of the more tough parts of your life. Working lots of hours and it's stressful. As a resident you're regulated to an 80 hour work week but sometimes pushed past that as well. As an attending, sometimes it's worse. There's no such thing as work hour restrictions for attendings. My old attendings taking trauma call were in house for 72 hours straight for their weekends on call. Once again your practice is something that you can try to find a good fit for whatever you want out of life. Most people will work 3-4 jobs before settling down in their final location/practice.

**You always have to be “on”.** Every case is different and nothing is easy or straight forward. The moment you think something is straight forward you'll find yourself in trouble. Even a simple case can take a wrong turn and kill a patient in any number of ways. 

**Attending life can be worse than residency.** As above, attending life can be worse in many ways than residency. The operating room is a very lonely place at 2 AM. A lot of times it's up to you to save that person's life and there's no one else that can. 

I hope that helps but that's all I can think of for now. General Surgery can be intimidating and stressful but only if you let it be. It can also be fun and rewarding.

My laptop is about to die but I'll answer anything else I can! I was going to write this up tomorrow, but I had 3 cases for the morning and 1 cancelled so I was at work from 7 AM to 10:30 AM. I've spent the rest of my morning watching Marvel movies while typing this up."

Our wedding is in August. As it sits, many of our vendors have already included the ""tip"" in the packages ( I do NOT agree with the mandatory tip percentage... this ruins the ability to judge if the service is indeed good and deserving...what if the food was bad? Too bad, I HAD to pay 25% tip regardless. )
The people who already had the tip figured into the price are: Officiant, Venue ( food and drink ), and stylist for hair/makeup.

Ones that are left which I am not sure if and when they get tipped are, the event coordinator at venue, planner, DJ, and photographer. We will be having 2 photographers and our planner she will have an intern with her so I am not 100% sure if that person gets tipped.  Our planner also contracted out the set up crew to set up for us, we had nothing to do with it except come up with the money to pay for it ( we dont want to deal with set up because we will have more than plenty of things to do before hand ). The crew will NOT be tearing down.

Now, as for the thank you cards, do we include these with the tips for those that get tips, or do we wait until after?

Where do I start?,Lauren86_1,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8svsdx/stuck_with_a_horrendous_undergrad_record_that_had/,"Just a personal story here and also seeking serious, constructive advice. Please keep in mind I don't know much about pre-med activities and abbreviations. 

I always wanted to do medicine since I was a kid. I did really well basically until I graduated high school. I had teachers and faculty at my school agreeing medicine was an great option for me. I got into a pretty good in-state university. But my college experience has been atrocious because of personal problems. 

I was on academic probation twice, and was almost kicked out for a year. I hit the maximum number of credits I’m allowed to repeat (although I was clueless and retook courses I didn’t even need to). My general science courses were basically a few B’s and mostly C’s. My lower-level major courses were C's and D's. No, I’m not lazy, and never was. I’ve always enjoyed working and learning, and I get bored easily when I’m not. But I had a plethora of problems that drained me (seizure issues, diagnosed chronic insomnia and depression, PCOS, a nasty relationship). Basically every semester/year consisted of a huge problem that took over everything. At the end of that fourth year, I realized I had no future and decided I needed some time off to address my health and get it together. So I took a year off and worked with my doctors (neurologist, psychiatrist, speech therapy, a plethora of things) to finally get everything resolved (yes, everything!). When I returned for my 5th (and final) year, I got an A in every single course, a total of 39 credits during that time (and these included biochemistry, physiology, orgo 2, and my upper-level major courses). I graduated from my diagnostic molecular science program.

Still, this was only enough to get my final GPA to a 2.8, and my major GPA a 3.2. I’m in the process of getting an internship in this program, and after 6 months I take the certification exam through the NAACLS. After that I basically don’t know where to go. I don’t like this program, I swapped to it my sophomore year when I realized I wouldn’t get into med school. I definitely don’t want to do this forever. Ever since feeling so much better and doing this well, I’ve wanted to dig my med school dream out of the grave. But I want to know if I’m being realistic here. I have 4 years of awful grades stuck to me. I have no experience doing anything special. I volunteered in a hospital for a hot second but that's it. No affiliations with anybody, nobody would could recommended me or help me.

Where could I start after this certification? I was thinking working in this area for a bit to gain some experience (and money), and do whatever it takes to find an SMP? But how could I even get into one with this GPA? What about the couple of pre-med perquisites that I’m missing? What things should I participate in during this working period to help me get a SMP? Or should I just take the prereqs, work for a bit, and shoot straight for med school? I’m 24 now, I wouldn’t be able to start until I’m, what, like 30? Any advice would be appreciated. I’m all over the place because I haven’t been doing anything pre-med related all these years since I assumed it was out of the question. I know (and have proved) I have the potential to do well, but my awful past is stuck with me wherever I go. It’s already going to be hard for me to get this internship because most require a 3.0. Any advice/experience would really help. I really don’t want to do this job forever, I want go shoot for the dream I had as a kid. "

I've tried to select these schools based on the following criteria: IS schools, OOS friendly, within my numbers, AND based on regional density. Long time partner of mine is also applying and I'd LOVE to be at or close to the same school! Having nearby support systems is important to me. Shoutout to the other reddit post that inspired me to do this whole regional thing. I've also tried to get a good balance of reach/target/undershoot schools based on ProspectiveDoctor's tool and my WARS score (76). Hope to stay in CA, but know that's a crapshoot, regardless of my IS status. Any helpful feedback is appreciated!!

I'm a college graduate from the US who will be attending grad school for Technical Direction starting in August. I have always wanted to travel abroad (mostly Europe or Australia) and would love to get started on researching summer internships for next summer. Im a carpenter/ welder/ rigger/ drafter/ TD. 

So I have a few questions for the people here: 

* Does anyone have any suggestions for specific places they know have internships, or good resources for finding them? I'm hoping for this to be financially viable by itself (stipend and housing, or stipend big enough to cover cost of living)

* What differences are there in USA technical theatre and Europe? What should I learn/ research to prepare for my trip?

* When should I aim to apply for these summer internships? I assume as soon as they are posted, so around December if it's the same as the US. 

Thank you for any help you can give!"

I was just wondering if anyone with a background in traffic engineering knows an equation or a starting point for finding this if I only have traffic counts? I received some help from others and have gotten some work done, but figured it’d be good to get other opinions. "
8sw9gt,534,2018-06-21,[residency]Why you should do Family Medicine - a Resident's Perspective,lwronhubbard,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sw9gt/residencywhy_you_should_do_family_medicine_a/,"Hey everyone!  I'm a PGY-3 graduating in two days.  I go to an academic tertiary care center and graduated from a top public Midwest medical school and couples matched with my wife who does internal med.  For the right person, family medicine can be an amazing opportunity with plenty of impact in your patient's life and also a great lifestyle as well.  Onto the good stuff.

**The Years**

* PGY-1: This is the hardest year of residency from an hours standpoint as you do the most inpatient intern year.  It ranges from the ob floor, general medicine floor, and ICU.  Throughout this year you'll also have clinic either within the rotation itself or in blocks.  Be prepared for a whirlwind experience and you'll likely average close to 60 hours a week.

* PGY-2: Easier hours wise, but still can be daunting.  You're now considered a ""senior"" so you'll be taking charge on the inpatient service, and expected to see a higher number of patient's during your clinic blocks.  However, this year is more outpatient heavy, so expect more office type hours.  You also get to do more off service rotations.  

* PGY-3: Senior on campus.  Should be the easiest year of your residency.  Again, you'll be leading inpatient teams and be the most senior resident on-call, but hopefully you've gained enough experience your second year that you feel more than able third year.  I really enjoyed this year and spent more time on teaching, efficiency and research.  Your outpatient clinic also ramps up and I saw up to 10 in a half day.  Also, this is the most outpatient of all the years plus elective time so hours are much better.  You'll also be rotating in a lot of different departments so while it may feel like 3rd year of medical school, you can go to each specialty you visit with very specific questions.  I also found that specialties were very appreciative of the work we did and very open to teaching and helping figure out if that was something we could manage ourselves or refer.  Third year is also when you find a job which is incredibly easy.  My wife matched for fellowship and I had vacation in 4 weeks.  I started applying to her city and had 6 different interviews lined up for that one week of vacation in a New England city.  I'd say I average 50 hours or less third year.

**Typical inpatient day:**


* 6:45-receive sign out from overnight team

* 7:00-8:30 - preround

* 8:30-11:00 - round

* 11:00-12:00 - call consultants, notes, orders

* 12:00-1:00 - noon conference/lunch

* 1:00-6:00 - admissions, follow up on patients, learning, etc. then sign out

**Outpatient day:**

* 8-12 - see patients

* 12-1 - conference

* 1-5 - see patients

To talk more about the outpatient world you'll end up in a variety of clinics.  My primary two clinics were the acute care clinic (cellulitis, asthma exacerbation, URI's, sore throats, etc.), continuity of care clinic (diabetes, HTN, annual physical exams).  We also rotated through other clinics including procedure clinic (IUD's, Nexplanons, shave, excision, and punch biopsies, treadmill stress test, colposcopies) our MSK/sports medicine clinic (injections, ultrasound, MSK issues) and also nursing home rounds (travel to the nursing home and round on patients) and also free medical clinic work.  Of course when you rotate on a different specialty you'll experience their flavor of medicine.  Also procedures were not limited to the procedure clinic.  Simple procedures like cryo, Nexplanon, punch biopsies and joint injections I did during all clinics.  

**Call:** We had weekend call coverage where you would cover a 12 hour shift depending on the rotation you were on.  Night float covered Sunday night-Saturday morning with three 12 hour shifts on the weekend to cover.  It was easy to trade call shifts.  Different places have different schedules.

Procedures: Covered in the procedure clinic.  I should also mention that some residencies will train you to do c-sections, are very active in you first assisting in surgery, or have you do screening colonoscopies/endoscopy.  

**Fellowships:** Sports medicine, geriatric, ob (train to do c-sections), hospitalist, medical education, informatics, sleep.  All generally are one year fellowships.  

**Who is a good fit in family medicine?**

* You want to do it all, or you want to not do it all.  It is very easy to create a schedule that works for you.  Want to be the do it all doctor who rounds on his inpatients, sees clinic patients, covers the ER, and then delivers babies?  Rural FM is for you.  Want to make six figures working part-time at an urgent care?  Easy.  For full scope FM you'll be restricted to rural areas, but for everything else you can go rural, urban and suburban with jobs available everywhere.  I'll generally talk about outpatient FM as that's the trend for most graduates.  

*  You enjoy talking with patients and like having continuity.  I've watched patients lose 50 lbs during my residency.  I've seen a diabetic exercise and lose weight and his A1c is now 5.1 completely off of medicine.  Though you also see that cirrhotic slowly circle the drain and pass away.  The diabetic wound that turns into an amputation.  You do goals of care conversations for your dying patients.  All my nursing home patients who I had at the beginning of residency have passed away.  I convinced one of them to go onto hospice.  I've delivered babies and seen them through the first years of life which is really incredible (or at least I think it is).  

* Most of medicine fascinates you.  I get to dabble in a little bit of everyone's field.  I'm currently working up a primary hyperthyroidism, treated chlamydia, sent a smoker to ENT for a laryngoscope for hoarseness, had to look up the work up for abnormal uterine bleeding, discussed PSA testing the list goes on.

* You want people to live their best life.  This applies to all of medicine, but in family medicine this means an emphasis on prevention and success can look different.  Instead of performing the heart saving cath, you counsel on diet, exercise and get appropriate people on a statin.  Instead of cutting out the cancer in the colon you convince people to get colonoscopies or do FIT testing.  There isn't that instant rush like other specialties, but it's very rewarding in it's own right.  

* Training: Our residency is only three years and it is definitely not the hardest one out there.  

**Cons:**

* Money: We're one of the lowest paid specialties.  Lifestyle wise it's very cush, but you're not pulling in half a million like derm does with their office life.    

* The unknown: You have to be okay with uncertainty.  Not every cough is lung cancer and not every cough needs a chest x-ray, but when you miss something, which will happen to you eventually as not everything is textbook, it can be devastating.  Along those lines, you can't know everything and you will hit things that you need to look up or maybe refer before you really want to.  

* Prestige: While a good FM doc is generally well respected it certainly isn't prestigious.  That being said, everyone in FM is generally down to earth and great to hang out with.

* Burnout: Some patients are nasty and that's just a fact of life.  You have to fight insurance companies.  The day is very fast paced and you'll see a lot of patients and documentation is a drag.  

I really love FM and am excited for my career.  I will be working slightly outside of a major Northeastern city working 4 days a week 8-5.  I will have occasional phone call which goes through a nurse triage line.  This generally means I get 1-2 calls when I'm on phone call.  I can't be drunk/altered, otherwise no restrictions.  I'll be making around 240k with bonuses.  

My wife is going to be a fellow in some internal med subspecialty and I'm excited to support her in her career.  I envision myself going part time shortly after she becomes an attending.  

For the right person FM can be a really rewarding career and nice lifestyle.  Let me know if you have any questions!"

8swk0t,3,2018-06-21,Where did you end up at with your 3.0 GPA?,gettingoverit6311,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8swk0t/where_did_you_end_up_at_with_your_30_gpa/,"So I landed an internship with a midsize federal agency last summer at a 3.8 gpa. Don’t ask me how I just got a call one day with the offer. I’ve been with them for a year in two days but with a full time course load, a 5 year old and 32 hour work weeks I am in my second to last semester standing at a 3.45. Side note I’m a mom to a 5 y/o, yup had her when I was 16 don’t judge please. So it’s been pretty tough especially with mom guilt. 

With all the pressure to graduate from my job I stacked four courses this summer and will take my last four this fall. I hope to finish my B.S. in accounting in December. (I’m constantly asked when my graduation date is) But I just bombed my cost accounting summer course with my first C and am now concerned. I still have intermediate part 1, accounting information systems and finance to finish.  I’m aiming for Bs in all 3 but honestly at this point idk. 

They have a 3.0 or higher requirement but what if I don’t get converted to a full time employee at the end of the year. Will any accounting firms consider me? Any other federal agencies? Where did you and your 3.0 gpa end up at? Are you happy? How’s the pay? 

I’m just worried because there have been a lot of office politics lately. An intern graduated last October it took them 4-5 months to convert her and get her office hence she’s Asian. Another coworker graduated in may it hasn’t even been a month and all his conversation has gone through and he’s already in an office, and yes he’s white. My concern comes from the fact I am Hispanic and also a mom. They’ve let me bring my daughter to their bring your kid to work day and always ask me about her. But you just never know what if I don’t get the permanent position at the end. "
8swqaw,0,2018-06-21,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8swqaw/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
  
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
8swu8f,95,2018-06-21,"Post-game, sweaty slutting",ilyrae,stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/8swu8f/postgame_sweaty_slutting/,"Hi! Just discovered this sub and I definitely have some stories to contribute! 

I'm in my second year at college and I recently started an internship at a company near my mom's house. It's great being back home but I also miss being on campus and, well, getting to have sex a lot. 

I love doing stuff with my body. Usually that mostly refers to running and soccer but I also extend that to sex, too. I love getting physical, and I love sweaty sex. Ever since I started being sexually active, my love for sports kept me outdoors and, of course, around lots and lots of men who were all very willing to treat me like one of the guys on the field and a tiny fucktoy in bed. 

When I learned that the company I'm interning with has summer sport league teams, I practically begged to join. I ended up on the coed flag football and softball teams and I recently had my first game on the flag football team. 

The game was great, even though we lost, and I felt awesome running around everywhere. After the game, one of the guys offered me a ride home since we lived pretty close together. It might be because I've done this so many times but by the time the game ended, me being surrounded by so many strong, sweating men, I couldn't stop thinking about cock. I've done it so many times where my friends and I would play, then just go straight back to a dorm room for some more fun. 

All throughout the ride I thought about fuckjng this guy giving me a ride. And I felt like he wanted me too. I saw the way he looked at me. Halfway through the ride I took off my shirt, partly to tease him and partly because it was so damn hot. He kept on glancing and I teased him about looking. And the more I teased him, the more he did it. I knew then I could fuck him that night. 

When we got to my house, I asked him if he wanted to come in. I knew my mom wasn't gonna be home for a few hours. And as soon as we got inside, I just couldn't hold it in and I told him I was fucking horny and I was in if he was in. 

And he was definitely in. He practically tore open my shorts and spanked my tiny ass a few times before turning me around and groping me. It felt so good feeling his hot body on mine.  I teased him throughout with my body and my voice, begging him to be rougher with me, begging him to hurry up and get his cock hard for me. 

I got on my knees and began to suck him off. His cock pounded in my throat and I gagged a few times, opening my throat up to him and getting throatfucked like a good whore. I let my spit dribble down my mouth, catching it with my hand and jerking him off with it. I pulled his cock out of my mouth and slap my face with it, and I knew he liked that. I kept slapping myself, asked him to slap me too. 

I choked on his cock a few more times before he was ready to fuck me. My pussy almost screamed for it. I pull a condom out of my nightstand and put it on him as he spits on my pussy and fingers me. 

He flips me over onto my stomach and he plunges in, deep. My pussy grasps around his cock and it feels so fucking good as he pounds me over and over again. He grabs me by my hair and pulls me up as he fucks me. I yell ""Yes!"" over and over again in rhythm as he grunts and fucks me. ""Harder, harder, harder"" I ask, every time he feels like he slows down. I want to feel him try to break my little body in half. 

""Fuck me until you cum!"" I beg, and he spanks my ass and pulls me up onto all fours as he spreads my ass and fucks me even harder. I feel myself orgasm and he plunges every inch into me. And then I feel his cock shoot into the condom, the warmth filling me up. 

I felt bad for sending him home right after that, but I couldn't risk my mom coming home to catch me with a man. If it was my dad's house I wouldn't really care but I didn't want her to see me like that. He left without saying much, and I appreciated that.

I fingered myself to orgasm again while I showered. 

Since that night, I give him a little hi and a wink every time I see him at work and he waves back. 

Can't wait for next week's game!"

Three months in, I feel the need to go home, but don’t know how to approach it",Xancolt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8sxi03/i_23m_moved_to_a_new_state_after_graduating_start/,"Hello, so this is my first post to anything, and I just need some help from people who are unaffiliated.

First things first, I’ve been with my SO for almost two years, known her for about three! We met in college, I was in a bad relationship at the time, but immediately fell for her. That first year was tricky, me negotiating how to free myself from the toxic relationship and be with her. She truly made me so happy and I just fell in love. It wasn’t until the summer after we met (after a couple of dates and me telling her that I needed to figure things out before I could be with her) that we really came together, but damn it was such a breath of fresh air to be with someone I loved, who loved me, who I could enjoy all the time with, and who I felt I really understood and she understood me. 

It was the best summer. And the year that followed was also fantastic, we were together and both graduating, ready to explore and adventure together into the next chapter of our lives. Then it got tricky again.

Towards the end of the year, I discovered that she suffered from extreme anxiety - I knew of some trauma in her youth, but this was new. She would just completely shut down and I could do nothing to help or make it easier. I feared for her well-being, her life at times, though she assured me that wasn’t at risk. 

After graduation, she moved home, another state, and was starting a summer internship. We had to go long distance for the next year or so, and it was awful. We hardly saw each other, she was still dealing with her anxiety, which made her question our relationship, scorn me at every turn, make her say things that were completely out of her character that I knew, and I couldn’t be with her to even try to help, though she often told me I didn’t help her anyway, I only made things worse.

Come the fall, seems we hit rock-bottom, she wants to break up, I try to keep us together, at least until we can actually talk in-person - I didn’t want this relationship to end over a phone call. Somehow we pulled through, but things had changed. I knew she had no intention of spending more time with me at my home, I knew she felt uncomfortable with my family, she had no desire to maintain a strong relationship with her family, and wanted us to move to the same city, in her state, to be together and start that new chapter.

Long story short, I’m here, in the new city, in her state. I made the move in April. I thought this would be the change, the starting point for everything feeling so much better. Since April, we’ve fought on a weekly basis, I’ve threatened to leave, she still says I’m no help to her; she’s away again at the same internship from before, two hours away from me. My lease is up in a week, I have a fine job but it doesn’t feel good, I don’t know where I’m going to live if I stay, or how I will manage it. Last week, I was going home for a few days, and we almost broke up again, but she said she couldn’t deal with a break up because of her internship. I went home, and as could be expected, felt immediately better. All I was missing was that person I fell for three years ago. But she says she can’t come with me every time I go home, still says my family makes her uncomfortable and she doesn’t know if she’ll ever be comfortable, she’s worried about my next trip home, wants me to spend more time with her, wants me to find a place to live closer to her, wants me to try to make living here better for myself and not rely on her being the thing that keeps me here.

I’m at a point now where I just want to go home, if I could keep her with me I would, but I know that going home will break her heart and it will end. I don’t know how to tell her, I don’t know how to deal with that fallout. I know my family would be a great support, but I guess I’m just scared to lose her and part of me feels like I’m giving up to easy. I’m going to see her this weekend.

TL;DR two year rocky relationship, a year of long distance, and a new city to be closer, nothing feels right and I want to go home, but she won’t follow"

Pack and Playoffs needs updated rosters throughout the season. Include promo pack players and moments player with your updates. If you can't manage to do this (probably because you can't even manage to update reward packs to moments packs) hire an outside engineering firm. 

Make the rewards better for Pack and Playoffs. Check your statistics, I bet most gamers quit playing that mode a month after they started their my team. Doesn't take a genius to realize it's because the rewards are trash (also because you don't update the rosters and no one wants to play with a bunch of golds).

Schedule challenges are hilarious. You actually thought people would waste their time on that hahahahaha. Everyone does the first game for the contracts and that's it.

You know it, I know it, you need another online option for my team players other than supermax. Trust me, Pack and Playoffs will be a success if you continuously update rewards like you do for Supermax (use MT as a reward if you don't want to give away players) and update the players we can use such as promo pack players. This will entice gamers to buy packs when they realize how fun those new players are.

If its possible to get around FIFA's copyrights on teammate chemistry, do it. This will be an easy replacement to the joke of a system you guys call salary caps. LOL at whichever employee suggested this.

Coaches are an amazing addition to the game. Don't give up on this idea. Instead, publicize it! Average My Team players have no idea what the coaches do. Show the attribute boosts like you do for dynamic duos.

Speaking of dynamic duos. Assign some first year employees or interns to do them since clearly no one at 2k likes it. It's easier than it seems. Stop waiting for certain cards to drop to make duos. The longer you wait, the more no one cares. 

I stopped playing 2k when the content slowed down. I came back when you guys realized your revenue streams were almost dried up and started adding cards like never before. Everyone was happy (surprising for 2k fans).

It seems like everyone wants to burn down 2k headquarters for this one (or kill Ronnie). Blow by cheese. Seriously, this is your counter to people chucking threes? I literally run 97 Lebron and pg and score literally every time no matter who is guarding me. This is a joke and it's not fun. It's not even basketball. 

Point guards need to be reintegrated into the game. My Team and My Career are broke because of this. No uses point guards! At least in 2k17 Diamond Kyle Lowry felt like kyle lowry. This year it feels like a 12 year old who gets his shit blocked every time he steps into the paint. 

Fix post moves. It shouldn't be like last year when even my girlfriend could score any time she wanted with a weak post fade but it needs to be much better than this year. It feels like the chance for a post shot to go in is completely random. All you have to do to defend in the post is hold the right stick in the direction of the post player. Really makes it feel like a real basketball game! 

You guys are either stupid or liars. You said defense would be completely revamped (weren't lying here!!! LOL) so that the defender would rely on skill and attributes. That's a joke. It has nothing to do with defense and everything to do with over powered blow bys.

In summary, update pack and playoffs rosters. Update reward packs to include moments players (would make a lot of players happy), more dynamic duos (literally assign interns to this task, its a lot easier than it looks), include coaching attribute boosts into the lineups like dynamic duos, BLOW BY CHEESE, POST MOVES (centers like hakeem and Kareem are only used as stretch bigs which is an insult to the inside game), fix defense, and please make point guards feel the way they should. This game has literally turned into small forwards who can speed boost and dunk, and big men who can rebound and shoot threes."

**Executive (Dis) Order**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**U.S. border patrol agents will [reportedly stop referring migrant parents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-will-stop-prosecuting-parents-who-cross-the-border-illegally-with-children-official-says/2018/06/21/4902b194-7564-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html?h_sid=58a91bb196-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;noredirect=on) with children who cross the border to courthouses for prosecution.** This is an apparent workaround that will prevent family separation and joint-family detention, even though the Justice Department says its zero-tolerance policy is still in place.                    
                       
**Meanwhile, there’s still [no plan in place to reunite](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/politics/trump-family-separation-executive-order-chaos/index.html?h_sid=58a91bb196-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) the 2,300 children already in detention** with their parents.                       
           
**In the chaos Trump has created, government agencies are not coordinating with one another** and Republicans in Congress are [paralyzed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/house-rejects-conservative-immigration-bill-with-no-citizenship-pathway-for-dreamer-immigrants/2018/06/21/77ca659c-757f-11e8-bda1-18e53a448a14_story.html?h_sid=58a91bb196-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.3b871677d0a6). The result is tremendous uncertainty and even a risk that family separation will return.                               
            
**Democrats can’t force Republicans to be humane and/or competent. Democrats CAN** stake out clear positions on how they would clean up Trump’s mess, if given the chance.                         
              
**The Senate Democratic [legislation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/19/17478656/keep-families-together-act-dianne-feinstein-senate-democrats-republicans-family-separation?h_sid=58a91bb196-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to prohibit family separation is a good starting point.** Democrats could go further, including by adopting proposals from Ali Noorani in the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-we-can-follow-our-laws-at-the-border--and-still-be-a-nation-of-grace/2018/06/21/362ea4e4-74d6-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html?h_sid=58a91bb196-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.c29ff28e6b9e) to:                                  
              
- **Revive the family case-management program that the Obama administration instituted—**a program Trump terminated, despite its overwhelming success assuring migrant compliance with law-enforcement proceedings.                                             
                  
- **Eliminate jail and jail-like detention in favor of home detention, or bail-style release, and monitoring.**       
                          
- **Discourage migration not with deterrence, but with aid measures targeted to alleviate violence and poverty** in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.                                          
              
**Democrats also can’t ignore the GOP’s ugly spin, which frames Trump’s approach as “[following the law](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/ice-border-trump-family-separation-humane-cnntv/index.html?h_sid=58a91bb196-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)”** and the alternative as “[open borders](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1009807715798044672).” Both of these frames are lies.              
                             
- **In no other contexts do lawmakers equate “following the law” with “zero tolerance.”** (If they did, Jeff Sessions would be in jail for lying to Congress!) In the actual world, with limited resources and common sense, it is phenomenally stupid and cruel to focus on arresting and prosecuting as many mothers crossing the border with children as possible.                                
                  
- **Republicans will lie and say anything Democrats support amounts to “open borders,”** so Democrats should support ideas they believe will do the most good and make the argument. Abandoning your principles to stop these attacks is a fool’s errand.                                   
               
**From Dan Pfeiffer:** Trump faced real-time accountability for separating families, and it’s worth looking at why, in the hope of learning lessons for the battles to come. We shouldn’t resign ourselves to the idea that Trump can only be forced to back down when he does something as vile as kidnap and torture children.

I'm trying to find out if there is a smarter way to go about it. I'm considering doing maybe one or two work terms and then dropping out of co-op. If this is doable, it sounds very appealing to me. I can regain one or two semesters which can allow me to do the following.

* I could graduate earlier and spread my courses out a little bit more.
* I could apply for a PEY coop if I want/need and I will have one or two previous work terms of experiences to help
* I could apply for an external internship if I am feeling ambitious.

I'm curious to know if anyone has done something similar and if this is a smart thing to do or I'm just wack. "
8syk2m,36,2018-06-22,My First Job Was a Bust,WarmBlanketColdBody,talesfromthejob,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/8syk2m/my_first_job_was_a_bust/,"This is a whole novel of feelings and problems I had with the company, so there's a little warning.

I worked in a large, large warehouse that shipped product for a bunch of home repair stores based in the midwest. It was my first job, I liked the store well enough, and I needed money so I figured ""Hey, why not work at the distribution center for the store?"" A friend had recommended me for it and I went in about a day after submitting my application. I was eager to work and learn, and I always called my bosses ""ma'am"" or ""sir"" no matter what.

The start was fine. There were no red flags right away and things felt good, I felt productive. The pay was $10.25 an hour so I felt good about that as my first job. When things started raising questions was when I, an underage part-timer working 40 hours a week and every other weekend, was told I had to cut my breaks short. We had two ten-minute paid breaks and a half-hour unpaid lunch, and most of the floor managers told people not to take most of them. That really struck me as odd.

The next problem came up on the day I was supposed to be getting my general training. Everyone there needed to be trained on all equipment and how to run conveyor lines. That day, I got told by a floor manager (I had never met before) to start cleaning the warehouse and gave me really vague instructions. I had no protective gear, no dust masks, and no hearing protection. The warehouse was filthy from top to bottom. There was animal feces, exposed chemicals from broken product, black dust and dirt, and nails hidden in broken pallets. I had to clean it all up for about three months before I got my first training week. I developed allergies from all of it and it was so bad, my snot was black and grimy and I couldn't breathe well in the warehouse.

My training was done by an intern who was there for all of a month, and he barely knew how to run anything at all. I was pushed onto equipment that was ill-explained and handed paper after paper for things I was never tested on or even fully trained on. This happened in the span of a morning, there was no follow-up, and I was sent back to cleaning.

Now, I was originally hired as a part of the line crew. I would put boxes of product onto a conveyor, and I had to keep it stocked so the sorters could process it fast enough. We had two to three people on two conveyor lines, and each line had three docks full of product that could be anywhere from 20 to 80 pounds. The lines had a productivity goal of 500 an hour and it never changed, even though we were so short-manned. I kept up and handled the line, I learned the computer work by hand on my own, and even bumped up productivity to 800 boxes an hour for both lines.

Again, after about a month of solid work for what I was hired for, I got shoved into janitorial service. I had to scrub the floors of the break room, upstairs and downstairs. I had both gender bathrooms I had to clean, alone, and I had intense exposure to all sorts of bleaches and corrosive cleaners with no training on handling them. I felt totally disrespected at my job at this point and I had no way out. I was expected to handle both the janitor service and my job on the warehouse floor, but I was pushed into sweeping and cleaning after an hour of my hired job. I was cleaning literal human shit and piss every day of the week, chemical burns from what I was using, respiratory problems from 17 to 18 from all the black dust, and I had no pay increase or recommendation.

I could never find a manager or a floor supervisor until they wanted something, and then they disappeared. Any questions or problems I had, they were gone. Now, I had two managers (Tipper and Topper, I guess) that worked in corporate, Magenta and Bob as floor supervisors, and a whole HR staff that was either behind locked doors or unreachable. It was a game of never-ending telephone with all four of the people I answered to. Tipper and Topper were never available in the office and I only ever (rarely) saw them when they clocked out. I could raise as many concerns or ideas and I never got anything back. Magenta seemed to hate me, and she always pushed for me to sweep or mop or clean and was the one pulling me out of my job and into the bathrooms to clean toilets. Bob was brand new, had no idea what he was doing, and did whatever Magenta said.

I received one instruction for a whole day, and it was to sweep aisles or scrape stickers. I got finished with a task early every day in the hopes of going back to my job, and I was either tossed around departments all day or just given vague ""clean aisle 2 through 9"" from whichever person I could track down. They would sometimes just walk around trying to find something for me to do, but God forbid I do what I was hired for.

It finally got too much when I started getting sick. It could have been from work, from stress, from home, who knows. But I had to take a few days off (this was the only few weeks in my whole career there that I took a day off) because I was so ill. I had no PTO, no vacation, no overtime, no healthcare, and no benefits because I was just a part timer. I didn't have the option to go to full time because I was supposed to ask within the first month of being hired, which I didn't know.

I worked the full time hours and only had lunch or a 10-minute break every few days, I did exceptional work, and I wasn't recognized for it. I saw people who had been reprimanded for poor productivity, bad behavior, late marks, and disrespectful people getting raises and promotions and Employee of the Month. It was a real slap in the face when a guy, who had pressured me into giving him my number and harassed me both in and out of work, get a 40% raise and a promotion. Here I was, reporting harassment, breaking my back for my job, and doing exactly what was told of me, getting passed over and looked over left and right. It got to me that I was putting in 110% and this disrespectful guy got rewarded for his actions.

I quit one morning out of the blue and I had to take a few months to get out of the depression that job put me in."

8syqp3,5,2018-06-22,(M20) having serious doubts about 6 year high school sweetheart (F21) with a hectic college schedule.,Titleist_Drummer,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8syqp3/m20_having_serious_doubts_about_6_year_high/,"As per the title, my 6 year girlfriend and I are finishing up college. Because we’ve been dating since a young age, we lost our virginities to each other and have had a strong emotional bond because of how many “firsts” we’ve shared sexually and emotionally. 

Our relationship started fast, but stayed very vanilla, but I told myself I can wait until we mature a little more before we start sexually branching out. So we had sex. Not regularly, and not nearly as much as I would’ve liked, but I didn’t want to be an asshole 16 y/o high school boy who was pressuring his girlfriend into too much sex. We went through high school having sex about twice monthly. Still I was patient. “Wait til college, people find themselves sexually in college” I thought. 

Then college began and suddenly we were too busy to have time for tons of sex. She and I were the kind of kids who sacrificed every bit of fun in high school for too many extracurriculars and AP classes, and she works even harder now that we’re in college. The girl had 3 internships during the school year and is busy with multiple things and doesn’t have much free time. I

I tried to talk to her about it and say that I wish we could make more time for sex. That it’s important to me to feel that physical connection. She apologized for not having a ton of time lately and promised to work on it. The only problem is, almost every time we have sex, it’s passionless and feels fake. It feels like pity sex. 

The frequency of our sex hasn’t changed from when we were shy high schoolers, in spite of the conversation. We have sex about every two weeks still. Every time we have four or five “pity” sessions in a row I start to emotionally withdraw a bit and grow dissatisfied. Then it’s almost as if she can tell because we’ll have an amazing date with passionate sex (albeit missionary) and suddenly I’m hooked and think “this is okay, maybe this means she’s starting to be more sexually driven.” But then she withdraws to starfishing. 

Last summer we lived together in a city where both of us had internships for the summer. It was great playing house and seeing how emotionally compatible we were and how easy it was to live with each other’s living habits. 

I started fantasizing about how great it will be when we leave college and our schedules can die down, but then I got to wondering if the intimacy would increase even if her schedule decreased - or if it would decrease at all since she’s a notorious workaholic. 

In spite of our emotional compatibility and lengthy history for our ages, I wish I could see her more. Our Sex is boring, but it’s more frequent than most people who post here, which makes me feel like I’m overreacting a little bit. 

I hate that she’s willing to hug and cuddle and give compliments occasionally but still flinches every time I touch her sexually or try to get her to relax and enjoy. It makes me feel like her compliments about my body are false and makes me feel unwanted. 

I’ve discussed breaking up with her with my best friends but I don’t know if I can bring myself to do it. We have a solid five year plan with jobs and living together potentially lined up after this next school year. I sometimes wonder if I’ve grown complicit in our cycle of sex every other Saturday with masturbation in between. 

I’ve recently lost a lot of weight and have realized I might be a bit conventionally attractive, and have had more than one group project member flirt heavily with me at school. If I don’t get out of my relationship, I don’t want to look back in 20 years having wasted the years of my best physical attractiveness and highest potential to meet a sexually compatible mate at college with someone who won’t reciprocate physical attraction. 

I’m just really tired of my girlfriend feeling like a roommate. Am I overreacting? My girlfriend is my best friend and practically nothing else in our relationship is wrong. Please help me out. I feel like I’ve built part of my identity into being this girl’s boyfriend. I’m just so tired of not feeling wanted and getting infrequent vanilla sex. 

TL;DR - high school sweetheart is really busy and has passionless sex about twice monthly. I tried talking to her about it but nothing changed. Practically nothing else is wrong in our relationship but I feel ignored. Thoughts?"

8syv50,265,2018-06-22,[Residency] Why you should consider dermatology - Attending perspective,sevenbeef,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8syv50/residency_why_you_should_consider_dermatology/,"Credit to /u/babblingdairy for the template and starting this.

**Background:** 

I'm a board-certified Dermatology attending and have been out of training for over five years.  I'm currently at a multispecialty group practice, but have held a position in academics as well.  Entering medical school, I was a neuroscience major, so was interested in neurology, then later ENT.  My third year surgery rotation squashed any desire for surgery or a subspecialty, so I thought about internal medicine, and later, infectious disease.  

I ended up taking an extra year to do additional rotations in pathology, dermatology, and radiology to see if any of them sparked my interested, and spent the rest of that extra year doing research to help match in dermatology.  If it helps, I went to a top 10 US allopathic school and had Step I/II scores in the 230s.  Not AOA.  I ended up with only one publication out of that research year, but had secured two research grants, which ended up giving me a little bit of an edge when sharing my experiences during the interview trail.  I had five interviews and matched at my #1 location.  

**Dermatology years:**

PGY-1: Intern year - Can be IM/Surg/Transitional.  You choose.  

PGY-2/3/4:  Derm years - I combine the derm years together because largely, you will be doing the same types of things with increasing degrees of skill, knowledge, and experience.  

A typical day is usually in the outpatient clinic setting, starting at around 8am and ending at about 4-5pm.  About half of the time, residents will have their own general dermatology clinics, staffed with an attending, who will give you more and more responsibility as you progress in years.  The other half of the time will be spent in specialized dermatology clinics, such as pediatric dermatology, immunobullous, procedural, lymphoma, contact allergy, laser, cosmetics, and so on.  These will be staffed by an attending who specializes in this field, to give you more dedicated time and (most importantly) exposure to that subset of patients.

Inpatient time is divided up over the years.  Some programs front-load the inpatient time, whereas some divide it evenly.  During this rotation, residents will be in the hospital taking derm consults during the day.  Depending on the hospital, this can be relatively light or absolutely crazy.  

A large amount of time is also spent learning dermatopathology, which can be very tricky at first to relearn histology and basic pathology.  

Finally, all residents will have exposure to Mohs surgery, which is a tissue sparing excision technique that relies on the surgeon to also act as the pathologist and examine clinical margins on the same day as the surgery.  As most cases of Mohs surgery take place on the head and neck, residents become familiar with facial anatomy and how to perform flaps and grafts.

Though most days do end at a reasonable time, much of dermatology is learned from reading, so expect 2-3 hours of reading a day in order to have any hope of doing well on the annual inservice examinations or the boards.  It is reasonable to say that you can perform well in clinic, know everything about your patients, have an excellent eye for procedures, and still utterly fail the board examination if you don't read.

When it comes to studying, get used to looking at pictures.  Our textbooks are largely pictures.  Hundreds of thousands of pictures of everything.  There is no alternative to this part of the training, and as such, you will learn the skill to identify diseases at a glance.  

**Reasons to do Dermatology:**

**Lifestyle.**  I'll get this one out of the way.  Life is pretty good in residency and as an attending.  Most attendings work 4 or 4.5 days per week and clock in about 35-40 hours of work.  The reimbursement is good ($350+) and most of us have great satisfaction helping our patients.  The opportunities for alternative practice styles including telemedicine, locums, part-time, solo-practice, and more are unsurpassed in medicine.

**Mastery of your field.**  In few fields will you have the opportunity to evaluate your patients clinically, treat them surgically/medically, and evaluate them histologically.  You can see kids, adults, men, women, or only little slides of patients as you desire.  You can dispense finely dosed amounts of topical medications, or sling immunosuppressants and biologics with the best of the rheumatologists.  With this comes independence, as you may not need to rely on labs or imaging most of the time - just your eyes and a scalpel.  

Dermatology graduates can choose to spend an additional year of fellowship training in Mohs surgery, dermatopathology, or pediatric dermatology.  Many dermatologists, especially in academics, have a particular interest in a subset of dermatology, which varies from contact dermatitis to psoriasis to lymphoma to vulvar dermatitis.  

**An old-fashioned view of medicine.**  The Norman Rockwell days of medicine are over...except perhaps as a derm.  You can start up a practice by yourself.  You can ignore insurance and take cash (or crops, or whatever).  You get to see largely healthy patients, take a look at them, make a diagnosis, and have them walk out with a prescription that will likely fix their problem.  They're happy, you're happy.  It's how medicine was once practiced, and still can be so.

**Characteristics of Dermatologists:**

* You liked both medicine and surgery during your clinical years.  You may even have liked anatomy and histology during your pre-clinical years.  
* You are risk-averse.  We are definitely not trauma surgeons or ER docs.  We like predictable schedules.  We can recite the side effects and risks of all of our medications - and take great strides to avoid all side effects.  Just ask a dermatologist about prescribing Bactrim and watch the look of horror.   
* You are business-minded.  Though not for everyone, business-oriented docs will find a great deal of satisfaction in our field.  You can start a business.  You can start a product line.  You can invent a new device.  The world is your oyster!
* You are detail-oriented.  You really can't do the job without being nitpicky about details.  Whether it's evaluating 1000 nevi in a day for slight irregularities or deciding whether to inject 4 versus 5 units of Botox, we are judged by the little stuff.
* You enjoy the variety of clinic, and like the fast pace.  You like coming into a room, making a quick impression, making a diagnosis and treatment plan, and then leaving...all in the span of minutes.  

**Downsides to Dermatology:**

* You're not really someone's ""doctor.""  Many may find this to be an advantage, but no one is going to thank you for saving their life or taking care of their children.  Your scope is narrow, and your impact is variable, but likely not dramatic.  You'll probably take some crap during medical school and residency, and probably as an attending too.  Some of this is envy, but some people will honestly wonder why you wasted your skills and knowledge on skincare when you could have been a transplant surgeon or something.
* Getting in.  The path to becoming a derm is cutthroat.  Yes, good board scores and grades and research are all important.  The field is also very small, so knowing the right people is critical.  
* Fighting off the fakes.  The honest truth is that 50&amp;#37; of the typical day-to-day stuff is pretty easy, and so the field is being overrun by nurses, nurse practitioners, PAs, and other physicians who think they can do our job with a few hours of CME.  It takes time and consistency to build your reputation, and though 50&amp;#37; of the job is routine, at least 10&amp;#37; of the job is impossible to know without going through the training.  "
8sz67w,402,2018-06-22,[residency]Why you Should Do Pediatrics - a Resident's Perspective,BrobaFett,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sz67w/residencywhy_you_should_do_pediatrics_a_residents/,"Thanks to /u/babblingdairy for the good idea and structure.

**Background:** Soon to be PGY-3 at an academic pediatric residency program in a city. Always had a lingering interest in caring for pediatric patients even while I worked in EMS prior to medical school. Wasn’t until my rotations that I realized that Pediatrics was the best fit for me (Gen surg, interestingly, was the close runner up). I am planning on pursuing fellowship in Critical Care.

Pediatrics is one of those specialties that has a pretty simple gateway: do you welcome the thought of never having to take care of adults and instead master the care of a pediatric patient? If you find that caring for adults doesn’t foster the same level of interest or excitement that taking care of children does, I would highly encourage you to seek out this specialty.

**Pediatric years:**

* PGY-1: Intern year- This will typically be front-loaded with inpatient months on the general pediatric wards. Most programs will try to put you in the general inpatient unit your first or second month. You will take primary ownership of your patients including writing the notes, placing the orders, and having first-shot at the majority of procedures (LPs, lines, etc). You will often have one or two months for electives, a rotation in the ED, NICU, and often some form of primary care month. 

* PGY-2: Resident- You will transition to a more supervisory role while on your inpatient months. You will often work with a number of interns, overseeing their work. The first half of your PGY 2 year will likely be quite difficult as you’ll be asked to oversee double or triple the volume of patients. You’ll also have a larger role in teaching rotating medical students while operating as senior resident. Lastly, you’ll likely be communicating with ED physicians and outpatient physicians in the admissions process. This is also your year to beef up the CV if you are interested in fellowship with some research. You’ll have several more months to do elective rotations in specialties that interest you. You will apply to most fellowships at the end of this year.

* PGY-3: Senior Resident- This will likely be the most laid back of your residency years. Here you will have a larger opportunity to moonlight, pursue elective rotations, complete pending research projects, and interview for fellowships if applicable. If you are going into general practice, this is the time that you will begin the job search and licensure process. By now, you’ll have a much greater comfort level in overseeing junior residents and effectively delegating responsibilities. Most programs will also seek your input at this level with regards to residency policy changes or other committee duties.

* PGY 4: Many programs offer a PGY 4 chief resident year. There are definitely practical advantages to a “chief year”; primarily the freedom to focus more on administrative tasks and having the time to focus on bettering the residency as opposed to clinical duties.

**Typical day:**
This is your average day on the wards which is a bread and butter rotation for Pediatrics:

*6:30 AM* - Obtain hand off from the overnight team. Following this, you’ll see your patients, make any necessary changes to orders, and begin working on the progress note.

*7:30-8:30* - Our program has various special educational rounding times depending on days. Morning Report happens each Tuesday and Friday. Radiology rounds on Wednesday. Occasionally we have subspecialty rounds on Monday.

*9:00- 10:00* - Table rounds. These are the “meat and potato” rounds where we discuss the very specific treatment decisions and go over the objective data. This allows for us to get the crunchy details for each patient settled and keeps us on the same page for family centered rounds. It also is a medical-student friendly opportunity for them to present on patients they are following and have a chance to learn a little bit more about the patient.

*10:00- Noon* - Family-centered rounds. These occur at the bedside and are lead by the PGY 1 resident. Here we will briefly overview the case, what our principal diagnosis is, what tests we plan to order, and answer any questions the patient’s family may have. Any questions the PGY 1 might not know the answer can be freely bounced up to the senior resident. Residents not primarily caring for the patients will often place orders right at bedside to expedite the afternoon work.

*Noon- 1 PM* - Lunch conferences. These are often informal presentations that happen while we eat lunch. Often lead by senior residents. However as the month progresses, interns and medical students are assigned small topics to present on.

*1PM-5PM* - Admissions, order placement, and follow-up with consulting services. The early residents will often leave around this time.

*5PM-7:30PM* - Late residents continue with afternoon tasks until sign-out to the night team.

**Call:** Again, this will vary pretty dramatically from program to program and I would encourage you to ask about call schedules during your interviews. Our program, like many, will have a “night month” for PGY 2 and PGY 3. Some programs have a “night float” schedule where there is a senior resident on an occasional week of nights while on an elective rotation. As a PGY 1, you can expect to work a Saturday, Sunday, and one week of nights (Sun-Fri) during each inpatient month. Our program voted not to have PGY 1s on 24 hour shifts but as a senior you will likely have to cover an occasional 7A-7A Saturday 24 hour shift.

**Procedures:** These will vary by specialty, as you can imagine. But every specialty that pediatrics is a gateway to will have procedural opportunities respective to their field. Cardio will give you time in the cath lab, OR, and with Echoes. Pulmonology will have bronchoscopy. GI, endoscopy. Critical care will give you your lines, tubes, ECLS, CRRT, etc.
 
**Fellowships:** There are a variety of fellowship opportunities including: Hospitalist, Child Abuse, Developmental-Behavioral, Neonatal-Perinatal (NICU), Cardiology, Critical Care (PICU), Emergency Medicine, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Hematology/Oncology, Infectious Diseases, Nephrology, Pulmonology, Rheumatology, Adolescent Med, Allergy and Immunology, and Neurology. Essentially you can pick a major life stage or organ system and specialize in it if you would like. 

I personally think Pediatrics is really the best field you could possibly go into, but I recognize it’s not for everyone. Here are some aspects of the career that I find particularly rewarding:

 **You enjoy a lot of patient and pathology diversity**- In pediatrics you will have the opportunity to develop fluency in caring for patients from extreme prematurity to early adulthood. Their stages of development, physiology, and pathology will change dramatically between each. The pathology you will encounter will change between each stage. I truly think Pediatrics, by far, offers the largest variety of pathology and patient presentations.

**Your work is incredibly important** - Your patients are often not at the end-stages of their diseases. Instead, your intervention - whether in maintaining a healthy trajectory or intervening in acute illness - will have tangible consequences that last for decades. 

**You want to be a generalist and be “the doctor”** - You want to be “Doctor Broba” when your patients see you. You want to participate in maintaining the wellbeing of a child from birth to adolescence. You have an opportunity to create long lasting, meaningful patient-physician relationships. As someone who is pursuing fellowship, I will miss this part of general pediatrics the most. Subspecialties- despite what they say otherwise- will not have quite the same role in their patient’s lives. You will truly be their “doctor”. 

**You want to be a specialist and focus in** - You really find the physiology of the heart fascinating. You enjoy localizing lesions with a neuro exam. You want to be called by the hospital service when the patient has some rare zoonotic disease. You want to be the master of pediatric or neonatal resuscitation and critical care. Pediatrics is how you get there. Even in shared pathways (such as Pediatric EM), I think Pediatrics better equips you to comprehensively care for this special patient population.

**You want to be a voice for a vulnerable population**  - As a child healthcare expert, you will be looked to by your colleagues, by parents, by the government, and by hospitals to advocate for children. You get to be a voice for a population that cannot speak for themselves. This is a privilege. 

**You save the lives of children. You cure cancer.** - I get to shamelessly make the same plug the general surgeon did in his thread (which you should read, it’s a great write-up). If your goal is to directly intervene in critical pediatric illness, you will find no better specialty than critical care or emergency medicine. You will make life-saving decisions, run pediatric codes, and manage the majority of pediatric trauma (as the majority is non-operative). You are the first line for DKA, arrhythmias, sepsis, status epilepticus, etc. And the *best* part of this is that, in general, *kids get better*. The vast majority of pediatric oncology is going to be managed and *even cured* by oncologists. 

**Primary prevention is even better** - Good generalists and outpatient specialists are continuing to improve pediatric morbidity and mortality. Pediatric emergencies are becoming rarer and rarer and I don’t mind the thought that someday as a future intensivist, I maybe only work part time. It’s through the diligent work of those invested in primary prevention that are making diseases that once contributed to a great deal of children dying or suffering a relic of the past.

**You don’t mind never seeing an adult again** - Personally, I don’t miss it. Taking care of children has a huge effect on my happiness and sense of meaning. I did not have the same satisfaction in my work taking care of elderly patients in the end-stages of their diseases. And while you will manage children with chronic (sometimes fatal) medical complexities, the environment is utterly unique.

**Happiness is an important metric for you** - If quality of life matters, Pediatricians and sub-specialists tend to score at or near the top when it comes to happiness. 

Misconceptions: You know, I haven’t experienced that many misconceptions. I do think there are some people who take Pediatrics a little less seriously than they do adult medicine, but this disappears once you put a sick kid in front of them (or when it’s their kid that’s sick).

 Some real downsides to the field:

**Compensation** - Our patient population has a much higher proportion of medicaid and the majority of our work is not procedural. Thus, we aren’t as well compensated as other specialties and regularly compete with Psych and FM for lowest specialties. You can expect to make a decent living if you are flexible and there are some Pediatricians who do quite well for themselves. 

**3-year Fellowships** - a Pediatric EM fellowship out of EM training is 2 years by comparison. There are several subspecialties that have 1 or 2 year training programs. While I think it’s appropriate for many specialties, it’s also somewhat arbitrary. 

**The Second Patient**- your patient is not just the child in front of you, but the parents at the bedside. Creating rapport, understanding, and trust are difficult and essential skills to develop. Additionally, you will encounter the very frustrating reality of a parent who disagrees with your recommendation (the most infamous example of being anti-vaccine). 

**Highest highs, lowest lows**- Yes, you have the opportunity to directly intervene and even save the life of a child. You will also see children succumb to their diseases. There are few experiences so sad as a child full of potential and promise be taken from the world. Something about it is inherently *wrong* and you will cry with the families. You will see children who have been terribly abused. You will see infants who have been neglected to starvation. You will witness trauma. The emotional toil is real and requires you to develop coping mechanisms to deal with it.

**Rounding**- I recognize the irony of a future critical care fellow not enjoying rounding so much, but it's here to stay and serves an important function. Fortunately there is some flexibility in this as well as career paths (general pediatrics, adolescent med, EM, etc) that do not require rounding.

I’m happy to answer any questions you may have about the specialty that I love."
8szfar,12,2018-06-22,I think Asia stepping away from the Migrant Crisis is okay,xArceDuce,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/8szfar/i_think_asia_stepping_away_from_the_migrant/,"I can't really provide proof without being absolutely fucked by my contract, so all I can say is that I'm a Korean living in the US who has lived the second half of his life in the US who works within the American-Mexican border. If anyone asks, I work private, so I don't work for the ICE. Most of my office have hated the ICE for barging into our jurisdiction multiple times, but that's off-topic.

***Since this will probably link to it (since it pertains to immigration): I'm also going to refrain from talking about the ""white genocide"" problem because I honestly think that issues an entirely huge elephant in the room and would like the topic to be talked about in another place. Probably the ""White Racism exists"" topic people had. We barely get brought into this shit, so I'll refrain from diving into a fire I don't belong in.***

Now that backgrounds and disclaimers out of the way, let me start my argument by saying that I don't think the Refugee Crisis is really pertaining to the refugees.

There are a few points:

- A lot of middle eastern countries barely provide support for refugees. It's obvious they don't think it's a refugee crisis. Despite it's fucked up, it's reality regardless and I think little can be one about solving this issue.

- The migrants openly have cheap labor skills such as construction (they can make tent cities of all things), but refuse to use them for any of the countries they are in, resorting to traveling to Britain at all costs for welfare and job security.

- They refuse to integrate into the society, instead trying to reform the countries they are in to their own comfortable view: regardless of the consequences.

These are the connotations I've gained from following the issue since the start and my experience of working with others. Gathering facts and stories (including the infamous Calais jungle) from multiple people.

These three factors are absolutely oil and water when you put that with contrast to Asian countries, who are known for their very religious views and dedication (whether in Christian or Buddhist roots), strict emphasis on education/work ethics and a sense of community of family roots while respecting men/women of educational merit. (This doesn't even start in the cultural divide like the pop culture)

The thing I want to point out is that I think the ""You're not Asian, so Asian people put you below them"" is absolutely overextended because of the fact that students worldwide are constantly admitted to study abroad programs, have internship experiences working in a professional setting and accepted in the community as long as respect is kept between both sides. You went to college. Everytime you see a study abroad program, you see South Korea or Japan on the list in the top. Good colleges to add. And the leadership in Korea, China and Japan realize this. If you are a leader of a nation and realize that accepting migrants will result in a time bomb waiting to go off in your country, then why shouldn't you be allowed to reject migrants? The problem is that people think that Asia should open their doors just because other countries did. But the Middle Eastern countries, who are closest to the border, did not open their doors. Israel barely even tried to keep their doors open or integrate. So why should Asia?

People would say ""you just hate immigration"" as a argument, but after working in the border, I have learned to differentiate what's going on in the Mexican-American border to the Migrant crisis. To be honest? I'd think that the ""Mexican Immigrants are ruining the country"" is absolutely bollocks when suddenly we're suppose to get together with people who openly admit everyone who isn't with them should be justifiably murdered. There is a difference between an Economic Migrant who admits they are a economic migrant and looking for work... and a migrant who refuses to work and try to leech off of their status as ""refugees"". The Mexico-America situation is far from perfect, but there is potential solutions whether it be reinforcing the border or making the policy more open.

As a person who lived in the DC Metropolitan area a lot of his life: Asians are capable of respecting other cultures. The work ethic and respect the employees have within cleaners, hard labor and restaurants between Asian and Hispanics is actually something a lot of other ethnicity in America can learn a lot from.

And it comes full circle. The claim that the leadership policy in Asia of ""they aren't Korean/Chinese/Japanese so they're not welcome"" is from xenophobia is absolutely wrong and doesn't warrant any merit towards the roots of the issue. It's not from the fact that Asians think that ""since we didn't start it, we are absolved from solving this"" (which is tolerable despite I heavily disagree). It's the fact that the leadership knows that the migrants do not fit in with the society and will continue to cause problems continuously due to their own sense of entitlement as a status of ""refugee"".

Off-branch: Something I absolutely fucking hate is the argument ""they accept North Koreans, so why shouldn't they accept Syrians?"". Have you even heard the stories in North Korea? Do you hear North Koreans making noise within United States for constant entitlement as a refugee? No. I barely hear of a time when a North Korean refugee committed a crime within the United States. The stories you hear is that most of them study and start a family/business. Compare that to what's happening in France. It isn't even close to the same because North Korean refugee's are rare compared to the flood of migrants coming from the middle east constantly. You shouldn't be entitled just because you celebrate a different religion. Anyone who uses a NK comparison should be absolutely barred from having any talk about civil rights or humanitarianism.

It would entirely ruin the population production and general happiness of the country. So why even do something like that for absolute losses without any gains just to be a part of a ""social movement"" that already has shaky foundation? It makes sense while making a good argument, but somehow another society's sense is absolute disregarded as ""racism"". What the UN needs to understand is that there is no ""middle-line"" they can create from this. This policy is here to stay and they can bitch about it all they want, but the Asian countries have enough economic and political power to fight demands.

I know this is a bit weird to talk about, but I wanted to get the thought out of my mind using my own set of logic. It might be flimsy at times, but I honestly think the plan of forcing Asian countries to accept migrants is an absolutely stupid idea that gives no merit and ends up making the world a worse place even more."

  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8sr8tx/my_desire_to_fire_has_opened_up_some_very/?st=JIPVRLET&amp;sh=5d95f716

A few people asked me to elaborate on my “Work Smart” philosophy instead of the usual putting your head down and grinding mentality that is the norm to advancing.

Before I begin, I have only used this in a corporate setting and cannot guarantee this will work in other work environments, however most of this will sound simple once you read it.


Let’s start with Internships 

So you land an internship for the summer and you have 8 weeks to leave your Mark with your employer.

Work Smart
1) Use your time to do as much research as possible to understand how the business works and what are some common challenges.

2) ask a lot of questions from long time employees about their day to day and learn from them.

3) work hard to make people’s lives easier by figuring out a simple solution to a simple problem that annoys everyone.  Trust me we all have small issues that we can never get to since we’re occupied with other things.

4). When given only basic tasks to work on, make sure to do then the best way anyone can and take it upon your self to get involved in more complex tasks.  Approach this from a “I am really interested in helping solve this issue”.

5) Schedule meetings with influencers to get to know them and ask them questions about how they became successful.   2 things ring true wherever I’ve been
       1) people like receiving sincere compliments.
       2) people love to talk about themselves.


6)   Make sure to be helpful at least once to the people that have the ability to hire you.

7) Ask your boss to advocate for you and get you a full time offer or part time work during school.    So many people just never bother to ask or make it known that they are hungry and want to continue working.


Don’t do this

1) treat an internship like summer camp.
2) Expect to be told exactly what to do.
3) only hang out with other interns or people your age.
4) leave exactly at 5 if you’re working on an interesting project.


So many interns at my company don’t realize that they are in a competition to maybe fill in 1 spot.  As managers we are looking for the brightest and the best and if you don’t stick out to us then you won’t get a shot.


Entry level job


So you’re hired full time and now you must do the work. 

Work Smart

1) you just landed an MBA class of the real world where they pay you to learn.  So make sure you learn something new each day or your Day was a failure.

2)  There are no problems only solutions.  When you approach your manager with a problem or issue always start with a solution and let your manager decide if you should implement it.

3) Be confident even if you’re wrong.   No body’s perfect and your manager probably has a lot on their plate.  Having an employee that comes to me with a solution and takes some chances on their own in order to make my life easier is a breath of fresh air.  Granted there are big decisions that need multiple perspectives and sign offs but do the work yourself and come to your manager confidently with a solution.

4) manage up.  Your sole job is to make your manager look good and earn more money with the hope that they cut you a slice.   Make sure to help your manager look good. 

5) Don’t take credit for things.   We hate credit hogs and can see right through them.   We know who does what and even if we miss a few things it won’t matter.   Just keep on solving things the reward will come because no one will replicate what you do.

6) make sure your peers are involved in your ideas and win them over to your side.  This is not a to the death competition.  You are all a team so get the rest of the team on board to your ideas and then present them with the team to management.   This shows that not only can you come up with solutions but you can also build a consensus.

7) Do the next level up job and don’t take the credit.  I believe that we should all be working the next job we want.  When it’s time for promotions we know who has the skills to move to the next level.

8) Develop relationships with key people that will mentor you and help you advance in your career.

9)  Understand the big picture and be a team player.  

10)  if you’re ultimate goal is to be a leader then start leading now.  A title does not make a leader successful rather people need to gravitate to you.   Leading without a title and having people want to follow you is the recipe for a true strong leader.


There are many more things but I feel like this rant is long enough.  I hope this makes sense and helps some of you."
8t0ufa,5,2018-06-22,Having trouble trusting my boyfriend,Heavymetalkitten33,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8t0ufa/having_trouble_trusting_my_boyfriend/,"Need help here guys. So I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 5 months now. We’ve been really happy, and everything has been great. We’ve had some disagreements but we’ve always worked things out and ended the conversations laughing.

Well I had to go away for a summer internship, so we’ve been in a LDR for about a month. And on Monday I found something reallllly sketchy on my boyfriends Instagram. It’s a long story, to save you the detail, I think he may have been hiding our relationship online on Sunday night.

He swears up and down that’s not true, that whatever happened on instagram was an accident or a glitch. I’m the first girl he has introduced to his family, his co-workers, and his friends and that he’s always seen a future with me. I talked with one of my computer wiz friends and he said it could very well be a glitch, since everything has been going so well and this in the first big issue and I’m not 100% that anything is actually is happening, I’ve decided to trust him.

But I’m having trouble. I find myself being very paranoid. I check his Instagram a lot and I also check his activity on the direct messages frequently as well. I’ve talked about it with him twice now but I keep getting this anxiety. I also have a diagnosed anxiety disorder so that just adds a lot of fuel to my fire lol.

Anyone have advice for me? This relationship really has been great up until this point and I really think it’s a valuable thing in my life to try and fix. Please help. "
8t19xd,1384,2018-06-22,"My car has been in 14 accidents from many fender benders to 3 major wrecks. It has been hit by an 18-wheeler and in a major wreck on the freeway. Last night, it was put to rest as it performed its last service for me and saved my brother's life.",iwannabefreddieHg,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8t19xd/my_car_has_been_in_14_accidents_from_many_fender/,"Hi all-

I just really wanted to post this because it is so incredible to me and I want this experience shared. It is a true testament to what amazing manufacturing can provide (or maybe just luck, I don't know, I'm not that kind of engineer).

My car was a 2007 Honda CR-V.  It had 120,000 miles on it, and I have owned it for nearly 12 years (bought brand new for my 15th birthday).  

I have the worst luck with cars.  THE WORST LUCK WITH CARS.   I have been in the car for more than 20 wrecks.  obviously the majority being fender benders.  I have been in the car with 5 different boyfriends over the course of my life when each totaled their cars.  I have only been at fault for 1 wreck (its not like I weaseled my way out or something they have all been cut and dry) I have been rear ended 6 times sitting still at a red light.  I legitimately have friends who wont let me in the car because they are convinced I am bad luck.     

This car has never so much as made a strange sound.  I have never in my life had an issue.  I have had to change the tires obviously, replace brake pads, etc.  but nothing has ever broken on it. Every piece of technology, AC, everything has worked perfectly through the entire life of the car.  

I realize this is not unusual, but 3 of the wrecks I have had with it have been major.  The axel has snapped and the side crushed in when I was T-Boned by an 18-Wheeler (It was not going too fast).  I was in a 4 car pile up on the freeway 2 days after I turned 16 when a truck bed liner flew out of a truck going 65 mph.  The marks on the median are still there from my car to this day, every other car was totaled but mine.  

Seriously, this car was so reliable.  I had my 100K mile tune up and the dealership said ""this car runs beautifully, I have no suggestions beyond the usual tune-up""   

Now to the story of what happened yesterday. My brother and I traded cars for the summer.  He was going to be driving 1500 miles to an internship in his pick-up so I offered to trade with him.  He would get better gas mileage and my Fiance and I just bought our first house so having a pick-up would help us a lot with projects.  

So yesterday morning, he called me upset.  He was driving around 45 mph through a green light and someone coming the other direction in an Explorer didn't yield to take a left and he t-boned them going full speed.  All of the airbags deployed and the car was destroyed.  The other person had moderate injuries from the glass, and had some really bad head and neck pain from the whip.   The other car was slammed into the traffic light pole.   

My brother didn't have a scratch on him, and not a single pane of glass shattered.  in fact- I have never had a single pane of glass shatter in any wreck I have been in that car.  

Here are the pics of the car: https://i.imgur.com/qfz0Dvj.jpg . 
I am fully convinced that this car is a miracle.  look how crushed the front and side are, and the drivers area is untouched. 

I was so shaken up for what could have been.  But really my heart is full because this has been an amazing experience with a car.   My brothers first sentence to me after was, ""I am buying this car for all of my children when they turn 16""

So thats my love song to the car I received as a present when I turned 15. 

I can't wait to buy my next one this weekend. :)

Edit:  **I am going to count the wrecks up I have been in the car for from my memory so I can be more clear.**  20 was an estimate. 

1.  My mom slid into a guard rail on ice
2.  One my mom was merged into and side swiped
3.  My mom's car was slightly hit when the car in front of us tried to pass someone and hit someone else head-on going the other way (that was very serious and someone nearly died, luckily my mom was a cop and knew what to do.  She pulled the unconscious person out of their car and did something, I was really little I dont remember)
4. My other brother had been mudding in his jeep and it was raining and he rear ended someone when they hit the brakes.  He was a fucking moron for that, but that will help him to remember what mudding does to your tires.    I was in the car and 15. 
5.  Freeway pile up I mentioned when I was 16.  A trunk bed liner flew out of a truck and 4 cars were involved by either being hit by it or swerving to miss it.  I swerved to miss it, the car behind me hit me from behind because she followed me and slammed me into the median, both of our cars went slightly sideways momentarily on the median and came back down.  Hers was bad.  She almost got hit getting out of the car because of her panic.  Luckily my mom was a cop and always said that people die getting out of their cars on the freeway after a wreck, so I grabbed her and pulled her aside, we were very lucky. 
6.  My friend backed my CRV into a brick wall while moving it in HS.
7.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
8.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
9.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
10.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
11.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
12.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
13.  Sitting still at a red light and someone rear ended me, various times.
14.  HS boyfriend was rear ended and totaled his car. 
15. BF #2 went fast over traintracks with me and ripped something under his car that meant it was leaking oil, he didnt notice so it destroyed the engine, totaling the car. 
16.  BF #3 backed into a car in the parking lot, they were both backing up and not looking.   His car was not totaled actually now that I think about it, so I was dramatic when I said it was all totaled.
17. BF #4 was rear ended in the rain.  Cheap car so it was totaled
18. BF #5 was also rear ended in the rain.  Cheap car so it was totaled.
19.  I was in a parking lot looking for a spot and an old man driving an 18-wheeler accidentally went pedal to the metal and t-boned me, major damage to my car. 
20.  I was in another parking lot also looking for a spot and I backed up and looked right and left and missed a car turning the corner and I hit him, totally my fault.  
21. Someone backed into my car when they went too far into an intersection and panicked.  I didn't have time to move, but honked too late.  No real damage to the cars. 
22. I was in another parking lot and some young kid wanted a spot and flipped it in reverse and backed into me, I was behind him, but didn't react fast enough which drove me to take defensive driving courses. 
23. My friend was driving my car and went off the road on a big turn and the bottom of my car slid on the street.  It did something to the underside of the car.  That wasn't bad but the damage was expensive, so I counted that as major. 
24. Someone ran a red light by accident and hit their brakes just in time to very very slightly t-bone me going through the green light.  
25.  We were on a 4-lane street and I said ""Hey lets stop at Mac's"" and my moron friend said ""Okay"" and merged without looking to make the turn for Macs in like milliseconds.  she hit a taxi.  We aren't friends anymore because she told me I should pay for the ticket because I said we should go to Mac's...

So the ACTUAL totals are:
14 wrecks in my car
25 wrecks total
I was the driver for 12 of them. 
1 I was at fault for 
3 were major

Edit 2:  Hey guys, I really appreciate all of the replies.  I am just going to blanket answer a bunch of these questions as my inbox is sort of blowing up with repeats.  

1.  I understand ""at fault"" doesnt mean I am not partially responsible, of course I could have reacted better in a few of these, but I have taken 2 defensive driving courses since these happened and genuinely try my best to be safe. I never want to hurt anyone.  a lot of these are skewed towards my first few years of driving.  I will always claim responsibility if it is mine to claim.  I have never tried to get money out of people or purposely caused wrecks.  I have never done a random break slam that caused any of these.

2.  If I am a passenger, and I didn't impede the drivers ability to drive or their attention, that wreck was not my fault.  Full stop.  

3.  Most of these were very very small and classifying them as wrecks may be confusing you. I counted any time my car or a car I was a passenger in hit or was hit by something it should not have been causing the 2 drivers to get out of their cars together and discuss damage even if it was only a dent and scratch.   
Most of y'all know that any amount of damage, however small, can cause problems in a car and the only point of including those is that it was a reliable car and didn't have that happen. 

4.  If your only contribution is to call me a shit driver or tell me I should never drive again, feel free to just upvote the other folks who have already done so. I cant just not drive anymore, sorry its necessary to get to my job.  If you sincerely believe I am somehow a danger to you, please feel free to leave tips I am always down for bettering myself. "

I had decent grades in 110 and 121 (96 and 89 respectively), and I am aware I should be practicing outside the lectures to get the most of the degree. My question is, what are your suggestions to do outside the classroom. For example, I am practicing Java over the summer for 210, but what comes after? Should I (do I need to) learn C++ before 213 and 221? Do I need to practice machine learning outside class if I want to pursue ML? Considering I will be doing some internships next summer before co-op, is my time better spent doing personal projects or learning new languages when I am not working in the afternoons or practicing interview questions?

Thank you!"

I love someone man or women to make me give then consent forever. Their slave. Their pet. Too many people try to turn me into a mindless obedient slave. That is no fun. I'm into obeying every command and instruction as if they're perfectly reasonable requests or stuff like that. Ideally the request tap into something about my character's personalty. Other kinks are public sex, pet play, daddy/mommy play, making me a nudist, corrupting a religious girl.

I love playing new scenarios so I would like you to send me the scene in your mind already. I will share some of the things I have been sent and liked. Don't think these are your choices. You can try, but I do love originality. What I would love to hear is twist on these or completely new ideas.

Also make sure to make your title related to your scene.

Your slut's daughter: While I was away for college, you hypnotized my mother to be your sex slave and wife. She was so lost on your spell that she never brought me up. Well now I'm back for summer. You have a nice nudist wife always ready for your biding. You are not going to let me get in the way of that. You may make me join.

Stuck out of my house: I lost my key. My thankfully I have the nicest of neighbors and he will let me stay till tomorrow morning. I don't know what he is planing thou. If he gets what he wants I will never be leaving. How could I leave my daddy after all.

Finding my friend: A friend of mine has disappeared. She wasn't kidnapped, she told me she was leaving, no explanation. After weeks of trying to reach out, she tells me to come over she has a new home. She would love for me to meet her master. I look up an address and see it is a mansion. I can't resist but to accept the invitation.

My new personal trainer: This is what I needed to do to lose weight. A pesonal trainer. You gave me a dvd to watch so I know what to do. I don't remember what was in it anymore, but since I did I eaten better and worked out everyday. It is like you put a spell on me. Today you are coming for our first one on one meeting. I'm so exited.

Free use internship: The guys in the company were getting too stressed till the boss decided to make one of the female employees into a free use slut with hypnosis. Of course the other girls were hypnotize to think this was okay. Slowly every hot female employee was turned. Now you need more. Help Wanted. I apply.

The perfect saleswoman: Sex sells after all. Your business is not doing to well, but you have a solution. Me. You have made me into your slave and I'm willing to do anything to sell your product.

Group orgy: This is the vague one. I won't play more than one character at the time. I will respond as whoever your character is paying the most attention at the time. We will both play the other girls and the crowd. Still your words are truth, so where will you do your orgy. Are you a teacher in an all girls school, are you in a first class plane ride, yoga class? Anywhere you want.

Everyone is welcomed. Men, woman and futa's. (I will only play a women or a futa). Will love to hear from all you lovely people.

Please, don't be scared to pm me all of today. Also if you have tried before don't be scared of trying again."

Only problem, she's taking an internship across the country and doesn't want to begin a relationship before she leaves.",KnightofSand,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8t1xwe/i_22m_began_dating_a_girl_21f_who_im_falling_for/,"I started seeing this girl from Tinder with the intension of a short term to long term relationship. We've only had a few dates, but since exchanging phone numbers we've been texting each other several times a day. We even made each other playlists. We recently had the ""what are we"" conversation and she says she could see herself with me.

Now onto the problem, she's spending the Fall semester on the other side of the country for an internship. I knew about this before the ""what are we"" conversation, but I thought that the time we had before then would be enough to develop into something long distance.

She expressed desire to remain friends, but understands if that's not something I want. I truly appreciate her as a person, and I think we could get along well as friends. I know from past experiences that I cannot lose romantic interest in a person if we remained friends, but those scenarios were more one sided. I truly believe that she would reciprocate my feelings if she wasn't leaving. 

My question:  
Would I be selfish if I remained friends with her, but want a romantic relationship with her when she returns? I'm worried this would set us both up for heartbreak.

**TL/DR:** Have feeling for girl who will be too far away to begin relationship; don't know if I can be just friends without hurting either of our feelings."

During high school everything was awesome. We saw each other everyday, we lived not far from each other so all was good. We then went to school and it was our first time being away from one another. I went out-of-state and she went in-state. We were apprehensive about an LDR but I would say we have made it work very well for the past two years. That brings me to now. 

We both moved home for the summer and I recently got an internship that I am really excited about. My girlfriend, who is in the process of transferring schools, is still looking for summer jobs. I got back home and have been working for about a month now and work ~40hours a week and try to see her any evening I can and I try to see her on weekends too. Please don't get me wrong I love this girl to death and really just want her to be happy. While she is searching for jobs she seems to get really down because she can't find any work on account of coming home from school much later than other college students. I really hate seeing her upset but what is eating at me is that her attitude is starting to affect us when we are hanging out. I try to suggest stuff that we can do but, as many if you probably know, it can be a little challenging to find fun stuff to do on such a tight budget. I offer to pay for stuff and all that but she is proud and won't let me, which is a quality that makes her even more perfect than she already is. She always brings up being bored during the days when I am at work and I really do try to help her think of things to do but it always comes back around to her talking about being bored and causing a little bit if tension between us. She has assured me that it isnt me and that my suggestions are helpful but it just doesn't feel like she wants my advice or like she just listens but nothing I say can help.

I really just want her to be happy and am unsure how to proceed going forward. I love hanging out with her and just don't want this to escalate into something bigger than it needs to be. Any advice would be much appreciated :)

P.S. we both live in our parents house so we are often never alone and both our sets of parents are pretty protective and stuff. (i.e. no being in bedrooms with the doors closed, etc...). This is also my first post so I was a little apprehensive but, for better or for worse, I trust what you all have to say.

8t2yfg,242,2018-06-22,[Serious][Residency]Why you should consider Orthopaedics - attending perspective,Vibez420,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8t2yfg/seriousresidencywhy_you_should_consider/,"Side Note: Didn't see an ortho post so figured i'd fill in a blank. I think this trend initially started to persuade people / fill people in on a field that was relatively unknown (PM&amp;R). But since i saw a derm post, we should be good

Background: 
I'm a board certified orthopaedic surgeon. Have been out in practice for 4 years. Initially was a general ortho surgeon doing bread and butter stuff out in the boonies. Now i'm in a larger city doing trauma related hospitalist/surgicalist gig. On the side i have a lot of different side hustles including IMES, case reviews, and even some locum work. Never knew i wanted to do ortho in med school. Just happened to get lost one day 3rd year during my peds surg rotation and drop into a peds ortho hardware removal case. Seeing all the shiny gadgets, watching some dude using a 10 lb mallet to whack a flex nail out of a kids tibia was an ""A-ha"" moment of clarity. One that i have never had before or since. I was a 4th year AOA. Step scores I/II were 254. Did some research and published towards 4th year, but almost after the fact in terms of applications. I applied broadly to 80 schools, interviewed at 14 places, matched at my #3. 

Residency years: 
Intern year: You're essentially another gen surg prelim. This was back before they mandated 6 months of it be strictly ortho, which is awesome for the new residents. The good side is once people figured you were ortho, you got more respect and residents tended to trust you more. The gen surg chiefs preferred ortho guys/gals because we took pride in our work and were here to stay (as opposed to transitions/prelims that were gone after a year). On the downside, it's gen surg and it's intern year. Rotations vary between programs, ours included ICU, vascular, cardiothoracic, urology among others. Some are easier, some suck... 

2nd/3rd year: Everyone's experiences will be different. I went to a school that was one of the last ones to be old school. So we got treated like shit, but we also did a lot of surgery. This was at the tail end of the toxicity, so the groups ahead of us were sometimes bitter while we were right as rain. This i believe has since changed, but 2nd year involved two 36 hour shifts tuesdays and thursdays and another 24 hour shift saturday, so you were working 100 hour weeks consistently for at least a 3 month rotation x 2 during our trauma service. As a 2nd year, this is the feeling out period where the chief ortho residents decided whether you were worth something. This is where reputations are made so first impressions were important. This is also when you learn the most of ortho knowledge base and the curve is steep because med school does not prepare you for ortho. Our rotations at that time were trauma, joints, and spine. In 3rd year, we had a bit of a reprieve and mostly did 3 month rotation blocks in hand, VA general, hand at county, and spine again. 

4th/5th year: 
You're essentially a chief resident at this point. Depending on the program, you should be mostly surgery heavy. In our 4th year we did mainly peds, with some spine, foot and ankle, sports. This will vary with the program. The peds rotation was great because you did everything surgery wise, but also almost harder than 2nd year in terms of trauma because if you're in a western state, the cachement area for peds is huge. Everyone from a 600 mile radius will call you about some peds stuff, so it's exhausting. This is also the time when you start applying to fellowships. Unlike residency apps, fellowships aren't as hard to get into unless you're looking for a top 5 program. This is also a time when you reflect on how poor you are. In 5th year, this is where it all comes together. There will be a moment where you reach the singularity point and all that training comes together. Hopefully attendings will leave you in the room by yourself and you can go skin to skin without interruption. This is also an important year because the trend is for everyone to do fellowships now. So this is your chance to do everything NOT in your fellowship so that when you're an attending, you don't forget the other stuff. 

Misc: 
Board exams are 90% pass rate. If you fail, you will be ridiculed and bring shame to your program. We do have an OITE program where we do practice tests throughout residency. There's a raging debate as to how much the OITE actually correlates with board pass rates. The short answer is, the best correlation is still STEP 1 scores and SAT/MCAT scores. It's unfortunately something we will never live down. 

As another side note, residency programs are a lot easier than even when i did it. The good is that you'll have a slightly better lifestyle. The bad is that your surgical experience will suffer. Thus another reason why everyone does a fellowship, not out of interest but pure necessity. 

Reasons to do Ortho: 
Lifestyle: 
People really misunderstand an ortho surgeon's lifestyle. Things have changed where no longer do you HAVE to work 60+ hours a week. If you work in private practice, everything is incentivizing you to work because you're paying for overhead (staff, office, etc). Thus people often do work over 60+ hours a week because you're either all in or not making money. However these days theres alot more hospital employed surgeons. I know surgeons working at Kaiser that work 35-40 hours a week and make 400k. As a surgicalist, i work seven 24 hour shifts a month and get 23 days off, so my lifestyle i would argue is better than most. But then i work my extra jobs because i'm bored, but that's a personal decision. As always, how much money you want to make depends on how you want to work. If you wanna make over a million a year, you're probably going to work for it. 

Mastery of your field: 
Like the derm post, no one knows your field like you do. But i think unlike the other subspecialty surgical fields, the volume of ortho is IMMENSE. They say MSK pain/problems is 80% of a general medicine practice. Now i'm not saying that's necessarily true, but EVERYONE has a MSK complaint at some point. Felt a twinge in that shoulder while lifting weights? That could be ortho. Banged your knee up playing soccer? Ortho. So I would say that from a supply demand standpoint, due to the immense supply of MSK complaints, ortho is even more in shortage than most of the fields out there. And if you're talking about spine and back pain? Out of control. So what i'm saying is, you'll never go hungry. 

Surgeries: 
I once made a post that i think ortho has the most broad and numerous amounts of surgeries. Since MSK makes up the majority of the body, and we're responsible for that, in turn there's a shit ton of surgeries to play with. Scopes? We do that. microvascular repair? we do that too. skin/soft tissue? yep. Nerves/CNS? yep. And bone. You're gonna have to learn to love the bone. We also have some of the coolest toys. So there's never an end to the fun.

Housekeeping: 
Due to the way residency is structured, residents now are getting less hands on experience than ever. Thus the fellowship heavy training, which leads to even less that residents do (as fellows do all the surgeries). I have friends with two, even three fellowships, which i think is insane. Because of that, we've created our own shortage. Let me explain. Used to be one general ortho surgeon could do surgeries all over the body. Now, we have a guy that operates on the left shoulder exclusively (/s). So instead of one guy taking care of the entire body, it takes 6 surgeons to do the same work. Sure some will argue that that work get better results and what not, but like everything there's a limit. When this next generation retires, the landscape of ortho will change even more. There will be an even greater shortage of ortho surgeons due to this phenomenon. In the cities, it's not a big deal because there's enough super specialized surgeons to fill all the gaps. But in smaller towns, this will become an issue. Part of why i do locums is to fulfill this niche need. And this segment of pay i believe will likely increase in the future. 

I'll try to edit stuff down the road. For me, i love this speciality and could not see myself doing anything else. The minute i saw that shiny mallet, it was love at first sight. Also, we have had many residents not AOA or had a Step 1 score below 230. So it's not impossible. You just have to kill your sub-I rotation.

8t48nk,2,2018-06-22,Looking for a job/internship in Cairo starting in September!,Kimo619,Egypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/8t48nk/looking_for_a_jobinternship_in_cairo_starting_in/,"Hey r/Egypt,

I am a 20 year old male Tourism-Management student from Vienna (Bachelor's programme at a University of Applied Sciences). I am in the fourth semester out of six right now and during the fifth semester (which starts in September) I will have to work abroad for around 4 months. Since my parents are Egyptian and I grew up in Vienna, I wanted to use this time and finish my work in Egypt (Cairo preferably, I am a fan of big cities) in order to experience my own culture. I found an internship a few weeks ago, but they let me down in the very last second and now I am desperately looking for a new job in Cairo starting in September - without success until now. 

In this regard, I am writing here in order to ask if there is anyone who might have connections (through family/friends/job/other) and can offer me a job? Information on me:

\-I am 20 years old and male

\-My parents are Egyptian and so am I, so I also look Egyptian

\-I speak German and English Fluently, Arabic mediocrely and French on B2

\-I am interested in humans (and working with them), cultures, sports, music, travelling and having a good time in general

\- I study Tourism Management (Relevant Subjects:  Accounting, English, E-Tourism, Congress Management, Controlling, Finances, Marketing, Statistics, Intercultural Competences, etc.), expected to finish in 2019

\- I am a very sociable and easy going person but disciplined and reliable

\- What I am looking for is an internship or just any regular job that I can do starting in September until around the end of December, my main fields are anything related to business (Marketing, PR, Congress, Social Media, Sales, etc.) and everything related to Tourism and Humans (Hotels, Restaurants but Teaching and anything related to Cultures is possible too, almost anything really)

I hope this is enough information on me, if not just ask and I will be happy to answer. I hope that there is anyone on here that might help me out since I need to hand in a working contract in my University and I am really desperate by now since I am way too late. I promise that I will never let anyone down and work hard. As already mentioned, if you can help me or need further details just let me know. Thanks r/Egypt!"
8t4lvl,325,2018-06-22,[Serious][Residency] Why you should consider anesthesiology - resident's perspective,wordsandwich,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8t4lvl/seriousresidency_why_you_should_consider/,"Background: I’m a rising senior resident who will be going on to do a Cardiothoracic anesthesia fellowship. I’m in residency at a large hospital that is a level 1 trauma center and a pan-transplant center. Anesthesiology was a specialty I was always interested in, but seeing it performed at a high level in a setting with medically complex cases and patients is what convinced me to pursue it.

Anesthesiology years:

**PGY-1: Intern year** - Can be either a Medicine or Surgery prelim year, but most Anesthesia residency programs have adopted the Categorical model where you’ll match once for the entire residency. As a result, Categorical intern years will usually feature some mix of Internal Medicine, Surgery, ICU, Emergency Medicine, and various other rotations. Take Step 3.

**PGY-2 (also known as CA-1, the first Clinical Anesthesia year): Junior resident** - You will be introduced to the basic elements of performing General Anesthesia in the operating room including airway management, physiology, pharmacology, and other pertinent skills. Typically case mix is more straightforward stuff like Gen Surg, Ortho, ENT, Urology, and GYN. Towards the end of the year you may get some subspecialty exposure including Regional, Cardiothoracic, Neuroanesthesia, OB, Pediatric, or Chronic Pain. 4 months of ICU are also required throughout residency, so you typically get 1 ICU month as well. Learning curve can be pretty steep initially. You take the ABA BASIC exam at the end of the year, the first part of the written boards.

**PGY-3 (CA-2): Senior resident** - This is typically the hardest year of residency because you accumulate more subspecialty experience and are generally slotted for harder cases. Call responsibilities increase as you’re expected to take a greater leadership role and learn how to manage personnel on the call team.

**PGY-4 (CA-3): Chief/senior resident** - Generally the easiest year. Typically consists of more elective time and “Transition to Practice” type of rotations where you learn how to be an attending anesthesiologist, i.e. learning to supervise multiple rooms. You often get more autonomy during cases and are expected to learn how to take care of situations that arise in the OR by the end of the year. On call, you will typically be the team leader and be tasked with making staff assignments and running the service.

**Boards** - Taken after graduating. Consist of ABA Advanced, the second part of written boards, as well as the Oral Boards and OSCE. Altogether, the Anesthesiology boarding process consists of four different exams.

**Typical day**:

5:30-6:30AM: Room set-up. Some programs do morning didactics while others do them in the afternoon.

7-8:00AM: First start cases.

Breaks: Typically you receive a 15 minute morning break and a 30 minute lunch break.

3-5PM: Some programs do afternoon didactics. Mine doesn’t.

4-6PM: Typically relieved by the on-call team.

6-7PM: I review my cases for the next day and call my attending to discuss my plan for each patient.

**Call**: Some programs do a 24-hour call system with a post-call day while others, like my program, have a Night Float.

**Reasons to do Anesthesiology**:

**You get to save lives**. This specialty will teach you the skills to keep someone alive almost singlehandedly. From managing the airway to placing monitors and lines to performing resuscitation, you become a singularly capable physician whose hands on ability in a crisis is virtually unmatched, and you learn how to do it all crazy fast.

**You get to make a difference every day**. It is incredibly satisfying to get a patient through an operation safely. I could never get that feeling of personal gratification from titrating somebody’s diabetes meds in primary care clinic. The patients entrust their lives to you, and it’s an awesome privilege.

**The OR**. There’s a particular team dynamic that I think is unique to the OR, and as an anesthesiologist, you get to work together with so many different people that there’s generally more comradery and a personal relationship that you develop with the other members of the team. I love working with great surgeons, circulators, scrub techs, and perfusionists who are committed to doing good work every day and having fun while they’re doing it. I never got the same feeling on the wards or in the ICU.

**You get to work with patients of all ages, from healthy to moribund**. You could be playing with kids and doing tonsils one day to doing a heart transplant the next day. At my institution a typical call shift could consist of anything. The variety keeps things fresh and challenging.

**Also, more fun, less grind**. No rounds, no mountain of paperwork, no clinic, no inpatient census, just action. I come to work in my shorts and a t-shirt and change into scrubs. I can leave work at work and beyond looking at my cases for the next day, not bring it home.

**Reasons why it’s not for everyone**:

**The Pressure**. Your responsibility is to keep your patient alive, and sometimes things go wrong, in which case you have to think and act fast. That can be too much for some people. You also have to be flexible and adaptable—you may get pulled into a situation with little or no time to prepare and have to get things under control.

**Blood and Guts**. Comes with the territory. Things can get dark sometimes, and you may encounter scenarios which are impossibly grim. Every single anesthesiologist will have the experience of their patient dying on the operating table after working hard to save them. I’ve already experienced this multiple times. When it happens, you have to be able to bounce back from it fast in order to take excellent care of the next patient. This specialty is not for the faint of heart.

**Misconceptions about the specialty**:

**That it’s boring or uneventful**. It’s hard to get a sense of the amount of planning that goes into providing an anesthetic just because what most people see is the end result, i.e. an appropriately anesthetized patient. Sometimes cases just are as boring for me as they look, and I get to sit in a chair and hang out until it’s over. It really is a stroke of fortune because it means that the patient has tolerated both the procedure and my anesthetic. I think that what students may get less exposure to are the type of cases where a patient has a lot to lose and a real chance of losing it. In Cardiothoracic and Vascular rooms, for example, some patients can be sick enough to risk dying on induction of anesthesia before any incisions have been made—and these are the patients who subsequently go through huge risky operations! These environments require me to have a detailed plan, be on my toes, and to keep ahead of what’s happening. There’s a lot going on in my head throughout the process, and over time you develop the situational awareness to keep track of the room while looking away or doing other things. That can sometimes be misperceived. Also, with experience, you learn to stay so calm when bad things are happening that others may not pick up on it.

**That anesthesiologists are redundant/CRNAs can do the same job**. I compare the relationship to that of any other attending and their PA/NP. CRNAs can be trained to do a great job and in some cases their experience doing certain types of cases may exceed that of the attending supervising them. But simply put, they aren’t doctors, and they have their limitations--the good ones know their limits or they may get booked depending on their ability. They didn’t go to medical school and have to sweat through all of that anatomy, physiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology of disease. They didn’t have to take a dozen high stakes board exams like we did. They didn’t have to rotate through all of these other specialties and do an internship and learn how to be a doctor before coming an anesthesiologist. It makes a difference in terms of understanding patients and their disease processes and making the most informed decisions you can. That said, are their anesthesiologists who make the specialty look bad? Sure, but that’s not a unique problem.

**Challenges**:

All of the above kind of plays into this point, and that’s other people may not appreciate your value. You are a physician, one of the most capable in your hospital, but for some folks, you’re just a product. It’s an ill-informed attitude (the ‘blame anesthesia’ thing), and it’s unfortunate. You’ll have to deal with being made fun of and hearing all the anesthesia jokes one too many times--sometimes it's good natured and other times it isn't and it's annoying. There’s a need to advocate for your patients and assert your own value. You cannot be afraid to speak up.

Reimbursement/pay. Every now and then you'll hear people question the future of the specialty particularly with regard to changing reimbursement models--so far I don't think that's translated into anyone's bottom line being torpedo'd. Nobody can predict the future, but there's still a great living to be made at this time. Everybody I know is going on to get great jobs that they are happy with. There is shift in terms of private practice group ownership and some people being chased out due to an acquisition, particularly in the Southeast, but I think that will always exist. Medicine is a business, and you have to position yourself well. There will always be a place for us less we as a country replace what we have with something more mediocre.

8t543p,13,2018-06-22,Pizza Boy Blues,goldvine_throwaway,SignalHorrorFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SignalHorrorFiction/comments/8t543p/pizza_boy_blues/,"No one gave me a heads up about that  house, or the jerkwho lived there before I moved in. Although to be fair, I probably would have moved in anyway. The rent was right, and the location was good. Still, it might have been nice to know. I think it was Shakespeare who said , “The good that we do is oft interred with our bones, but the prank phone calls that assholes make live after them.” Well, maybe not exactly, but something pretty close to that. 

I moved into the spacious house down on Old Bridge Road  a couple of months ago, on a cold April morning, and the first person I met was my next door neighbor, a man a few years older than me named Tony. 

“Cold morning, huh neighbor,” he said, and then he helpfully mimicked shivering to further drive the point home. We were standing on our respective porches and Tony was grinning at me, ruddy faced and bundled up head to foot in Land’s End and LL Bean gear. 

“Uh, yeah, sure is I guess.” For most of my adult life I’ve lived and worked in the city, and so the phenomenon of having a grown man come up to me and grin at me and just start talking was...novel. Novel and a little uncomfortable.

He stuck out his hand. I stared at it. 

“I’m Tony,” he said, “your new neighbor. Put ‘er there.” And so I did. 

The first sign I had that something a little fishy was going on in my new hood came a few weeks later. It was a little after midnight and I was up bingeing on The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt  when I heard the slightly irritating putter of a motor scooter go past my house for what I realized was the third or fourth time. I looked out my window, and saw a guy in a white denim jacket with something airbrushed in blue and pink on the back, wearing a big red helmet and scooting down the road past my house on a red scooter. He got to the end of the block, turned around, and scooted back the other way. 

I was sort of enthralled by the stupidity of it all, so I watched for a few minutes as he toodled to the end of the street, did a U-Turn, and went back the other way. Past a certain point, though, entertaining stupidity turns into Worrisome Behavior and I started to get concerned he might be some kind of creep, stalking a woman in the neighborhood or looking for a pet to steal or something. I had no reason to believe that whatever he was doing involved me. I don’t really have enemies--I’m the kind of dude who likes to binge watch Kimmy Schmidt at midnight. No angry former lovers. No current lovers. I just moved into the neighborhood so there haven’t been any disputes with the neighbors--Tony, for example, seemed to like me just fine. I was absolutely sure that whatever on God’s green earth was going on had nothing at all to do with me.

That was when the driver stopped right in front of my house, looked up and saw me in the window. He immediately dismounted his scooter, extended his right arm high in the air with his middle finger very theatrically raised, and flipped me off for a solid minute before remounting his scooter and puttering off into the vasty night.

“The fuck?” I thought. I shrugged. I did what anyone would do in my situation--finished up Season 2 of Kimmy Schmidt and went to bed.

A couple of weeks later, I heard the unmistakable, whiny, dismal drone of a scooter going back and forth outside my window again. This time I had just managed to doze off. After the first incident, I had been having a little trouble sleeping. Although I was enough of a grownup not to be unduly unnerved by the antics of someone who I assumed must be some kind of disconsolate jackass, I had been noticeably physically tenser around bedtime. I would spend a long time tossing and turning and clenching my jaws and grinding my teeth and alternating between feeling scared and foolish and angry. 

The whine of the little red scooter startled me awake.

I bustled over to my bedroom window and threw it open like Scrooge on Christmas morning,. I yelled out into the night,  “What do you want????” I had no sooner opened the window than the rider came to a stop at the curb in front of my house, dismounted his scooter, and looked up at me. Directly at me. There was now no room for doubt that this was deeply personal for him. 

He was wearing the same stupid white denim jacket and the same stupid helmet. He stood with his arms crossed like some kind of badass movie villain and stared up at my window through his visor.

“Oh! So now you’re home, huh asshole? Now you fuckin’ answer when someone has a delivery for you,” he yelled.

“What are you even talking about? What delivery, moron?”

I was vaguely aware that some lights had started to turn on up and down the street, including Tony’s bedroom light. I couldn’t count exactly how many people I was waking up making a splashy, late night scene with a schmuck on a scooter, and to be honest I  didn’t want to know. I just wanted this to be over.

“Pizza delivery, shitbird!” He yelled back and gestured to his scooter which I noticed, for the first time, was tricked out with a basket that was stacked with pizza boxes. One, two, three, four, five. Five boxes  I counted.

“I didn’t order any pizzas! You’re confused.” I clenched my jaw tight and choked back something about how he was possibly stupid, too; or insane.

“I’m not confused, you stupid asshole, and you’re gonna be sorry!”

“You’re deeply confused. I’m shutting my window. Go away.” I shut my window. He kept staring up. Same stupid denim jacket. Same stupid helmet. Was he going to flip me off again?

Of course he flipped me off again. He flipped me off and yelled something although I couldn’t hear what he was yelling because I had already turned an old Nirvana/Pixies playlist up on Spotify, and was hunting around for a Xanax so I could get back to sleep. This was all getting seriously out of hand.

The next morning, I realized just how out of hand it was getting when I took a step onto my front porch and stepped on a gooey, grease-soaked pizza box. To be more accurate, I stepped on a pile of five gooey, greasy, rotten smelling pizza boxes. My foot went through the soggy boxes and, before I was able to jerk it up, my left cappuccino colored Cole Haan loafer was slimy from pizza grease, melted cheese, and what I realized with immediate distaste was a generous helping of anchovies. The smell hit me so hard I almost puked up my chocolate peanut butter protein shake. “I’m gonna kill that little fucking jackass, whoever he is,” I yelled at no one in particular. 

Even though I wasn’t yelling at anybody in particular, someone answered. 

“Looks like you’re having a bit of trouble,” said Tony.

I looked at him. He frowned solicitously. My old pal Tony.

“Yes, Tony,” I said through gritted teeth, “I’m having a bit of trouble.”

“Yep,” he said. 

“Yep,” I agreed and nodded curtly and stepped back inside to change my shoes and my pants.

Work sucked. I was wearing my second favorite pair of shoes and wrinkled khakis and I was convinced that the noisome grease-and-stinkfish concoction had somehow permeated my clothes and clung to me after I changed. This made social interactions awkward and I realized, as I walked past two of our interns and they wrinkled their noses and whispered something to each other and giggled that my mantra of “It’s all in your head, bro” just wasn’t reassuring me anymore. 

At a few minutes before 3 in the afternoon I suddenly felt weak in the legs and clammy. A convulsive mix of anxiety, embarrassment, and the phantom stench drove me into the bathroom where I puked up the Trader Joe’s Banh Mi bowl I’d eaten for lunch. When I said I was going home a little early I don’t think I was imagining the relief on the faces of everyone in our small, poorly ventilated office.

At about 6, there was a knock on my door.

I was upstairs at the time, sipping ginger ale and languidly scrolling through Facebook. I’d made the mistake of making several posts about my mysterious nocturnal pizza boy tormentor, and was now in the position of having to deal with lighthearted jibes from asshole friends, one of whom had dubbed my new bete noir “Ghostrider” and kept asking me when we could expect the big reveal where he yanked off his scooter helmet and revealed a flaming, shrieking skull beneath. The jokes had been mildly amusing at first, but I wasn’t in a laughing mood anymore.

So there was this knock on my door.

I felt my jaw tense up. I felt the muscles in my arms go hard. I”m a mild mannered guy but I keep in shape and I wasn’t scared of some skinny little dipshit in a spray painted denim jacket--I’d played high school lacrosse! I grabbed the first weapon I saw, which was a green and blue plaid umbrella from the umbrella stand in the corner of my bedroom. I rammed it against the palm of my hand like it was a club. I muttered, “Alright, motherfucker” and stormed down my steps and flung open my front door and came within a split second of braining Tony with my umbrella. 

Tony was holding a bottle of Bulleit bourbon and looked apologetic.

“I think maybe I should tell you something about the guy who used to live here,” he said, “because I think the kid who keeps bothering you might actually be looking for him and not you.”

I shrugged. I nodded. I invited him in.

I got us two tumblers and Tony poured the drinks. And then Tony told me the tale of Trevor Fitzgerald. 

“Trevor Fitzgerald, to paraphrase the Big Lebowski,” Tony began, “was almost certainly the biggest asshole to ever live in this particular burb; which places him high on the list of biggest assholes worldwide.”

Trevor Fitzgerald had been an abrasive, pompous-yet-crass  young lawyer who had moved in on a freezing cold day in December or January and quickly become the scourge of the neighborhood. Trevor found myriad ways--both grand and petty--to torment his neighbors. He revved the already loud engine of his jet black Porsche Cayenne (vanity plate:LAWGOD”) much too loudly and for for much too long at every opportunity. He threatened to sue neighbors who didn’t keep their lawns acceptably pristine. Despite being a (very) single man, and an avowed New Atheist, he put up such an enormous, garish, and overly illuminated Santa Claus around Christmas time that his neighbors had to threaten HIM with legal action. He said he “Just thought it was funny to bust balls a little.”

But the relevant Trevor Fitzgerald story, the “salient point” as T Fitzgerald Esquire himself might have put it, was the time he got the pizza boy killed.

Apparently, and unsurprisingly, one of Trevor’s great passions in life was fucking with people by making prank phone calls. For example, he once “swatted” (got the SWAT team to show up at the house of) some other young executive-level asshole two suburbs over who had pissed him off in his Call of Duty campaign. Late one night, a clearly besotted Trevor had spent almost 30 minutes regaling an increasingly nervous, clammily uncomfortable Tony with \*that\* story. 

“Every time that son of a bitch talked to me, I needed a shower right after,” Tony said.

The worst thing Trevor did, though, was get a pizza boy killed. 

On a dark and stormy night, Trevor had pranked another online gaming bro by sending him five large anchovy pizzas. This other guy, from what Tony could piece together, had been bragging all week during their gaming sessions about this woman he was going to be banging and so Trevor, being a real sweetheart, decided to fuck with him a little in the pettiest, laziest, least original way possible. 

Trevor gave very specific instructions to the order taker, saying “Look, I’m a little hard of hearing and I’ve had issues getting pizzas before so please, please, make as much of a racquet as you need to and do NOT stop until I open the door, okay?” The order taker took all of this in good faith and gave the delivery boy the instructions before he left. 

Anthony said, “So this poor kid, Charles I think? Or Chuck? Something like that. He gets on his scooter and he toodles over to this guy’s condo and he rings the bell and doesn’t get an answer. So then he yells ‘Hey I got your pizza!’ and maybe hears like a muffled voice telling him to go away or something. But he thinks this guy is hard of hearing and really wants his pizza so he leans on the doorbell. Understand that this whole story is just Trevor hypothesizing to me later about how it might have gone down. And as he’s telling me this story about how he imagines the kid’s delivery went, he’s laughing so hard he’s about to cry, even though he knows the kid ended up dying. I could have punched him right in the goddamn mouth.”

“I don’t understand how the prank got him killed though? Did the guy shoot him or something, mistake him for an intruder?”

“I’m getting to that. So finally the guy comes to the door, and this is the part Trevor thinks is funniest because his coitus had just gotten interrupted and so he’s obviously horny and sweaty and furious. Calls the kid every name in the book, tells him he got pranked and to get the fuck out.

But see the kid’s pizza parlor has a policy that if you don’t get paid for your pizzas you’re in deep shit. Pizza delivery is a shitty way to make a living--I should know, it’s how I made beer money in college. So the poor kid tries to hold his ground. Says \*somebody\* is gonna have to pay him for the pizza. So that’s when it dawns on this horny asshole who must have pranked him in the first place, and so he gives the kid Trevor’s name and address and says ‘If anyone owes you money, it’s that cuck,’ and slams the door on him. The rest you can probably guess.”

“It’s a stormy night,” I said, “so the kid is trying to ride his scooter in the driving rain way across town and he’s pissed off, probably super amped up, and somehow or another he gets killed right?”

“Slides off the road in the rain, falls down a steep embankment, lands wrong and breaks his neck. It’s actually pretty hard to kill yourself in a scooter accident. I’d have to say Charles or Chuck or whatever was a pretty unlucky young man.”

“Yeah,” I said. “So maybe he has a brother or a friend or something who still thinks Trevor lives here?”

“That’s my guess. Maybe if you can find some way to safely get the kid who is doing this to come look at your ID or something, prove you’re not Trevor?”

“It’s worth a shot. This is getting out of hand.”

“Yeah well. You seem like a good guy. Good luck to you. This is some creepy bullshit, my friend.”

We polished off our drinks and I locked the door behind Anthony.

========

I had uneasy dreams that night. The same dream, more or less, several times and each time I woke up sweaty and clutching at my sheets and screaming. In the dream, I was a schmucky pizza delivery guy named Chuck. “Schmucky Chucky,” was how the other characters in the dream referred to me. I had a little red scooter and hair that wouldn’t quite stay out of my eyes and I wore this godawful white denim  jacket that I thought was fleek as fuck. I got dispatched with five anchovy pizzas on what turned out to be a crank call, and then, as I was driving furiously to go get my money from the prick who made the prank call I lost control of my silly red scooter in the rain and I felt myself falling off the wet scooter seat and tumbling down the cold, wet embankment and I could feel every piece of broken glass and every piece of gravel until I woke up in a cold sweat. 

Halfway through take four of my dream sequence, right as I was pulling my little red scooter out into the street to go get my money from the son of a bitch who had placed the prank call, I heard a furious pounding on my front door.

“HEY WAKE UP SOMEONE OWES ME MONEY FOR FIVE GODDAMN STINKING ANCHOVY PIZZAS AND I’M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT IT.”

I sat bolt upright in bed, a clammy, sweaty mess. I ran my hands through my hair. 

“HEY TREVOR OPEN THE DOOR MAN. BE A MAN AND COME TO YOUR DOOR AND GIVE ME MY MONEY.”

I had a sudden, ghastly realization: a kid like Chucky (and his name WAS Chucky, I was sure of it now, Schmucky Chucky) wouldn’t have anyone in his life who was devoted enough to get vengeance for him from beyond the grave. Probably plenty of people missed him, a few people cried, but nobody was going to don the delivery boy’s uniform and search for justice for him.

The last thing in the world I wanted to do was go open the door, because I suddenly knew what I was going to find there. But I wanted this to end. More than that, I wanted that poor sad-sack to be able to find some peace, if that was possible. So I shrugged. I forced myself to stand up. I made my legs carry me over to my dresser, where I willed trembling hands to pick up my wallet. And then I made the trip down the stairs and to my front door where Chuck was still howling threats and imprecations.

I was pretty glad I’d stopped by the ATM earlier in the week, because if at all possible I wanted to give that poor bastard his money.

I took a deep breath and threw my front door open. I noticed that a driving rain was falling, and that all the streetlights had gone out rendering the night outside my front door a bright black void. I saw a white denim jacket with a Chinese dragon airbrushed on it, but the jacket had seen better days. It was torn and ripped and burnt and through the tears I could see patches of abraded, necrotizing flesh drooping off of bones that jutted and angled in weird directions because they were broken. Chuck’s head was hanging straight down and to the left. He was shivering. His helmet was off. I dreaded what I’d see when he turned around.

“Chuck…” I said softly but that was all I got out before he spun around and drove a scalding hot pizza that smelled of stale grease and rotten fish right into my face. It was like one of those scenes out of an old movie where the lovable rascal hits the pompous douchebag in the face with a pie--only this was a garbage pie and the “lovable rascal” was a bloodthirsty revenant.

“YOU OWE ME 77 dollars and 18 cents ASSHOLE plus I want a TIP for once.”

The shambling, reanimated remains of Schmucky Chucky were incredibly strong. Between the smell of his rotting flesh and the stench of the grease and fish I was struggling not to get sick when he tossed me casually to the ground and jumped on top of me, pinning my shoulders down with his bony, jagged knees.

“I’m not Trevor I’m not Trevor,” I was yelling, spitting out pizza grease and rancid cheese between syllables.

The cheese was dripping on my face, burning and blinding me, and I could barely get my hands up high enough to claw it desperately off my face, away from my nose and eyes. 

“Bullshit! I’m sick of being fooled, bro. I don’t give a shit who you are, all I know is I need my fucking money before I can go back. I’m not gonna have the old man who owns the place yell at me again because our stupid incompetent fucking Debbie answering the phone let herself get pranked….”

“I”ll pay but you have to let me get my wallet.”

“No more tricks,” he yelled, punching down hard and hitting me right in the middle of the chest. I felt the breath swoosh out of my lungs and saw stars. For several seconds I couldn’t talk, couldn’t catch my breath.

“Not so much to say now, huh,” he said, eyeing my kitchen. I saw his eyes fixate on my knife rack. Both eyes were grotesquely bloodshot and his right eye was mostly drooping by its stalk down from the socket, but he seemed to see just fine and a big, goofy grin played upon his face when he saw my big, black handled butcher knife. The grin was almost endearing. But I knew there was nothing endearing about Chuck’s plans for me.

Flesh dropped down from his face like melted cheese as he grinned at me. 

He shoved off from on top of me, kicked me once hard in the ribs, and then as I doubled over, still breathless, he staggered toward my kitchen. I felt close to blacking out, and had to gasp in several harsh lungs full of breath just to try to yell at him. What came out was a hoarse, raspy whisper, “Hey Chuck, here’s my wallet.” I took the wallet I’d grabbed from my dresser and threw it feebly between his feet.

He glared down at it dubiously.

“Open it up. Take what you need,” I wheezed, “I wanna make it right.”

He reached down. “There’d better be enough money in here for 5 16 inch pies AND A TIP,” he bellowed and I realized, with a gut wrenching spasm, that his blood and guts were dripping onto my kitchen floor now as his body decomposed in front of me.

Chucky opened the wallet, and took out 4 20 dollar bills and a 10. “I’m taking a fucking 13 dollar tip, asshole, for all the aggravation you caused me.”

“Take it. Just leave me alone.”

Then he looked down at my driver’s license, surprised, and remarked, “Hey, you’re not Trevor. You’re just some guy. Well fuck you, I’m taking the money anyway. Somebody’s gotta pay for these pizzas so I can rest.” 

“Sure,” I wheezed, “okay that’s fine. I wanna be fair to you.”

“Yeah, fair’s fair,” he muttered, cramming the money into his jacket pocket. He looked with some measure of disgust at the pizza pie congealing on the floor next to me, and then out the door toward his scooter. 

“Hey, uh, I have to be honest bro it took me a minute or two to get all the way over here and I’m not too sure those pizzas are so good anymore. You don’t really want them do you?”

“Nah,” I said, “I just want you to get what’s fair for you and for us both to move on.”

“Yeah that’s cool,” he said, “that’s cool.” His voice was getting weaker and the skin on his face was beginning to droop like the cheese on top of a hot slice of pizza being pulled from a pie. I was in a pretty big hurry for him to leave.

By now most of whatever energy was animating him seemed to have drained from his body, and he ambled to the door much more slowly than he had burst in. Finally he was out on my porch and I shut the door behind him with a sigh of relief. I heard him sigh, too, and a few minutes later when I finally heard his dumb little scooter start up for the last time I cleaned up the pizza on my floor and went to bed."
8t5aez,0,2018-06-22,I [21/f] genuinely don't get jealous of friends or strangers. Is something wrong with me?,kerovcv,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8t5aez/i_21f_genuinely_dont_get_jealous_of_friends_or/,"After weeks of tension and feeling some passive aggression coming from my best friend of 4 years, I finally asked her if everything was alright (because in my mind, nothing had actually happened that would cause someone to act that way). She finally admitted that I didn't do anything wrong but sometimes she couldn't help but be resentful at me because she is jealous of my life. 

I just want to clarify that we both just graduated and are both pursuing our (very different) respective fields and I really believe she is doing extremely well. She is a pre-med student so obviously her career will take a lot more time than mine to fully mature, but I truly admire and respect her career and her accomplishments. Her family is way more well-off than mine is, so it's not like she has had a shitty childhood versus my upbringing. What is weirder is that she is not the only person I have met throughout my life who acts in a toxic manner when jealous of someone else. 

The idea that someone can be put down or negative to others because of jealousy is unfathomable to me. I have been overweight, I went through an ugly duckling phase, I even dealt with years of depression and currently am working through my anxiety issues. I say this because I want to make it clear that I am not a perfect human being, and have - and am currently - overcoming many weak points that I perceive in myself (I consider myself a ""work in progress""). 

Even when I was overweight as a teenager, I never felt nasty to other girls for being prettier or skinnier than me. I realized that this was a ""me"" problem that I had to work on. I don't get people (in particular, a lot of women I have been around) who put down girls' appearances as a way to make themselves feel better. I much prefer the progressive way of trying to improve my own appearance to feel happy, not trying to drag everyone down to my level. 

When I do poorly on an exam that my friend aced, I genuinely feel happy for them because I know that my poor grade is a reflection of me either not studying enough or trying hard enough. It's not like my friend is the reason why I got a bad grade, nor is it the case that only one of us can get the A, so it's not a competition either. 

Same with job interviews or internships. I was very stressed last year for job interviews in a very competitive field, and there were many nights I cried because I was just so stressed out by all the rejections and companies ghosting me. But I still hug and cry (with happiness) for my friends who got the job I didn't get, or the call-back that I got rejected from. Because they also worked very hard, probably cried over it too, and they were able to do something amazing! Why would I be mad at a good friend for achieving something great? If anything, their accomplishments motivate me even more to work harder and recognize my flaws. I admire people who work hard and achieve amazing things. I am happy for people who have even the smallest victories, even if they ""won"" at the same things I ""lost"" at. I have witnessed friends who give the silent treatment or express anger at someone for ""showing off"" their accomplishments, when in reality they are just proud of what they have done. I even know a couple that broke  up because the girlfriend was angry that her boyfriend had gotten into the grad program that she had gotten rejected to. 

Even in relationships, unless someone is blatantly doing something disrespectful, I don't get irrationally jealous about past girlfriends/romances nor do I get jealous if they talk to another woman or have female friends. But maybe that is most of us here. I even had a guy I was seeing comment, ""wow, you really don't get jealous do you?"" after he told me about his ex of 3 years and all the vacations they went on (I asked him to elaborate on all the places he's visited instead of telling him to stop talking about his ex).

Maybe it is because I am brutally honest about myself and I don't try to sugarcoat when I fail or face an obstacle. I have been called really naive and trusting by a lot of people, so maybe that is it too. Or maybe I just go to school with a bunch of really toxic/competitive people. I am sure not feeling jealousy has to be a pretty common thing, but maybe the jealous people are just more outspoken? Any input would be very much appreciated! Thanks :)

**tl;dr: never have felt jealousy or resentment towards others in academic, personal, romantic settings. My peers/friends have demonstrated otherwise in similar situations. Do other people feel the way I do? Is it normal to feel jealous in this way?**"

How should I approach this, to all the current data visualization specialists out there?"

Two internships. I finally graduate with a BS in comp sci. And nobody will fucking hire me.

The biggest fucking hurdle is that most of these jobs requires a security clearance which *I don't have* and the government is backlogged on clearance investigations. So nobody will fucking hire me there.

Second hurdle is that my GPA is shit and I guess it doesn't matter if I actually have decent technical skills because herp derp *you can't possibly be good at coding and have a 2.5 GPA*. Hell, one employer had the gall to *heavily imply* to my face that I was lying on my resume about experience.

Third hurdle is that even if I pass interviews somehow, even if nobody cares about my GPA, even if nobody makes an issue of my lack of a clearance or a clearance doesn't necessarily matter... I still don't get fucking picked anyway! ""I'm sorry, we went with somebody else"". I guess I just fucking suck at interviews.

So why the fuck did I bother going to college? Why do I have this fucking degree? Waste of fucking time. I should have just quit and resigned myself to flipping burgers years ago.

And then just fucking *died* already because I'm diabetic and I seriously doubt I can afford all those medical supplies on cheap labor gigs. (It's a longer and *far* more profane story about my parents that explains how I afforded that shit *during* college)"

On Saturday 5 May 2018, [the previous Government of Democraciv ragequit](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8h93z9/the_legal_end_of_democraciv_mk3/), and we entered the Boring Period of Democraciv. Over two weeks into the Boring Period, [we entered a Constitutional Convention](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8kxs2b/the_mk4_convention_begins/) on Sunday 20 May 2018. Finally, on Monday 16 June 2018, [the Constitution was ratified and accepted](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8rkphu/constitutional_referendum_results/), ending the 42-day-long Boring Period. We now have an allegedly ""better"" Constitution than in previous iterations; will it stand the test of time?

# Political Parties form; only good one is BAD

The introduction of several new parties were announced on the [Party Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8se253/party_megathread/). Only one such faction is good: The Bold Audacious Destruction (BAD) Party, introduced Thursday 21 June 2018, which aims to ""destroy everything in its path"", including ""even our own Cities if we get bored"". According to famous citizen u/LePigNexus, this new party [""can't possibly be a BAD idea.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8sxo7e/forming_of_the_bad_party/e137wqr/) Of course, some other parties have formed this week, including the Unity Party and the Liberal Party (both formed 19 June), the Blood &amp; Iron Party, the People's Party, Los Ingobernable, the Progressive Union, the Celestials (all formed 20 June), the Progressive Industrialists Party and the Anarcho-Syndicalists (both formed 21 June); however, these Parties are barely worth mentioning.

# Fabian Order finds BAD sanctuary; House grieves beige loss

Beloved citizen u/ABigGlassHouse (aka House) formed the [Fabian Order of the Neo Anti-Camerata](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8se253/party_megathread/e12cmx5/) on Thursday 21 June 2018, originally as its own separate Party. The aims of the Order were to ""achieve the goals our members pick not what the game tells us achieve."" House has since joined the BAD Party, which now serves as the Headquarters for the Order. On making the transition through switching roles on Discord, House remarked, ""at least let me enjoy my beige for a little while"", referring to color of the Fabian Order role on the Discord server.

# Multiply-banned citizen Das named Assistant Moderator

Flamboyant citizen u/Darthspectrum (aka Das), infamous for multiple bans in previous iterations of Democraciv, has been named Assistant Deputy Assistant Moderator Intern in Training on the Discord server. Das's place in this position is likely to prove controversial for some, depending on where they fell on the #FreeDas movement. Another question remains on the question of Das's party allegiance. Das joined the Unity Party (which is what Discord continues to recognize); however, Das has been working with the BAD Party as well. Das has expressed interest in being a member of both parties if dual partisanship will be allowed in the new government.

Meier Law University (MLU) [reopened its doors](https://www.reddit.com/r/democraciv/comments/8t545g/meier_law_has_gone_bad/) on Friday 22 June 2018, where it announced that it is now under control of the BAD Party. According to MLU, they will now focus on civil rights, principles over legalism, and the destruction of precedence. Strong statements were issued, in favor of ""free speech and free assembly"" and against ""exact wording and evidence"" in determining rulings. The university is currently accepting enrollment.

# Opinion: We Need Election Schedules BAD!

No official word has yet been announced as to when to expect the upcoming elections under our grand new Constitution. Without any expectation of when elections will be held, activity will disappear out of renewed boredom, and then citizens will miss the elections when they do proceed. Even a tentative schedule would be useful right now. We need election schedules, and we need them BAD! I call upon whoever is in charge to release a schedule."

i was 16. you were 18.


you told me i dropped my phone charger. you thought i might need it for whatever brought me to the city. and that i might need it to charge my phone and text you back after you put your number in it. 

your area code; 650 — i didn’t recognize it.

you were from california. i called connecticut home. i later found out that a flight out of LAX and a connection in chicago brought you to me thousands miles away in new york city. 

i was there for a concert. you were there for an internship interview. we got off the train. walked through the terminal together. clicked the uber button. you were wearing a black sweatshirt. i was wearing a white one. you got into a white corolla. i got into a black suv.

three days have passed. i’ve gone home. only half an hour away from the city. you text me; “and i never learned the name of the lovely girl on the 7:15”

i tell you my name. two days later you’re at my house, two weeks later and you’ve been going back and forth from the city to catch lunch or dinner or to “just see you”, two months later and the internship didn’t work out and you’ve resorted to moving back to palo alto with your parents, two more months pass and after countless nights of staying up to talk into the early hours of the morning and the thousands of text messages you come to visit, two days later and you’re gone again. two weeks later, you tell me you love me, two months later i meet your parents in california. two years later and you’ve been mine for a year and a half. 


two months ago you left. you got an internship. this time across the world. for the us state department. being a foreign officer for the united states in germany. two hours ago you texted me saying how earlier today you were offered a permanent position at the embassy. two hours ago my heart broke. two hours ago your dream turned into my nightmare.

to the boy i met on the 7:15 on january 6th: every night i pray for a miracle and today it came. 

i am hopelessly in love with you. and you’re so aware of this. i hope germany treats you as well as i did. that it looks as good on you as i did on your arm. that it has sunsets you can smile at. that there’s theres a place you can find a good  iced almond milk latte. and that there isn’t anyone that will compare to the girl you met on the 7:15.

The arguments would consist of small things such as me annoying her or just other things around her life annoying her and her getting mad at me not making her feel better the ""correct way"". I have been with my girlfriend for 2 and a half years now and we usually have a period in our relationship where we fight and a period where we aren't fighting and everything goes great. But as of late, the fights between me and my girlfriend have just been toxic to my mental health and my overall well being. The way I feel is as if I am on a tightrope or walking on thin ice with her daily. If one thing doesn't go right for her getting things back to normal would consist of about an hour of fighting 5 minutes of quiet and then her coming back to her regular self and dealing with that time after time has seriously taken a toll on me. I feel like while I can have time to myself and do things alone such as going to the gym or performing other hobbies that I like. Its very hard to tell her I actually want to do things alone. For example, I would tell my girlfriend that I want to go out to the skatepark alone today and maybe skate with a friend of mine. She would tell me its okay and I would head out but about an hour into skating (if I haven't texted her enough) she would blow my phone up saying oh are you having fun without me or things like I'm bored in this house alone. Things like that happen almost every-time I do anything alone that consists of the slightest bit of fun. It is extremely rare for her to give me a little bit of space and time to text her or just be with myself while I am out. My girlfriend has fallen out with her best friend after high school and barely has any friends that she can call or talk to or hangout with. While I don't have many friends I have a couple of friends that I can call or text or hangout with. She constantly compares her social life to mine and says things like 'you are so lucky to have friend's and I wish I could have people to call or text on like you do and I will never have friends"". I try to help her find friends as much as possible like through my friends girlfriends or through social media or anything. Another thing about her is the way that she takes in real advice. For example, she does not have a job (neither do I right now but I start work in July for my internship) and her source of income is through the internet (she sells clothing) and to help her out I gave her some money for buying some clothes and its doing great now but when she would be down and did not have any funds or savings she would not take advice from me for finding a job whenever I would tell her what she would have to do for finding work she would just end it abruptly saying things like ""okay"" or ""its not that easy"" and she doesn't in an effort without me giving her a push for almost everything that she does. She tells me that she has mental illness and depression and social anxiety and I don't treat her wrongly because of it. I try my best to help her with her mental illnesses and how she feels but lately it has been pushing me away and just takes a large toll on my mental wellbeing. She tells me that a regular job just isn't for her and she avoids putting in effort for work one day but then the next day she would tell me how much she wants a job but she doesn't fully go through with the application or interview process(except for one job she applied and interviewed for she is still awaiting the response). Her overall mentality and energy that she puts out to me is just very draining. She makes me feel like if things are going my way and they aren't going her way I should make her feel better or go out my way to do certain things. I have no issue with going out my way to do things with her not at all but I don't feel that same energy on my end. I don't know what to do anymore. I have many more examples of what she does and have it affects me. But even after all of that I still love her and she has played a large part in my life just being there and giving me love. If we do breakup I will inevitably be very very sad for a while getting used to being single. I would most likely spend my time betting myself and doing things that I like. Odd enough although I love her I find myself fantasizing or thinking about other girls but I know for sure I would never cheat on her because of my loyalty and respect and love that I hold for my girlfriend. I just don't know anymore. What should I do? I usually talk things out with her and will most likely will talk to her explaining how I feel but that will also more than likely end up in another draining fight. I feel over it but at the same time I am in love with her. Thank you for all replies and helpful advice :) "

On November 29 2017, POTUS sent out a cryptic Tweet message referring to Morning Joe and the mysterious death of one of his campaign staff interns.

Tragedy happened at one of Rep. Joe Scarborough’s FL campaign offices almost 2 decades ago. That sweet campaign aide was Lori Klausutis-R.I.P.

Post **Q# 1515** on 6/16/18 (in part):

**THE BRIDGE: PODESTA GROUP.**

On July 20, 2001, the dead body of 28 year old Lori Klausutis was found at her place of work. Lori worked for US House Rep. Joe Scarborough at his Ft. Walton Beach office.

Klausutis was a daily runner of 5 miles and the picture of perfect health. Later no drugs or alcohol were found in her system from the autopsy lab results.

Bizarre as it seems, Scarborough had just announced that he would not seek another US House term. This unexpected statement comes on the heels of just again winning re-election.  Psycho Joe claimed then, to need to spend more quality time with his beloved family.

Rumors had swirled around the Florida panhandle, about “affairs” involving  Psycho Joe. Local tales connected past promiscuous activity, as the real reason Joe would never run again. This was contrary to his recent cookie-cutter public announcement about of his family.

Coroner report had Lori passing out due to rare, previously undetected fatal heart condition. This heart condition caused Lori to suddenly fall over, hitting her head on a desk corner, causing her death.

Autopsy could not confirm this rare  “heart issue” in Lori. Primarily because it can only be detected while the heart is beating (victim is still alive). He was able confirmed the head trauma did kill her.

What confounded a local WGTX reporter, was right after being notified of the death, they unexpectedly got official statement given out by Joe and several key staffers. This statement told a narrative that Lori was “very sticky” and not a healthy person.

Psycho Joe and his team were scrambling to build a false narrative about Lori’s “ill health”. This incorrect theme was shot down instantly by the Klausutis family members and her close friends. Scarborough/Aides were then forced to retract their original false public statement concerning Lori.

Dr. Michael Berkland was assigned to perform Lori’s autopsy and had a history of unethical conduct. Berkland was fired within a year due to faulty and incomplete official reports.

In 2008, authorities found a real life “House of Horrors” rental unit by Dr. Berkland. Discovered were various body parts of over 100 different cadavers. Insanely these body parts/organs, were stored in various Tupperware containers, styrofoam cups, and garbage bags.

Odd enough although I love her I find myself fantasizing or thinking about other girls but I know for sure I would never cheat on her because of my loyalty and respect and love that I hold for my girlfriend. I just don't know anymore. What should I do? I usually talk things out with her and will most likely will talk to her explaining how I feel but that will also more than likely end up in another draining fight. I feel over it but at the same time I am in love with her. Thank you for all replies and helpful advice :)"

1. I know the school is known for engineering, but how are the other majors. Mainly I am interested in Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, because I aim to go to med school after.
2. Talking to some of my friends that go there, they tell me the school has a lot of connections. He is majoring in accounting and was telling me about how easy it is to get internships there. Is this true for many of the majors or just accounting.
3. I am a California resident so I know they have the WUE program, but I wanted to know about the other scholarship opportunities they offered. Does the school offer a lot?
4. How is the pre-med crowd there? I was just wondering if there are any clubs and such.
5. Finally, im not sure if any of you remember, but  when you apply to UNR how fast do you hear back from them because apparently UNR has rolling admissions? Also is it true you do not need any essays to apply?

Thanks all to taking the time to read this. If you can give me any information that would be very helpful. Hope you all have a good day."

So I'm currently in the process of applying and have already sent out a few primaries and received some secondaries back. I want to add more schools to my list to improve my chances but I'm having a tough time deciding which schools to add. My cGPA is a 3.97 and my sGPA is 3.78. My MCAT is 504 (125/123/128/128), yeah I suck at CARs but I don't want to take it again. My LOR's are strong and I feel pretty good about my personal statement. I'm also a PA resident if that helps at all. 

As for my ECs, they're pretty interesting. I have over 200+ hours working at the National Aviary as a vet intern (I thought I wanted to pursue veterinary medicine, had a sudden change of heart and here I am. It's explained in my personal statement). I have 400+ hours of volunteering in different areas, including undeserved and impoverished communities. I worked as a tutor for the past two years at my university so I have around 300+ hours doing that. Unfortunately, I have a small amount of research experience, but I worked in two different entomology labs. Also, I currently work as a PCT so I'm fastly racking up hours of clinical experience (applied with 200). And lastly, I had an internship at my local hospital last summer where I gained 500+ hours of shadowing across 10 different specialities of medicine. (there are some other miscellaneous things I've done, but these are the important ones)

I've applied to mostly DO schools and a few lower tier MD schools as well. I wanted to add a few more and was looking for some suggestions for both types of schools. 

DO School List

PCOM

LECOM (both campuses)- secondary received

VCOM (Auburn and VA)- secondary received

RowanSOM

NSUCOM

MD School List

Drexel

Penn State

WVU

Geisinger Commonwealth 

Please, please, tell me which other ones are worth adding to my list and that I actually have pretty good chances at.

Thank you!!!"

I would go crying to my parents, but they would always go easy on you, since you were the big star quarterback who was going to a big state school. 

Your first year of college, you would come back to visit every break, but as time went on, you were distracted by internships and jobs and your fraternity and your many girlfriends, so you came back home less and less. So, you didn't see much of me anymore. You couldn't see the way I was transforming myself, so that neither you nor any other boy could ever push me around again.

8ta6bz,10,2018-06-23,[All Spoilers] Why Kuvira was literally never wrong,IamDaEmper0r,TheLastAirbender,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/8ta6bz/all_spoilers_why_kuvira_was_literally_never_wrong/,"&gt;And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.

John F. Kennedy.

To me the above quote represents all of what Kuvira stood for. Now while I am obviously be hyperbolic, I feel that a lot has been said of Kuvira being Fascist or Authoritarian. However I believe that this is fundamentally wrong, and will now set out to prove it, by going through those things that people point to as bad an explain how they are blown out of proportion to character assassinate this great Patriot.

#####Political Dissidents and Reeducation Camps

So we repeatedly see the claim from the Beifongs, starting in S4E1, that Kuvira operates Reeducation Camps something she confirms. However I would rather ask you this. Is it wrong that she is operating reeducation camps? To us it might seem self-evident from the story, however this largely from framing. We in the whole of the show are only ever told about these camps, by refugees, Beifong and Kuvira, when she is threatening people. However all of these sources are biased in one way or another to rely on them for information is just blatant favouritism.

So while we might conclude that there are camps, we can't really conclude anything further about them. In fact, I would go further and say that they are at least all right, considering the fact the refugees are clothed, and appear to be fed enough to lay traps and bend, which being a martial art should be hard for a starving person. This is coupled by the fact that Kuvira sends Bolin to one, considering the fact that Kuvira being in what amounts to a Civil War, is probably short on manpower, these reeducation camps are likely primarily camps for military personal to be reeducated into being productive soldiers once again. This also makes even more sense considering the fact that she is in the habit of recruiting former bandits, who dont make the most reliable of troops, as the Soviet Red Army learnt after the Miracle on the Vistula.

Furthermore, on political dissidents in general, there are only two real sets of enemies that we see fighting Kuvira. The first of these are Bandits, on which we will talk later. And the second are separatists. Firstly, I will refer you to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-FNPuIM9jg). The video points out several structural issues with the Earth Kingdom. As far as we can tell the Earth Empire is largely an attempt to deal with these, and one key part of that is the absolute control over the States. We see this with Kuvira's subjugation of the State of Yi, which has vital ore mines, and later with the Conquest of Zaofu, which likely has similar resources considering the amount of platinum it has, and just general technological innovation. This fits with the general strategy of Kuvira which is about political centralism. 

Now any historian will tell you that the rise of nation states is most closely linked with the rise of strong central governments, see most clearly in France, where they ran an almost 150 year long campaign against languages other than Parisian French, so as to increase centralism. Similarly, the most successful states in history have been those that are centralised, France being a prime example, in its fights with decentralised Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire, or in Avatar, the Fire Nation vs Everyone Else. In this pattern her crushing of those who oppose this centralism is merely a part of her campaign for Earth Nation strength. And for we as the audience to oppose this strengthening would fundamentally be anti-democratic, considering the fact that all Earth Nation people we see support it, with the only support for the Royals being in Republic City, and even then that's not even so certain considering the Kuvira T-Shirts were selling. In fact I would argue that in this case, Suyin is a colossal Hypocrite, considering the fact that she talks at length about not imposing her views, which seems rich as most people Kuvira imposes her centralism on welcome it, because fundamentally the centralism is just good government.

#####Weapons of Mass Destruction

Now in the real world, the creation of superweapons is often seen as an act of provocation in and of itself. However, after Varrick has probably the best line in the series, the reaction of the council tells differently for the Avatar world. No one on the council bats an eyelid about a ""Dictator"" with what amount to nukes. This would indicate that the creation of superweapons is okay in the Avatar world, something confirmed by the fact Raiko wants Varrick to make more of them. So this point can hardly be held against her, if the only person really objecting to superweapons is Varrick, who by the way has previously attempted to foster wars to line his own pockets, so how do we know this isnt the same. Because he tells us?

Furthermore, her use of the superweapons is incredibly Humane. To give an example, we first see the Spirit Cannon attached to an artillery piece. Now if she had been the cruel tyrant the protagonists want you to believe she is, she would have just created two or three or four more of those cannons and then used them to just pummel the city into submission. However, no she creates the giant Mecha, and then is able to use the spirit cannon as a precise weapon and destroy the invading Fire Nation fleet. Similarly, when the Airbenders intervene in the affairs of a foreign nation, she is forced to use the cannon as she has little else to possibly defend herself. Now, you might say ""well DaEmper0r, what about the fact she is using it on a city she probably believes to be full of people"" and I would answer that that didn't stop Harry S. Truman when he dropped the Atomic Bombs. Sometimes hard leaders must make hard decisions to prevent an overall loss of life, and this can be seen in the fact that the spirit cannon only continues to be used after ""Team Avatar"" refuse to accept the agreement between the Illegitimate Government of the False State of United Republic and the Great Uniter. So really any further deaths after the surrender are on ""Team Avatar"" not on Kuvira.

#####Nationalism and Republic City

One of the most bizarre parts of the fandom is the fact that people side with the United Republic against its legitimate owner. To make you understand how bizarre this is let me make an analogy. The Fire Nation's actions during the hundred years war are clearly based on the IRL actions of Japan from the Meji Restoration to 1945. Similarly, the Earth Kingdom is based upon Korea and China in terms of history and the like. Now IRL the last strong ruler of China was [Empress Dowager Cixi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi), and after she died 3 years later [Emperor Puyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyi) takes the throne, we will likely talk more about this later, but for now it is relevant to know that Puyi ruled as puppet Emperor in Manchukuo, a state really controlled by the Japanese, who brought in settlers to colonise the area. Now to a Chinese Person hearing this show lecture them about why it is essentially wrong to take back their sovereign land would seem like you were a Japanese Hyper-Nationalist, and you would be a Japanese Hyper-Nationalist, because **no one** in the west complains about the fact that the Japanese settlers were deported back to Japan.

Thus to Kuvira and the Earth Empire, the bleating about Republic City is total ignorance to the 100 years of hardship of that the Fire Nation imposed upon the Earth Kingdom. Basically, you can't show me ATLA and then turn around in TLOK and say ""Do you know what Imperial Japan wasn't so bad"". What makes this even worse is that Republic City is a rip off of New York City, and America in general, and I don't need to remind you what the Americans did to the Native Americans. 

What makes this even worse is that the entire council seems to be completely ignorant as well. So at the end of Season 1, a presidential republic is created. This is a clear violation of Earth Kingdom sovereignty, as the United Republic only exists because the Earth King, Fire Lord and Avatar agree to let it exist. So when does the Earth Queen agree to this move? Never in the whole show, in fact she comments how she will take it back. So the rest of the cast have given a clear and reasonable Casus Belli to Kuvira, and then what, expect her not to take it? This is further compounded by the intervention scene. For those who don't remember, this is when Varrick and Bolin bring the news of the Superweapon, the Fire Lord says she wont intervene citing the platitude of ""waa waa we fought dumb dumb wars"" instead of the far better reason why the shouldn't invade. Namely, that the only people with the forces to invade are the Fire Nation, and the Fire Nation invading is literally Hundred Years War 2.0 Electric Boogaloo, and would hand Kuvira the best possible propaganda victory in the history of ever. What makes this even worse is that Riako and the rest of the world leaders don't even realise this very obvious fact, the idiots.

#####Ethnic Cleansing

Another remarkable accusation is that of ethnic cleansing. Firstly there is the obvious fact that why should we trust the word of one group of people, over another, i.e. the Refugees vs Kuvira. To say nothing of the fact that IRL this happened, and it is called the Expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe, or the Japanese Repatriation from Huludao. Thus in terms of stuff that have happened IRL this is hardly remarkable or even that bad, due to the fact that IRL it is a literal war crime to settle people in occupied territory, and after occupations end *normally* said settlers are repatriated. 

Secondly, we have the scene in S4E7 ""Reunion"" when they accuse Kuvira of locking up foreigners. Now when else is this mentioned? For the life of me I can't find another place, and as we have already established there is a good reason to intern Fire Nation settlers, so why not for water benders? Now looking at the scene they say they are from a prison/reeducation camp, this means they were either in her army, or they were bandits. This means that that group of ""refugees"" are really either criminals or deserters, who are also criminals, hardly people to feel sympathy for. This also fits with the fact that they are all youngish, the kind of people to be bandits or soldiers. So again on this count Kuvira is blameless.

#####Slave Labour

Again this accusation is moronic. Kuvira has been fighting what amounts to civil war for the last 3 years, her likely using corvee labour seems logical, as her army is meant to be conscripts, something I can believe due to Earth Kingdom military history. If she is short on cash, which she probably is maintaining the most advanced army in the world, she will probably have to break a few eggs to make a good new omelette. So it is clear that her ""slave labour"" is little more than her desire to give work to the jobless, due to the devastation wrought by bandits, and the desire to see the modernisation of the Earth Empire, i.e. creation of Railways or modern farms. Furthermore, Corvee labour is a form of tax in kind, which considering the fact that during civil war's money often loses all value, means its probably the only way to continue the war machine. This basically means she is blameless on the count of slave labour.

#####Autocracy

Another complainant often seen is that of her being a dictator. And firstly, up until the declaration of the Earth Empire she is at best a Commander-in-Chief, so yeah of course she will not be very diplomatic. Secondly, the only time we see her interacting with civilians is the T-shirt scene and near the end of S4E1. This both share the key feature that every civilian loves her, people taking and wearing shirts with her face on them, and you literally just see cheering crowds, in Yi. Furthermore, she still allows the local governor to keep control, even though he is a moron, so she can hardly be said to be an autocrat, if not only do the people love her and support her decisions, but she keeps the native power structures intact. Sure she isn't democratic but remember this is during the middle of 3 years of civil war, IRL almost all governments have things called States of Emergency when a leader is granted Emergency Powers, this is little different. Similarly, when the Earth Empire is declared, she doesn't crown herself, indicating that whatever system should would eventually create is not a hereditary monarchy. This is in stark contrast to Zaofu, which despite preaching about how Monarchy is outdated, is still a hereditary dictatorship, due to the fact that it is the personal property of the Beifong Family. So she can hardly be blamed for not practising western style democracy, during a civil war, and in a country were the only democratic state is an illegal separatist state.

Furthermore, when Prince Wu decides to abolish the monarchy and create independent democratic states, I was just sat there thinking ""Bryke can't be this stupid can they?"". Because fundamentally, there has been one democratic state, United Republic, which season 1 is entirely focused on showing how it has failed, so can hardly be called well functioning. Similarly, IRL when a similar thing happened we got the rise of Hitler. A country which for most of its history has been united under a single ruler, while decentralised, will still tend towards that. This is further confirmed by the fact that nowhere in either shows do we get any sense that different parts of the Earth Kingdom/Empire want to be independent, that retard Governor is just that a retard, whose people disagree with him. Thus in actuality that scene is basically Wu consigning his Country to another 3 years plus of civil war, as copycats of Kuvira rise from her former supporters to continue the goal of national self-strengthening. This won't be balanced out by the fact that the Avatar supports this retard move, because as we see in the series Kuvira's supporters are fine with her beating the crap out the Avatar, and those people won't just disappear.

#####The Abolition of the Monarchy

This now brings us neatly onto her first crime that we actually see on screen. Her Abolition of the Monarchy. Most simply, Wu is a moron, his entire arc is about him accepting the fact that he is a moron. So why are we meant to think that her getting rid of a retard is bad? In fact it goes further, the fact of the matter is that Hou-Ting is clearly based on Empress Dowager Cixi, and Wu is based on Emperor Puyi. Both these people IRL are hated by pretty much everyone in China, with Puyi being regarded more favourably, but more out of pity. So me as a historically literate person I cheer on Wu's removal from the throne, he is a petulant moron, whose IRL counterpart sold his country out to the Japanese. Similarly, Cixi IRL basically led her country into total chaos that was only solved by the actions of Mao Zedong. And what ever you have to say about the Glorious Revolution, Mao Zedong was the only one who was capable of driving the Japanese into the sea and creating an actually functioning state, unlike the Nationalists, who dont even have a parallel in Korra. So really her abolition of a system that clearly didnt work is a mark in her favour.

This also brings me then onto why I think Raiko really wanted Kuvira out. Prince Wu is planned to be crowned in United Republic, not in Ba Sing Se, which to me clearly shows the intentions of Raiko and the other world leaders. They don't want the Earth Kingdom to be strong, they want it to be controlled by them. They ultimately want to crown a puppet, a puppet who then decides to get rid of the Earth Kingdom all together, which is literally the best possible thing for Raiko. Any sane person knows that those states are going to fall into a brutal civil war. This will mean that United Republic will not only be able to preserve its existence, but also sell weapons to all the different sides, and make a killing off the conflict. Prince Wu has in essence sold his country out to foreign powers that want to exploit it for resources, and to get a quick buck.

#####Baatar Jr.

Another key scene that is cited as against Kuvira is when she attempts to kill ""Team Avatar"", along with her fiance Baatar Jr. However this really only confirms that she is willing to sacrifice anything for her Nation. By this point, Raiko has surrendered. ""Team Avatar"" as a result are violating the wishes of all parties with any authority, and needlessly extending a conflict, for no other reason than they think that Kuvira is a bad person. And into this we get the scene where Korra threatens Baatar with what amounts to torture for the rest of his life. Now he then breaks and attempts to get Kuvira to call off the invasion, but Kuvira as seen with crying and then fires the Spirit Cannon upon the position. To me this clearly indicates that Kuvira is willing to sacrifice everything for the dream of a strong and united Earth Empire. She is willing to sacrifice her future happiness for that of the Nation, if that is not dedication to the cause I don't know what is. 

This is also to say nothing of the fact that Baatar kinda acts like a complete wimp in the face of the weakest torture ever, I mean this is a guy who runs a highly organised military machine, for him to break so quickly is stupid. So this again is a point in her favour as it clearly just shows she is willing to sacrifice her own happiness for that of her People. 

#####""Team Avatar""

I have already spoke at length about how ""Team Avatar"" have violated the sovereignty of the Earth Kingdom/Empire. But I will now talk about the facts of her surrender and some crucial details that it reveals. Immediately after he capture, the first indication of the response of her Soldiers is to continue fighting, this goes directly against the lies given to us by Suyin, where she says that Kuvira's conscripts will fall apart without their leader, this is disproved by the one scene that we are given, of her post-capture. Arguably also the extent to which Wu is harrassed, which we get no indication is caused by Kuvira, also demonstrates this loyalty. Which makes perfect sense, her soldiers like being commanded by a Winner who has been making the Earth Kingdom strong.

What it does reveal however is that Suyin and Opal, by association, are full of BS. This further corroborated by the fact that they are hypocrites, criticising Monarchs whilst simultaneously owning an entire city as personal property. The basic effect of this is that we can't actually trust anything that Suyin or the Beifongs say about Kuvira, as it comes from people that we know to be consistently hypocritical and wrong. 

Which leads us to ask, why in the hell is Korra listening to them? And the answer is simple. She is completely and utterly the worst Avatar. She systematically favours her friends over everyone else, she barely attempts to reason with Kuvira, the extent of these attempts to create a peaceful settlement are pitiful, and she fails to recognise the fact that the creation of the Presidency is a clear violation of the Sovereignty of the Earth Kingdom. In all of this Korra comes out looking very very very badly, I mean in essence she is siding with the Settler State against the country whose land has been stolen, because at the end of the day we have no evidence that Kuvira is performing genocide or ethnic cleansing as I have previously pointed out.

Finally, there is Kuvira's surrender, and she decides to, despite all the above issues, still try and prevent any further violence, because she realises that the ""Avatar"" is just such a moron who has no concept of justice, that anything she does will just fail, as this idiot will attempt to stop all of it.

So this is literally just ""Team Avatar"" being entirely in the wrong, throughout the whole of season 4

#####The Good Stuff She has done

Now onto why you should support her, and I for this I have made a short bullet list:

* Creates a highly centralised state during a civil war, an amazing achievement in and of itself
* Is able to continue and expand Research and Development into new technologies during a civil war, again amazing
* Destroys the bandits that were ravaging the Earth Kingdom
* Creates the most modern army on the planet during a civil war, again an amazing achievement
* Reunites her country which has basically been falling apart since the Hundred Years war, in **3** years as well
* Liberates Ba Sing Se, a city the size of small country, with a tiny army, this is more than Azula, a warrior trained from Birth with a colossal army, is able to do.
* Solves a massive famine crisis, caused by the Banditry, as shown in Yi.
* Abolishes the Monarchy, and presumably the Feudal Structures of the Earth Kingdom.
* Provides employment to large numbers of people, through the army, that will provide them with vital skills once they demobilise.
* Creates a government that is actually able to govern, unlike the United Republic, which caves to the demands of terrorists, or the Earth Kingdom
* Has utterly [Chad Aesthetics](https://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/Animetiddie+used+roll+pictureanimetiddie+rolled+image+not+even+gonna+lie+_ab99b0f40164287b9a38df02f9f89a50.jpg)

So really what is there to dislike?

###Conclusion

Now, it should be noted this is only semi-serious, and I am not actually advocating for military dictatorship. More it was an exercise in demonstrating how Bryke utterly failed in show don't tell, as they told us throughout season 4 that Kuvira is a bad guy^TM but none of this bad stuff actually happens on screen. Similarly it was also to point out the fact that the story as it stands has some really unfortunate implications, namely that China/Korea should be spilt up, apologism for the effects of Japanese Imperialism, promotion of settler states, and a defence of the last Qing emperors. Really this is more than anything this is born of my frustration at the focus on completely trivial and useless diversions to the story, such as S4E8 ""Remembrances"", when that time could have been spent on showing us the audience why Kuvira is bad, instead of telling us what happened in season 1-3. To me fundamentally, I don't see how one can have watched ATLA, come to TLOK, knowing even the most basic stuff about Chinese History, and not be offended.

But overall remember that [without Kuvira there would be no new earth empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tCMI0uKbBE)"

8tae1c,1,2018-06-23,Theory - Oda's foreshadow on Shank's background,boyplunger56,OnePiece,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/8tae1c/theory_odas_foreshadow_on_shanks_background/,"Did anyone remember this guy? ROCKSTAR - https://imgur.com/a/Dw01wyI

In chapter 907, we were introduced to a pirate captain/crew called Rocks that was ruling the sea before Roger's time and it was this captain/crew that made Garp famous. And we ended with Shanks wanting to talk about a particular pirate. 

Rocks, other than being speculated by many to be consisting of initials of kaido, charlotte, shiki/shakky and etc is an eeriely familiar name that dates almost 700 chapters.

Just to clarify, the pirate captain/crew mentioned in chapter 907 is ROCKS and not ROX, if you wish to doubt this. Because in Japanese manga, Rocks was written as ロックス - https://imgur.com/a/G0eo44E

And Rockstar name in  japanese is ロックスター, therefore it is ROCKS. 

It has always been funny to me as to why Oda introduced this character rockstar who seems to be out of place. Rockstar is also one of the rare red hair character similar to Kidd and Shanks. Could Rockstar be actually used by Oda to tell us the relationship between Shanks and Rocks? Given the age of Shanks and that he is an intern on Roger's ship, it is possible to assume that Shanks could be the son of Rocks who is also a red hair. 

It fits that bill that a legendary yonkou like Shanks is the son of the legendary captain/crew Rocks and Oda foreshadowed it since chapter 264 when Rockstar was introduced. another OMG moment.

Let me know what you think as always :D"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

* **Enemies: Michigan**  
  
* Other contributions we can use on top of your action votes each day is memes and recruiting. If you know other Badger redditors or where they gather please encourage them to join in the game. Our power seems to have plateaued and we'll need more as end of game approaches. If memes are your thing the meme game in /r/CFBRisk is as strong as anywhere on reddit. Please throw some memes together to support Wisconsin and Team Red (WI, NE, AL, TX A&amp;M, tOSU, OK, Stanford, and Virginia Tech).  
  
* Please Keep Recruiting! Every soldier we can get is one we can use somewhere! Don't make alternate accounts or bots to vote for us but if you can convince your friends to help out we would appreciate it! Your Facebook group chats, discords, twitter, anywhere you think we will have sympathizers.  
  
**New Developments:**  
  
* We held Rutgers and snagged Syracuse again, so we are back up to 2 on a choke point with the North Eastern Peninsula. Situation is still tense but we have some breathing room and an elimination is VERY unlikely.  
   
* If you are just joining us today DEFEND RUTGERS     
  
* Orders will be going out shortly but there may be a 2nd order later for people to swap.  
  
* Alabama sits in both the Midwest and on Florida's door step, they are in an interesting spot for decisions.
  
* Michigan went hard to try to kill us last turn, and it didn't pay off. Now they have Alabama and VT and Ohio on many of their borders. They lost quite a bit of ground, so preoccupying them is a big improvement for the red alliance! Clemson squeezed out South so they can't get crushed and GT has consolidated it's land. Florida continues to dance out West and Texas got a bit stronger. Chaos gained a lot of land quick but they are in the west and won't affect us.  A&amp;M and Oklahoma are stabilized.  
  
* If you aren't on the PM bot, and want to be, please message us!     
  
* In the event Wisconsin is eliminated we are not sure what path we will take. We WOULD ask that everyone keeps playing, be it as chaos to sabotage the blues or as a blue player. The reason for this is to 1) help our alliance at least win, and 2) help people gain more turns played for awards and a potential bonus next season for playing a long time in this one.  
  
* Job. So my internship started Monday, and as such the way orders getting messaged out will be at essentially one of 3 times. It could be in the morning before 8 A.M., during the noon lunch hour, or after I get back from work. The goal is to have the first of the 3, and then noon, and then Worst case is right after work. We have been working with Red Command to streamline the process so you can get your orders as soon as you can.  "

I’m 23, live in NYC without parents, just got my master’s, working on my CPA, have an offer from a big 4 to start in fall full time. To give a timeline:

-	Summer before senior year - start at media company
-	Fall of senior year - continue at media company, go through acquiring a bunch of others 
-	Spring of senior year - supposed to do tax internship, stays at media company practically full time because lead on bringing over acquired companies from data to processes
-	Summer after senior year - leave media company to do summer internship at big 4, get offer, sure
-	Start of fall grad school - start full time at old media company with them knowing I have big 4 following fall
-	Graduate grad school - submit my end date
-	Today - boss makes an offer for me to stay on for 2 years, she can sign off on my CPA hours and I get more control of process areas, could pay back big 4 for owed fees and possibly get raise 

Dilemma: I don’t care about accounting in the slightest and to me, they’re both jobs to pay my bills. Staying sounds advantageous as we are a media company, we’re doing some pretty big things and the industry I ultimately wish to be in is media or at least, that’s where my passions lie. But I also have hated this place for 2 years of my youth and although things are getting better, it’s slow and requires more patience than I have at the moment. Going big 4 however isn’t anymore enticing as I’m 90% sure they placed me in FS and I can make it with just about any team but then I’m going to have to work extra hard to find the media client manager to poach me. All of my connections at the firm either don’t work in the industry I want or are in Jersey. The main draw of going to big 4 is that I can transfer to ATL which is where I want to end up, networking isn’t the worse thing in the world and if I can get into consulting/advisory, then I could definitely do it for a couple years with little problem. 

Realistically, I could stay in audit for about 5-10 years. Nope I haven’t gone through a busy season and no I’m not overassessing my abilities. I’m annoyed and burnt out now so I very well could see myself half way through busy season not caring and quitting. But I survive close every month and post close which takes up the rest of the month so thinking a 5 month burst isn’t the worse. There’s also the fact I don’t mind long work hours, it’s not a threat in my relationship (at the moment), and ultimately for about 3 years they expect me to be an absolute idiot.

The big things that separate them are as follows:

-	Media: already surrounded by the people and in the industry I want. Have the ability to make changes and implement policies as well as layout of our accounting system (we’re going through some changes). Have the potential to be in contact with big names and get adequate attention/Help/feedback with my actual interests in entertainment. Also could probably get them to sponsor my endeavors as a revenue line for them. But because of rebranding, no one knows who we are and internally we’re a shit show. 
-	Big 4: ability to get international clients, ability to go into consulting/advisory, ego check (start at the bottom, work up, no need thinking I’m bigger than I am), ability to transfer to ATL with my partner, travel, network, ease of finding a new job after. 
-	 should add the fact that while I have the ability to do these things from Big 4, I am in no way guaranteed any of it. They will put me where necessary and moving requires a need in ATL that I can fill better than anyone from there so toss up of can go and run into dead ends. But name will carry far.

He responded well to this, but for the remainder of the session was still somewhat closed off. Any solution focused questions I asked were met with ""I don't know.""  and ""I have no idea.""

8tc2j6,1,2018-06-23,I am collapsing,justembers,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8tc2j6/i_am_collapsing/,"There are different kinds of depression. There's the depression of having a decent life, but being hopeless and miserable. I had that when I was younger and overcame it to some degree. Then there's the depression of being in a truly grim, hopeless place and feeling despair because you don't see any way forward. That's where I am now.

30 ish years old. Roughly a decade of college hopping, modest degree in IT support. Graduated three years ago. Childhood abuse means that while I can mostly function normally, I get stressed/start to panic easily, especially in new situations, and when I do, I shut down. This makes me look like a moron in every interview I do, because I can't communicate the knowledge I easily could if I was talking to a friend. I've measured it: with the shit jobs I DO get, it usually takes me a full month to ""unthaw"" and relax. So I fuck up the few interviews I get. I fucked up the internship-to-hire that was amazing that I got out of college because after training finished I was dumped into:

-talk to people on the phone all day (I'm terrible with people which is why I went for IT)  
-helping them fix a system you barely understand  
-And also the stakes are huge because these are big companies and big contracts  

I fell apart and quit instantly. Too much, too fast.

So I failed out of the internship. Failed out of almost every interview. Got one temp contracting job I was fired from a month early because they expected me to know everything despite it being literally my first job in the industry. There are maybe 2 jobs a month listed in my field locally, and almost no bites for interviews. When I do interview, my awkwardness aside, it's clear they want someone already established in the industry. ""entry level"" doesn't exist.

So I've lived with my mom and scraped by for 3 years supporting us with whatever shit job I can find. Dishwasher, cleaner, janitor, cashier. It's a delicate balance working these without them grinding into my mental issues and making me collapse completely. I'm managed it, mostly, so far, but that's nearly miraculous, as it could collapse at any moment.

I mostly work at this point to get my mom to social security in a few years, so she'll be self-supporting. After that, what's the point?

I think of all the time and money I wasted on college. I think of how I'm still so fucked up and isolated socially. I think about how pathetic I am for still living at home. I think about how I have no way forward, no way to meaningfully improve myself or my situation. I'll be doing this until something big goes wrong, medical, mental, accident. And with zero margin for error, I'll be on the street. 

And I want to kill myself. 

There's nothing left. There's nothing I can do. There's no life I can ""settle"" for, and no way to recover. The Red Queen in Through the Looking Glass famously remarks that you have to run as fast as you can to stay in the same place. I have to run as fast as I can just to slow my acceleration backwards, to slow down the collapse a little. I've been running for 14 years now, dragging through college, dragging through the job market. But eventually I won't be able to run anymore, because people can't run forever. Running is a temporary burst to escape the predator. Eventually you have to either escape or collapse and let it eat you. "

Then summer started a few weeks ago and everything got much better. I will have to share my slutty weekend in Chicago, but here is when I first hooked up with a summer intern.  

A couple of weeks ago on a Monday I checked grindr at work and there was a 19 year old boy 200 feet away. I blocked most of the guys on grindr that are near me at work as I don't want some closeted middle-aged coworking to hit me up but of course I left a cute 19 year old on. He hit me up and started chatting.  His grindr stats are real good: 5'9"", top, toned, vers top. He is interning for the summer at another company in my building. He asked if I had more pics and I told him just to meet me in the ground floor lobby and let's take a walk around the building. He said sure, and 10 minutes later he and I met up in person.  

He's even cuter in person and is a little cocky and kind of a bro. He was wearing khakis and a polo shirt and says he can't talk for long as it was his first day but he wanted to meet me in person. He has buzzed blonde hair and looks like he plays lacrosse or something. He's going to be in town for the summer and doesn't know anyone. I could feel my dick getting hard as he was checking me out. I'm 24, blonde and am starting to get some muscles on me. I felt some sexual tension, and when we got into the elevator he just looked me and gave me a deep kiss and grabbed my ass.  

I went back to work with a hard dick and couldn't think of much else. I had a deadline so I was off grindr most of the day but when I logged back on at 4pm the intern had asked if I wanted to hang out after work. He was leaving the office at 5pm so I told him to come over to my place. I left at 4:30 to go home, clean up and shower. I just changed into a jockstrap, shorts and a tshirt.  

When he got to my apartment at 5:15 he didn't waste any time and immediately made out with me. We were making out on my couch, and he pushed me onto my back and lifted my legs and was grinding up against me. He was still wearing his khakis and polo so I took off his polo. He had a really nicely defined chest. I undid his belt and got his pants and boxers off, and his hard six inch dick sprung out. It was real hot. I tried to suck it and he told me not to because he hadn't got off in four days and would cum immediately. I told him that was fine if he could cum twice and he said he was going to but didn't want to cum in my mouth. On prep and loving cum in my hole, I hoped that meant he wanted to cum somewhere else.     

He stood me up and asked where the bedroom was, and I took him to my room where I had lube, condoms and poppers out on the bed. He bent me over the bed and started lubing up my hole with his fingers. I normally don't like fingers in me and just tongues and dicks but I was so horny for this guy he could've put anything in me. Without asking me if I wanted it raw or with a condom, I saw him lubing up his raw dick. I was fully bent over the bed when I felt his dick against my hole. He was kind of thick and I had to focus on breathing as it hurt a little bit and he was really eager and wanted to get his dick in really quick. I told him to slow down, and he just moaned really loudly and said he was cumming.  

I felt my ass get completely warm and some of his cum spilled out as he was only a couple of inches in. Wow. Never had that happen with a guy before.    

The intern pulled out and I stood up, and he didn't seem embarassed or anything and just laughed and said we weren't done yet. He didn't get soft and put me on my back and entered me missionary immediately. Now that I was slick with his cum , he slid in all the way really easily and it felt really good. His entire body had changed. Before he was just a clumsy 19 year old needing to cum, and now he was a really good fuck who knew how to get me to moan. He figured out almost immediately that I liked it a little rough and started grabbing my neck and talking dirty. I know I kept moaning as he was getting me really turned on.  

A few minutes in the intern took my dick out of my jockstrap and started jerking me off while he was fucking me and I had to tell him to stop before I cum. He asked if I could cum twice and I told him maybe but my hole gets real sensitive. He just smiled and kept slowly jerking me off as he was fucking me. In just a few seconds I had a really fucking mind-blowing orgasm and my cum shot up over my head.   

He kept his dick in me and just started making out with me. This was a weird sensation as usually I want the dick out of me as soon as I cum, but he was just slowly moving back and forth in just a way that it didn't feel weird. The intern took some of my cum off my body and had me lick it off his fingers. This was also weird as normally after I cum I don't want anything to do with cum, mine or anyone else's but somehow it was hot. Then when he was pulling his dick mostly out of my body he used the rest of my load to slick up his dick. I think he realized my body could take it so he just started fucking me again.  

It felt like a completely different fuck again, now that he was really horny and I had just cum so I was working back up into the moment. He kept me on my back and kept fucking me and I was getting more and more turned on. I don't know how long he fucked me but it felt so amazing, and I was wrapping my legs around his back and making out with him and telling him to fuck me harder and harder. He kept hitting just the right spot on my prostate and I was moaning louder than I have in a very long time. He told me to start jerking off as he was close, and as he was fucking me I was jerking my dick. I could tell he was getting close and that turned me on, and I let myself go over the edge and I started cumming a second time in 20 minutes. My cumming set him off and he bred me a second time.  

We made out a little more, and he pulled his now soft dick out of my ass. The intern looked over at the clock and said he had to get home in time for dinner. I thought he was just here for the summer, and he told me that he told me that he is staying with his conservative aunt and uncle for the summer, and that they don't know he's gay and asked him if he was going to find a girlfriend this summer. He told me they invited a 20 year old girl from their church over for dinner to meet him tonight.  

He washed his dick off in the bathroom, put back on his khakis and polo and headed out the door. I was still really horny in my jockstrap so I got a butt plug and played with my cum-filled hole thinking of how hot that was before I came a huge third load."

8tct9i,33,2018-06-23,I AM OUT!,lardos123,callcentres,https://www.reddit.com/r/callcentres/comments/8tct9i/i_am_out/,"Thank you so much for the support on this subreddit. I accepted a paid internship at the age of 24 that will allow me to work what I love after - digital marketing in a very innovative small business.

Today, I handed in my notice and my final day will be on the 29th this month after a year and 8 months.

The senior manager’s look was “oh another one”, and her words were “we really hate you to go, but you have to do what’s best” in a very fake way.

I am so glad that this is gone. 

Now to tell you a bit more about my decision. 

I went on my two weeks vacation from this place and decided to travel to Texas and see my friends and meet new people. I went to San Antonio, Houston and Austin (I currently live in Newcastle, United Kingdom)

It was amazing and made me realise how small these call centres look in my eyes now. There is someone (your manager) that picks on you and makes you feel little in order to make you overthink situations so they own you. 2 weeks off and I grew so much in regards of my confidence. I can now focus on better things, travel more and see my family who live abroad. 

Life completely changed when I handed in my notice today. I feel present now and less depressed.

# FAQ (for mobile users)

&gt;**What accent is that?**

I'm Asian but English is my native (and only) language. The ""accent"" is just rhotacism, or a difficulty with pronouncing certain ""r"" sounds, and a bit of a lisp.

&gt;**Do you take requests?**

Feel free to send me requests! However, **I don't currently plan to post ramblefaps or extreme fdom.** Other than that, let me know what you'd like to hear from me!

&gt;**Do you do Skype/phone sex?**

I do not! I do [take commissions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSaPWkFddZKiiCeMAWBSJ1hW0JAgRvpcHaKZBteeDygQjOaQ/viewform?usp=sf_link), though.

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this.

He was supposed to be working like a restaurant job for the summer, and so once they left he was saying how we could take a couple of road trips together and what not, visit him in his hometown, before we had to say goodbye once I moved out of the state.


Now, he actually got a summer internship offer the day he finished finals in his hometown. Suddenly he is working a schedule that he has ""no control of"" and it's his number one priority. He can't tell me the days that he is going to be free, kept telling me this weekend he wasn't going to be free so me and my family went on a road trip, and now he has the weekend off but ""had no idea"". So now I start making plans of seeing him next weekend. Since I need to go back into our college town to run some errands anyways and he'll be there for a day but now he is saying that it seems too complicated.  


I am starting to get a lot of anxiety, because now I don't know what to do. I need to know in advance wether we are going to plan to see each other, and he doesn't seem to want to put the effort or seem to be able to tell me. My lease is going to end mid July, and I don't move into the city of my workplace until August. I was planning to stay either with him or with a friend that lives near by, just to be able to spend the rest of the summer together.


But now I don't know, I feel like I am getting that now that he found himself busy this summer, he doesn't need me around and its easier for him to call it quits. Then I feel like I am being stupid for putting so much effort to make sure to be on the same place. He hasn't even mentioned since if I can stay with him and his family once the lease ends, so I would most likely stay with my friend. It's always me pressuring him to meet eachother, and I need to know as soon as possible if it's going to happen or not, not one day before (especially one day before my lease ends). 


I don't know what to do. I don't know if it is because my parents are here that he thinks its too complicated, or if it is going to be the same way once they leave. I also feel like when I get anxious, I can come off like crazy sometimes, and we'll get into an argument, and I want to be able to explain to him how I feel. That not knowing where I'm going to live is freaking me out. That having him seem not to care about when is the next time we'll meet is giving me anxiety. And I don't think he understands because he can just stay with his parents if we don't meet one weekend, meanwhile I would need to couchsurf. 


tl:dr; Boyfriend had planned to spend summer together. Now, he seems to be unresponsive to the idea of meeting up, and its giving me anxiety because my plans revolved around him and I don't want to be out of the loop right before the end of my lease. "

8tfx6n,6,2018-06-24,Top Scholarship Schemes for International Students to Study in the USA and How to Get Them,tanmoyray01,scholarships,https://www.reddit.com/r/scholarships/comments/8tfx6n/top_scholarship_schemes_for_international/,"Quick tips

1. Assess your finances

Know how much the study abroad program will cost (fees and living expenses). Evaluate your profile (merit is the key for any kind of scholarships).

Assess your family income and assets and how much you can arrange through an education loan (demonstrated financial need will be very critical as well).

2. Concentrate on Building an All-Round Profile

The scholarships are primarily based on the merit of the student. Besides, demonstrated financial need is also a key determinant of securing a scholarship.

Grades and test scores are of course important. But, the scholarship committee will look way beyond your scores and grades

Solid work experience is always more than helpful. 2 – 3 years of work experience will give you more chances rather than 6 – 12 months of work experience, especially for full-scholarships.

Community involvement is good, and do impress the admission officers and scholarship committee. But, don’t do it just for the sake of doing. A failed attempt at starting your venture, online business (part-time) or a quality research project is better than a 3-month of community engagement.

Universities prefer students who can express themselves and reflect the true-self in the applications. If you are passionate about playing guitar or photography, demonstrate how actively you have followed your passion.

3. Research and Respect the Timelines

The majority of applicants miss out on getting scholarships because of not researching well enough. Secondly, they miss out on applying to various scholarship schemes before the specified deadlines.

Always create a balanced list of universities. It’s quite possible that you might have a great profile for admission to your dream school. But, the chances of getting a scholarship or other form of financial aid (TA/RA) could be very slim.

In such cases, you might get some form of aid in the second term or second year. But, those are not always guaranteed. So, always keep some safe options in hand.

It might be possible that your targeted universities are having their application deadlines in January or February. But, for international students, the application deadlines to get considered for financial aid are usually earlier (November or December).

4. Don’t Over-Rely on the Rankings

Ranking tables are a good starting point to start the research process for shortlisting universities. But, don’t follow them blindly. Rather focus on the research profiles of the faculty members and available research projects at the departments.

Additionally, institutional cultures, curriculum strength, community vibe, opportunities for career advancement, industry tie-ups, and connectedness of its alumni network are more important.

If you have to look at the rankings, focus on the metrics like subject rankings, graduate employability rates, student satisfaction etc.

5. Spend Time on Defining Your Interests and Goals

You need to sincerely reflect on your interests, strengths, and ambitions, strengths. The more time you spend on introspection, it will help you to research the programs efficiently.

In order to justify your candidature for a generous scholarship, you have to demonstrate why you want to do an MS in your subject area, and why from that particular university.

While researching the programs on the university websites, have a look at the profiles of the graduate students.

While comparing programs &amp; universities, ask yourself – how a particular program can help you to achieve your career goals.

6. Demonstrate True Interest and Engage

You might be having a great profile. But, you’re not alone. When you are looking at to obtain a scholarship or financial aid, the completion is cut-throat. What can really put you at advantage is demonstrated interest and engagement.

Try to communicate and engage with the faculty members, international officers, and admission officers by asking the right questions.

Ask curious and thought-provoking questions to the faculty members. You need to demonstrate that you are actively interested in knowing more about the program, research projects, and the university.

Follow the targeted universities on social media (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn etc.). Engage with the current students and alumni to know more about the program, campus culture, student activities, internships, jobs etc.

8tg4dy,4,2018-06-24,F4A A dark twisted evening from the depths of my mind,The_Sex_Goddess,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8tg4dy/f4a_a_dark_twisted_evening_from_the_depths_of_my/,"Hey everyone, I'm in a very naughty mood this evening and I have a few ideas for some RP. I know not everyone reads every single prompt, but if you could at least read the very end that would make my day! Thanks!

\# Office Slut

In this prompt I was thinking that I could be a woman working in an office who gets used and abused by her superiors, or even the people below her. I could be a young intern who they use because she's going to be out of here in a little less than a year anyway. Or I could be a higher up who uses her body to get what she wants. There are lots of different ways that this could go.

\# Festival Slut

For this Prompt I would play as a festival girl. You know the ones. I'd be dressed skimpy with tons of glitter covering my body. I would love it if you took advantage of me in the crowd or in my tent or somewhere else on the festival grounds. Drugs get thrown around a lot at these kind of things and I could see myself getting my drink spiked or something like that. Maybe I'm not a girl who does drugs very often, or I don't see any of this as sexual, but you decide to change that.

\# Animal Slut

In this prompt I could play as a woman who owns a farm, a zoo, a dog kennel, or a dog walking service. The animals however tend to get the better of me. Maybe it's something I do often, maybe its only for special occasions, maybe I'm experimenting, or maybe they take advantage of me. I would be interested in taking this to a really weird place and having me be able to get pregnant with the animals litter. The more exotic the animal the better

\# Violence Slut

For this one I would either be a girl who loves violence, it turns me on and is the only way that I can cum. Maybe I hate the violence. The pain is too much but I can't cum without it. Maybe it doesn't turn me on at all and it's your thing, but you won't let me go without hurting me. I can see this one going a lot of different ways and being very depraved.

\# Filthy Slut

In this prompt I would be a filthy little slut. And I don't just mean that I have a naughty mind, but I mean I roll around in the mud, I live in a literal trash heap, I piss or shit myself, I never wash, I shove food in my holes. There are tons of different kind of filth we could play with and I'd love to hear your ideas for some of them.These are just some of my prompts and I would love to hear what you think. All of these prompts are just suggestions or starters. Things can be tweaked or changed about any one of them. They could be combined or you could even come up with your very own idea. As you can also probably tell I am quiet dark and fucked up and if you want to get into some of those ideas I would really appreciate it! I can't wait to see what you guys have in store for me!

\# Barbie Slut

I'm sure you all know the doll, Barbie. There's no way that she isn't a slut right? You know how people always say that if she was real her proportions would make her so top heavy and she wouldn't be able to stand without heels? I want to be turned into that. I want to live my life like Barbie. Not only the shopping and the clothes and the pink. But also the brainless cock sucking and fucking that she must constantly do. 

\# Daddy's Little Slut

For this scenario I was thinking that we could do a father/daughter RP. There are a few ways we could do this one. It could be father forcing himself on his daughter. Or it could be consensual. If we go consensual I am thinking something more like the Josie art. If you don't know what I'm talking about I would suggest checking out the pieces that Sparrow does of her.

\# Furry Slut

This one kind of fits in with the Animal slut, but I was thinking more along the lines of Anthros and Yiffing. If you want this could probably be added to several of the other prompts as well!

8th68c,64,2018-06-24,"The danger modern day feminism, culture and social media causes growing up. A case study.",flashcash12,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8th68c/the_danger_modern_day_feminism_culture_and_social/,"Hi everyone this is my first official post to The RedPill. I post a lot on asktrp and contribute a decent amount here but now I am ready to post.

I decided to put together a quick case study on the destruction that modern culture, social media and feminism causes on college females. For this I decided to use a girl I know extremely well as an example. I will refer to her as Katie.

I grew up with Katie in a simpler time. We are both mid 90s babies but instead of being raised on internet cell phones and social media like kids today, we grew up playing pranks on others and playing sports until the sun came down. Then we would come home together after a day out with friends and I would eat dinner with my family. There was no phones or internet to distract us. Then I would watch sports with the family or whatever kid shows were on TV. It was a good time. School was great too. No political correctness, no liberal indoctrination, no agenda pushing education such as LGBT rights or other bullshit like that is being taught these days. Eventually we got cell phones (with no internet or social media) and only used them to text our friends to hang out.

Fast forward to high school, social media apps such as Snapchat and Instagram had just come out and people began to use it like crazy. Everyone had a Facebook by that point but it wasn't cool and no one used it. Katie and I got on Instagram and Snapchat. I used it regularly while she only used it to post the occasional picture and mostly to look at others. Then something revolutionary happened. The creation of instantaneous social media. While social media had caused FOMO in people especially teens, snapchat stories, twitter and Instagram magnified it. People could now see what others were doing at that instant and could instantly feel left out. Growing up where we did (a rich SoCal beach town), it is notorious for extremely entitled kids doing crazy things every weekend and of course posting it on social media. I took part in all those crazy activities every weekend while Katie stayed at home or hung out with a few of her friends. While I basically had a college experience in high school Katie had essentially missed out. It never seemed to bother her. I thought Katie was loser for not being like every other girl from my high school who were fun to party with and social.

For college, we ended up going to schools 15 minutes apart. I continued my party ways by pledging a popular fraternity fall of my freshman year while my Katie locked herself into her studies and working. The narrative then flipped. By sophomore year we were burned out, I was from the nonstop schedule of working, school and partying while she was from just school and working. I decided to take a break and focus more on my career goals and lifestyle. This coincided with a huge physical change. I started going to the gym hard my towards the end of my freshman year and got big so fast that summer I have stretch marks on my chest. Katie grew out of her awkward stage and her SMV skyrocketed into the stratosphere. Katie took of advantage of this right away, instantly joining a top tier sorority that fall. She then realized it was time to make up for lost time she felt she had missed. She then began going out and partying every night, bring back guys to her place every week, riding the CC to the extreme and starting to put together a group of orbiters who would do anything for her. She also had dropped all of her low status male friends/unattractive female friends from freshman year and began hangout with high SMV sorority sluts. Due to this she began to develop liberal views on the world and began to hamster every poor decision she made. After all she saw all these girls having the time of their lives. As a result of this, Katie's social media blew up like crazy. She began getting attention from extremely high status males on it and getting invited to exclusive Hollywood parties/clubs. Katie then started getting with these guys. This caused her hypergamy to go into overdrive and while she continues to pull these men, none will settle down with her and she will be an alpha widow in 10 years. However now everything is going great. This has caused Katie to constantly brag and flaunt all the attention she receives on social media. She became one of those girls she used to despise. That girl you see on greek row passed out on the lawn of a frat house after a party. Or that girl coming back from a club with a girl and a guy.

Despite all of this Katie does well. Has a very prestigious internship this summer and is the president of a exclusive business club on campus with over 200 members. She works hard but receives a lot of this due to her status and the fact that people will hand her things. This has put a dent in her relationship and since I am no longer up to the standard of a guy she associates herself with. I am irreverent to her and she only uses me for parties/formals at my school or the occasional emotion tampon when she decides she wants to use her “precious” time to call me once every 4 months. I may have a top 15&amp;#37; SMV for my age but it is pennies compared to hers or the people she associates herself with. Some of you may give me crap for this but it is how it is. I am not exactly thrilled about the logistics of our relationship these days but soon the balance of power will shift in my direction.

While noticing the complete 180 in personality in Katie, I never understood why she did those things. I was indoctrinated with girls were pure and guys are pieces of shit. After discovering the red pill I began to see everything that was happening. It all made sense. Trying to justify with her in impossible. Sometimes I try to tell her about the wall or the dangers of riding the CC but she doesn't care, she just thinks I'm now a misogynist and that feminism is the only way society will work. You can't rationalize with any female. Don't bother.

A few months ago Katie invited me to a party she got invited to. She only knew the host and I knew no one. It was the first time I had seen her in a while. For the first 15 minutes at the party I orbited Katie while she talked to the host and found the highest SMV guy there to hit on. I stood there with her talking to the guys and she eventually shooed me off. I realized that I was being a pussy. At any networking event or party, I was always a natural, effortlessly working the room  and getting know everyone. So for the next hour while she talked to Chad, I effortlessly worked my way around the room talking to everyone. After 45 minutes Katie realized Chad was actually Billy Beta who only relied on his looks and she began to orbit me. After ignoring her trying to butt in, she said she was leaving and took off irritated. I stayed and had developed so much social proof that I picked the girl I wanted and left an hour later with her. Also met 4 guys I currently hang out with now. The whole event dawned on me. I realized that Katie is still the shy and awkward girl and compensates for it by acting like an obnoxious party girl which she can get away with due to her SMV while I was always the natural one. That situation made me realize that a lot of girls like Katie are like this, so we need stop being pussies around them and realize that they should be nervous talking to us.

Social media controls a lot of people's lives. It makes them complacent, ignorant and unoriginal. With everything that is going on in politics with the immigration, stupid celebrities are sharing false information and pictures and their loyal supporters are eating up everything they say. It can used to spread misinformation. What about Facebook stealing our data? People don't seem to care and still worship Mark Zuckerberg despite the fact the reserves time in prison. Social media allows the average modern day female to receive endless validation thus inflating her ego and turning men into mindless zombies. What on earth causes guys to spend 15 dollars or so in order to watch some sluts snapchats?

In the future who knows what will happen. Maybe Katie will figure out her clock is ticking and settle down with an Alpha in 4-5 years. Maybe she will continue to ride the CC and be alone or have to settle for a beta. She continues to live her life based on status and spends her time wasting it on social media and pointless gossip. I got off social media and deleted almost every app off my phone and just focus my internship this summer while building interpersonal relationships with others. Every now and then I get occasionally jealous of Katie's lifestyle, endless paid trips to Vegas, constant validation, expensive gifts, partying in exclusive clubs and on yachts etc. However I realize that is all of a small hour glass. Eventually one day the hourglass will be empty on she will be left with nothing. Katie has the opportunity to take advantage of this to set herself up in the future. The question is, will she?

As always, AWALT."

I  grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one  was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still  wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an  Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more  of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching  the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I  rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a  shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There  would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to  poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the  caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The  timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I  open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I  flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one."

We are both PhD graduate students in STEM, and having him has made the tumultuous time that can be grad school easier. We are about to move in together very soon. 

We know a fair amount about each other’s pasts, but there’s one thing I haven’t been able to bring myself to tell him. Long story short, when I was an intern in college in a position I felt i needed to get into a good grad school program, I was sexually preyed on by my immediate supervisor who was much older(40) and married.  It was pretty traumatic at the time and I did not handle it well. I felt powerless and that I had no choice but to go along with what he did in order to have a good letter for grad school. I dealt with so much guilt and shame and lost friendships and relationships and became very depressed. This kind of evolved, in ways I still don’t understand, into this kind of codependent relationship with my supervisor once I was no longer working for him. And it took me forever to have the strength to cut him off. This makes me feel like I can’t report it. 

I finally did cut him off, and have dealt with a large stream of emails ever since. I’ve blocked him on every other platform but I feel like I need to save what he sends me if I ever need to protect myself. I kind of lapse into anxiety whenever I get one, they range from this holier than thou you need to forgive me and be friends with me type of emails to how much he misses me to lunatic ravings about how everything was my fault.  My boyfriend takes notice of my mood  and asks if everything is okay. 

I guess my question is; should I tell someone I love about this? Would he want to know? It’s over and yes it still affects me, but I’m afraid I’ll have trouble explaining it. I was pretty weak in handling it and the fact I kept in contact with my supervisor for awhile sickens me. I feel ashamed and like my boyfriend deserves someone who was stronger than me.  At the same time I don’t want to see me any differently. 

Does anyone have experience/ insight on informing a SO about what happened to them?"

No contact for about three months. At the time, I was really low on energy and didn’t really want to keep investing in a relationship. I also figured it might be fun to meet other people. 

We hung out a couple of times in the fall but it never really culminated in anything. The most noteworthy event was a drunk text about how I miss her which was responded with similar sentiments but a “we aren’t right for each other”. We hung out a couple of times after that but I hadn’t realized how bad of shape I was in at the time.

I was very busy with internships, finishing school, and studying for the bar. This hectic schedule is somewhat responsible for my general neglect of our relationship on my part but once all these things were finished, I realized the full extent of my unhappiness, depression, and lack of wellness. I realize how these things ruined a relationship and allowed me to be such a jerk at times. 

After finished school and studying for the bar, I launched into really taking myself apart. I learned new hobbies, started exercising with a lot of success, lost about fifteen pounds, and started eating healthier. I also found out that I passed the bar and landed a job with an awesome salary and benefits. 

Despite all these great things, I wish she was here and I wish I could share all these things with her. I stumbled onto her Instagram page one night and saw that she was in a new relationship, which messed me up. I’ve been dating people, but I always compare them to her and want them to be better than her. I know this is stupid and what this means but I still do it.

 I find myself wanting to be better for her  despite the fact that she may never know of or understand what I’ve been doing. Like I can make up for my past shortcomings by the person I’ve made myself. I find myself waiting for a text from her, what I’ll wear and say when I see her, and how we can get back together from there. 

I’m not really sure of the point of this post. I guess I’m just looking for advice but just getting this out in the world feels good enough. "
8tivue,4,2018-06-24,Information on computer science internship,yorkuniversitycsguy,yorku,https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/8tivue/information_on_computer_science_internship/,"So I was accepted into Lassondecoop and I asked around to find out what the hype is all about. I'll share what I learned with you, because the department is vague and don't tell you a lot beforehand.

Basically, they just hustle you to find an internship **on your own**. That means they don't link you up to a company or anything like that. They might set up a small job fair, but it is rare and it depends on if there's any company that is in desperate need to fill up spots. They do help you prepare for your interview (so does EECS 2011) and your application. But so does the career centre.

So what makes Lassondcoop and computer science internship stand out? The fact that you're enrolled into it. Apparently some (not all) companies specifically look for students who are enrolled into an internship program at their attending universities. I've come across a few of these ads myself, so it checks out. But that's about it. Not all companies do this, mind you.

No wonder they don't tell you a lot before you get in. It's not much of a selling point."
8tj80f,239,2018-06-24,[Serious] Why you Should do General Surgery - a Recent Grad/Fellow's perspective,surgresthrowaway,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8tj80f/serious_why_you_should_do_general_surgery_a/,"I know that /u/Nysoz beat me to the punch, but I will try to add some thoughts and give a little bit of a different perspective as our experiences while similar have some differences. 

  
**Background:** I am a PGY-8, about to be PGY-9 (the flair only goes to 6 on this forum) surgery fellow. I trained at an academic/University general surgical residency program and am now in training at another heavily academic center as a fellow. 

During my residency, I did two full years of research and obtained a masters degree. My general surgery program was done at a quaternary referral center with ~1000 beds and a Level 1 trauma center. 

**Residency years:**  
-*Intern Year* Traditionally was the year where you learned how to take care of patients. My experience was a little different than the prior write up - we never rotated in the ED or on a medical service (I didn't actually know anyone did that). We did month long blocks: 4 months on the general surgery services, 2 months at the VA, 1 month SICU, 1 Trauma, 1 Vascular, 1 Peds, 1 Transplant, and 1 CT surgery. Typical operative volume for intern year was ~100 cases - mostly melanoma/breast/hernias with the occasional lap chole and appy. We were fortunate in our program to have a lot of APP support on the floors so interns also came to double scrub bigger cases pretty frequently.  
-*PGY2* Our PGY2s were more or less considered the equivalent of interns. They still took call (or did night float). They also carried the general surgery consult pager on our emergency surgery service and served as first responders (in charge of secondary survey and lines/chest tubes) for trauma alerts.  
*PGY3* This was in our program considered your first year of ""senior residency"". The expectations for operative volume and case complexity go way up. You also lead the team on rounds and cover senior resident call sometimes. This is in some ways the most awesome year of residency - you get to do a ton of great cases but don't have the same level of responsibility as a chief resident. This year I did over 300 cases including my first whipple, kidney transplant, esophagectomy, carotid, and many other sweet cases.  
*PGY4* The PGY4s served as chief residents of the trauma service, so this defines your experience for the year. Running hundreds of traumas in the ED, taking patients to the OR for operative traumas (hopefully! These are becoming increasingly rare - something like &lt;10% of trauma activations went to the OR), rounding in the trauma ICU. Unfortunately this also means you're working a lot of nights - I did 2 months of trauma night float.  
*Chief Year* In an academic program like mine, chief year is what it's all about. Everything leads up to this. You run the service. We have a true chief-run general surgery service that we all rotate on for 2 months - you have a PGY3 on service with you and the two of you do cases together with an attending present for supervision/backup. I took PGY3s through some awesome cases including perfed ulcers, gallstone ileus, sigmoid volvulus - all with the attending hanging out and not scrubbing. You also run the show at the VA for two months. Chief year is also what you make of it - I'd show up for some hernias or smaller cases because I knew the attending was cool and would just let me do the case with the junior. Learning how to not just operate but show someone else how to operate is a whole new learning curve (that I am still very much working on). Chief Year also means running your service at all times - I was on home call for probably 300 nights out of the year (alternated weekends with another senior to get a weekend off, and if I was really tired or had to come in the night before I would have my PGY3 cover the home call that night). 

**Typical day:**  I posted a sample schedule from my chief year once before on this site:  
[Typical Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/4tt8qy/surgery_residents_what_are_your_hours_like/d5kc7qb/?context=3)

**Call:**  
*Call*: I did my intern year in a very traditional program taking Q3-Q4 call. Our duty hours system tracked the number of call days and I did exactly 100 calls in one year. Call for us meant usually somewhere in the neighborhood of a 25-26 hr day (i.e. got to leave immediately after rounds). On our ICU month it meant closer to 30 - had to stay for formal ICU rounds and present all the new admits from that day.  
*Night Float* After 2011 my program introduced a semi night-float system. What our junior residents (interns and PGY2s) did was do 5 night/2 night system to cover a week - so an intern did 5 nights in a row (M-F), then flipped back to days; and another intern did 2 nights (Sat/Sun). Benefits of this were that the night float person got the weekend off; downside was that as an intern you had to do on average 3-4 day/night switches per month. It was wildly unpopular, and we were in the process of developing a month long night float rotation to replace it when the most recent hours changes came along. Our program is one of a relative few that went back to traditional Q4 call (though our program has also expanded over time so it is more like Q5 call now). 
  
**Fellowships:** There are a LOT of general surgery subspecialty fellowship options. My attempt at an inclusive list although I'm sure I will forget something:   
-Trauma/Acute Care  
-Endocrine  
-Breast  
-MIS  
-Surgical Oncology  
-HPB   
-Colorectal  
-Transplant  
-Cardiothoracic  
-Vascular  
-Pediatrics  
-Plastics
  
The process of applying for fellowships sucks. Almost all of the programs are a match, but not all are done through the NRMP, and they are almost all on slightly different matching schedules. You also have to find time to apply and interview during a very clinically busy residency and coordinate with your co-residents to adequately cover for each other. Plus there are several non-accredited fellowship programs that exist outside of the match.  
  
Fellowship applications are also much more nebulous and secretive than med school or residency. In med school the path to success is fairly straightforward - do good on step 1, get honors on the wards, etc.  
  
For fellowships my experience was that academic pedigree and ""who you know"" mattered far more than anything else. We have an annual inservice exam called the ABSITE but I got the impression (and was told) on the interview trail that no one cared about it as long as your scores weren't abysmal.  
  
But bottom line is even though I matched at my top choice I had no real idea of how competitive an applicant I was and it caused a lot of anxiety throughout the process.   

**Reasons why you should do General Surgery:** I will try not to completely repeat the previous list...  
*You love to operate* I put this first because it is the most important. It may sound ridiculous but sometimes people go into this field without a love of operating.  
  
*You can have tough conversations with patients* General surgeons are too often the bearer of bad news. The oncologist tells the patient lets try one more round of chemo or that new trial; the general surgeon is the one who has to tell them they've now perforated/obstructed/etc. The family of a trauma patient comes in and you have to break the bad news about their loved one. It's crucial that surgeons be able to connect with patients quickly and it is painful to watch a surgeon that can't do this well.  
  
*You enjoy immediate impact of your work* One of the great things about surgery is that you take action and it has a near immediate effect. Tumors out. Hernias fixed. Appendicitis cured.  
  
*You can say no/You can handle death* The flip side of the above is that not every patient will be helped with an operation. One of the most important part of your surgical training is learning when **NOT** to operate. 

**How do you know if general surgery ISN'T right for you?:**  
-To some extent it's basically if the above things don't ring true to you. 
  
-I would encourage people though not to focus too much on the difficulty of the residency. It's five years; your career afterwards is 25-30 years. Other residencies are hard too. I think our ortho and plastics colleagues work just as hard as I do; they also take a lot of call and spend the night in the hospital a ton.   

  
**Dismissing some misconceptions:**  
*The Asshole Trope* I am often mystified when I read the comments on reddit from med students about the way their surgery attendings/residents behave. It's so foreign from my personal experience that it's really hard for me to believe it at times (but I do). I would just tell you that at many programs out there, that kind of behavior doesn't exist and won't be tolerated. I really think the entering generation of surgeons (myself and the residents junior to me) are very different than their forebears, and our field will continue to improve in the future.  
  
I will say that surgeons more accurately have a reputation for being direct. I am a fairly introverted person and confrontation is not in my nature. But surgery forces you to be the voice in the room clearly directing a trauma. You have to be the one to stand your ground and tell a consulting team that no, you won't be operating on their patient even though everyone wants you to. That directness evolves in all of us over time in our training.  
  
*""Don't do surgery unless you can't see yourself doing anything else""*   
I hear this comment a lot or some variant upon it. I could imagine doing any number of other things. Occasionally as a PGY8 I find myself wishing I had done a field where I'd be done and have been an attending for 5 years by now. You do have to love surgery, but it is neither my first nor my only love in life. 
  
*Can't have a personal/social/family life*  
I really like my life. I work hard, but I do the things I like to do. I have hobbies I enjoy outside of work. I don't have kids but I know a ton of surgery residents who do and they love their kids and are incredibly committed parents.  
  
*General Surgery is just choles and hernias* I see these types of comments a lot, often deriding general surgeons or saying why someone picked a “cooler” subspecialty. The scope of practice of general Surgery is incredibly broad, especially in training. Especially at a major academic center than mine.
  

**Some Real Downsides:** Okay I will try to tell you the negatives:  
  
*Incredibly long training* As said, I'm a PGY8 going on 9. My med school classmates are mostly comfortably into their attending lives by now. I won't be the last person from my med school class in training but I will be damn close.  
  
*The Academic Hamster Wheel* This is specific to academic surgery and subspecialty fellowship matching - but along with this long training came the process of having to go through another competitive application process and fellowship match.  
  
I love the environment of academics and have a hard time imagining ever practicing outside of it. I love teaching and working with students and residents. I have some research ideas that I'm genuinely interested in. But I don't kid myself - I'm not going to be the person with 3 RO1 grants and 200 publications.  
  
And the job search is even worse than fellowship application - chairs interview you for an 80% clinical job but still ask you about your K award plans. Expectations for jobs in academia are wildly misaligned with reality.   
  
*Lots of hours and lots of nights in the hospital* For a great number of fields, the moment you graduate residency you can pretty much count on never stepping foot in the hospital at night again. Not true for general surgery. If you manage to snag a truly pure elective practice with no general surgery call you may come close but that's about it.  
  
This goes for both practice and training. I'm a PGY8 and I still take in house call now.  
  
*Difficult outcomes* It is very challenging. I've dealt with death and debilitating injury more often than I'd like, and I'm a trainee still. Sometimes it makes me want to just go do hernias for a living and avoid it all. That said, there are specialties within general surgery that allow you to largely avoid this (bariatrics, MIS for example)."

""I'll try to do for IM the exact same format the rads guy did.

Background: I'm about two weeks away from being done with IM residency. I have taken an attending position at a pretty nice teaching hospital on the west coast.

IM years:

PGY-1: Intern year- Not as bad as everyone thinks it is. No one has any expectations for you. Just get your work done and take step 3 and try to figure out if you want to do fellowship.

PGY-2: This is probably the hardest IM year because you need to work on your team and leadership skills. You will usually have at least one and probably two shitty interns on floors with you and it is hard to corral them sometimes especially if they are radiology or psych prelims. You have a lot more responsibility and you also need to pad your CV to apply for fellowship this year if that's the plan.

PGY-3: Difficulty is in between intern and year two. You see the light at the end of the tunnel and you have been studying for boards so you start to feel confident. You'll find out if you got fellowship by December of third year so you'll submit apps pretty early on. And that's it you are done.

Typical day:

An example of a typical day of a resident on floors.

6:30 AM Arrive and corral the interns and ask them if anything notable happened overnight. Look over the labs and formulate a plan while the interns go and see the patients on your team.

830AM The social worker comes in and you tell them about who needs placement.

9AM-1100AM Start rounding with the attending. Your interns present the patients, you listen and mention important tidbits that they gloss over and listen to them present their plans. Once the attending gives them feedback you tell them what you think we should do if it is different from what they said. Repeat for the patients on the list. While moving from room to room quickly put in orders and call consults so by the time rounds are down they are all in.

11AM Double check the orders while the interns start notes.

12PM Go to noon conference and eat/sleep during conference.

1PM Follow up on all the stuff you put the orders in for during the day and emergent things that come up. Once all the stuff is done check out to the on call team and go home, this will usually be around 3-4PM.

ON CALL DAYS - Everything above is the same the only difference is you will take admissions over the course of the day and cannot leave until 7PM which is when you will stop taking admissions and will probably get out close to 8PM. At our hospital you are on call q4days.

IM is not for everyone but these are the pros: 1) It is not neverending patients like it is with the ER or radiology where the studies/patients never stop coming in. There is a goal and the end is in sight. Get your work done and you can leave. You can even joke around and have fun in between while waiting for stuff to get back.

2) You feel like a real doctor and there is thinking involved. You get to see patients and have that interaction. Patient's say funny and weird things, it's great. Some patients are jerks and that is fun in its own way.

So how do you know if IM is right for you? Here a some characteristics I think that may be a sign that it’s for you.

You don't mind patient interaction
You like thinking and the occasional procedure
Dismissing some misconceptions about IM:

Endless rounding-While this does happen it is rare and the worst attendings do this. You are the senior IM resident you dictate how fast rounds go. If you are unprepared and have no idea what is going on rounds will take a long time. I have never taken more than 2.5 hours to round on our entire team and that includes putting in orders and consults

I honestly do not know if there are other misconceptions if you guys ask about them I can post about them.

Some real downsides to the field:

You take admissions that probably should go to another field. But at the same time these are easy admissions, the other speciality is essentially managing the situation you just need to restart the meds and check up on chronic health issues.

Call days can be brutal, but again this depends on how fast you as a senior are or how horrible your interns are. Attending life will be much easier in this regard because the residents will do this aspect for you and you can watch remotely or be as hands on as you want. If you work as a hospitalist you can crank out notes pretty fast and see an admit pretty quick by the end of your third year.

Let me know if there is anything that I missed or should clarify."""

8tkds2,258,2018-06-24,[Serious][Residency] Why you should consider Vascular Surgery,TypeADissection,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8tkds2/seriousresidency_why_you_should_consider_vascular/,"Background: Just finished a traditional 5-year general surgery residency and about to begin fellowship.  Trained at a level-one trauma, tertiary “privademic” center.  Each resident depending on their interests will graduate with around 6-10 months on the vascular service over the course of 5 years.  We have 2 hybrid ORs and 3 vascular surgeons.  My program does not have a vascular surgery fellowship, which was great from a resident standpoint because nobody would be able to out-chief me for open AAAs, aorto-bifems, and other awesome stuff.  

Residency year: PGY-6

Fellowships: [https://vascular.org/career-tools-training/vascular-training-programs](https://vascular.org/career-tools-training/vascular-training-programs)

* This is a great place to start.  Gives a list of training programs and various paradigms.
* Currently you will either go the traditional route (5+2) whereby you do a general surgery residency (5-7 years) and then a standard 2-year fellowship in vascular surgery.
* Or you can go directly into vascular surgery and match into an integrated program right out of medical school.  Program lengths vary from 5-7 years, depending on research requirements.

Typical day from a general surgery resident standpoint:  The usual census ranges anywhere from 6-25.  Being the chief of the service, I usually wake up around 0500 and get to the hospital around 0530.  I go through labs, I/Os and various notes from the overnight team.  See who the new admissions are or if anyone got transferred to ICU.  Talk to the overnight residents and get updates.  Depending on my familiarity with patients, I will then go by the ICU and then see the new ones on the service.  Then I’ll convene with my junior resident and intern to see what they’re seeing and make plans for the day.  Breakfast.  Cases start at 0800 - usually two rooms running.  I’ll do the more complex cases or since I am going into vascular, I’ll even do the angios to get better with my wire skills and get comfortable with the sizes and lengths of various sheaths, catheters, balloons, etc.  Consults will come in throughout the day and the intern/junior will go see them and report back to me.  I will then go see it and discuss plan with attending.  If everything goes well and we have no add-ons, we’re at signout for the night float team by 1645 or we catch them later on after we’ve wrapped up all the floor issues and done our postop checks.  Go home anywhere between 1700 on a good day to 2100 on a bad day, see what cases are coming up in the week, read up on them, dinner, play with my kid, play with my wife, go to bed (not in any particular order).  I’ve had weeks where I was home by 1700 every night and one week where the earliest I got home was 2100 and even 0100 that one night.

Attending Call: q3 - giving a rough approximation I’d say that 1 in about every 3-4 calls they have to come in for something in the middle of the night.  Cold limb, rupture, dissection, trauma, etc.

* My call as a fellow will be q3 for the next two years, but the above written was in regards to what my attendings in residency are doing.

Inpatient vs Outpatient: Each attending does one full day of clinic a week and half day of veins.  There are mid-levels to otherwise staff a full day of clinic everyday on their own for postop evals, surveillance, etc.  They call if they have questions, but do an awesome job of making sure these patients don’t fall through the cracks and get the follow-up they need.  

Procedures: This is one of the best parts of vascular surgery as a field, its versatility and wide breadth of cases.  Operate all throughout the body and on every vessel outside of the brain and heart.  Here’s a quick snapshot of what a vascular surgeon can do:

* Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms
* Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms
* Endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms, thoracic aortic dissections and thoracoabdominal aneurysms, including hybrid aortic procedures
* Open surgical reconstructions and balloon angioplasty and stenting in all vascular areas
* Endovascular intervention, such as angioplasty and stenting
* Bypass surgery and endovascular therapy for peripheral artery disease and gangrene of the limbs
* Carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting
* Treatment for Carotid Body Tumors and other vascular tumors
* Endovascular intervention and open bypass surgery for mesenteric and renal arteries
* Endovenous laser therapy and open surgical intervention for varicose veins and venous ulcers
* Endovascular and open surgical reconstruction for deep vein occlusions
* Hemodialysis access
* Treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome
* Retroperitoneal exposure for spine surgery

Lifestyle: This is highly variable, but vascular surgeons tend to work a fair bit more than other specialties.  My attendings are averaging probably around 65 hours a week, but this can vary from as short as 40 some weeks to 80-90 other weeks.  It all depends on what you’re going to get called for.  A large chunk of our consults are intraoperative from other services that get into trouble and call for help or iatrogenic injuries in the ICU during catheter placement.  

Income: If I remember correctly the starting median salary for an academic job is $382K/yr and private practice is $442K/yr (I could be completely wrong on these figures).  But you really have to take this with a grain of salt because geographics will play a large role in how you’re compensated as well as how your contract is structured, your wRVUs, etc.  My home institution is offering a stipend while I’m in fellowship and guaranteed $500K salary for two years if I signed right now.  I’ve decided not to because I don’t want to get locked into something that is 2 years away and lot can happen in that time.  Bottom line - none of us are going to be hurting for money, and we will sure as hell work for it.

Reasons why to do vascular surgery:  Full disclosure I just posted a similar answer on SDN recently and so I’m just gonna copy and paste what I wrote not too long ago.  As specific questions come up, I’d be more than happy to try and answer those.

* Vascular surgery has a unique set of characteristics in the medical landscape that some practitioners will find appealing and others abhorrent. Although there have been landmark strides made in the field over the last 30 years, it still today remains  an incredibly challenging and dynamic field from a patient care and research standpoint. Many Americans over the course of their lives will experience some form of vascular-related symptoms. It is rewarding to have the ability to tailor each operation to achieve the best outcomes for individual patients in the goal of improving quality of life, limb salvage, or risk reduction for stroke or aneurysm rupture. Contemporary vascular surgery is also heavily technology dependent, and has manifested itself in the ability to perform hybrid procedures whether that is sewing in iliac/subclavian conduits for a complex EVAR or femoral endarterectomies and stenting to create ipsilateral in-line flow to the foot. So you basically have a rapidly evolving field that can have a large positive impact for many people while using cutting-edge technology, power tools and loupes.  What’s not to like?
* To paraphrase Dr. John Eidt, “We are cobblers in vascular surgery, we aren’t Nike.  We make one shoe at a time.  We see each patient, get to know them and develop a relationship, and then tailor an operation for their specific needs and goals.”  
* You also get distinct impressions along the course of your training.  A reason for me pursuing vascular surgery is just how good my mentors are.  They are master technical surgeons and are often called to bail others out of trouble.  I appreciate how their mindset, preparation and training has brought them to a point where they are just really really good.  And I want to be really really good.

How do you know if vascular surgery  is right for you?

* Anyone who is attracted to surgery will innately have a desire to not only fix a problem (because all of medicine seeks to do that) but to do so tangibly with their hands.  The devil is truly in the details and the good vascular surgeon will have the big picture of what they’re trying to accomplish with a patient while being cognizant of their overall clinical picture.  A good vascular surgeon will also be hard-working, for anyone who has rotated on this service knows how demanding of one’s time this field can be.  There are days where it is relentless and sick patients keep rolling through the door and they require attention not tomorrow, but today.  
* This isn’t a field for those who want to fix a problem and then never see it again.  This isn’t general surgery where we fix a hernia or take a gallbladder out and never see them again.  We develop long-term longitudinal relationships with our patients similar to surgical oncologists and they will come back with other issues.    

Dismissing some misconceptions:

* That all vascular surgeons are grumpy and hate their lives.  I have amazing mentors who throughout my residency never complained and just did work in front of them.  The amount of people they have helped, lives and limbs saved, families comforted has been humbling to experience.  But I do mean it when I say that this isn’t a field that you talk yourself into.  You will either become enamored with it or you won’t.  There’s very little middle ground and I don’t think this specialty was ever meant to be any other way.

Downsides:

* You will work hard.
* There will be concessions made in your personal life due to unplanned emergencies.
* The patients are sick and many will die.
* Some patients are non-compliant.
* The operations can be difficult, made more challenging by the fact that you are not operating on healthy veins and arteries but rather very diseased ones.
* You are the “mop man.”  Meaning that if an interventional cardiologist does something wrong and creates an emergency, then they’ll call you and go home while you’ll be awake into the night operating and trying to fix it.  
* Being a vascular surgeon, you are going to be very good-looking (because this field attracts such beautiful people) and thus many of the staff will not leave you alone.

This is all I have for now.  I'm sure there are things I have forgotten.  Anyone who is already a practicing attending or fellow would be able to lend more insight.  Hope this helps everybody.  Cheers."

8tli5w,15,2018-06-24,Who should know about *** at this point?,Kaitzu-,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8tli5w/who_should_know_about_at_this_point/,"So the recent anime episode made me realize that Aizawa was present when Bakugo asked All Might what Deku means to him. At this point it's borderline **offensive** to Aizawas character that he hasn't figured it out already.

 - After the very first test All Might gets caught peeping and even makes a small note on how [Midoriya has potential](https://i.imgur.com/bRZkUIt.png)
 - As seen in the picture above and throughout the series Aizawa is very smart and notices small details from people. His character being sold so smart would naturally mean that.
  1. He knows All Might and Midoriya are close (Todoroki noticed this very early).
  2. He was among the people who knew All Mights true form.
  3. Midoriyas quirk can reach the same strenght as All Mights (Both Tsuyu and Endeavor noticed this).
  4. He is aware of 'unnatural' entities like AfO, this was one of the reasons that Bakugo could believe something like a transferable quirk exists.
 - Noted above, he heard a very weird question from Bakugo towards All Might.
 - This a bit difficult but to what extend does he know about Gran Torino and Sir Nighteye? 
  1. Midoriya gets **only** 1 place to go for workplace experience so there is quite a big chance Aizawa at least knows the name. Then this old ass hero who nearly nobody knows of shows up at AfO fight, right next to All Might.
  2. Then the internship starts and who does Midoriya intern under? All Mights former sidekick! 
  3. Cut to the Overhaul raid, we see Gran Torino (again) and Deku under Sir Nighteye, Torino makes a friendly note to Deku, [Kirishima notices Deku has connections](https://i.imgur.com/vIhD8gk.png).

After all it does rely on Aizawa himself to connect the dots but he is sold as smart character to us. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Aizawa has figured it out but he is such a sly cooper that he even keeps it a secret from us viewers.

So back to my title, who else should know about OfAs true form?"

I'm currently in college and have some money saved up from working part time jobs and full time internships between school. I have enough to pay back my loans in full right when I graduate, and that's how I'd like to keep it. Throughout the years I live away from home and pay my own rent/tuition/transportation/phone bill. My parents send food up often so I guess you can say they cover my eating expenses.

My ""aunt"" is more like a family friend, but we've known them since before I was born. She is currently in a rough situation with her partner - they aren't officially married but have 3 kids. She's planning on separating soon and would like to buy a used car to become more independent. She needs to pay the owner in cash and my mom is asking me to loan her $10,000 to buy it. She said she'll be able to pay it back in 1-2 years.

Upon projections, I have enough money to pay rent and tuition for the next term considering I'm working full time for the summer and I'll have more student loan money coming in. I have the means to loan the money but they're sitting in investments and savings accounts. If I withdraw this money I will lose out on 2 years' worth of interest/profits, and lose the contribution room on my savings account. I told my mother this, and she said it's more important to help family than to be investing. She also said in the future, if I really needed the money she'll withdraw some from our mortgage pool.

I'm really uncomfortable with this whole idea considering I'm still a student. Although my mom trusts this aunt, I don't really know her myself on that level. I'm sure she has good intentions on repaying that money, but what if circumstances change? I'll be graduating in 2 years time and will definitely need that money to pay back my loans and possibly move out officially. I don't really know how to respond since my mom has already said family comes first.

TLDR: Mom wants me to load $10k to a close family friend, but I'm worried they'll be unable to pay me back within 2 years time. Will also be losing out on investment gains and contribution room in my savings account. Unsure how to respond.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has commented so far. To address some common points:

\- I come from a traditional Asian family where as a dependent (I come home some weekends, they still supply me with food, etc.), they are to know about my current living circumstances (what i'm studying, where i'm working, where i'm living, whether i'm doing well in terms of finances). If my mom asks me about my finances, traditionally I'm obligated to tell her otherwise there will be a lot of concern, questioning, yelling, etc... I guess you can call her a helicopter mom?  
\- My mom isn't offering up her own money because we recently came across some troubles and she no longer has the capability, however she had already offered/promised this aunt a loan from our family BEFORE the troubles occurred - hence why she is turning to me"
8tm29k,4,2018-06-24,I don't even know anymore,whodidikillinapastli,quarterlifecrisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/quarterlifecrisis/comments/8tm29k/i_dont_even_know_anymore/,"I've been having a series of quarter-life crises over the past few years, the details of which can be seen in my submission history. 

Right now, I'm just at the point where I have to get all of this shit off of my chest, and I have *literally no one* I can talk to. I turn 27 in a few months, and I feel like I have completely wasted my life. I'm questioning basically every choice that I've made over the past decade, and it's driving me nuts.

I have *no* friends--being so lonely that I feel like I'm dying is what prompted my miniature come-apart that I'm having right now--and spend all of my time alone. My opportunities to meet people are extremely limited, and I guess I'm just not a likable person. My coworkers are all middle-aged and/or uneducated women with kids, while I'm a single dude in my twenties with a master's degree, so I have nothing to talk to them about. I've thought about going out to a bar or something alone--something I've never been fond of doing alone--but, even if I do go, I don't have anywhere near enough money to go with any kind of frequency. Most online things are just filled with weirdos (yes, I've tried meetup.com, etc), and I'm too normal for some of these things, but not normal enough for the types of people I like I guess. From what I can tell, I had a below average social life when I was in college and grad school, but I still had one at least. Now, though, I have nothing--I've done stuff with friends twice in that time, most recently in December 2016.

I haven't so much as touched a girl in over three years. I'm not great looking (I *have* started going back to the gym for the first time in about 3.5 years, though), and I have *no* game whatsoever anymore, not that I had all that much to begin with anyway. I'm too poor to really date (I have a job that only requires a high school diploma, pays about $35K a year, and if completely meaningless, while I also have nearly $70K in student loan debt), especially the kind of women I'm actually interested in, and I can't even hook up with anyone. My confidence and self-esteem have been shit, obviously, for the past few years, which is certainly a factor, and the fact that I'm a dude with no friends and a shitty job despite my background almost certainly raises tons of red flags that something is wrong with me.

My job is meaningless. I can't make a career out of it, I can't pay off my student loans with it, and I can't find any kind of happiness outside of work.

I feel like I've missed out on my entire life. I keep questioning *every* major decision I've made since my senior year of high school--""I should have pledged that fraternity,"" ""I should have taken that internship instead,"" ""I should have told that girl how I felt,"" yadda, yadda, yadda. 

I had mostly had my shit together until recently, but I think the fact that I'm kind of moving up on the hierarchy of needs (I graduated with my master's May 2015, was unemployed/underemployed/otherwise losing money until March 27, 2017, broke even from that point until almost 8 months ago, and have actually had a *tiny* amount of disposable income since November) is what has brought all of these feelings to the surface. Weirdly enough, I felt *good* on Thursday for the first time in years--I felt some kind of confidence or something. It maintained into Friday, yesterday was kind of neutral (though I still didn't experience much negativity), and today was fine until this afternoon. The fact that I probably spent too much time in the sun doesn't help, but I don't really know what triggered it.

On a positive note, as I mentioned, I *just* started going to the gym again, so hopefully that helps me out some. I'm also thinking about pursuing a second master's degree.

Sorry this is so disorganized--I'm exhausted and my head is killing me, on top of feeling like complete dogshit. I just really needed to get this off of my chest."

8tmblg,1,2018-06-24,Question regarding visa,Koreanbritishintern,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/8tmblg/question_regarding_visa/,"Hey guys, I’ve recently started working at a research company through a link via someone I know i.e. CEO is hiring me because he’s friendly with someone I know. There wasn’t a formal process of hiring. 

They’ve decided to pay my travel fees. It’s currently via the financial team of the firm so the process is a formal process. I didn’t realise they’d be paying me anything as I was treating it as 1 month work experience sort of thing and didn’t prepare a visa. 

I now need a visa.

Relevant information

* I was a dual Korean and British citizen but now just british (not spending 2 years in the army)
* I started the job prior to the end of my official university end date (3 days before the end)
* I’ll be working for less than 1 month

To be paid formally do you think the D-2-5 visa is most relevant?  (exchange student) or is that not relevant as I am no longer a student of my uni now.

I’ve read in other posts that if its less than 3 months of internship your normal entry visa would be fine but I haven’t been able to confirm this. Could anyone clarify if this is true?

Will this be an issue that I've already started working before applying for a visa?

Very grateful for any advice. Seems like I've fucked up."
8tmp62,8,2018-06-24,My List of Exhibitionist Games,SmutMaster88,NSFWgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/NSFWgaming/comments/8tmp62/my_list_of_exhibitionist_games/,"I love when a porn game allows me to edit female character’s clothing to the point of allowing me to let them go outdoors naked. I love exhibitionism, and not a pansy “Oh, they might catch me if they look this way!” type, the “Here I am, naked in broad daylight, take pictures and molest me!” type. This can be hard to do and hard to find, so here, by request, is my list of games that have this element in any form. I’m compiling this list for record keeping and by popular request, but also because when I first started exploring these games, I wish I had a list like this too.

So here is my standard for being on this list. My perfect game (Which does exist, I’ll list it first) involves a female protagonist who starts off innocent and pure, is corrupted, and by the end of the game, scenes will typically involve her loving the degrading acts she partakes in, and of course, is able to walk in public completely nude. Bonus points for sex scenes during these walks and being a willing rape victim. Extra bonus points for watersports, a kink of mine but not necessary to be a good exhibitionist game. Not every game on this list has everything just mentioned, so I’ll be adding a very short description to try and pinpoint what the game has from the above-stated elements.

Disclaimer that I’m only posting titles, I will only post developers if I know the name off hand. The description may also contain spoilers so I can state how far the exhibitionism goes.

Okay...here goes.

**Liz of the Tower** by Clymenia (My absolute favorite porn game from my favorite developer. There will be other Clymenia games on the list, but if you want exhibitionism, you can get it out of any Clymenia game. Corruption, multiple outfits, full nudity, rape, and just a very fun story)

**Noxian Nights** (Another favorite due to being one of the first porn games I played when I started searching. Highly suggest you play the game along with the walkthrough to ensure you get enough lust points. Not only can you walk around naked in public, but you can walk around covered in cum)

**Naked Order** (Obviously, a classic in the genre, walking around naked is the point of the game. LOTS of scenes and cheats to make the game a little easier after you complete it the first time.)

**Rune’s Pharmacy** (Not listed as a game with exhibitionism, so this game clued me into the fact that there was more then what I usually found. A very well made game, you can eventually corrupt the very innocent and cute female protagonist into walking around naked and whoring herself out for free)

**Shinobi Buster** (Another of my favorites, you can strip naked as soon as you start playing. The fun is getting her to lose her battles and see scenes of her being raped by the victors)

**Four Elements Trainer** (I came for the exhibitionism, but I stayed for the top-notch corruption. Helps a lot if you love the original series. During the first book, you can have a very short scene of Katara walking around naked, and you can pick what she wears or doesn’t wear. Some public scenes in the other books, like Toph in a string bikini. Light on exhibitionism, but is still a memorable porn game overall.)

**Corrupting the Intern** (“menu” game, as I like to call most Ren’Py games. You can send your intern to work days at the office completely nude. Otherwise, not too much content, but considering the genre, any little bit counts)

**Cursed Armor** (An early find. VERY content-heavy game, in my opinion, but perhaps a little too much. It’s machine translated, so it doesn’t help much if you get stuck. I did and never got too far in it. As far as I can tell, you can change your outfits to be more and more revealing. I was more into the hypnotism and rape scenes)

**Fountain of Mana** (Everyone SAYS this is a classic, and while it's well made, the corruption burn was TOO slow in my opinion. I got to some flashing scenes, but if there is any actual public nudity, I never got to it)

**Lab Rats** (Another classic, just like with Four Elements trainer, I was more in it for the well made slow burn corruption. There are some scenes of public sex, but that’s about it. I just kept seeing this game pop up whenever I would search)

**Valentina’s Story** (An oldie, but goodie. The corruption is a BIT slow, but you can choose more revealing outfits and there are a few public sex scenes. More on this list for its lost potential than the amount of content, as game updates infamously stopped a while ago)

**Violated Heroine** (A supposed classic in this genre, I can tell the game is well made but there may be too much to do, like in Curse Armor. I still need to give this game another chance. There is a clothing system there, and you can force her to go naked, but I don’t know if it will allow her to walk around like that.)

**Civilian Justice League** (A Clymenia game, but actually the one I like the least. The combat system was a bit too boring for me. There’s a sequel I recently finished that I would recommend much more, **Civilian Justice League 2**)

**Witch Act** (Another Clymenia game. Great art and scenes, but you can tell it’s one of his earlier works. The public nudity comes from one town in the game where the protagonist is automatically brainwashed every time she enters, discarding her clothes every time)

**Curse of Pleasure** (Not finished, last time I played, short on content. The game is promising to have exhibitionism content, so keep an eye out for it, I guess?)

**Fallen Bitch Leona’s Exhibitionist Altelier** (I mean, it’s in the title, but the only English translation I found was REALLY bad, bad enough for me to not continue playing it after the beginning scene. Maybe you’ll have better luck with it)

**Holy Knight Olyana** (Clymenia game, but I can’t remember if it has a lot of exhibitionist content. Definitely a lot of the protagonist being raped, though)

**Hypno-Sex RPG** (By Swallows999. There’s one scene that deals with exhibitionism, but I’m more recommending this cause I know the creator, he does good work on free-use and public nudity stories on CHYOA, so I suggest you read his work. You’ll see why I have this on my list)

**Marionette Fantasy** (Only got to play this recently, so I haven’t finished it. The game involves fourth wall breaking, where the character knows she’s in a video game and knows that YOU are controlling her. She can’t move otherwise. You can make her go to a bathhouse and strip. Then, you can just walk back outside and continue the rest of the game like it. NPC’s take note. Promising, so it’s on my list.)

**Midnight Exposure Girl** (Art is whatever, it does fit well into the genre, but it’s a bit buggy. I didn’t get too far into it)

**Naked Female Knight Ulrica** (I played this for a bit but stopped halfway through, don’t remember why. The female protagonist is cursed with armor that shows off her tits, among other things, so she spends the whole game showing off at least that in public.)

**Princess Trainer** (Not a lot of exhibitionism content, but more famous for its slow burn corruption. Jasmine’s public nudity stuff is in her ending.)

**Luxuria** (Clymenia game, supposedly you play as the blonde chick from Liz of the Tower, but there are some contradictions if you subscribe to that. Options to walk around naked, with NPC’s responding to it. She’s loving it by the end of it)

**Salvation** (Yet another Clymenia game, where you control 4 characters. I didn’t finish it but booting up a completed save shows you can get each character naked in public. One of the scenes involves the princess being used as a urinal, so fuck yes, get on my list)

**Sangeki of Gear** (Too slow in its corruption for my taste, but it does have some exhibitionist content. Not enough for me, but might be good for you)

**Something Unlimited** (Helps if you like Justice League Unlimited. You can have some of your characters stand around naked and you have brainwashed superheroines stripping in public. Not really exhibitionism, but still a favorite of mine cause I love Justice League Unlimited)

**The Humbling Experience** (I keep hearing it has public nudity, but I never got far enough cause I got lost.)

**The Nobleman’s Retort** (You don’t play as a woman, but you can hypnotize both female characters to walk around naked and be public sluts for the public at some point. It is a Clymenia game, so it has good art.)

**Era Hunter** (I only played a bit of it, but you can walk around naked.)

**Melty’s Quest** (I liked this one. Takes a bit to get to the public nudity, but it has a lot of outfits you can find and make her walk around in. Each one even has an ability you can level up, so it’s fun to find new outfits. Also a pretty extensive sex stats list)

**Sword Princess Cistina** (You can walk around naked from the start, though here, it’s actually something of a bad thing. If you like it, that’s great, but I like it when NPC’s respond to it by taking advantage of the female protag or rape her. You gotta play a lot for her to get into a “lust” mode where she becomes a cheap whore and sleeps with any male NPC. It’s good, just doesn’t go as far as some of my other favorite games, and it keeps it from being near the top of my list.)

**Material Girl** (Haven’t played much of it, but there are clothing options, and I hope one allows you to go fully naked. If anyone plays it, please let me know if it’s worth the time)

**Treasure Hunter Mai** (Same with Sword Princess Cistina, considering it’s from the same developer)

Finally, the current games I’m losing myself in…

Nymphomania Paradox (I love this. She starts off being a totally willing slut already, so the focus of the game is getting her into worse and worse situations with multiple endings. It doesn’t take too long to raise her lust enough to walk around naked, and I can’t wait to see what other scenes I can get out of this. Highly recommended)

Rouge-Like Evolution (I wish I'd played this game a lot sooner. A slowburn corruption game that doesn't take too long, two women to play with and you can order both to walk around campus naked)

And that’s it! Like I said, this is ongoing, so please let me know if you have a game that’s not on this list. Maybe we can keep updating it and make it a definitive list for people like us who can't get enough of exhibitionism in our games."

I am finishing up my Bachelors degree for Culinary Science and working as a Research and Development Intern.  Getting paid about $750-$800 bi-weekly.  I have a 2 year old daughter, and receive $500 of child support each month.  I am currently living with my parents so I don’t have to pay rent or utilities.I was dumb enough to dig myself into a hole of debt, and now that I am done being irresponsible with my money, I want to get out of debt as soon as possible.  I also recently cancelled all of my unneeded subscriptions and memberships (Gym, Netflix, etc).

Here are my Expenses:

Credit Cards—Debt—Min Payment—Interest Rate

USBank#1—$5115.40–$164.00——25.49%	

USBank#2–$804.95–$30.00——14.49%

Chase#1—$4000.00–$55.00——16.49%

Chase#2–$1250.00	—$25.00——(No interest until 2/2019)

Loans

Student—$4,707.28	—$50.00——7.6% (Variable)

Car	—$11,224.87–$209.00——3.75%

Other Bills
Phone Bill				$101.77
Health insurance		$27.68
Life Insurance			$37.84
Dental Insurance		$30.91

Total Income/month: About $2050
Total Bills:  About $731.20

Miscellaneous/Variable expenses
My daughter goes to daycare 1-2 days per week  at $25.00 per day, depending on whether my dad (retired) can watch her or not.
My internship is out of town, so I am also totaling about $275.00 per month in gas. I have a 2011 Chevy Equinox AWD 2LT, V6 with about 90k miles. (Currently getting 22-23mpg)
Note: As for things like groceries, and diapers, the amount I spend is highly variable, depending on what my parents decide to help out with.  Groceries(Including things like diapers and wipes) ranges from $100-$200 per month.  (This does not include eating out, which I no longer partake in, unless someone else is paying. 

On another side note: I do have $1000 in an emergency fund, $1000 in a Roth IRA, and $750 in savings as a cushion if I need something extra to pay bills (most of my bills are due at the beginning of the month and I don’t always have a large enough paycheck to cover the whole amount, so I take from savings and replace it with the next paycheck if need be.)

I am hoping to increase my income after my internship is over.  It ends at the end of July.  I graduate in August, so I should be able to find a full time position right out of my internship.    
I have considered getting a second part time job in town on Saturdays and Sundays in order to increase my income to pay off debt faster.  I only want to do this as a last resort because that’s even less time I will get with my daughter, not to mention, those are the only days I really get an opportunity spend with my boyfriend.  He is supportive of my decisions and wants me to get out of debt too, but we’ve only been together since February.  I’m afraid if I have no time to spend with him, it will drive our relationship out the door.  I have also considered selling my car and getting a cheaper car that gets better gas mileage in order to expedite the process.

Asking for some advice on what the best plan of action might be!

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

the first night i fell asleep in your arms seems like a forever ago. it was on a beach in northern california, you whispered to me with your arms around me; pointing up to the stars ""you and me, we can learn to escape up there.... together"" i never looked at the ocean or the stars or you the same way after that night.

you were right about one thing. i did learn to escape with you. for what felt like ever i got to live in a romance made for movie screens. a picture perfect relationship, on the arm of a picture perfect boy. MY picture perfect everything.

who would have known that a stranger i met on a snowy day on the new york metro at 16 was the one i thought would be my last first kiss. who would have thought that i would fall in love with a california boy thousands of miles from his home. who would have believed that what we had was requitted. who would guess that telling yourself to be empirical is easier than letting love flood your heart and sting your eyes. i can tell you one thing; i never did.

life is taking you places. it brought you to me but its taking you to a new country every other week. it is taking you to countless hotel rooms. it is taking you to the back of an uber suv every morning to whatever coffee shop you are feeling that day. it is taking you from internship to internship. it finally decided where to take you for good though

and that was germany

working for the foreign service us state department

across the world

this morning when we were taking you to the airport, your mom told me she felt bad for me.

""moms know they have to let their kids go and do their own things someday... you on the other hand...""

i hugged you for what felt like thirty seconds but was actually 8 minutes at the ticket counter and bawled. you smiled and laughed to keep yourself from doing the same. i held your hand while you waited in the security line, then you went through. then you stood there and looked at me for a minuted, blew a kiss, and headed to the international terminal. i was a mess.

i think this all was easier for you than it was for me and im trying to make myself believe that it is only because you have your childhood dream waiting for you half a world away and im trying to be happy for you but im selfish

i guess what i am trying to say is letting go is harder than breathing but its the best choice, right? when you cant be with who you are meant to love. it was not supposed to work out. i need to let you go but if i do im sure i will lose you and that is not a commitment i am willing to make.

to me this is one sided premature agony but please dont break please dont go please hold on when you come back please feel like i am worth it please think of my eyes when you add amaretto creamer to your morning coffee please think of us dancing when you hear any taylor swift song please think of my laugh when you watch the office please think of me when you can smell my perfume on that jacket of yours you love but always let me wear please think of my hair when you see a golden reflection in sun

please think of how we learned to escape in a wonderland of love when you look at the stars. please also count down the days until you visit. please be as excited as me for it. please put your arms around me and make it feel like more than 30 seconds."

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*"

I started playing freshman year of high school and made the team because I was y’all but didn’t know how to play, I would play for 2 months in the school season and wouldn’t touch a volleyball until tryouts so kinda regretted that. Therefore after junior year school season and playing 9 man and club through summer and  senior year allowed me to improve exponentially. However this summer I have an internship in China until the end of August and I have been here since beginning of June, and I can’t play because I don’t have time and I will also be traveling to visit family and I can’t find a place to play here that offers open gyms or opportunities without expensive yearly commitments. So I really don’t want to lose my progress this past year and a half that I worked really hard on after regretting not playing club the previous 3 years, and at this pace I don’t know if I’ll make try college club team.

About to graduate.,zoochadookdook,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8tq8iv/career_options_26_about_to_graduate/,"Hey all, So I'm trying to set up my financial future prior to getting married and have a slightly unique situations.

I've been self employed pulling around 25-30k a year for the past 5 years. Current situations

Assets: 

$400 AMD stock

$1500 bitcoin

$21500 Roth ira

$22000 cash (direct sales based so cash on hand is always required)

$11,500 in current inventory 

$13000 checking/saving debit

House loan is around 110000 left. Original purchase was 141 with 12 down. Current market is around 170-180 (Zillow says 215 but that seems a bit much).

Debt:

11000 student loans

600 credit cards

Bills:

Mortgage $584

utilities: avg 225 (gas, elect, water, internet)

Taxes and insurance 383

misc (gas, food) 200

Roth IRA contribution (484)

car is a pos Honda that runs great so no car payment

total= roughly 1800

Current income (for the next 2 months)

12 bucks a week 40 hours a week (data analyst internship) 

1600 after taxes each month

maybe 1000 off self employment

600 from renter (have been renting a room in my house for the last 7 months)

I graduate in fall of this year (will have to pay that semester still but no big deal) with a degree in Management information systems. Unfortunately the job market seems to want all back end developers/IT coders and majors. This has left me in a predicament; should I try to get an entry level job in the field (help desk oye) and try to grind up from 25k a year temp work or should I consider a change to the trade field (electrician) where you average 35k a year with annual raises starting out as an apprentice? I'm focusing on my financial future because even though being self employed is great; it isn't constant. I could scrape by and barely pull 1800 a month to pay everything and the next month make 3000. I'd like something with benefits and stability. Any advice is appreciated.

Looking for some guidance before I consolidate and end my grace period. I graduated in May and have federal loans and a small private residency relocation loan from interview season . 

I moved to a high cost of living area (even with roommates) and would like to use my left over money to pay down the higher interest residency relocation loan (although I won’t be in repayment for that for 3 years, interest is accruing and I at least want to make a dent in it). So $0 payments on my federal loans all of intern year would be ideal. 

Problem: I had read the language changed for IBR that asks if your income has significantly changed since (I believe) you filed your taxes. My plan was to consolidate before intern year but I procrastinated and was unexpectedly (but pleasantly) paid for orientation in early June. 

Question: can I still claim $0 income (based on MS4 taxes) and consolidate my federal loans now for $0 payments for intern year or have I missed that boat? My med school financial aid office hasn’t returned my call for a week but I am thinking about reaching out to Great Lakes to see what they think.

8tr9kd,3,2018-06-25,Health Insurance Marketplace Dependent Question,adorablegay,HealthInsurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/8tr9kd/health_insurance_marketplace_dependent_question/,"For the 2017 tax year, we claimed my brother-in-law as a dependent because he lived with us, was in school full-time, and got over half of his financial support from us.  We also used his dependent status to get him insurance subsidies on the health insurance marketplace through our household because he didn't make enough money on his own to qualify for subsidies.

Things are a little more up in the air this year.  For 2018, based on financial support, he could be claimed by either us, his new girlfriend, or even himself, since he's making $12,000 in an unexpected internship.  He also turned 26 this year and is still a full-time student, and I'm not totally sure how that factors in. 

If we don't claim him on our 2018 taxes, will we have to pay back all of the health care subsidies he received in 2018?

The computer board is [an Intel Up Board.](http://www.up-board.org/up/specifications/) I am having trouble figuring out how to approach powering on and off.

There are three possible ways of dealing with this that I'm considering:

1) Up board is always powered. When on, peripheral devices (projector, fans, etc) get powered on, and power off when the Up board turns off. The 3.3V rail on the GPIO is only powered when the Up board is on, so its power state would be detected by the power management board that way. The downside is that this would require an extra cable/connector.

2) Same as above, but detecting whether the Up board is powered based on current draw. Is this feasible? How would I approach this, with a shunt resistor, an op-amp and a comparator?

3) Up board and peripherals all start powered off. The power button is connected to the Up board and the power management board, rather than just the Up board like in the previous options. When everything is off, pressing the power button switches power on to all of the devices and the Up board automatically boots. When turning the system off, the button press is detected by the Up board, which immediately turns off, and the power management board, which waits a set amount of time for the Up board to power down before powering off everything. I'm not sure how I would cheaply implement this delay though.

Are there any options I'm missing? What is the cheapest reliable solution here?"

At the time, the account had been suspended and part of my task involved figuring out why, resolving the issue(s), and then getting it unsuspended.

We've had the account for a number of years, and as employees have come and gone it has changed hands many times. It had previously been managed by a student intern. During my review, I determined that one of the violations was that we had pointed our ads to more than one domain in a few ads. I fixed those ads, resubmitted, then Google told me there was another violation, and another. Ultimately, I ended up removing the majority of our ads from the account at the directon of an Adwords technician. The account now has a couple of adword groups, one or two campaigns, and just a few ads running.

I heard recently that Google will be cracking down this Summer on non profits who are a part of their adwords grant program. We are a part of this. They will be eliminating organizations who are below the 5&amp;#37; CTR minimum. Right now we are at 3&amp;#37; and I'm trying to raise it.

I am wondering what steps I could take to revitalize the campaigns and legitimately raise the CTR before Google begins its review. I'm also looking for some help with working out a strategy for our adwords account.

Our president (my manager) has said that Adwords should receive a minimum of time/effort, just enough to keep the adwords updated and the account running. I've asked, and we don't have the budget to hire consultants.

I am  hoping that someone can help."

I've worked in HR for 4 years in the same company and 2 years prior to that at an internship elsewhere.

Recently, we (HR) have been challenged on our practices for processing STD by some of the managers within the organization.  

HR's view/practice:  Employee would approach HR with the need for STD.  Once all paperwork is in place, we inform the manager of the time frame (Out July 1st through August 7th for example) and if needed, we discuss getting a temp or how we fill that role.  It is not our view that an employee should tell their manager first about needing to take STD as there are documents and employee confidential information a manager shouldn't be privy to.

A few of our managers views:  Employees should come to them first to discuss STD, then they would bring it up to HR together.  This way, the manager would have advance knowledge of a role that may need to be filled and can plan ahead.  I should note they skirted around the issue of actually KNOWING the medical condition, but ultimately said ""we don't need to know why they are out.""

Our concern in HR is how this may affect an employee.  They may not be on good terms with the manager and be fearful of either not being taken seriously or being told they should use PTO or something else instead of STD.  We also worry that the employee would feel pressure to share what their medical condition is, which would cause added stress.  One thing I've heard before from many people, not just management, is that if they had an experience or knew someone who had a similar experience to the employees stated medical condition, then judgment seems to be passed on how long they think the employee could/should be out, despite doctors paperwork.  This leads to the thought process of employees 'milking it', which I'm ashamed to say I've fallen into, before catching and correcting myself.

I've looked online to see if there are certain HIPAA guidelines that advise on this.  My hope would be to concretely tell managers that they can not ask employees to come to them first with serious medical issues.  Unless it's a cold that's keeping them out just a couple of days, any serious medical condition should not be known by their manager.  However, the employee may choose to share that information at their discretion. 

Does anyone have any insight or experience with these conflicts?  Also, any policy documentation you've read that can advise on this?

Thanks."

I don't care about the aura types as long as it somewhat fits their characterisation:

#Namui Mauglie:


Position: expedition leader/navigator

Occupation: Carthography hunter (exploring and mapping out unmapped places)

Mantra: Whats the point of going somewhere, where you already know how it looks?

#Serpiente de Cascabel:

Hobbies: reading, observing nature, writing a dairy

Mantra: Every day is like a chapter you only get to read once.

#Lio Kampheppo

Hobbies: knife games, going on adventure, helping others achieve their goals

Mantra: Don't do what Namui tells you to do!

#Teodore Markus


Position: muscel/bodyguard

Occupation: Temp hunter (gets paied to carry the heavy stuff)

Hobbies: exercising, daydreaming, playing with stones

Mantra: The helper helps because he knows how it is to be helpless.


Group's history: 

Namui was a hunter searching for sponsors for her expedition into the Soiretsym mountains, when she stumbeled over Serpiente; a young lawer and fresh backed hunter who dreamed of unclaimed riches. She tought him about nen and he intern orgenized her first expedition: only the best of the best that next to no money can you get: Indy, the in depts swimming botanist, Lio who's as brave as he's cheap and on Lios recomandation Teodore.

This sort of sentiment was repeated by my mom in various ways (sometimes using Disney Princess-type imagery), especially when she and SD first got married. When I first repeated that line to my therapist, she did a full-stop about-face and asked me, ""Wait. How old is your mother?"" 

And that's when I first had the inkling that she, my mother,  just miiight be entirely full of shit. Or at least 60&amp;#37; full of shit.

This post is meant to be an introductory post to my mom, as years later, I'm trying to get a grip on the abuse she poured out to me between the ages of 16-20. I lurk here and on the CPTSD subreddits, because I want to move forward with my life, and sometimes I think that my desire for my mother's attention is holding me back. Also, I feel very bewildered about what happened during that time, so here's a few events in no particular order.

* When I finished my first year of college, I failed to get an internship that would let me live in the city I wanted to be in, and returned to spend a summer at home. Mom WAS NOT happy about that, and I remember feeling especially shameful that I couldn't secure a job for myself. She repeatedly threatened me to take me to the homeless shelter where she completed her internship to become a licensed counselor (OH yes, llamas, she's a professionally licensed counselor, and still actively practicing), and threw me out of the house at one point because I was ""NOT SAFE"". To be fair, I threw a desk lego structure at the ground right before she kicked me out, but, also, to be fair, this happened when she was in the middle of her tirades about me never leaving the house, despite the fact that I had nowhere to go. I'll never forget the grin on her face after I snapped and she ordered me outside; it almost seemed like this was what she wanted to happen.
   * As an aside, my college had no program for internships or anything like that, and years later, I realized that it was not normal for freshmen to get an internship after their first summer. Zero of the friends I have now, who are all talented, well-paid people, got an internship after their first year.

* Speaking of ""nowhere to go"", she considered it ""not her job"" to teach me how to drive. This was a big battleground for us. We were from the outskirts of a major city in the US known for its driving culture, and comparable lack of public transit. Learning to drive is mandatory, especially if you want any kind of job. The options she gave me were to learn from my stepdad (who was a terrible teacher), or pay from my own pocket for a professional driving class. I was PISSED about this, because all of my friends had learned to drive from their parents. And before we can say it was a money thing, my dad was paying enough child support for me alone that the classes could be easily afforded. I didn't even live at home from 16-18 because I had a scholarship to a boarding school that I had won with my hard work, and most things that weren't covered by the scholarship, my mother dipped into my college funds to pay for, which I pieced together after the fact.

* The summer after I graduated high school, my mom would not leave me alone about the dishes. ""You're so messy,"" ""you never clean up,"" etc etc etc. Both she and my stepdad would corner me about how messy I was in the kitchen. I generally felt bewildered and defensive, and I never was clear on what they wanted from me, kitchen-wise. It got so bad, I left home to go live at my aunt's house for a year. After I left, my mother texted me, ""LOL \[Jenga\] Turns out it wasn't you that was messy in the kitchen! It was us.""

There's a lot more little stories like above that I'll get into. I'm trying to piece together what happened, and it seemed like the moment my mother married my stepdad, she wanted me gone, and any moment that I had to be dependent on her, she resented it. She most certainly projected the worst qualities on my emotionally abusive father onto me, and although I had some FLEAS, I'm starting to think that the way she treated me wasn't fair, and that the anger I feel towards her is entirely warranted.  


Thanks for this sub, and thanks for reading. The most helpful thing I've found so far is the metaphor about the normal-meter being out of whack, and I'm hoping I can do the work to restore it to its greatest potential."

Let me preface my comments with a couple matters. Back before your old pal, Bud, was permanently excommunicated from Twitter Land, I used to frequent the litterbox fire that is Salon. The appeal in it for me was the fact that they bravely go where nobody before them has gone. The glaring omission, however, is that before they go there they forget to ask why it is that nobody has ever gone there before them. Are they engaging in groundbreaking journalism? Let me answer my own question with a question: If nobody else eats dog shit, isn’t the reason pretty self-evident? 

But, no, Salon boldly forges ahead with such cartoonish takes, narratives, and whacky conspiracy theories that even similarly-situated online millennial-driven, leftist cult sites like “Mother Jones” and “Daily KOS” look sane in comparison.

Now, when I say that I like Salon, let me be clear. I do not “like” them like I like nice pale ale accompanied with a sun-grown Habano. No. I “like” them in that I find Salon immensely amusing, in the same way I find it amusing to watch adults with Down’s Syndrome try to split a lunch bill. 

Amanda Marcotte is the heart and soul of Salon. Without Amanda, Salon would just be a tub full of cat shit. Amanda is the fire burning beneath the tub of cat shit that causes it to boil and emit its foul glory for  miles around. 

So, on to today’s offering from shit spinner and troubled individual, Amanda Marcotte. It is titled “Is Donald Trump Truly Incompetent? Not Nearly As Much As Liberals Hope” 

Hyperlink To Hypershitsville: https://www.salon.com/2018/06/25/is-donald-trump-truly-incompetent-not-half-as-much-as-liberals-hope/

Mandy takes the position that she is more wise than her contemporary leftist trash and their assumption that Trump, worth over a billion dollars, is an idiot. Mandy thinks that Trump is a genius, but only inasmuch as that entails trolling the left and being a sadist. According to Marcotte, Trump probably IS an idiot, but he is not incompetent. 

For example, Mandy accuses Trump of being “incurious, half-literate, and would almost certainly be flummoxed by a basic math problem or a grade school reading comprehension test.” In other words, Trump is an oversized toddler. She then says Trump ran several businesses into bankruptcy. 

First, let me say that Amanda has no personal knowledge of Trump. She has never sat down and had a conversation with the man. All she knows is what she has read of him in the leftist press, with her mind already made up on him. Second, Amanda clearly leads a sheltered life. Trump restructured the finances of his subsidiaries through chapter 11. Nothing was “ran into bankruptcy”. Of course, for slow adults like old Mandy, if she has never heard of it, then it surely does not exist. 

At this point, the depraved and mindless nature of this article is already at the point of being nearly unbearable, and I am only a couple paragraphs into it. As I sit here in my office this afternoon writing this review, I have just finished my lunch and am fucking off for a bit before I move on to another task. But at the moment I am feeling the urge to defecate. But the urge, I fear, does not have its genesis in the chicken salad I just ate. Rather, I think it is the bile inducing tripe to which I have subjected myself. Voluntarily reading and parsing articles on Salon is like the literary version of “Jackass”. 

Ok, I have now pulled myself together, somewhat, and will attempt to move forward. Shortly into this article ... BLEEEEEEEEEECCCCHHHHHH!!! .... Uh.. sorry, I just puked. 

Shortly into this “article”, Mandy plugs her book, “Troll Nation: How the Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set on Rat-Fucking Liberals, America, and Truth Itself.”  

BLLLLLEEEEEEECCCCCCCHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

Sorry. 

Apparently, this Leftist tome of hate argues that Trump was elected for the purpose of imposing “his white supremacist vision on America.” 

At this point my monitor is frozen. This is not surprising, as Salon’s website is full of cookies, malware, and other shit in a lame attempt to make a buck. As was well reported last year, Salon was almost evicted from its offices because it could not pay its rent on time. 

Ok, so at this point my computer appears locked and fucked. I am going to switch to mobile while I run a program to scan my desk top for viruses and malware. Motherfuckers!!

Alright, so Marcotte sincerely believes that Trump is all about white supremacy and trolling liberal trash (like herself). Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. But the derangement Syndrome people like Mandy are infected with is SO ACUTE that they will see everything in terms of race even if the substance is objectively race-neutral. For example, tax reform (only benefits wealthy people, and blacks as a group are not wealthy); and military updates and upgrades (this only protects the white patriarchal power structure; the black man will fight and die for whitey, like back in the slaving days). Marcotte is so intellectually cucked and corrupted by bias that her opinions are masquerading as Analysis. She is useless to ANY discussion on policy. 

At this point I am halfway through this literary abortion. I read it in toto while I ate my lunch. This is the second time through for me. My idea was that I would read it with a stream of consciousness review of what I was reading. I did the same thing with a Digby piece last week, and it was hilarious. 

As I scan through the balance of Marcotte‘s tripe I come to the conclusion that it becomes exponentially less interesting each time you read it. The second half of this piece just reiterates the first half, to wit: Trump is an evil simpleton who takes glee in trolling the poor, innocent prog-Left, Trump is a white supremacist, and he is working by design rather than being a bumbling idiot (like she says GW Bush was). She actually goes on to assert, as fact, that GW’s Iraq war was a “failure” due to his incompetence. This literally pains me to hear, as it evidences a clear break with reality for Mandy. While I did not personally agree with waging Iraq War 2.0, it was far from a failure. The war was quickly, decisively, and efficiently won by our military. When GW announced “mission accomplished”, he was absolutely correct. 

What the media and left are just too stupid to get is that there were 2 “wars”: there was the war against Iraqi military and Saddam Hussein, and there was the more general “war on terror” we were engaged in post-9/11. The latter has never ended. The former, however, ended pretty quickly. What lasted a longer time was the period of OCCUPATION during the post-war phase. Occupations have occurred all through history. They are many times just as bloody and deadly as the conflict itself. But, there is a clear demarcation between war and post-war occupation. 

Clearly, by all objective standards, GW won the war. We then OCCUPIED Iraq, during which time we sought to clean up the mess so that Iraq could rebuild. Frankly, we wrapped things up pretty quickly. There was the ISIS problem that arose for awhile. But the swift acting leadership of Trump cut the head off that snake. The problem is (1) the media and left conflated the war on terror with the post-Iraq-war occupation; and (2) Republicans and media let them get away with this false narrative. I know GW Bush is not into trash talking the leftist swine. But, Goddamn, if you do not fight back then you get morons like Marcotte treating narratives as fact. 

One can consume one’s self with the nuances of policy, practice, and politics before, during, and after the war. But it is a hard argument to make and maintain that the world is worse off today than it was before Saddam Hussein was ousted from power. At the time, I thought containment was satisfactory. That’s neither here nor there at this point, though. But maintaining that the war was a “failure” notwithstanding the many positives that have flowed therefrom evidences either a total break from reality or a corrupt set of values. It is difficult to imagine such people exist, let alone exist within the USA. Such is the line of thought you would normally associate with the product of a Third World nation. 

So, here is what I get out of Mandy’s project: Blah blah...Trump is racist ...blah blah.... white supremacy .....blah blah blah..... I AM AMANDA  MARCOTTE, LOOK AT ME!!!!! .... blah blah ... white supremacy ... Blah blah .....trolling ..... blah blah blah .... I HATE MY FATHER!!! .... blah blah blah. 

If you have ever read any of this chick’s stuff, then it is pretty much all the same. Typical unhinged, leftish rubbish. 

A couple of final points. First, if these writers for Salon were decent technical writers, were intelligent, and had anything worthwhile to say to anyone besides pot heads, then they would be working for a real, and credible, media outlets. I mean, even look at CNN. As biased and whacked out as those fuckers are, can you imagine reading an online article on CNN even half as nutty as something Marcotte or Digby write? I can’t. These clowns are, at best, MSNBC caliber. 

I mean, I am not even sure the “writers” at Salon even get a paycheck. Marcotte may very well be a 20 yr intern. If she does get a paycheck from Salon, it cannot be much (and it almost certainly includes blowjobs). 

Second, and I know this is going to come across poorly to those with delicate sensibilities, but no discussion of Mandy Marcotte can be complete without addressing the elephant in the room: Mandy looks like a whore one would get if he is on a budget. I means, tats all over the fucking place, face like an abused baboon’s ass, she is a fucking disaster. Mercifully there does not appear to be any image of her attached to this particular article. 

A person’s appearance says something about them. If you wear a nice, pressed white shirt and a tie to work, it shows that you care about your appearance. If you take time to care about your appearance, then an employer will think that you probably take time and pride in your work product. But, if your work is associated with gross photos of you looking like some  unwashed hag who’s stink is so bad that your senses fool you to believe you can even smell her THROUGH the photo, then you end up working at some career- ending shit hole like Salon. 

So, yeah, Mandy Marcotte is vile trash as a human being. But I would still dig hanging out with her just for the experience. I just know that all my guesses and theories about her would be confirmed, plus some glorious surprises!! "

I applied for so many jobs throughout my senior year; I even got 3 offers, so I know I’m qualified and employable, but none of them felt right so I rejected them. But now everything seems bleak.  It’s so exhausting sending cover letter after cover letter, resume after resume, going to interviews, and getting a “thanks but no thanks.”

I’m genuinely so disappointed in myself and my situation. I keep seeing my friends moving, getting job offers they’re excited about, etc. and it triggers my anxiety really bad, then makes me depressed and feel like shit because I was always the person who had their shit together, had a solid internship, had good grades, and now? Nothing. 

My anxiety spirals and I start thinking about how I’ve not only disappointed myself but those around me. My parents say they’re proud of me, but it’s hard for me to see that. When I look at myself in these moments, I see someone who is going to amount to nothing and disappoint my parents and my family. There’s a lot of pressure on me because my brother didn’t turn out the way my parents wanted and I want to uphold my family legacy. I want to be successful. I want all of the struggles my parents went through to mean something. I honestly feel like such a failure right now and I’m losing hope."

Details, scenes and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8tuleg/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood afternoon DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

Although I am applying for other journalism jobs, I'm considering quitting my job with nothing yet lined up. But, obviously, I'm worried that that would be a fatal mistake in the job hunt.

Here's what's going through my head:

Months into this job I feel like the value of the experience I'm getting has plateaued. What I do amounts to flipping press releases and writing the same story over and over with a slightly different angle. No wading into multimedia, no expansion of my beats, and not making valuable connections. The topic areas of tech that we focus on are so hyper-specific and do not interest me in the least. I'm not motivated to expand my responsibilities because it means going further and further and further along a career path I'm not interested in.

Like I said, I'm applying for other journalism jobs - looking at other B2B publications, tech reporting jobs, and public radio (in which I have some internship experience). But as you can imagine it's hard to keep up with the job hunt when you're working full-time.

**So my concern comes down to: If I quit this job, is that going to be an irredeemable blemish on my resume? Is it professional suicide? Or does it sound justified based on how I described my current job above?**

Thank you for your insight!"

(Wife intern progress),roblestion,Hotwife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hotwife/comments/8tur6f/what_a_weekend_wife_intern_progress/,"So my wife and I are new to this hotwife lifestyle. Check out my previous posts to get caught up on her intern at work and her progress. 

So we made some MAJOR progress this weekend! My wife decided to call the intern from work and invite him out for dinner to meet me and see if it’s something we’d all click with. We discussed what all she’d be comfortable doing and she stated she wouldn’t be okay with sex with someone else yet and I somewhat agree. I’d rather us both ease into things rather than do things we regret. So we agreed to go with the flow.

Saturday evening we met up with the intern and he was actually a really nice guy we had some appetizers at a restaurant and he asked how long we’d been doing stuff like this and seemed kind of embarrassed that he kissed my wife but I told him I liked it. He wanted to confirm there would be no MM stuff I totally agreed. It was a relaxing time and we kind of laid out the rules that we wouldn’t have sex or take it that far. I had the wrong impression of him he seemed like a down to earth guy. We didn’t want him knowing where we live so we agreed to just park the car at a good spot with low traffic my wife and I go to to mess around sometimes and see what happens. I sat in the backseat and told them to go for it.

I was shaking and rock hard my wife was giggling uncontrollably we were all a bit nervous. He leaned over and they started making out I immediately pulled my dick out and almost came but held it to see what happens. He took her hand and put it on his crotch my wife started rubbing through his shorts while they were still making out. He pulled his shorts down and took it out. I’m longer but he’s definitely thicker idk if it’s normal to notice that haha. My wife grabbed his dick and started jacking it up and down they didn’t stop kissing for a second all I saw were tongues flying everywhere. My wife reached her hand back and grabbed my dick too and started jerking ya both at the same time! I seriously had to focus on not cumming this was the first time my wife had two dicks in front of me!

 I noticed that the intern had his hands inside my wife’s jeans and she was bucking around. We have never had. Guy finger her before so this was awesome to see. She pulled her jeans down right under her butt and I saw two of his fingers smacking in and out of her pussy and heard “splashing” lol. She was still kissing him and just him off as she moved her hand away from mine to get more comfortable. He stopped kissing her and asked if she wanted to suck it. I could tell she was really horny she had the look in her eyes where she’d do anything. She looked at me I was just holding my dick not jerking to avoid cumming I said it’s upto you Babe. I didn’t know if she’d do it then I saw her head go down and bob up and down in his lap. He moved her hair out of the way and I moved over to get a better view and I saw my wife sucking another mans dick!! I couldn’t take it and came almost instantly and pulled her hand on my dick to give her my cum she kept sucking him and I was still jacking off which never happens I usually need a break but was so into it. 

She continued giving him head and he was smacking her bare ass until he finally told her he’s cumming. My wife took her mouth off and let him cum on her lips and I actually was ready to cum again so she turned to face me. Not much came out from me but enough to see her with two loads on her face. We all sat there sweating and my wife asked for a towel we had one handy in the car and she wiped herself off. The intern said that was awesome and said anytime y’all wanna do that again we can. My wife was very quiet so I asked if she was okay she said yea I just need to catch my breath. She pulled her pants up we all did and we drove back to the interns car at the restaurant. He said to call him whenever and that he’d keep this between us. He shook my hand and reached into hug my wife and then kissed her goodbye and she kissed him back. After he left I talked to my wife about why she was quiet she said she couldn’t believe that happened I asked if she regretted it she said she didn’t and she loved it but she didn’t get to cum lol!

When we got home I ate my wife out until she came and we had perhaps the best sex we’ve ever had and talked about the experience during sex. She asked me things like if I liked watched her suck another mans cock while we were having sex! It was amazing!

So yea that’s a recap of this weekend lol. "

melt*my*heart is a unisex gourmand fragrance and silence*the*sea is a unisex aromatic aquatic fragrance. I purchased the samples for this review from Luckyscent, and there are no affiliate links in this, or any, or my reviews. These reviews are for the EdP fragrances. Pure oil perfumes are also available.

Neither of these fragrances are likely to be blind-buys for just about anyone, due to their exorbitant cost, but I would particularly recommend to definitely **not** blind-buy silence*the*sea. You may love it, I did not. And I do love most ""dirty oceanic"" fragrances.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of my favorite pastimes is to go to the [Luckyscent website](https://www.luckyscent.com/) and click on the ""New Additions"" header to see what fragrances have just been released, and what lines have been recently added by the store. I usually end up ordering samples of most of them, because I have an insatiable curiosity about how things smell. Once I know it exists, I must sniff it for myself. These samples join the hundreds of other unworn samples in my backlog of scents to try. That is how I ended up with these samples from strangelove nyc.

Someday I will gain the self-discipline to try all of the samples that I have on hand before ordering new ones. Meanwhile, I find myself particularly intrigued by the new scents that cost a fortune -- I love to look at their lists of extravagant ingredients, and their flowery descriptions. While waiting for the samples to arrive, I start to prepare myself for the kind of sacrifices (and justifications) that it takes to fall in love with a perfume priced in the $7-10 per mL range.

In 1975, French racecar driver Hervé Poulain commissioned artist Alexander Calder to create the first BMW ""Art Car,"" an auto painted like a canvas, which Poulain drove in the 1975 Le Mans Endurance Race. Since then, [BMW Art Cars](http://www.artcar.bmwgroup.com/en/art-car/) have been produced by many famous artists, but the one that speaks to me most is entitled ""Protect Me From What I Want."" Created in 1999 by American neo-conceptual artist Jenny Holzer, the car has phrases written on it, like ***The Unattainable is Invariably Attractive***. This about sums up my experience with perfume, I'm always finding myself drawn to things that are rare, expensive, and difficult to obtain. So, a few months ago when I opened the New Additions page to find $795 bottles of EdPs from strangelove nyc, I knew that I had to smell them

## strangelove nyc

strangelove nyc is one of those companies that shuns capital letters. Perhaps to be artsy or avant-garde, perhaps ""to let the work speak for itself,"" perhaps to buck the conventions of linguistics that oppress us all. Or maybe for some other reason, who knows? (All I do know is that repeatedly writing perfume names with italic characters in the middle, like melt*my*heart and silence*the*sea, is kind of a pain in the rear end, so I apologize for the inconsistency if I miss an instance or two.)

The company was founded by American businesswoman Elizabeth Gaines. Gaines is also a co-founder of the company GaiaOne, which has a mission of marketing and distributing sustainable essential oils and natural raw materials. With strangelove nyc, Gaines hopes to use the highest quality materials in the world to create exquisite, luxurious fragrances. It was these materials, like natural oud and ambergris, and orris butter, that caught my attention, along with Gaines' choice of master perfumer Christophe Laudamiel to create the fragrances.

## CHRISTOPHE LAUDAMIEL

Mr. Laudamiel is somewhat of a rock star in the fragrance world at the moment, and he has a little bit of a connection to my hometown. His work is so prolific and diverse that in 2017, the Institute for Art and Olfaction presented him with an award for ""Exceptional Contribution to Scent Culture.""

Laudamiel is a perfumer and flavorist who started out as a chemist, earning a master's degree in chemistry from the European Higher Institute of Chemistry in Strausborg, where he was a champion chemist and valedictorian. He has taught chemistry at Harvard and MIT, but he got his start in perfumery at Procter &amp; Gamble as an intern right here in Cincinnati.

Laudamiel started out as a flavor chemist, creating flavors to mask the bitterness of cough syrups. While working with the flavorists, he was introduced to perfumers, and was accepted into P&amp;G's perfumery school in Newcastle. Procter &amp; Gamble is actually one of the largest perfume companies in the world -- in addition to perfuming all of their many home and personal care products, the company owns (or has owned) many beauty brands that produce perfume.

Laudamiel ended up leaving P&amp;G to pursue opportunities in creative fine fragrance and innovative projects in the fragrance realm. I'll discuss some of these in Part Two of the strangelove nyc reviews. Also, in 2002, he founded the non-profit Academy of Perfumery and Aromatics in New York. The Academy is dedicated to the advancement and education of the art of perfumery and aromatics, and offers lectures and training, along with working with the Osmotheque, and other educational institutions.

## strangelove nyc FRAGRANCES

strangelove's fragrances come in both oil form and EdP. Because 1.25 mL of the oil perfume costs $55 from either Luckyscent or the strangelove website, I chose to sample the EdP fragrances. (Even these samples are premium priced, I paid $10 for each 0.7 mL sample.) I would imagine that the oil perfumes are even more decadent, but I think that the EdPs are sufficient to familiarize oneself with the scents.

All of strangelove nyc's fragrances (to date) are built around sustainably sourced natural oud, and come with 24 karat gold-plated caps.

I was particularly intrigued to see the oil perfume necklaces. Custom-designed and plated in 24 karat gold, these charms hold 1.25 mL of strangelove nyc fragrance oil, and cost $260 - $390. I think that this is an interesting concept. I would definitely enjoy wearing jewelry that holds luxurious pure perfume oils -- but maybe not for this price, which I automatically equate with one bottle of Malle.... (anything that costs around $300 is ""Malle Money"" in my mind.)

## meltmyheart FRAGRANCE REVIEW

melt*my*heart is a gourmand oriental fragrance for men and women. It was created by Cristophe Laudamiel, along with Elizabeth Gaynes, under the creative direction of Helena Christensen. melt*my*heart was released in 2017, in both pure perfume oil and EdP concentrations.

melt*my*heart is described as ""romance and indulgence for devoted lovers.""

Upon first spray, meltmyheart smelled like those dark chocolate coated orange jelly sticks that you find in a candy store. Deep, dark chocolate, crispy and slightly bitter, with just a touch of orange oil coming through from the jelly center. As it dries down, I'm reminded of a Terry's Chocolate Orange. If you've never had a Terry's Chocolate Orange, I can't help you. You need to experience this for yourself. But here's a picture. Go forth and seek out the real thing. (Now, excuse me for a moment while I attempt to order some for same-day delivery on Amazon).

After about 20 minutes, the fragrance starts to smell more dry and dusty. The chocolate is still there, but now I can also smell something that smells like the bottom of a well-loved and well-used makeup bag. At the 30-minute mark, melt*my*heart smells very much like my beloved Too Faced Chocolate Soleil bronzer.

Over the next few hours, the deep cocoa started to fade, and some other scents became more recognizable. There was a very restrained bit of well-mannered oud. There was a fatty nuttiness that reminded me of Mauna Loa milk chocoate coconut macadamias. (If you haven't tried these, they're whole macadamias, dipped in white chocolate, then shredded coconut, then milk chocolate. Go get some.)

After three hours, the orris butter in melt*my*heart really begins to shine. Rooty, woody, violet-y, and luxurious. So smooth and lovely, with just a dusting of cocoa powder. During one of my wearings I sprayed my wrists heavily and went to bed, inhaling the delicious aroma deeply at a close distance from my face. It became quite meditative, and I detected all of the nuances of the orris much more easily. After that wearing, I could pick out the orris throughout the wear, like my heart knew exactly where to look for it.

## meltmyheart DETAILS AND FINAL IMPRESSION

melt*my*heart lasted about 8 hours on my skin, and had low but steady projection. It is gourmand, but not too sweet. The chocolate is bitter and the orris butter is decadent, and both are the stars of the show, blending seamlessly. melt*my*heart is what I wanted *Iris Ganache* to be. I enjoyed it more each time I wore it.

melt*my*heart could be worn by men and women. The powdery ""make-up"" phase of the orris, while not too intense, and buffered by the chocolate, may displease some potential male wearers. Although some descriptions make it sound sexy, I find it more of a comforting scent. It is a scent of love, but not a scent of lustful desire or the throes of passion. It is more like the tender embrace of a true and faithful lover.

Perfumer's listed notes for meltmyheart are pure orris butter, oud, sandalwood, ylang ylang, absinthe, French sage, ginger, mandarin, and dark chocolate. It is available in both EdP and pure oil perfume. For more details, visit [strangelovenyc.com](https://strangelovenyc.com/products/meltmyheart-eau-de-parfum).

## silencethesea FRAGRANCE REVIEW

silence*the*sea is an aromatic aquatic fragrance for men and women. It was created by Cristophe Laudamiel, along with Elizabeth Gaynes, under the creative direction of Helena Christensen. silence*the*sea was released in 2016. Like melt*my*heart, it is also available in both pure oil perfume and EdP concentrations.

silence*the*sea is described as ""an arousing, animalic fragrance.""

I love the smell of natural ambergris, and all the ""real"" smells of the ocean, so I was really excited to try this. I spent about a year wearing practically nothing but oceanic fragrances, and trying as many as I could find, so if any of the strangelove nyc offerings were going to woo me, I expected this to be the one.

silencethesea opens with a dry, bracing, bitter angelica. Just pungent, bitter, sour green. If you've ever cut a field of tall, sticky weeds, you might recognize this sour smell. After about 15 minutes, I start to smell some dirt. Dryness. Then salt and pepper. At 20 minutes, it smells like a salted and peppered bandaid, plus the sour weed stems.

At 30 minutes, a musty, earthy funk breaks free of the greenness. It is also sour, smells like mold, or fungus. Then it starts to be sweaty. The sour sweat with the salty bandaid reminds me of an overused and underwashed jock strap. Finally, at one hour, it settles in to just sour sweat smell. If you've ever woken up in the middle of the night with a fever, sweating through your sheets, the smell is similar. The sourness of sweaty sheets.

After two hours, silencethesea smelled mainly of leather and sourness. Like milk spilled in your leather couch and sat there for a day or two. Or a baby bottle got lost in the cushions and wasn't found until it had curdled.

After three hours, my visual equivalent of the smell was if you were wearing a very old leather watchband, that's been worn daily for years, and you spill buttermilk down your arm, on a hot day.

After four hours, I washed it off. My second wearing went about the same way. I didn't attempt it a third time.

## silencethesea DETAILS AND FINAL IMPRESSION

The perfumers refer to silence*the*sea as ""provocative"" and ""daring."" I agree with them. I enjoy a lot of scents that many people would classify as ""challenging,"" but I could not find a happy place with silence*the*sea. Something about it disagreed with my nose, my skin chemistry, or both. I would call it an advanced fragrance, and a try-before-you-buy situation. If you like natural ambergris and oud, it's probably worth a shot. I personally found the angelica to be overwhelming, and could never fully get past it to the other facets of the scent.

Perfumer's listed notes for silencethesea are pure ambergris, black oud, frankincense, narcissus, tuberose, jasmine, white truffle, and angelica.

For more information, visit [strangelovenyc.com](https://strangelovenyc.com/products/silencethesea-eau-de-parfum). Also, samples of silencethesea (and all of the strangelove nyc fragrances) can be purchased at [luckyscent.com](https://www.luckyscent.com/brand/793/strangelove-nyc).

I am finishing up my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and am  looking for jobs and stuff out of school. My internship experience is mostly various aspects of Web Development, but I'm hoping to move away from that a bit. A company I really like posted a job listing for a Tools Programmer, listing C/C++ as requisites.

From my classes, I have lots of experience with C and other programming  languages, but I have never used C++ before. I've started on the programming ""assignment"" that accompanies the application, which they want in C++. I took a stab at it and found that I am basically just writing C code. I know that C++ is object oriented and has other functionality that C lacks, but I'm not really sure how to use this. I  tried some online tutorials, but they're all geared for brand new  programmers (a common problem I find when learning new languages), making them very difficult to feel like they're worth my time.

I'm hoping reddit can help me find an appropriate resource I can use to  learn C++ or explain the important differences (in practice!) between C  and C++. By this, I mean stuff like writing `std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello, World!"" &lt;&lt; std:endl;` instead of `printf(""Hello, World!\n"");` and other style differences that will make my C++ code different from C.

For  some context, I know Java, Python, and other OO languages, but have yet  to use any object syntax in C++. The ""assignment"" I'm working on is a path-finding problem; I am implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to solve it."

I met my ex-girlfriend 2 years ago at a ""dinner party"" of sorts, and we're both nearing the end of college now. We quickly became close, and a week after meeting I took the plunge and asked her out for dinner. She was beautiful, funny, and hands-down the most intelligent girl I've ever met, and unlike many of the LTRs I had been in in the past, she equally reciprocated my love.

Shortly before we met, she had committed to taking a semester abroad in Sweden. We talked it out beforehand and were both willing to give it a shot. Coincidentally enough, I was already planning a trip to Scandinavia for that spring, so we had the opportunity to travel around Europe together for a week. She had trouble making friends there, and spent much of her time alone, which meant that we got to call each other quite frequently.

In retrospect, neither of us were equipped to deal with a long distance relationship. I admittedly started some petty arguments about how I didn't feel like we were communicating with each other enough, and this led to some tension...but there was a light at the end of the tunnel!

She returned to my area at the end of the semester, and what followed was potentially the best year of relationship I've ever experienced. She was my absolute best friend, and I hers. Weekends were characterized by camping, hiking, cooking together, drinking/laughing, cuddling, or just TALKING for hours on end.

Cut to early May, she had an internship opportunity in San Diego for the summer (I'm in Illinois) and she obviously had to take it. It was only 3 months after all, and we had made it through much worse before. Little did I know, this was the beginning of the end. For the first time in her life, she met an amazing group of friends and had social opportunities galore. We both struggle a bit socially, so seeing her happy like this made me so proud.

In a long distance situation, I feel that consistent communication is key...but she didn't seem to have time for it. Between the stress of work and the novelty of having a new social circle, her ability to keep up the calls dwindled. Fights ensued. I knew it was only temporary, but my own loneliness back home on an empty campus drove me to start arguments that I am not proud of.

We had planned to have me visit California for a long weekend. I admitted to her that if she was just going to use this trip as an opportunity to break up with me in person, that she should just save me the money and time and do it over the phone. She reassured me that this was not the case at all.

To cut to the chase, I flew out there last weekend and we seemingly had a great time together. There was tension from our ongoing fighting about the distance, but we were both genuinely happy to be reunited. I got to see the ocean, try authentic Mexican food, and go on some interesting walks with her. It felt like there was hope for the relationship.

I was scheduled to leave on Monday, and we woke up early that morning to have breakfast together and watch some TV like we used to back home. We ended up having sex shortly into it, and as we were lying together in bed, she dropped a bomb.

She told me that she can't keep doing the ""highs and the lows"" (highs when we're together, lows when it's long-distance).  I told her that ""it would have been much easier if she admitted she doesn't love me anymore"", but she emphasized how much she DOES love me. I was crushed, but I accepted what she said and quietly packed my stuff and left for the airport.

I will admit, we were both unhappy; we could never quite figure out a suitable middle ground when it came to long-distance communication. I'm almost positive it wasn't another guy. My mind tells me that we definitely needed some time apart to let things cool off and reevaluate our priorities...but this feels like the end. I haven't said a word to her since (7 days NC), and it kills me so fucking much.

I've been trying find solace in friends, but almost all of them graduated and left town last year. I'm making a point to take up running and going to the gym for the first time in my life, but it all feels like a futile attempt at distracting myself from the inevitable: that this is a permanent split. There's a part of me that keeps the hope that this is temporary alive, and that's the part that unfortunately causes me the most pain.

I want to keep giving her space. I want to reach out at some point. I want to rebuild myself into a man that both she and I would be proud of: one that's independent and not reliant on just her for happiness. But by and large, I'm a mess and I need to know if this is a bump in the road of our relationship or something that she's absolutely sure of.

Fuck. Why is this so long? I'm so sorry, I don't have anywhere to turn and I need wisdom. And a hug."

This weekend, they gave me an unacceptable ultimatum, thus I'll be leaving permanently at the end of the summer. I do not expect any support or contact from them afterwards, and I'm at a loss of what to do.

Right now, I have \~$8000 in the bank from gifts over the years that I never spent. I've currently got a software internship for the summer, and I'm expecting to make \~$13k pre-tax, $10k post-tax. I'm thinking of getting an on-campus job to supplement this.

My expenses are:

* $5.4k per semester for housing
* $2.5k per semester for meal plan
* $1.2k in the fall, $1.7k in the spring for health insurance

I have a full tuition scholarship, plus $5.5k yearly. I'm planning on moving to cheaper, $4.6k a semester housing with a kitchen so I can get off the meal plan. For budget purposes, I've assumed I'll be living on campus, even though I'll probably crash with a friend for a few weeks. Taken all that into account, that brings me to \~$13k in total for a year in college.

I'm not sure whether I should take out college loans. Right now, I'm double majoring with a minor, and that fills a large part of my schedule. If I drop the double major and minor, I could probably graduate in just two more years. Computer science pays well, and loans are a huge burden. Yet, I don't want to pigeon hole myself into computer science when I find biology/public health much more interesting.

The main issue right now is that I live in the suburbs of a small city, and you need a car to get anywhere. My university is 4 hours away by car, or 5 hours by train. All my clothes and college stuff is with me, so I need to figure out how to get it to campus.

For the long term, I'm planning on finding tech internships every summer. (Worst-case, I can go back to my current company.) They'll pay most of my yearly expenses, and they'll provide housing for the duration of the internship. When I can't find housing, I have a college friend who's been in a similar situation, and I can rely on him for a week or two.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
8twd4s,267,2018-06-25,"Welcome to Residency! For those of you just starting off, here's some tips:",Novelty_free,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/8twd4s/welcome_to_residency_for_those_of_you_just/,"1. Write everything down. I can't emphasize enough that no matter how good your memory is, you need to write everything down. Every morning, print out a daily list of patients and notate important information like vitals and labs. Write out your own list of to-dos with check-boxes before rounding but leave room for additional check-boxes for to-dos that come up during rounding. Look over your list multiple times a day to make sure all boxes are checked.   
  
2.  Listen to what your patients are saying. As an intern, only the medical student has more time to spend with the patients. There will be times where you will be the only one to catch something because your resident is new and can't handle 20 patients and your attending hasn't spent time with the patients yet. 

3. Even if you are unsure of management, know your patients from vitals to labs to medications. Again, besides the medical student, you have the most time to know your patients best. Rounding will go much smoother if residents and attendings don't have to stop and look things up and can just get information from you and then make management decisions. It will also help build trust between you and your residents/attendings if they know you know your patients from front to back.   
  
4. At appropriate times throughout the day, ask your resident and attending about reasoning behind their management decisions. If possible ask them to provide you with a relevant source (not always possible as a lot of stuff in medicine is based on culture rather than hard evidence).   
  
5. At appropriate times throughout your rotation, ask for feedback from your resident and attending on how you are doing. Ask for tips on how to become more efficient and where you can improve.   
  
6.  For hand-offs, don't let your fellow intern off the hook if they seem unprepared to give a hand-off or don't know the answer to a question. They need to be sure about their patients before they give them to you to cover. If they can't answer a question, ask their resident, and don't let them leave until everything is clear. At the same time, you don't have to memorize everything they tell you in hand-off. That is almost impossible for covering 50 some odd patients you don't know. While they are telling you the hand-off, pay attention to their notes to make sure they are legible and clear. If they aren't, you will seem like an ass, but you should ask them to make their notes clear for you.  
  
7. Answer pages relatively quickly. If you don't answer them in a reasonable amount of time, nurses get nervous and then end up paging you multiple times, making it nerve-racking to deal with other things.   
  
8. After you have handed off your patients. LEAVE. If you stick around, there will be something insignificant that comes up that will make you stay. Don't feel bad about it because everyone on call goes through it. As long as you've done your best not to give extra work to the covering team, get out while you can. Do what you need to at home after you have handed off your patients. 
   
9. Be respectful to nurses and PCAs. This rule doesn't change when you become an intern. It never changes.  
  
10. For some reason, I feel like it's wrong not to have 10 tips. Don't forget to take care of yourself. Eat lunch even when you're busy. Sleep. Go see a doctor when you are sick. Don't ignore what your body is telling you to take care of others. If it gets to be too much or you are feeling depressed, talk to someone in the program. Some programs are malignant, so that doesn't always mean your program director, but it should be someone that you trust or an outside ear if you don't trust anyone in the program.    
  
Hope these steps help you newbies out. Good luck!"
8twnrh,1,2018-06-25,Am I stupid..?,blue2devils6,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8twnrh/am_i_stupid/,"Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.

Some details for reference
-Both of us are 22
-Together for a year
-friends/friends with benefits for 8 years
-She was in an abusive relationship for 3 years
-I was in a 6 year, toxic for 2 year, relationship

So when I first met her, I immediately fell in love with her but things never really took off until a year ago. Everything was great and we where both happier than shit. My parents loved her and let her sleep over every single night for the first 4 months of our relationship. We decided to rent an apartment together from a family friend. We moved in and it seemed like everything got that much better, a few arguements but I felt that's to be expected while working out the kinks.

Fast forward 3 months to Christmas time and she tells me that she wont be spending Christmas Eve with me in our apartment because her parents are preparing for a divorce and it will be the last Christmas in her childhood home. Despite being hurt, I understood and let her do her own thing. I saw her for maybe 4 hours on Christmas because one of the gifts we gave to my brother was Eagles tickets on Christmas day, and she decided to stay at her parents again. Everything is smooth sailing until New Years Eve.

I had gone snowboarding with family and fractured my wrist, she had told me she was too busy to come to the hospital and that I'll see her that night at her parents house for New Years, okay cool.

I leave the hospital and go directly to her parents house and shes asleep on the couch, okay I'll let her sleep until the ball drops and then we can do the whole cliche makeout at midnight and go home. Except when I try to wake her up all cute like she gets mad at me. Okay shes just tired, let's go home. Everything is still okay for 3 days.

January 4th, I wake up at 6AM and leave for work, it's her day off. I come home at 5:30PM and she has packed up all of her belongings and moved back home while I was working. She left a note saying she will be over around 8 to talk about everything. The gist of the conversation was that she was home sick and wanted to be closer to her mom.

During the conversation her ex boyfriend is texting her and I noticed, got a little upset and asked her to stop talking to him because it makes me uncomfortable, she agrees. The next few days she texts and calls me like normal and eventually starts sleeping over again. 

A month of what I thought was peace goes by and at 2 AM she gets a call from someone saved as ""Kaitlyn"". I wake her and she takes the call in the living room, whispering. I decide to snoop and check the phone number. It's her Ex again. Fight ensues and she promises to stop, I forgive and forget.

Another month goes by and another guy is texting her at 2AM. This time not her Ex, but another guy, who she hasn't told me about. This happens for 3 days straight until I begin to question who it is, she says it's just a friend.

After talking about it, I decide to move home. I get a phone call from a good friend at 1:30AM that shes at a bar with another guy, when she told me at 9PM that she was going to bed. I dont say anything to see if she would tell me about it, which she never did.

We are now in the beginning of May and she tells me that she needs me to drive her down to Orlando, FL because she was accepted into the Disney college program for a 7 month internship from June to January. I knew nothing of her even applying.

Again, I agree to do this for her.

3 days later, I call her to talk and she says she had a bad day at work and just wants to lay down and not hang out, okay cool. Except I get another phone call that shes at the bar with another guy. This time I decide to drive to the bar and confront her with full intentions of ending the relationship, but I cave because shes the person i love more than anyone.

Fast forward to June 1st, I use my vacation time and drive her to florida from NJ, and help her set up her new apartment/dorm and fly home June 4th. 

Almost every conversation from that point I have started, and she answers every other hour. I have had 2 phone calls since I left and she is always ""busy"".

I'm sorry for the discombobulated text and how long it is, I'm just upset and confused right now..

8tx0jn,1724,2018-06-26,Bully my sister? Enjoy the most miserable day of your life and a few months of therapy.,k155l355,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/8tx0jn/bully_my_sister_enjoy_the_most_miserable_day_of/,"Not sure if this is pro, but I certainly did my best! 

Some Information before we start:

I was interning at a local wilderness camp as a counselor in training.  It is run by a local group of conservationists who aim to teach younger kids (ages 5-11) about nature, wildlife, conservation, etc.  As a counselor in training, I was basically a counselor except I wasn't paid.  Each camp session lasted Monday-Friday.  Each day has a specific purpose as follows:  Monday was introductory day.  Tuesday was activity day.  Wednesday was hike day.  Thursday was lake day.  Friday was talent show and pick up day.  

The whole ordeal started during my third week interning.  During this particular week, my sister was attending the camp as a camper.   At the time, she was 10 and I was 14.  She got a great price at the camp ($150 for a full sleep-away camp from Monday-Friday) due to my internship and my mother's great relationship with the camp director (more on that later).  During this same week, I also had the (dis)pleasure of meeting the most horrible child I have ever met.  We will call him SLS, or stupid little shit.  

My first taste of SLS's antics was no sooner than five minutes after arrival when he interrupted my sister's game of frisbee and flung the frisbee deep into the woods.  I had to go fetch it, and I got more than a few scratches from digging through nasty little manzanita bushes to find it.  My sister immediately approaches SLS after he threw the frisbee, and being the innocent person she is, tried to inform him what he did was mean.  He spat in her face.  This was the beginning of SLS's week from hell.

After getting a talk-down from a counselor, SLS was seemingly unfazed, except for the fact he made it his goal to ruin my sister's camp experience.  During the course of the day, he spilled lasagna on her outfit during dinner, called her an array of insults ranging from ""fat"" to ""stupid cow"" to ""poor little bitch"".  Finally, he violently tackled her to the ground during a game of ultimate frisbee.  Make no mistake, SLS was 11 years old, around 100lbs and a head taller than my sister.  It was so bad that my sister came crying to me at the end of the night and said she wanted to go home.  While this was not an option (my mom had already left for a girls-trip in SF), I promised her I would make sure SLS would stop bullying her.  

The next day, SLS continued to treat everyone like shit, and continued to single out my sister.  Unfortunately, he was not in my assigned group, but he apparently tripped her twice, threw her fishing rod into the nearby fishing pond and splashed her in the creek.  When he got back, he was incredibly smug.  Apparently, the counselor in his group made no real effort to stop him, only rapping his knuckles each time then continuing to let him bully my sister.  That night at dinner, I gave him his first taste of revenge by forcing him to talk with me during the campfire and causing him to miss out on s'mores and dessert.  While it was small, I was still focused on formulating my master plan of ruining SLS's week.  He also called me a cunt.

The next day was Wednesday, or hike day.  I started preparations the night before by specifically requesting that he and my sister were separated AND requesting to be in his group.  Now, as a counselor in training, it was my job to stock the packs with lunches the night before the hike.  I put the sack lunches in every kid's pack, making sure one pack had an especially nasty tuna sandwich.  I also ""forgot"" to add the fruit and cookie.  I marked it by buckling all the buckles together,

On the morning of hike day, I gathered my group and distributed all the packs, making sure SLS got the one I had rigged.    We marched into the woods, with me pointing out different kinds of trees and whatnot until eventually we stopped in a meadow to eat lunch.  Of course, SLS threw a massive fit when he found out about his lunch.  He suspected it was me due to our talk the previous night, but I claimed no wrong doing, and due to my good relationship with the camp and his previous wrongdoings, nothing was made of it. 

Anyways, we arrived at the camp later that afternoon, and he started demanding me I take him to the dining room because he was starving (he didn't touch the sandwich).  I calmly explained to him that I couldn't because I didn't have a key to get into the kitchen (I did).  He started throwing a temper tantrum, loudly cussing in front of the rest of the group with kids as young as five years old.  Bingo.  Later that night I brought my case to the camp director, and with some gentle prodding, I convinced her he was unfit to spend time with the rest of the group tomorrow at the lake.  Instead, he would sit out and wait - with me.

The next day was the fabled lake trip, and the reason most people signed up for the camp.  We loaded up into a school bus and a few vans the next morning.  Once again, I was on pack duty the night before, and I conveniently misplaced a few items in his pack, which was specially labeled this time.  When we arrived at the lake, the entire group settled down on a nice spot on the beach.  Due to a staff shortage, I was left alone with SLS.  I started by choosing a terrible spot away from the main group in the heat of the sun.  it was mid july at the time, and I think it was about 88 degrees.  He had not brought a hat, and despite me offering, refused to use any sunblock.  While the rest of the camp enjoyed the lake, he sat there with me, overheating in the sun for five straight hours.  He didn't help himself by wolfing down his sandwich almost immediately.  I had brought my phone (counselor privileges), but for him, he had nothing to do but play with the sand.  By the end of the day, he was bright red like a cherry tomato, and fuming about the lake trip.  In fact, it got so bad he started saying really dark stuff, like how he was gonna gut everyone at the camp.  I managed to record this on my phone, and later that night I showed the recordings to the director.  Obviously, she was horrified, and contacted his parents immediately. They said they could not make it until the next morning, which was perfect, as it meant he had to spend a night with me in my private bunk (he was deemed to be a hazard to other campers and thus removed from his bunk).  That night I slept directly under him and stayed up until well past midnight making loud annoying noises.  He was also in pain from his extreme sun burn.  When he complained in the morning I claimed i talked in my sleep, and that was that.  

Finally, the icing on the cake was him being publicly shamed when his parents arrived during breakfast, pulling him out in front of the entire camp.  The director and I went to his parents and I explained all the terrible things he had done to my sister over the week.  The parents seemed rational enough and explained to me he had a history of behavioral issues.  I recommended therapy due to his comments about slaughtering the camp, and they said they would consider it.  Later I was informed by the director, through my mother, that he was in fact sent to a weekly behavioral therapy class for a few months.  The next two weeks on interning went without a hitch.

TL;DR Evil kid physically and emotionally bullies my sister, causes her misery.  I return the favor by causing him ti be a hungry, sunburnt and tired wreck by the end of the week.  He also goes to therapy.

EDIT:  I guess I forgot to mention it but I do think I was too harsh on the kid and that my revenge wasn't carried out in the best manner.  However, I hope he is doing better after his therapy.  Also I didn't intentionally sunburn him, that was just a biproduct of his refusal to accept my sunblock.

EDIT 2:  Changed TL:DR.  Also it's pretty fascinating to see the comments and how they differ.  And for any of you wondering, this kid is now 19 and as far as I know, completely normal. Hopefully, he was just an obnoxious brat when he was young."
8tx4i1,2,2018-06-26,"I suspect I have Celiac disease, can you take a look and tell me what you think?",pjekworm,Celiac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/8tx4i1/i_suspect_i_have_celiac_disease_can_you_take_a/,"First of all, I'm not here looking for a diagnosis at all. I just want to hear your thoughts in case I'm barking up the wrong tree. Hearing from other people who are going through the same thing would make me feel a bit better, too. I found a blood test that you can do at home, which I'm going to buy as soon as I can, and if need be I'll also be visiting the hospital (although I'd rather not for complicated reasons.) I'm still eating gluten because I don't want to get a false-negative on the test.

I'm a 23 year old female, if that matters. The most obvious symptom is my hands. I get this weird dryness that makes my hands so itchy I just scratch and scratch until they're a bloody mess. They were at their absolute worst when I was going to baking school (!) and worked with flour daily. I just figured my hands were dry because of the harsh soaps we used, even though nobody else in my class had a problem with it... I went to the school nurse who literally said ""if your hands get this bad from working in the bakery you should probably quit."" My hands don't get so dry anymore after I quit school, but now I had these weird, tiny blisters covering the top of my right hand instead. It looks like herpes or something, it's embarrassing. :/

I have gastro issues, of course. I get stomach pain pretty much daily, usually in the evening or morning. I actually have pain as I'm writing this. I stopped eating breakfast in 7th grade to prevent the pain and discomfort in the mornings because it would distract me from school work. I'm pretty used to it at this point and most of the time it doesn't bother me, but sometimes the discomfort will make me so angry I punch myself in the stomach as if that's going to make it go away... it doesn't. No vomiting, but I do have C &amp; D often. On three or four occasions I've had extreme pain in what I think was my gallbladder. It was so bad I couldn't move or talk, I just laid on the bed in the fetal position and cried for hours. I've read that gallbladder issues can be related to Celiac disease?

The last big symptom is the permanent runny nose. I blow my nose 5-10 times per day. Sometimes more. These last few days have been so bad the skin between my nose and mouth is dried out from constantly blowing my nose. I can't go anywhere without a package of tissues, I keep them everywhere. When I was doing an internship at a bakery, I would have to take 5 minute breaks just to dip into the bathroom and rinse my face with cold water and blow my nose repeatedly. I constantly felt like somebody had blown a handful of pepper straight up my nose. It was awful. Again, nobody else in the bakery had this problem.

I've always brushed these things off because there was always something else to pin the blame on. Soap, allergies, dust, pets, unhealthy diet... But looking at it all together, I can't deny that I have a problem. Especially because the symptoms persist even when none of my ""excuses"" are viable. I've been in denial until a few days ago tbh. Some smaller symptoms I also have are heartburn, dental enamel damage, irritability, depression and general lack of energy. Things that don't really mean anything on their own. There's probably others that I haven't realized yet. One part that has me stumped however is that I'm not underweight, which seems to be the case often for Celiac sufferers. I'm actually pretty fat (although I know very well why.)

Sorry this got so long. **TL;DR version of symptoms:**

Possibly dyshidrotic eczema.

Stomach pain or other gastric issues in some form every day.

Extreme pain in gallbladder on several occasions.

Permanent runny nose, especially bad when exposed to flour.

Heartburn, dental enamel damage, irritability, depression, general lack of energy etc."
8txeq1,0,2018-06-26,Failed Exam C today. Where do I go from here?,superduperm1,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8txeq1/failed_exam_c_today_where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I’ve passed P and FM, have one year of college left, and am currently working in an actuarial internship for the summer. I decided back in October that C should be my next exam because I didn’t want to rely on just a March sitting to pass MFE.

Well today after all those months I took C and failed. I thought about how they’re changing the exam AND it won’t count for both SOA and CAS anymore. I thought about that and all the time I spent studying over the past several months and went to the restroom to cry for 20 minutes, but that’s beside the point.

My point is where should I go from here? Should I shoot for STAM? Should I go for IFM over the next few months and hope the C information is retained long enough to make STAM (or the CAS equivalent) smoother? Should I just quit altogether?

I guess part of me is just devastated. I feel like all that time I spent studying C was wasted now and I really wanted this one badly. Would have been in perfect position to have four SOA/CAS exams passed before graduation with internship experience, thus making me a prime free agent for jobs if I had chosen to go that route. But alas it’s all a mirage now.

What would you recommend doing?"

- **extern** - criza Regatului Ungariei, datorata si schimbarii de dinastie (stingerea dinastiei arpadiene si venirea dinastiei de Anjou); dorinta formatiunilor prestatale romanesti de la inlatura dominatia Regatului Ungariei.

- **intern** - pericolul extern a dus la **intarirea raporturilor feudale** si la **concentrarea acestora in jurul unei autoritati mai puternice**; premise economice: largirea schimburilor comerciale, aparitia targurilor si a oraselor.



**Tipuri de autonomii romanesti sec IX - XIII**

- **'Tari'** - Sipenitului (situata la est de Carpati), Fagarasului, Tara Hategului, Tara Cavurnei (situata intre Mangalia si Varna) - 1230

- **'Codrii'** - Orheiului, Lapusnei (spatiul dintre Prut si Nistru), Cosminului - sec. IX-XI

- **'Campuri'** - Campul lui Dragos, Campul lui Vlad (situate la est de Carpati)

- **'Cobale'** - in tinuturile Dorohoi, Neamt, Bacau, Vaslui

- **Cnezate** - Cnezatul lui Ioan, Cnezatul lui Farcas (situate intre Jiu si Olt) - atestate de **Diploma Cavalerilor Ioaniti - 1247**

- **Voievodate** - Gelu, in centrul Transilvaniei, Menumorut in Crisana, Glad in Banat - atestate de **Gesta Hungarorum cronica lui Anonymus**; voievodatul lui Ahtum si voievodatul lui Gyla - atestate de **Legenda Sfantului Gerard** si voievodatul lui Litovoi (dreapta Oltului) si voievodatul lui Seneslau (stanga Oltului) - atestate de **Diploma Cavalerilor Ioaniti**

- **Jupanat** - formatiune condusa de jupan Dimitrie - atestata de **Inscriptia de la Mircea Voda** si formatiunea condusa de jupan Gheorghe - atestata de **Inscriptiile din complexul Basarabi-Murfatlar**



**Autonomiile romanesti in relatie cu centrele de putere vecine**

- maghiarii la inceputul sec X au inceput cucerirea spatiului cuprins intre Tisa, Crisuri si Somes, unde s-au lovit de trei voievodate (Menumorut, Glad si Gelu) aceste voievodate fiinad apoi cucerite rand pe rand. **(Gesta Hungarorum - Cronica lui Anonymus)**

- crestinarea ungurilor dupa anul 1000 a insemnat si preluarea formelor de organizare politica si ecleziastica ale lumii apusene

- pentru a-si impune stapanirea asupra Transilvaniei, cuceritorii au colonizat teritoriul cu populatii de alte etnii. **Secuii** au fost progresiv deplasati spre rasaritul Transilvaniei, au fost instalati mai intai in Bihor apoi in zona Tarnavelor si in Subcarpatii rasariteni pentreu a apara trecatorile, ei au convietuit cu romanii. **Sasii** s-au instalat in principal in regiunea Orastiei, a Sibiului, a Tarnavelor si in sud-estul Transilvaniei.

- in 1211, regele Andrei al II-lea a instalat in Tara Barsei **Ordinul Cavalorilor Teutoni** cu misiunea de a opri invaziile cumanilor din Campia Dunarii in Transilvania si pt a deschide calea expansiunii  Regatului ungar la sud si rasarit de Carpati.

- presiunea triburilor turce si nomade si a tendintelor agresive ale statelor vecine (cnezatele rusesti Kiev si Halici, Regatul ungar su Hoarda de Aur) au determinat necesitatea structurarii autonomiilor romanesti pentru asigurarea apararii comunitatilor.

- bizantinii sub conducerea lui **Ioan Tzimiskes** au ocupat si teritoriul dintre Dunare si Mare.



**Traditia Descalecatului**

- **descalecatul lui Negru Voda** - prima resedinta a T.R. si anume Campulung, reprezenta si sediul unei comunitati catolice. Descalecatul a fost urmat de intemeierea tarii adica de agregarea formatiunilor politice preexistente, cnezate si voievodate din stanga si dreapta Oltului, traditia istorica a descalecatului din T.R. nu are acoperire in documente.

- **descalecatul lui Dragos** - reprezinta prima etapa a intemeierii Moldovei. S-a construit o marca militara de granita, cu centrul la Baia, condusa de voievodul maramuresean Dragos, ce impingea marginea orientala a Transilvaniei dincolo de Carpati si din a carei dezvoltare se va naste statul independent Moldova. Clasa conducatoare autohtona i-a indepartat pe urmasii lui Dragos (Sas is Balc) pt ca apartineau coroanei ungare.

- **descalecatul lui Bogdan** - Bogdan din Cuhea a fost un maramuresean nemultumit de politica Regatului ungar (urmarea sa desfiinteze autonomiile provinciale si sa le inlocuiasca cu institutia comitatului) deci Descalecatul lui Bogdan din 1359 a marcat un moment important in procesul emanciparii statului romanesc de la est de Carpati sub suzeranitate ungara. In vremea lui, noul stat si-a extins hotarele prin inglobarea in cadrul lui si a altor formatiuni politice existente de pe teritoriul la est de Carpati. **Cronica domniei lui Ludovic scrisa de Ioan de Tarnave** semnaleaza esecul expeditiilor repetate intreprinse de ostile Regatului ungar si rezultatul final al luptei, **transformarea Moldovei intr-un stat independent**


**Unificarea teritoriala**

- intemeietorul statului Tara Romaneasca confirmat de catre izvoarele istorice este **Basarab I (?1310-1352**, intr-un document din 1324, Basarab era numit de catre regalitatea ungara 'voievodul nostru transalpin'.

- in acordul din 1324 Carol Robert de Anjou **recunostea unitatea T.R. sub conducerea lui Basarab si achizitiile ei teritoriale**, in schimbul recunoasterii zsuzeranitatii regelui si a incadrarii tarii in aria spiritualitatii catolice.

- cauza neintelegerilor dintre Basarab si regalitatea maghiara a fost Banatul de Severin ---&gt; in **1330 Batalia de la Posada** (o confruntare directa dintre Basarab I si Carol Robert de Anjou) a marcat sfarsitul suzeranitatii maghiare si aparitia primului stat romanesc independent.

- Basarab I l-a asociat pe la tron pe fiul sau **Nicolae Alexandru**

- teritoriul dintre Varna si Caliacra era cunoscut sub numele de **Tara Cavarnei**

- avandul pe conducator pe Balica si apoi pe **Dobrotici (cca 1354-1386)** acesta a intervenit in evenimentele din Bizant, favorizand acordarea titlului de startef si apoi **cel de despot, in 1357** asadar Dobrotici si-a intins stapanirea asupra intregului teritoriu dintre Dunare si M/ Neagra, cunoscut in zilele noastre sub numele de Dobrogea, nume inspirat de acest conducator.

- Dobrotici a intretinut legaturi  cu voievozii Tarii Romanesti.



**Actiuni de consolidare**

- consolidarea Valahiei nord-dunarene, s-a realizant in timpul domniei lui Nicolae Alexandru (1352-1364) - a intarit caracterul de suveranitate  al statului, intemeind **Curtea de Arges, prima Mitropolie a T.R., in dependenta fata de Patriarhia de la Constantinopol** - 1359 isi asuma titlul de domn autocrat (de sine stapanitor). Aceasta politica a fost continuata de catre **Vladislav Vlaicu (1364-cca 1376)**

- in Moldova, Latcu (1369-1377) a continuat politica de independenta a statului, intrand in legatura directa cu papalitatea, care ii recunostea **titlul de duce al Moldovei**. Domnia lui Petru Musat (1377-1392) a marcat un pas important in directia afirmarii internationale si a organizarii statale - s-a orientat spre alianta cu Polonia, in 1387 domnul, **a depus omagiul regelui Vladislav Jagiello**




**Institutii centrale in spatiul romanesc (secolele IX-XVIII)**

**Domnia** 

- uns de mitropolit, domnii deveneau conducatori politici 'din mila lui Dumnezeu'; introducerea in titulatura domnului a cuvantului Io, prescurtare a lui Ioannes 'cel ales de Dumnezeu' afirma raspicat sursa divina a puterii domnesti. Domnul ii numea pe marii dregatori. Titlul de voievod arata ca domnul era comandantul suprem al armatei, percepea birul, decidea politica externa a tarii, declara razboi si incheie pace.  Succesiunea la tron se baza pe sistemul ereditar-electiv, intemeiat pe drepturile ereditare ale unei famili domnitoare. Ales de o adunare mai larga din care facea parte boierimea mare si mica si curtenii.

- dupa instaurarea dominatiei otomane, domni erau numiti direct de catre Poarta, fara consultarea boierimii, depunea omagiu si juramant sultanului, domnia devenise o functie administrativa, iar domnul un inalt dregator al Portii. Domnii nu mai aveau voie sa duca decat o politica externa conform intereselor Portii.

- in Transilvania, vechea institutie a voievodatulu, convertita de cuceritori in organ al puterii centrale, simbolizeaza autonomia tarii. Concentrau in mainile lor: atributii militare, judiciare si administrative. **Incepand cu anul 1541 (Imp Otoman a cucerit Regatul ungar) tara a fost condusa de un principe ales de dieta.** Principii aveau nevoie de confirmarea puterii suzerane odata ce erau alesi.

- alte modificare intervin odata cu instaurarea **regimului fanariot - 1711 - Moldova si 1716 - T.R.**. Domnii sunt numiti direct de catre Poarta, greci sau romani, fara asentimentul tarii, prin derogari de la formulele proceduale de alegere. Acest statut antreneaza si declinul puterii militare.

- Transilvania, potrivit **Diplomei leopoldine din 1691** , a devenit o provincie a Imperiului Habsburgic condusa de imparat prin intermediul unui guvernator.

**Sfatul domnesc**


- alcatuit din marii stapani de domenii insa rolul cel mai important revine dregatorilor

- atributii: asistau pe domn la scaunul de judecata, participau la incheierea tratatelor cu puterile vecine.

- *marele logofat* - in fruntea cancelariei domnesti

- *marele vornic* - afirmarea si consolidarea prerogativelor judecatoresti ale domniei

- *marele postelnic* - activitatea diplomatica, primirea solilor straini si ceremonialul primirri lor 

- *spatarul* (in T.R.) si *hatmanul* (in Moldova) - atributii militare

- dreagtori ai curtii: *marele paharnic, marele stolnic, marele comis, marele culcer, marele sluger si marele pitar*


**Adunarile de stari**

- poarta numele de Marea Adunare a Tarii (in T.R. si Moldova) compusa din: marii boieri, clerul inalt, boierimea mica si mijlocie si curteni. Reprezinta un mijloc de a mentine pe cei alesi in dependenta fata de alegatorii lor.

- era o institutie sporadica.

- Sfatul - Sfatul sau Divanul domnesc, al marilor boieri

- Soborul - fetele bisericesti

- Adunarea a toata tara - cuprindea reprezentantii tuturor starilor privilegiate.

- va renaste in 1831 si 1848 sub numele de Adunarea Obsteasca.


**Armata**

- serviciul militar 'oastea cea mare' pentru toata lumea

- oastea domneasca - dregatorii domniei, curtenii si steagurile din tinuturi (mici proprietari de pamant)

- rol important in aparare: Moldova - cetatile Neamt, Suceava, Hotinul. T.R. - Giurgiu, Turnu, Severin. Transilvania - Chioar, Unguras, Ciceu, Cetatea de Balta, Hunedoara

**Administratia**

- in Transilvania - institutii adiministrativ-teritoriale maghiare. 'Comitatul regal' a fost instalat peste vechile tari ale autohtonilor. Exemple de comitate: Bihor, Crasna, Dabaca, Cluj, Alba, Timis, Arad, Zarand, Tarnava. Teritoriul secuiesc era impartit in scaune in fruntea carora se aflau un capitan si un jude. 

- in Moldova si T.R administratia se realizeaza prin intermediul unor dregatori teritoriale, in cadrul judetelor si respectiv tinuturilor. In Moldova acestia se numeau parcalabi iar in T.R. judeti.

**Organizarea judecatoreasca**

- in T.R. si Moldova judecatorul supre era domnul iar sfatul domnesc participa la scaunul de judecata.

**Biserica**

- modelul bizantin adaptat necesitatilor romanesti

- prin intemeierea mitropoliilor domnii au reusit sa-si consolideze statutul devenind de asemenea monarh civil si religios, precum si imparatul bizantin

- domnul era uns in tron de catre mitropolit iar mitropolitul ocupa un loc important in sfatul domnesc si tinea locul domnului in caz de vacanta a tronului.

- in Transilvania regalitatea maghiara a incercat sa introduca religia, in schimb romanii, majoritatea de religie ortodoza, erau considerati tolerati.




Ma doare capul :)) fac o pauza dupa care revin cu statul roman modern.

[My name and contact info]

[Name and contact info for judge]

[Date]

Dear Judge [Name],

I am a recent law school graduate with honors from [Law school]. I respectfully write this to express my interest in a federal clerkship in your chambers for the January 2021-December 2021 term. 

I currently serve as a Judicial Law Clerk to the Honorable [Judge] at [Court] in [City], a position I shall be employed in until August 2019. The Judge’s docket consists mainly of criminal and Orphan's court matters. The experience of assisting the Judge in drafting judicial opinions has bolstered my legal research, writing, and reasoning skills, particularly in Fourth Amendment suppression matters. On a daily basis, I analyze whether motions and petitions filed with the Court are in conformity with local and state rules. In addition, carefully observing countless trial proceedings and discussing their resolutions with the Judge has given me deep knowledge of criminal law and procedure. Furthermore, in this role, I am tasked with communicating promptly and professionally with attorneys, support staff, pro se litigants and Probation about the status of pending cases. Outside of work, I design and teach an immersive three-semester “Spanish for Lawyers” CLE course for [County] Bar Association, support staff, and college/law students, create flashcards and glossaries of Spanish legal terminology, and grade/evaluate pupils’ work. I am passionate about increasing access to justice for English language learners. 

I demonstrated a record of scholastic achievement in law school, where I made Dean’s List. Throughout my time in law school, I have focused on developing the research and writing acumen necessary to succeed as a litigator and as a judicial law clerk through my internships at various public interest agencies. As a [Minority] Bar Association of [City] Fellow at [Nonprofit], I strengthened my analytical skills through researching and drafting memoranda assessing the immigration consequences of my clients’ criminal convictions according to the Third Circuit’s modified categorical approach to crimes involving moral turpitude. Last year, I was a Certified Legal Intern at the [local PD's office], which gave me broad exposure to the systemic challenges faced by indigent criminal defendants. Through this clinic, I harnessed my trial advocacy skills through representing poor people accused of crimes at preliminary hearings and misdemeanor trials at [County] Municipal Court. At these hearings, I was given the invaluable opportunity to develop case theories, negotiate with opposing counsel, make evidentiary objections to testimony, cross-examine and impeach complainants/witnesses, argue suppression motions and state closing arguments. In addition, I researched and wrote a persuasive memorandum on the connection between juvenile de-certification and recidivism rates using a trauma-informed approach, a task that helped hone my policy analysis skills. 

Finally, my law school curriculum, including courses like Criminal Law, two courses in Criminal Procedure, Immigration Legal Research, Refugee &amp; Asylum Law, Federal Criminal Law, Evidence, and Criminal Litigation Field Clinic I and II, is highly relevant, and I look forward to the challenge of putting my classroom training to work on behalf of the [Federal District] as a Judicial Law Clerk. I performed particularly well in Federal Criminal Law, a course taught by the Honorable [Judge] for the [federal district]. In this class, I completed an in-depth research project on 18 U.S.C. § 1170, which proscribes illegal trafficking in Native American human remains and cultural items.

In sum, because of my passion for public service, diverse background, commitment to academic merit, and strong legal research, reasoning, and writing skills, I hope you will see me as an ideal candidate for a judicial clerkship in your chambers. I have enclosed my résumé, references, transcript, writing sample, and one letter of recommendation; three more letters of recommendation will be sent to your chambers separately. Please let me know if I can provide any further information regarding my candidacy. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

[Me]"
8tzeqz,8,2018-06-26,F4M / A -- No one was supposed to find out,Twinklinglight,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8tzeqz/f4m_a_no_one_was_supposed_to_find_out/,"It was a stupid thing to do. I should have known better than to post pictures of myself online. But I'd thought I was being so careful. I never posted any personal information, I never showed my face, okay, maybe my lips sometimes, but never anything more than that. But I guess I wasn't careful enough.

I'd spent the morning pouring over my posts, trying to figure out where I'd slipped. They were such tiny mistakes, I have no idea how much time someone must have spent piecing it together, but the slip ups were there. One picture showed the little knot ring I always wear. Another had a textbook laying on my bed that was put together just for my university. In another if you looked out the window you could make out McVail Hall behind me.

It didn't matter how long it took, or how implausible it seemed. Someone had figured it out. You'd figured it out.

There were a lot of new messages in my inbox when I checked this morning. Not unusual, I'd just posted a little album last night showing me playing with my new vibrator. There were all the typical responses; men telling me what they'd do to me, asking for more, requesting specific poses, complimenting me... Those are why I did it. It makes me so wet to think about all the countless guys looking at me, fantasizing about me, jerking off imagining what they'd like to do with me...

But it was all just pretend -- a fantasy. I'm not that kind of girl, not really. I might talk about wanting to suck a stranger's cock and have him cum all over my face, or dressing like a whore and getting fucked in an alley by men whose names I didn't even know, but doesn't mean I'd actually want to. None of this was supposed to be part of my real life.

Well, it looks like it is now. ""Nicole-"" the message had opened, my heart froze from just that word. No one knew my name. A few of the guys I messaged with had asked, and I'd always lied. I'd be Jess or Megan or Emma, never Nicole. Never me.

I read the rest with my heart in my throat and my stomach in knots. The obvious threats are there, that these pictures will make their way to my friends, my family, my professors, unless, or course, I do as I'm told. There's a phone number at the end of the message, with instructions to text you a photo of my panties, and to await further word.

I can't let this get out. My life would be over. Assuming I didn't die of shame imagining everyone I know seeing exactly what I get up to online I'd probably still never be able to leave my dorm room again. God, what would my parents say? How would I ever be able to look them in the eye knowing they'd seen gifs of my fucking a dildo suction cupped to a chair in my childhood bedroom? My friends, that cute guy from my calculus class, the professor I needed a letter of recommendation for for an internship... everyone would know. The nice, sweet, hard working student they knew as Nicole would be wiped away, how could anyone look at me the same after seeing this?

With trembling fingers I unlock my phone, pulling up my skirt and snapping a photo of my pale blue panties, edged in white lace. I stare at it for a long moment. It isn't my best work, I usually play around more with lighting and angles, but then I'm also usually taking photos of myself because I want to, not because some creep is blackmailing me. I swallow, sending the picture to the number you'd sent me. There's nothing else I can do, I just have to wait.

Hey! So I’m looking for someone to play my blackmailer. You found my pictures and managed to trace them back to me, and now you plan to use that to your advantage.

Kinks and such can be found by clicking [here](https://i.imgur.com/LusKdoj.png). I prefer responses that are a couple of paragraphs long, shooting single sentences back and forth gets old fast for me. That said take your time getting a reply in, I probably won't be checking in for a few hours, and a quality response a day after this is posted is worth a lot more to me than a low effort one within the first five minutes."
8tzyaa,2,2018-06-26,[Futa4F/M] Celebrities with something extra,[deleted],futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/8tzyaa/futa4fm_celebrities_with_something_extra/,"'ello there!

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this little post of mine, I hope that you'll find something that interests you in it!

First time writing a post here on reddit so might not be the best! You have been warned.

**One liners will be ignored. Put some effort into it like I did with this post.**

Quick Edit: I'd also be very open to playing rule34 styled things as well. Like Arya stark or Daenarys Targarean in the GoT universe and such!

So, I'll fully admit that I'm a very big fan of celebrities and the status that they hold in the eyes of many 'normal' people. I'm also a big fan of futanari/shemales who's packing big piece of swinging meat between their legs. So I thought, why not pair those two things together and made a RP post about it?

Needless to say, I'm looking to play some very well endowed celebrities  (internet celebs included, like youtubers!) who gets into all kinds of lewd and naughty fun with people that they meet and work with. While I am primarily looking for female partners, I am very much open to partners who plays feminine boys as well.

Please be literate, detailed and be able to write decent amounts of text. I'm a multi-paragraph rper myself.

Some ideas to get the thoughts rolling, but keep in mind I'd be more than happy to hear any other ideas as well.

Personal Assistant: You're a personal assistant to the stars, you get to meet all the most famous and hot actresses and singers. All from the women from the all too popular Game of Thrones series to singers like Rihanna and Taylor swift. You get to follow them to the nicest locations, to the best resorts, to their own getaways and houses scattered across the world. Of course your job is to keep them happy, to get them the food they want, the entertainment they want, the clothes they want, the alcohol the they and so on. But since you're in such a high paying job and getting very nice bonuses because of it.. Well.. You have to take care of their other needs, any time, any where.

Comic Con meet up (works with any Con really): A con is always a good place to get the chance to meet some celebs, maybe they're doing a meet and greet, maybe they're doing a bit of autograph signing, maybe they're just nerds that wants to enjoy it like a normal person? Whatever the reason, you get to meet the celeb(s) of your dream! Maybe you met them after a Q&amp;A where they thought you were cute when you fumbled with your question, maybe you met them back at the hotel. You couldn't quite remember, but here you are regardless.. What luck, eh?

Co-worker: Being an up and coming young individual in the industry can be daunting to say the least. There's always someone that's more important than you, always someone who knows more than you, always someone that can get you fired with one phone call just around the corner when you're running with that hot coffee in your hand. Needless to say, you have to be careful. But at the same time it's a fantastic opportunity! Maybe you get to know your more famous co-star privately? Maybe you want to make that sex scene just look that more real? Maybe you actually did make some enemies and are trying to make up for it?

Intern: Let's face it, being an intern sucks. You always have to go get food and coffee for stuck up producers and even just to the people one step higher than you on the company ladder. But it's not all bad. You still get to meet plenty of beautiful famous people. Perhaps you see this as an opportunity to get close to them? Befriend them? Use them to maybe make your life a bit easier?.. Or maybe you simply end up as their toy?

While I hate to do this, please write Big Dick Celeb in the title of your message to let me know you've read this far. Silly I know but best I could come up with!

So there's 4 quick little prompts, nothing fancy but it's better than nothing. Like I said, I'd be more than happy to hear out any other ideas as well, so don't be shy! I'm down for pretty much everything, from them being complete strangers to friends to family members to being married!

Here's a list over celebrities that I enjoy playing: Emilia Clarke, Ronda Rousey, Daisy Ridley, Dodger/presshearttocontinue, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Emma Watson, Pokimane, Avril Lavigne, Shakira, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Emma stone, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Amy Adams, Alexa Bliss, AJ Lee, Paige, Sasha Banks, Becky Lynch, Eva Marie, Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman, Ariel Winter, Gal Gadot, Christina Hendricks, Sarah Hyland, Alyson Hannigan, Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Zooey Deschanel.

I have a handy kinklist right over here [https://i.imgur.com/1YJX4kD.png](https://i.imgur.com/1YJX4kD.png)

But TL:DR version quite vanilla. Incest, large breasts/cocks/ass, anal, oral, handjobs, titfucks, size difference, dominance, interracial, raceplay, clothed sex, public sex, mind control, femboys, feminization. That's a short version, just check the kinklist for more.

Hard limits: Scat, watersports, gore, snuff, blood, violence, anything that's counted as really extreme so to speak."

From what I have read from posts in this sub and in other engineering subs, as well as from what I see during my internship, there is not much of what I would consider an ideal work-life balance offered in civil engineering. I see many posts about people who often work 50+ hour work weeks while having only 1 week of vacation, and I just can't see myself doing that while being happy. Even 40 hours a week is more than I would ideally want to spend a week working, I'm not a lazy worker, I'm willing to work hard, it's just that I have other things in my life I want to spend time on rather than working. 

So my question I guess is, in the United States, is it possible for me to find a job, preferably structures but open to other concentrations, where I work 32-ish hours a week (even if it means a lower salary)? Would it help if I went to grad school before trying to finding such a job?  "
8u0o6r,8,2018-06-26,Solving Algebraic Riccati Equation,FruscianteDebutante,ControlTheory,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlTheory/comments/8u0o6r/solving_algebraic_riccati_equation/,"Hi. I'm currently in an internship and I've been learning classical/modern control theory for the past month. Right now, I'm trying to solve for the P matrix in the algebraic Riccati equation:

0 = transpose(A)\*P + PA + Q -P\*B\*(R\^(-1))\*transpose(B)

Thus far, I've moved the Q matrix to the left side, and on the right side I took out a P leaving me with

\-Q = P\*(transpose(A) + A -P\*B\*(R\^(-1))\*transpose(B)

Then, I divided both sides by the right side (minus the P) leaving me with:

\[-Q\]/\[transpose(A) + A - P\*B\*(R\^(-1))\*transpose(B)\] = P

After this point, I am uncertain of how I can solve for P. Should I use partial fraction decomposition? In the sources I've looked up I have seen the use of the Hamiltonian matrix (\[Q -A; -S -transpose(A)\]

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: So now, as many of you can see, my linear algebra is not up to par. I'm reading about Matlab's care function now and have implemented it... but using the ARE my equation \~doesn't add up to 0\~ adds up to a matrix of epsilon, essentially 0.

A'P + PA - PB(B')P + Q = 0

Edit 2: Just in case anybody reads back on this or wanted any update lol I GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT!

I used 

[P,L,K] = care(A, B, Q) 

like I should have a long time ago and made a pretty bomb ass group of matlab scripts that automated the plot of my state matrix so that each time it displayed, the settling time was better than the last. Good enough that my professor in charge of the internship said I was done for the day when I showed him what I was working on! "

8u1avu,1,2018-06-26,Antwoord op vragen van het lid Leijten over mijn kennismakingsgesprek met Shell,kamerstukken-bot,kamerstukken,https://www.reddit.com/r/kamerstukken/comments/8u1avu/antwoord_op_vragen_van_het_lid_leijten_over_mijn/,"^(Vragen van het lid Leijten &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; aan de staatssecretaris van Financiën over het gesprek met Shell &amp;#40;ingezonden 25 juni 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag 1  
Kunt u uitleggen waarom een staatssecretaris van Financiën een gesprek voert met de grootste multinational van ons land &amp;#40;Shell&amp;#41;? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;  
Antwoord vraag 1  
Bewindspersonen van het kabinet voeren met enige regelmaat gesprekken met maatschappelijke organisaties, belangengroeperingen en individuele bedrijven. Het voeren van dergelijke gesprekken levert een bijdrage aan de beoordeling van de maatschappelijke impact van voorgenomen kabinetsbeleid. Deze gesprekken geven ook inzicht in relevante maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen. Ook ikzelf voer om die reden zulke gesprekken, waaronder mijn kennismakingsgesprek van 15 maart jl. met mevrouw Van Loon, President-Directeur Shell Nederland. Ik hecht eraan op te merken dat ik bij mijn gesprekken streef naar een zeker evenwicht in de keuze van mijn gesprekspartners en dat ik niet alleen gesprekken voer met multinationals. Verder beoog ik transparantie over dergelijke gesprekken door openbaarmaking van mijn agenda. Mijn gesprek met Shell heb ik eveneens op deze wijze publiek bekendgemaakt.   
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag 2  
Wie nam het initiatief tot dit gesprek dat op 15 maart 2018 plaatsvond?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Antwoord vraag 2  
Het voorstel voor een gesprek is gekomen van Shell.   
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag 3  
Met wie voerde u dit gesprek?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Antwoord vraag 3  
Dit gesprek is gevoerd met mevrouw Van Loon. Zij heeft zich daarbij laten vergezellen door twee van haar medewerkers. Ikzelf ben bij dit gesprek bijgestaan door twee ambtenaren van mijn departement.   
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag 4  
Wat waren de onderwerpen tijdens dit gesprek?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag 5  
Is er een gespreksverslag of notulen gemaakt van dit gesprek? Kunt u deze aan de Kamer doen toekomen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag  6  
Kunt u op grond van artikel 68 van de Grondwet de voorbereidende memo’s en/of notities ten behoeve van het gesprek, alsmede eventuele memo’s en/of notities naar aanleiding van het gesprek openbaar maken? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Antwoord op vragen  4, 5 en 6  
Het is staand beleid van het kabinet om documenten die zijn opgesteld voor intern beraad, zoals notities, memo’s en gespreksverslagen geen onderwerp te maken van het politieke debat. Voor het goed functioneren is noodzakelijk dat mogelijk is om in vertrouwelijke sfeer van gedachten te wisselen. Desgevraagd geef ik wel de relevante informatie uit de gevraagde documenten in geobjectiveerde vorm aan uw Kamer. Tijdens het gesprek stonden als onderwerpen geagendeerd: de fiscale beleidsvoornemens van het kabinet zoals verwoord in het regeerakkoord en de impact van internationale ontwikkelingen als de belastingherziening in de Verenigde Staten en de EU-voorstellen voor een grondslagharmonisatie in de vennootschapsbelasting &amp;#40;CCTB en CCCTB&amp;#41;. In de notitie is ten behoeve van mijn eigen gedachtevorming &amp;#40;achtergrond&amp;#41;informatie verstrekt over openbare uitlatingen die ik reeds had gedaan over enkele in het regeerakkoord verwoorde fiscale beleidsvoornemens, de CCTB en de CCCTB, de Amerikaanse belastingherziening, dat partijen die als belanghebbenden worden aangemerkt bij een Wob-verzoek de gelegenheid hebben een zienswijze te geven, en de stand van zaken rondom het Groningengas.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Vraag 7  
Kunt u deze vragen beantwoorden voor het debat over de dividendbelasting van 26 juni 2018?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Antwoord vraag 7  
Ja.

* We sit in pretty much the same position as yesterday, some territory trades here and there but the tactical situation changed little, save Michigan no longer connecting to us near Kent.  
    
* [Regional Map](https://i.imgur.com/txHpzMg.png)  
  
* If you are just joining us today ATTACK RUTGERS     
  
* Nebraska Stays strong on the map Kicking florida out of most locations. They also took Madison, shame it's not our red but its better than Michigan. Stanford is a bit anemic in terms of territory, but bama and Oklahoma stretched a bit. VT is down to 1 territory but should be fine, and A&amp;M has a lot to fight.  
  
* Chaos bounced back a bit, they own BYU which borders tons of territories, perfect for their shotgun strategies.   
  
* GT continues to push up towards Ohio and west to Michigan but their troops are starting to approach our borders. Clemsons objective is to kill us, so don't expect them to leave anytime soon. Texas is a bit trapped but they have many vectors to hit, so don't expect them to dissapear anytime soon. Florida continues to mix East and West with mixed results.       
  
* If you aren't on the PM bot, and want to be, please message us!       
  
* Job. So my internship started Monday, and as such the way orders getting messaged out will be at essentially one of 3 times. It could be in the morning before 8 A.M., during the noon lunch hour, or after I get back from work. The goal is to have the first of the 3, and then noon, and then Worst case is right after work. We have been working with Red Command to streamline the process so you can get your orders as soon as you can.  "

Stalinism, national-comunism si disidenta anticomunista.",Sagittariahx,robac,https://www.reddit.com/r/robac/comments/8u1ddq/romania_postbelica_stalinism_nationalcomunism_si/,"**Context** - instaurat in Romania la sfarsitul celui de al Doilea Razboi Mondial, Uniunea Sovietica obtinand acordul tacit al aliatilor, si folosindu-se de un instrument, Partidul Comunist Roman, care va actiona sistematic si organizat.


**Mecanisme de preluare a puterii**

- **Actiuni diplomatice** - Conform intelegeri;or dintre marile puteri, Romania a fost lasata in sfera de influenta a Moscovei. Astfel prin 'Acordul procentajelor' din octombrie 1944, dintre Churchill si Stalin, Romania e lasata in proportie de 90%.

- **Prezenta Armatei Rosii in Romania** - Armata Rosie ocupase Romania dupa 23 august 1944, va recurge la abuzuri si violente impotriva populatiei civile precum si indepartarea liderilor comunisti; Adrei Visinski (adjunctul ministrului de externe URSS) soseste in Romania si se face presiuni pentru a se instaura un guvern prosovietic.

- **PCR a fost folosit ca element esential in politica lui Stalin** - Crearea unor coalitii, cu dizidente ale partidelor democratice, astfel va fi infiintat BND-ul (Blocul National Democrat), iar in octombrie 1944 FND-ul (Frontul National Democrat). Aceasta determina caderea primului  guvern Constantin Sanatescu, in octombrie 1944, FND intra in al doilea guvern Sanatescu, unde vicepresedinte al Consiliului de Ministri a fost **Petru Groza**; falsificarea alegerilor din noiembrie 1946 unde castiga BND cu 70% din totalul voturilor.

- **Manipularea opiniei publice** - realizate pastandu-se secrete, sctiunile ilegale fiind pastrate secrete, de ex alegerile din noiembrie 1946.

- **Inlaturarea ultimelor institutii ale regimurilor democratice** - Monarhia reprezenta un pericol pentru comunisti pentru ca putea sa devina un centru de opozitie. La 30 decembrie 1947 - regele va fi obligat sa abdice, prin Legea nr. 363 se va recurge la abolirea monarhiei si in aceeasi zi a fost proclamata Republica Populara Romana.



**Mecanismele Partidului Comunist Roman de mentinere a puterii**

1. Inregimentarea Romaniei din punct de vedere militar in blocul sovietic, astfel ca la 4 februari 1948 va fi semnat cu URSS, un tratat de prietenie, colaborare si ajutor reciproc.

2. Consolidarea partidului unic - la Congresul din februarie 1948 s-a format PMR (Partidul Muncitoresc Roman), secretar general fiind Gheorghe Gheorghiu Dej. Mai tarziu acesta se va impune si va trece la lichidarea opozitiei interne, precum si a fostilor aliati pentru a putea sa preia singur puterea. **In 1952 Gheorghiu-Dej a preluat functia de presedinte al Consiliului de Ministri cumulata cu cea de secretar general al partidului.** Vor fi infiintate institutii cu rol represiv: Securitatea (Directia Generala a Securitatii Poporului)

3. Adoptarea Constitutiei RPR, in aprilie 1948 si introducerea sistemului judecatoresc sovietic asigurau baza juridica a noului regim. Aceasta a fost modificata in 1952, folosindu-se ca si model constitutia stalinista din 1936.


**Regimul lui Gh. Gheorghiu-Dej**

- **Prima etapa** - 1947-1960 - se caracterizeaza prin supunerea totala fata de Moscova, ceea ce va duce pe plan intern la stalinizarea tarii, iar pe plan extern Romania se remarca prin sustinerea politicii Moscovei fata de miscarile de dizidenta sau anticomuniste din statele satelit (dizidenta iugoslava a lui Tito, revolutia din Ungaria 1956, ambele condamnate de Dej)

- **A doua etapa** - 1960-1965 - se realizeaza o **indepartare de Moscova si o reorientare a politicii interne si externe**. Plan intern: relativa liberalizare a invatamantul si a culturii si vor fi eliberati ultimii detinuti politici (1962-1964). Plan extern: reluate legaturile cu occidentul.



**Regimul lui Nicolae Ceausescu**

- **Perioada 1965-1971** - caracterizata prin acapararea unor functii importante, in 1967 Ceausescu devine **presedintele Consiliului de Stat.** Plan intern: in cadrul Congresului al IX-lea al PCR, se afirma principiul conducerii colective. **Prin constitutia din 1965, va fi proclamata Republica Socialista Romania.** Este promovata o politice de destindere. Plan extern: este continuata politica de independenta fata de URSS lucru exemplificat prin reluarea legaturilor cu Republica Federala Germania si pastrarea unor bune relatii cu Israelul. Opozitia fata de invazia trupelor sovietice in Cehoslovacia, pentru inabusirea Primaverii de la Praga - consecinte: cresterea presitgiului Romaniei si a lui Ceausescu pe plan extern.

- **Perioada 1971-1989** - aduce o schimbare radicala a atitudinii statelor occidentale fata de Romania, pentru ca Nicolae Ceausescu a instaurat regimul personal punandu-se accent pe cultut personalitatii, incetand astfel perioada de liberalizare. Schimbarea  majora a avut loc dupa vizitele lui Ceausescu in China si Coreea de Nord. Prin Tezele din **iulie 1971** era lansata revolutia culturala: ideologizarea tutror sectoarelor vietii sociale, Ceausescu va detine toate functiile importante in stat, devenind presedinte RSR, introdusa cenzura basoluta, rationalizarea hranei, etc.


**IMPACTUL REGIMULUI ASUPRA SOCIETATII**

**Politica economica: Industrializarea si colectivizarea**

- La 22 iunie 1948 a fost votata legea nationalizarii intreprinderilor industriale, de transport, de asigurari si bancare.

- Se realizeaza o industrializare fortata, dupa modelul sovietic. Directiile procesului de industrializare: electrificarea, mecanizarea complexa, automatizarea productiei, dezvoltarea industriei constructoare de masini.

- Colcetivizarea agriculturii a inceput din 1949 si a fost declarata oficial ca incheiata iin 1962, cand 96% din suprafara agricola a tarii a fost inclusa in structuri colectiviste. Consecinte: distrugerea structurii traditionale a satului romanesc, desfiintarea chiaburimi, migratia de la sate la orase. Metode: brutalitati, arestari, confiscari, izolare, iar taranii au rezistat prin: rascoale, revolte, miscari de resiztenta in munti si refuzul de a preda recoltele.


**Impactul asupra culturii**

- reflecta conceptiile materialiste asupra lumii.

- prin intermediul activistilor se urmarea impunerea controlului asupra tuturor sectoarelor vietii, scopul fiind crearea 'omului nou' de tip sovietic.

- 1948-1958 - rusificarea romaniei, falsificarea ideilor nationale, a istoriei; introducerea lb ruse in scoli ca limba obligatorie; prolecultismul

- 1958-1965 - se impune un proces de derusificare

- 1965-1974 - perioada cand Romania este deschisa spre Occident, invatamantul cunoscand o perioada de modernizare, istoria rescrisa, sociologia reabilitata

- 1974-1989 - cea mai grea perioada cunoscuta de cultura romana, ideologizarea tuturor sectoarelor vietii sociale.


**Dizidenta anticomunista**

- se manifesta in mod special in primii ani ai regimului

- 1949-1956 - puternica rezistenta armata in muntii Carpati: haiducii Muscelului, haiducii lui Iancu.

- rezistenta intelectualilor romani din exil: Paul Goma, Vlad Georgescu

- rezistenta intelectualilor in spatiul romanesc: Doina Cornea, Ana Blandiana, Mircea Dinescu, Aureal Dragos Munteanu.

- 1989 - Scrisoarea celor 6 - adresata lui Nicolae Ceausescu"
8u1e0r,27,2018-06-26,My story about the awful practices of a certain company,McDougiee,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8u1e0r/my_story_about_the_awful_practices_of_a_certain/,"Hey guys, first post here, so I’m not sure if this fits, but here we go:

It’s summer here in Illinois, which means that all the students coming home from college need a job, me included. I was trying to get out of the dishwashing industry, because it’s the dishwashing industry, and into something a little less gross. I go online to apply for some jobs, just some nice ones like GameStop because I like video games, and I come across what seems like the perfect job for me.

“SUMMER INTERNSHIP: PAID” said this listing, and my heart starts to race. It’s every college student’s wet dream. It says it’s an advertising job, and hey, I don’t major in that, but how hard could it be? I sent in my resume to this unnamed company (only because I’m not sure of the rules of this subreddit, otherwise I’d be plastering this post with the name) and get a prompt and promising result. An email reply later, I’ve got an interview date for tomorrow. Time to prepare. 

When I go into an interview, I like to know a lot about the company. So, I looked them up on google and saw 1 star staring me back in the review section. “You have my attention” I (probably) muttered to myself as I expand, and I see 4 reviewers each giving this company one star, talking about how poor the office looks, and how it was definitely a scam. I talked myself into believing that they just were salty they weren’t hired after interviewing with them, and that my fate would be different. I lay out my suit for tomorrow, and head to sleep.

The next day I woke up like a kid on Christmas, ready and excited to interview for this job. I take the 25 minute drive in anxious spirits, because I really don’t wanna screw this up. I’ve always wanted to try advertising, and I never want to go back to dishes. I walk into the (admittedly dingy) office building and go up a floor to their office. The decor is IKEA-core, but not bad like the reviews say. The interviewer was pleasant, and when I asked what kind of advertising they do, she says “ground floor advertisement”. She states that some big companies like DirecTV and Verizon have deals with them. “Okay”, I think to myself “This is just a start up firm looking for people like me!” I was asked to come to another interview the next day. 

I wear my only suit again the next day. It’s a very nice, navy blue suit, and I normally wear some brown chukkas to ease down the formality, and a semi bold tie to really make the whole outfit pop. I got it while working for my hometown AHL team. I can’t believe I sullied it wearing it to this interview. I get there 10 minutes early (eager but not too eager—I planned ahead), and end up waiting 40 minutes after my time. I’m finally greeted by my interviewer, a bald man with tattoos poking through his collar, and Oakley’s worn backward on his shiny dome. Alarm bells are ringing. He says we’re going on a field interview, to my local Menards. “Cool, I’m gonna see what this business actually does!” runs through my mind. I had thought that ground floor advertising was something to do with laying out floor plans and item placement, or maybe using displays at a shop. So I was still on board when baldy and I took separate cars and pulled up on the home goods store. 

He immediately takes me to the back of the store, and sets his overstuffed bag next to the display of all the doors. He pulls out a handheld white board and starts talking to me about the law of averages. But he gets it completely wrong, and actually educated me on the law of diminishing returns. Then we go even further in the back, and he pulls the tarp off over one of my biggest fears. My heart drops to my stomach, my stomach drops to the floor, and the sweat on my brow gets into my eyes and makes me see red. Underneath that tarp was a foldable table, and many pamphlets about DirecTV. I put the pieces together. “Ground floor advertising” wasn’t really advertising at all. It was pestering people trying to do their shopping. It was selling your soul for $9.80 an hour, 6 days a week, with Wednesday off. 

The rest of the interview was a blur. Baldy made it sound like I was going to be a permanent part of the team, and so I asked him what was gonna be different, because I applied for the intern position and I only stay home for maybe 2 months. He didn’t even have an answer. He told me that “All I had to do was pay for the advertising equipment, and I could make all sorts of money”. And then give it back to company. At the end of the proceedings, he told me that if I wanted to have the job, I’d have to email the company 3 reasons why I should be hired. I couldn’t even think of one, but I was confusing “why I should be hired” with “why would I want to be the scum of the Earth”. I felt lied to. I was just trying to get some experience, but I ended up wasting gas, time, and a great suit on crooks and swindlers, just because they lied to my face about what they actually did. I will not try and convert you to DirecTV while you’re shopping for doors, thank you very much. 

TLDR; I was swindled, bamboozled, double crossed and flummoxed by a scheme that didn’t even pay well. "
8u1mwx,104,2018-06-26,"Thanks for coming to the movies, FMIL!",layneepup,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8u1mwx/thanks_for_coming_to_the_movies_fmil/,"Some of you may remember me posting around Christmastime two years ago. If not, I don’t blame you; my FMIL drama is relatively tame compared to others. For full disclosure: my SO and I are not engaged, and I won’t be entertaining that notion until I feel comfortable with where our therapy’s at. I gave SO the ultimatum that it was therapy or I walk back in October, and we’ve been doing couple’s therapy and he’s been talking to that therapist individually since then. 


I mostly just wanted to record some of the more obnoxious things FMIL has done, because my SO has indicated he’s ready to go from VLC to LC with her (she’s been in TO more or less since last summer) and tbqh I think thats a terrible idea, and want to have this list for when the revisionist history starts. 


Without further ado, shit my FMIL has done:


1. If you remember from the Christmas story, she’s weirdly interested in our sex life. As in, wanted to bar us from staying in the same room and, when that didn’t work out (other guest rooms were full), gave us two twin-sized beds pushed to either side of the room and made awkward comments about how we “got what we wanted” by sleeping in the same room and “it’s not like we didn’t sleep together anyway.” We were 24 and 25 at the time and had been dating for 3 years. Bonus: FMIL’s mother told my SO to watch out because I would trap him with a baby without ever having met me, when we first started dating. (I am childfree.)


2. Talks about how she is “not affectionate” to me while literally hanging all over my SO, constantly complimenting him, touching him, kissing his cheek, etc. This woman has never hugged/kissed her husband that I’ve seen (we stayed with them a full week in their home, for example.) SO’s normal meter is fucked about this one: at one point he came to a separate floor of his parents’ house after showering wearing just a towel around his waist. Hugged and kissed his mom half naked with his junk basically out. (Hugged and kissed me too, but I was so uncomfortable with the fact that I could literally feel his penis while getting a hug with his grandmother in the room that I froze. Still makes me feel squicky to this day.) 


3. Will demand to move tables at every restaurant. Doesn’t matter if we already have the best table. Apparently she “always does this.”


4. Used to call my SO on the phone and just cry hysterically for hours. Complained to him about her marriage/his sibling. According to him, used to threaten to hurt herself. I told him if she did it again, that he should call her local police to either get her he help she needs or get her to knock it off. Luckily he agreed and I think put an end to that, which was necessary because he would shut down/ignore me if I got upset because he was so emotionally worn out/trained that this was “normal” and not a big deal and it was having a terrible impact on our relationship. 


5. Would just show up unannounced at our University to visit SO. I only dated him for our senior year so I didn’t know this, but when we first got together, she showed up like the next week for his birthday. When I didn’t hear from him on his birthday, I figured he was busy with PhD applications. I didn’t find out until years later it was because his Mom crashed her adult son’s birthday without warning. 


6. Speaking of showing up, last April, my SO was dropping me off at the airport after a visit (LDR) and when he got home, his mom was waiting at his apartment. He refused to let her in (he had asked her for space prior to this, due to a series of the crying phone calls/other factors) so she decided to just show up, par for the course. She made a huge scene crying and banging on the door. My SO texted me having a breakdown and I had to turn my phone off on the plane, knowing he was sitting in his house with headphones on trying to ignore this crazy. By the time I landed, she had left, but sent SO some texts about how she’d be around for a couple of days and hoped he got over whatever was “tormenting his soul”. The irony of that being her was not lost on me. This was the moment my SO went VLC with her, more or less, and I was really proud of him for finding a spine in this moment. 


7. This one, for some reason, is the worst for me. We went to the movies together (me, SO, FMIL, FFIL, AIL, GMIL1 and GMIL2). I’d forgiven GMILs for suggesting I was trying to trap SO because they were absolutely sweet to me after I met them and welcomed me into the family/invites me to their homes in Other Country, gave me a family heirloom, etc. GMILs are cute and best friends. So, we have 3 seats on one side of an aisle thing (it was a really fancy movie theatre with like, tables and waitresses) and 4 on the other. Naturally, GMILs want to sit together so SO and I go with AIL to the 3 seats, leaving FMIL with FFIL. We noticed FMIL get up and leave the theatre during previews and she didn’t come back until well into the movie. Apparently she wanted to sit next to SO (so we could both hold his hands?) and threw a hissy fit when she had to sit with her husband instead, and thought AIL should have sat with the grandmas or given FMIL her seat. FMIL was texting my SO about this during the movie. He eventually silenced his phone and we enjoyed the movie while FMIL spent most of it drinking a glass of wine outside of the theatre. 


There are a million more things, but I just had to get these off my chest since SO’s parents just happen to be planning a trip to Touristy Thing near his new internship and asked if he wanted to meet up with them. He’s considering it. I asked him what had changed and if they’d ever acknowledged doing anything wrong or apologized, and he said they never would understand and it was “not fair” to expect them to. 


Normally I would say not my circus and stay out of it, but my SO is tbh a pretty terrible partner right now because of his anxiety and he recently lied to me about seeing his parents, which spikes my anxiety.

I am fairly new to the whole concept of CI/CD, and I have some questions. First off, I am an intern for a Windows-heavy company. What I am trying to do is host our own private PowerShell repository. I have set up a NuGet feed via ProGet (free edition) to hold the modules within the repository. Version control is a top priority for us. We use GitLab to host these modules (and other projects), and I was wondering if someone could explain the best process for getting changes made in GitLab to get pushed up to this NuGet server.

Is there a middle-man between GitLab and Proget that I should be using, or am I able to push changes to the NuGet server via GitLab's API or WebHooks (using PowerShell)?

Also, if this is not the right sub, please direct me in the right direction.

Thank you!"
8u2ksp,3,2018-06-26,"If hell exists, its in my heart",Tatara_san,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/8u2ksp/if_hell_exists_its_in_my_heart/,"Hi my fellow unicorns,

I suddenly feel so emotional, suppressed tonight and I would want to share my love story, from an extraordinary 1-month wonderland plummeted to a 2-month life of hell. I know this story is a bit long and I dont expect all redditors might go through the entire writing. But I do really feel appreciated!

Around the ending of the last september, I met a guy in a gathering of a gay NGO. He appeared to be a timid, introverted but shine, intellectual curious and artistic person (INTP-9). I never met a guy in my 22 years of life that is such elegant and beautiful, which his impact crushed me hard from the first sight I saw him. We did not communicate much during the gathering, but we do leave together and share few catalogs of conversation before we spread out.

After that day, he sent me a friend request on facebook and we initiate communication immediately. We shared our professions, interests and knowledge, we talked about self-made arts and exchanged photos of our daily life. Both of us felt comfortable and satisfied with the depth of conversation. I could actually felt theres a doe jumping in my heart and I cannot stop resisting to investigate my life and love into such an elegant person. Eventually, I came up with him around early october. Despite he felt it is so suddenly and a bit too early, he did not commit anything but we soon developed a relationship of an unofficial lover. He invited me to his home \[(18+)\] and we went to several dates. Although I know intp person does not speak love, I could tell that he likes me the same amount I did, from his body language and physical contact.

However, around end of october, one of my friend told me that he sent flirty messages and nudes on a telegram group. I feel deeply frustrated with explosion of anger as I would see it as a betrayal. The rationale of this feeling might be caused by his disrespect to my love which I rarely give to others. I believe love is the most valuable gift of mine and I do hope other could value the weight/meaning of his love the same i do. However, he didnt. I start doubting whether he is faking his affection and I initiate a major argument with his. He did not reply much and I guess it is his defense mechanism. Wound has made, and this wound makes me mistrust and insecure. After that we met a few times, I could really feel there are distant stacking between us. The chemical expired.

Around mid November, we went to a bar gathering and I was a bit tipsy. Emotions of insecurity flooded into my brain and I wish to hold his hands to comfort me. However he shrinked and sat away. Perhaps he was scared of my drunk misbehave but it makes me a major emotion wound. I felt super depressed, particularly I saw him chitchating with another guy and left together. My emotion collapsed and I had a big cry on my friend's shoulder. I never cried that hard and that was my first time crying in public. I felt disheartened, depressed like the world has end. I started apologising with my misbehave and other stuffs that might caused him leaving but his cold shoulder remains.

Soon in december, I travelled to a new place for a 6-month internship. We did not chat for a month. Unfortunately at the end of the year, I was sent to the hospital due to a serious ill that requires an immediate operation (in a foreign country, alone). I was terrified with the fear of death and the only image that appeared in my brain is him. Somehow I felt if I really died I would not regret he was the last one I texted. So, I texted him my situation in brief right before I was moved into surgery room. However, after I was awake, I found he blocked all my contacts. tbh, I dont know how to react, perhaps I have been suffered too much fear and tired of overthinking his cold shoulder, at least he made his decision clear.

Since january, every days and nights there are memory bubbles coming up. I miss him so much. Emotions prevented me to sleep and stay focus which I felt my life is empty and worthless. Therefore, I tried to paralysis myself with hardworks. It does works, but he appeared in my brain again every time I was exhausted. The virtual him gave me energy to live and work, fighting against my tireness, although I know the fact that he is not coming back.

Reflecting this 6 month of hell, despite this emotion sometimes pops in (like today), it affects me lesser and lesser. It warns me not to trust or investigate other too much. Instead I realise that I have been treating myself too bad, most selfless. I start being more self-conscious, showing more of my feelings and emotions to others (Fi is a privacy!) by writing and drawings, using music to express my emotions and found some topics of skills for my to invest and learn. I start training my Ti and hopefully this logical framework could let me control my emotion, but not letting my emotion controlling me (to do silly acts). Perhaps some relationships are for learning and some relationships are for commitment. I start telling myself there must be good days and ofc it is okay to have bad days too. Although I still miss him quite much, I am now trying to explore the possibility for me to investigate my love to someone else. But I know that, even I will be in love with someone else, he would still occupying some proportion in my heart.

Despite i still feel im a bit not to honest to myself, I am now trying ameliorate this self-dishonesty by facing my feeling and emotion more directly. Writing this story is one of my strategy. I feel so much better now not just because I share it to you, but how I analysis myself while writing this. Sometimes it is hard to think without emotion but writing distracting me from this overpowering Fi and boost my Ti. Thank you so much for reading the text and I think it is a good time for me to have a nice sleep! English is not my mother language but I am trying to make it grammatically correct withe my best effort! Please do accept my apologise if my poor english confuses you!   


Good night everyone :) :)"
8u2w5s,7,2018-06-26,She said I wasn't man enough for her,JohnDoeSnow,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8u2w5s/she_said_i_wasnt_man_enough_for_her/,"A little over a month ago my relationship of 1 year came to an end. It all started with her saying she doesnt know how she felt and I basically got her to own up to everything. She said my mannerisms were embarrassing to be around, that I was a pushover, and all these things made me not man enough for her- I'm cute but not sexy so she'd rather fuck around. 

After the breakup was finalized she'd send me messages once in a while and we'd talk about how much we missed eachother. It always came down to she wanted to cuddle with me, for me to tell her everything is okay when shes sad, but it would have to be an open relationship. I said ""So a boyfriend without the benefits?"" and all she could respond with as ""Ugh I'm so sorry :("" 

I feel like my life is some kind of sick joke. My previous major involvement with a woman ended in a similar way (high school girl slept with my bestfriend, a chadbro I had an inferiority comlex to, despite him being purposefully abusive to her). I'm trying not to swallow the black pill again but its hard not to when it feels like life is pushing it down my throat. Even before we broke up she would say things to the effect of ""I wish we met when we were in our 30s (I'm 20, shes 18)"" and ""youre definitely the guy to bring home to the parents"". Its as if my life is some cautionary tale a redpiller tells to scare people into his way of thinking, or some greentext story from /r9k/ only its absolutely fucking real. 

I've spent the past month hitting the gym hard, trying to focus on my studies, and everything to distract myself. Everyday I get overwhelmed with trying to 24/7 make sure I carry myself in a way people can respect, constantly in my head saying: 

""Dont talk to yourself""

""Stop fidgeting""

""Sit up straight"" 

""Get that fucking pen out of your mouth I'm not going to say it again"" 

I always had a prematurity problem to deal with but when I manage to get myself hard now (oftentimes I'm just too defeated) Its always super fast when I'm not even really turned on. Then I get drunk and glower in the mirror saying ""This is all I am and all I'll ever be"". Then I just oscillate between hating women and myself for the rest of the day as I keep pushing on in my work, internship, job, etc because I'm not allowed to have a bad time in my life where I actually break down. 

I loved you more than anything, and when you told me you loved me and looked at me like I was the greatest man on earth, I felt like a complete human being for once. Now I'm just back at the start, hopefully the lesson can stick this time so I don't make this mistake again. All I ever wanted was to be a great husband and father but I'm obviously just the provider type that gets settled for, if a thought in anyone's mind at all. 

Thanks for letting me ramble here"
8u2ygj,14,2018-06-26,My experience moving to Switzerland (after 2.5 years),travel_ali,ali_on_switzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/8u2ygj/my_experience_moving_to_switzerland_after_25_years/,"I moved to Switzerland over 2.5 years ago, and as it is raining out and I am feeling thoughtful here is a reflection of the move and my subsequent time here. [I made a post on here 2 years ago about my thoughts after 6 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3x3hkn/i_moved_to_switzerland_here_are_a_few_thoughts_on/), so this post is kind of a redo/update of that (and this is also heavily focused on the German speaking part of the country).

In short it has been a fantastic experience: I moved into a flat in the old town of an absurdly pretty town, got the chance to fully explore the country, made friends and feel I have integrated and understand the country very well. The move itself was very easy for me. But the language has been the slow and hard part.

Partly I wrote this for myself to help clear up my thoughts and memories, but hopefully it will be interesting and helpful to others.
[For info on travel, hiking and other things see this previous series of posts I put on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/85jbdn/resources_for_switzerland/). This is just about my experience moving and living here (ok it is mostly to bitch about the language, but shhh).

**Serious bits**

There are plenty of blogs ([eg: the German Way](https://www.german-way.com/)), forums [englishforum.ch](https://www.englishforum.ch/)), and books (Living and working in Switzerland by David Hampshire) out there dealing with the matter. Blogs from other expats are sometimes wonderfully accurate, but sometimes they seem to describe another country altogether. I am mostly going to avoid serious bits as they are covered well elsewhere.

One thing I will say is transfer your driving licence to a Swiss one right away if you are from a country that can. After 1 year your license is no longer valid in Switzerland. I swapped mine after 2.5 years no problem, but everything I read suggested that you might have to retake the whole test again. What is outdated and what is certain Kantons only is very confusing so take the safe option and do it soon.

**Why / How**

Basically I just ended up here slightly by chance. I (at the time M/28/UK) was doing a PhD in Biomaterials and had been wanting to do a Post-doc outside of the UK (adventure, travel, and experience), but had been focused on Germany or Australia and had never really considered Switzerland. Then a job with the right requirements popped up through contacts as I was writing up my PhD. I applied, got the position, and suddenly found myself about to move to a country which I didn’t really know a whole lot about and to a town I had never heard of.

There were two major aids here: the culture and highly specific skills of academia makes it very easy to find a job in another country, and as an EU citizen (for now) I get equal rights and easy access to Switzerland. So it was just a case of entering the country normally and telling them I was here once I set myself up.

**Pre-move research**

I had been to Switzerland twice before during my studies, but only to Geneva and most of that time was spent at CERN on or over the border with France. Now I was moving all by myself to a different part of the country and the closest person I knew was in the north of Germany. So I was really going in blind and alone.

I was spending 2 months travelling elsewhere in the run up to the start date so didn’t really have much time for any serious preparation beyond checking what I needed to do to make sure I entered and set myself up legally.

What I did do was read Swiss Watching by Diccon Bewes. [He also has a long but quite good TedX talk, similar to the Swiss Watching book but quicker for some of the basic facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc). He tends to overdo some points, but generally gives a very good overview of the country and the people.

Otherwise I just bought tickets for the closest airport and packed as much as I could into the biggest bag I had: laptop, clothes, a frying pan, and hiking boots. 

**The move**

All things considered this went surprisingly smooth.

Entering the country I just walked through customs just like any holiday maker with a big bag. I then left the airport by the wrong country - a problem which is possibly unique to Basel/Mülhausen - before correctly entering Switzerland and meeting my new boss for the first time in arrivals. He escorted me to our town and informed about various things work and life related on the way (99% of which I forgot pretty much instantly as my mind was overwhelmed with so much to take in).

I had been expecting to use the flat my new workplace rented for visitors, but I found out late on that it was already taken by some interns, and so I had to find my own place at very short notice. Browsing the standard property websites I quickly realised that my original idea of finding myself a furnished flat was not going to happen - such properties are very limited in number and absurdly expensive. I got very lucky and found a room to sublet almost instantly though the flatmate finding website [wgzimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer.html) (though be warned flat sharing is not a common thing here like it is in the UK). Not only did I get a mostly furnished flat to live in, but it was in the historic old town, and I had a Swiss housemate which made starting so much easier as I had both an instant friend and a local guide / information source.

(Having since searched for a proper flat 2 years later I have found it is a rather slow process. You typically have to arrange with the current tenant to see the flat, rather than just getting an agent to take you around a selection. Often the tenant feeds back to the company which means appearing in a smart(ish) outfit and being friend helps, certainly the quickest and most positive responses I got were when I had a good chatty tour with the current tenant. Applying then takes ages as you have a to fill out a form for each flat, and the answer can take anything from a few hours to a few weeks. On the plus side you legally get a day off from work to move house which is nice.)

I moved into the flat without a rental contract at first as it took time for the landlord to approve me as a sub-tenant. Whilst slightly chaotic (I took most of my first months wages in a large pile of cash), this made the whole chicken-egg process of getting setup in a new country vastly easier. Once the rental contract came through it was simple to just go to the Kanton with my passport and work/rental contracts and register as a resident, followed by a quick trip to the bank to get myself a bank account. And just like that life fell into place.

For the mandatory health insurance (you have 3 months, but start early as it takes at least a month for it to actually be processed) I just went on Helsana and figured out a reasonably cheap package. I haven’t changed it since, but many Swiss take it very seriously and constantly swap to keep the cost down.

I didn’t really have to spend much time on official matters, and didn’t really come across any serious problems or delays (other than sleeping on the floor for a few weeks as Ikea delivery takes ages). Even setting up a bank account with no common language went surprisingly smooth and quickly.

**Adjustment and life**

I went in with a 1 year contract and a mentality that I would jump in, make the most of the time to see everything I could, and then hop out again to move on elsewhere afterwards (or stay if possible, but I was very open to whatever).

During the early days keeping yourself busy is probably the best thing you can do.
On which point the first few “honeymoon” months are a magical time when everything is different and exciting - make the most of them. Especially for me as I turned up at the end of May which is possibly the best time of year - warm weather, snowy peaks, and green meadows. During my first summer I constantly bought new and novel things in the supermarket, and went on trips almost every weekend. My coworkers started to become quite amused as I turned up every Friday with hiking boots and a backpack to head off directly into the mountains after work.

It of course isn’t all rustic cabins and mountains. Most people moving into Switzerland will go to the Flatland: which can be wonderfully charming with rustic villages and rolling forested hills, but can also be ugly industry and forgettable charmless towns. From October to February the Flatland suffers from a dense low fog which swallows the light and leaves you in a depressing world of grey for weeks or months at a time. [You can escape above it to a world of beautiful clear views and sunshine](https://i.imgur.com/SKmNWwt.jpg) at the weekend (some people go up armed with deckchairs and newspapers), but during the working week you are rather stuck with it.

My past experience made dealing with the move quite easy: having moved to Australia as a kid, and a few times in the UK for uni I had gotten used to new places and new people. I also suspect I have it very easy as an outsider here: I am white, speak English as my mother language, and am skilled (ie: I look like I fit in, I can almost always communicate, and I arguably add something to the country). I don’t mean that in a “the Swiss are horribly racist” way, but a just “the closer you are to the culture you move to then the easier it is” way.

With my housemate and friends I made at work I found myself with a social life fairly early on. Partly due to that, and partly due to not wanting to fall into the expat-trap, I didn’t get around to meeting my local English speaking society until almost 2 years after I arrived. In retrospect it would have been better to join them early on for advice and tips.

Moving from one western country to another isn’t too big a challenge. But the differences can pile up:

* If you come from anywhere but Norway then converting the prices back to your home currency will give you a heart attack each time you go to the shops here. It is best to stop doing that ASAP. Prices are high, but pay is good.

* Getting used to the way things work takes time. I was utterly shocked on arrival to find the shops here close at 6:30pm during the week. 

* One of the curious bits of adjustments was the steady stream of small differences that I became aware of as time passed. For example after months of spending at least part of every day in the countryside I finally realised what it was that seemed off to me - there were no fences or hedges and so it all felt strangely open compared to the English countryside.

**Language**

*Side point: I have now added [a Swiss-German specific post](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/7y6ubu/my_experience_dealing_with_swissgerman_for_those/)*

This is the one thing that gets to me the most about living abroad. It can really isolate you or give you the feeling of being isolated even when you are being socially accommodated (I feel guilty about it and hate having to drag the conversation back to English). Being near the Röstigraben I sometimes end up in a French dominated group (of which I speak almost nothing beyond ordering a coffee) so the effect is somewhat doubled. 

You can survive here without German - I have met plenty of people working at big companies like Novartis that do. English is kind of the common language here - far less people speak multiple Swiss languages fluently than you would expect. Still, when someone in Switzerland says they “only speak a little French” it tends to me they can only converse for an hour or two (as opposed to “a little French” in the UK which means you can count to 5). Once you are setup and enter the rhythm of everyday life then (other than the odd official letter) it is easy to just coast along in English. This is understandable in some ways: coming home after work it can be hard to find the motivation or time to sit down and study something serious (especially with a family), and learning by immersion is often about as much fun as learning to swim by being thrown into a tsunami. 

I wanted to learn the language regardless, but I also happened to move to a very Swiss company in a small town that is almost unknown internationally. As such I was always immersed (drowning) in Swiss-German and had plenty of motivation to learn. 

I would sum up the experience of learning a language as you move to a new country as three stages:

- **1 - The initial novelty.** You have just arrived and everything is exciting and new. You don’t understand anything but that is fine: you are armed with a range of apps, you are confident that immersion in the language will make sound like a native in a few months, and you can even identify some of the items in your kitchen in German already.

- **2- The frustration stage.** You have completed Duolingo and other such things, politely smiled through hours of German, and learnt your dative/genitive/etc - but you don’t understand a fucking thing beyond the fact that the important looking sign in the train station says something about platform 4.

- **3 - Starting to click.** You might still mix up words and your grammar makes the language less of an art and more of a frontal assault. But you understand what is said and get the message across. Conversational level has been reached, and the long road to fluency begins.

- **4 - Bonus Swiss-German stage.** You read, listen, and talk High-German without trouble. Then you pop into Migro and the cashier asks you a simple question in Swiss-German, but you don’t understand a bloody word. You sigh and lower your head in shame/frustration.

I had 3 years of German at school in the UK which was something but not amazing (I showed an example GCSE exam to Swiss colleagues and they literally laughed). Still at least that gave me some words and installed a basic appreciation of the language which helped me restart 10 years later. Having recently started learning French from nothing I actually do appreciate that my school German was a helpful foundation, though I think 3 years of “bare minimum because I had to” at school translates to about 3 months of part-time “because I want to” later on.

I didn’t have much time before moving out so I just played with some game/apps on my phone, which taught me one or two words but were mostly useless. On getting into Switzerland I hit Duolingo and worked my way through it. It is certainly attractive being easy, free, and full of happy binging sounds. But overall I would say it is really limited. You are so far from everyday understanding at the end. Some people claim to watch TV shows or hold full conversations based purely on Duolingo, fuck knows what they watch or talk about but I was nowhere near that. It is useful as something to play with, but as a supplement to other methods. I found Memrise after completing Duolingo, but at this point I could not be bothered with more repetitive filling in the blanks - so I didn’t really bother with it. Instead I moved onto youtube, games, newspapers, classes, and whatever interaction occurred in my daily life.

My German has come quite a way and generally impresses most people I talk to here given the amount of time I have learnt it in (and sometimes that I have bothered to learn it at all, though I feel I could be so much further with less time “wasted” on other things):

* On arrival I would say I was A1. I could introduce myself and say that I had a cat (which was a lie), count, and identify a few objects and animals. But that was about it.

* Now after 2.5 years I can understand most High-German and join in on most topics, so would put myself at B2. Though my grammar is still far from pretty, and a long German session can still burn me out. I can barely remember any genders for nouns and mostly just pick whatever sounds best in my head. Whether I fully understand Swiss-German is very hit or miss.

I must say that I really like Swiss-German. I like how it sounds and it is so much more interesting and full of character than High-German. However….

Learning German in Switzerland can be absurdly frustrating (more so than usual). Swiss-German makes it so much more complicated (basically [see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBLjOF8UfNk)). You can reach total fluency in High-German, but then get utterly floored by the simplest question from a Swiss person. The Swiss like to laugh when people ask them if “Swiss” is a language, but I would argue that Swiss-German is basically a whole other language. The pronunciation, grammar, and even basic words are often very different. It isn’t so much that the goalposts have been moved, but that the whole fucking game has changed. The idea of trying to play football whilst the other team are playing Gaelic football is about on the right lines. [This video makes the point rather well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2S9iggdzM). And on the point of [a whole different game….](https://youtu.be/ThwG88SFIQc).

Still there is no ß in Swiss-German (you just use ss instead) which saves some faffing around at least. It also helps to know that Swiss-German gives most normal Germans a hard time too (German TV often gives Swiss speakers subtitles).

This is infinitely more frustrating as a native English speaker: people often hear my accent and switch straight to English - and usually keep going in English even when I keep responding in German. Sometimes in a shop the salesperson will run off to find an English speaking worker (and sometimes they will then run off to find another worker that speaks better English). Even the middle aged butcher in my little town speaks perfect bloody English. On the flip side having a Swiss address means people often assume I am Swiss and hit me with the hardest dialect they can muster. Going to check into a B&amp;B as the only guests that night the host greeted me with a barrage of Swiss-German only to get a deer-in-the-headlights response from me (much to the amusement of my Swiss girlfriend). Partly this is also down to the Swiss not liking to speak High-German. Older people and those from rural areas may not have used High-German very much and so for them it can be like an alien language in some ways. 



Technically you can learn Swiss-German, but unless you are already fluent in High-German (or just plan to live the rest of your life in that part of Switzerland dealing only with Swiss) that would be insane. Every Swiss-German speaker (theoretically) understands and talks High-German (even if it pains them) so you would be pointlessly over specialising with a language that most German speakers can’t understand. Especially so as Swiss-German varies drastically by region (yes even in this tiny place), and it isn’t a defined language so if you write it out you just write it as it sounds to you in your dialekt. I have been told that any structured class on it is just a waste of time. Just learn the Swiss part by exposure as you go along - you are never going to easily pass for a local with the dialect anyway.

For putting the language to use it is much easier for me to talk German with strangers, or with people I know speak no English. When you start speaking English with people it is far too hard to then switch language years down the line when your German is good enough to function properly. I live with my Swiss girlfriend but we almost always talk in English when it is just us as German feels so strange.

While it is endless frustration, it really does payoff and feel good. For example when checking into a hotel in Graubünden the receptionist was delighted that I spoke in German rather than just shouting at her in English and I got very friendly treatment for the rest of the time. Also we had regular internal presentations that are given in German, at the start I was filling sheets of paper with scribbled words and translations from my phone as I tried to keep up, but at the end I only needed to do so for one or two words which was rather nice. And of course being able to fully function and communicate with people in daily life is rather a good payoff too.

The downside of this is that when I return to the UK it takes me a few days to stop talking German to strangers (especially if I have had a few beers).

For learning in Switzerland I found these tools very useful:

* The free commuter newspaper [20 minutes](http://www.20min.ch/) is the best tool for learning German in Switzerland (probably also French and Italian too). It is not going to win any journalism awards. But it has short, simple, neutral articles - grab a copy each day and scribble all over it. The odd Swiss-German word is included which helps build up the local lingo. Some of it (ie: the people/community section) is invented bollocks, but it mostly helps give you an idea what is important in the country and how Switzerland works.

* Dict.cc has a number of Swiss words which makes it my mobile/internet dictionary of choice for Switzerland.

* [There is an Allmanisch German wiki if you want to pick up a feeling for the way the dialect feels](https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Houptsyte).

* [SRFplay](https://www.srf.ch/play). TV and radio on demand in High and Swiss-German. You paid for this with your Billag, so abuse the hell out of it.

* SRF radio is available on podcast through services like Spotify. There are various topics in High-German regarding Switzerland and the rest of the world, and some local stations in Dialekt. I rather like SRF4 - the news radio station - which is in mostly nice clear High-German. 

* Youtube has some useful resources. Swiss-German channels like [Ask Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndi9zHvIDYa1Tp6vXJqHxA) provide plenty to listen to. It also has some SRF stuff which might help if you are not already in Switzerland. Search “bi de lüt” for shows focused on Swiss life with some strong Swiss-German accents. 

* [The australian/swiss comedy of Rob Spence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mifm_FMFLM&amp;t=4s). Not so easy to understand but somehow reassuring.

For German in general I would also suggest:

* /r/German and the resources on their [wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index).

* There is so much on youtube. [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3936178A38BB5F87) is a favourite.

* Dive in - to hell with how stupid you might sound.

* Joining a class. The learning process is much more fun when you have some people at your level to share the frustration. I spent almost a year trying to decide what level to join - online tests kept putting me as A1, but the overall meaning of each level made me think B1, in the end I went B1 and it was perfect (so bollocks to yes/no online tests).

* Duolingo provide a nice way to get started and keep steadily learning. The simple focused nature of the tree and short time requirements of the stages mean you don’t get overwhelmed and don’t need to worry about setting more than a few minutes aside for it. But overall it is really limited in what it actually teaches you of the language, so you need to heavily use other medium in addition to it. Think of Duolingo as a snack: something quick, convenient and easy to keep you going, but it isn’t going to properly fill you up. Complete the tree and practice if you find it useful, but don’t bother aiming for the highest level or for a 1000 day streak.   

* I am not a massive gamer but I swear by video games as the best way to learn. The mix of interaction, language, and fun makes for a very effective learning environment (that and being able to attack someone with a sword when you get sick of them speaking German to you is rather satisfying…..). The trick is to find something story based with a good separation of language and action: RPGs like Skyrim are perfect for this (especially using console to pause and quick save/load to repeat bits), whereas something action based like COD is too distracting. This worked especially well playing games which I completed in English years ago, where I could just about recall the gist of the story to help me along but had forgotten many aspects and details.

* Music. I built a playlist when I first arrived. It started out as random sounds, but through 2 years of steady listening and learning I can now make sense of it.

* Read out loud (though maybe not on the bus).

* [Emon publishing](https://www.emons-verlag.de/) do local Krimis with one probably set where you live or are interested in. Not exactly the best books in the world but entertaining enough.

**The Swiss**

Sometimes I feel I understand the Swiss, other times they are complex enigmas. The nature of the country often feels very contradictory at times (often liberal and conservative at once). And of course the urban/rural, and language divides only make this more complex. 

Take anything you read pre-2000 with a big pinch of salt. The country seems to have changed significantly since then: going from a dull but practical country to a much more fun and outgoing one. The summer months especially are very lively as people head outdoors to drink at bars, go to festival, and jump in the lakes/rivers. Younger Swiss are very open and there is less of the formality that you get with the older generations.

The Swiss tend to operate in two modes in public: city and mountain. In urban areas the Swiss are along the lines of the quiet closed society of stereotypes, but get them into the countryside and they can become super loud and chatty. I have been on Post buses where the entire bus was interacting and best friends by the end of the trip, and if you get on a train to the mountains with a group of retirees you will know about it. 

I am a fairly private person but the Swiss sometimes really beat me there. Once a coworker who I spoke with most days casually mentioned that he wouldn’t be in the next day, I assumed he had to wait for a delivery or something - turns out he was getting married. This has happened twice now. Most other coworkers got this treatment too, so it isn't (just) that I am insufferable. 

I have however always felt very welcomed here. On one of my first days I went walking in the Jura mountains near my town. As I sat on a peak to eat lunch an elderly local man started talking to me. My German was almost non-existent then but I managed to get the idea across that I had just moved there to start work. On finding out that this foreigner who barely spoke a word of German (let alone the local dialect) was moving in to work he wished me well and gave me a Ricola. A small gesture, but one that really stuck with me. Having improved my German I have only felt more welcome since then.

On which point the Swiss are very tolerant with language. Absurdly so really. In my early days I only once or twice got very gentle remarks that I needed to improve my German (buying curtains was one notable early occasion where my few words in German really failed to get me far) but generally they did everything to accommodate me and then as my skills picked up they started to throw praise at even my crude German. Whether that is just being polite or they are just genuinely impressed that an English speaker learnt German I am not sure.

The Swiss are almost always very considerate. Dog walkers will stop to hold their dog in place whilst bikers go past. Even the bored teens drinking on the street at night don’t bother anyone walking past. The main exception is the growing number of wankers who think they are special and can just walk around with their music blasting out of some powerful speaker (though that is probably more common elsewhere).

Some habits of talking took a while to get used to. The British habit of saying sorry to express sympathy (or anything) rather confuses the Swiss who take it to just mean guilt. Understatement isn’t really a thing here which either leads to confusion or hilarity - one day at work I was being shown a process with a sample being taken out of the oven at 1400C, on being warned that it was very hot I replied that it was indeed a wee bit toasty, the poor worker taking the sample out was almost collapsing with laughter from what I thought was just a standard comment.  

The absolute worst thing about the Swiss is their obsession with putting their bag on the seat beside them on the train (the overhead racks are apparently only there for aesthetics). They will move it if you ask, but not until you do so (no matter how obviously busy the train might be) which can create a passive aggressive awkwardness about it. Some talented people have even mastered the art of taking up 4 spaces by themselves, and then manage not to notice that there are other people on the train. 

A few odd thoughts:

* [Stereotypes exist for each region in the country](http://i.imgur.com/Gq72cwL.jpg). Generally they are fairly mature. Coming from the UK and Australia where anyone more rural than you is having sex with their sheep (and/or incest) this was quite a surprise.

* One thing I find curious is that the image of sport (TV adverts etc) here is more of families and normal people doing it as opposed to super-athletes. And most people are quite outgoing with sport and such-like. 

* Shaking hands is a big thing here. Get used to that in situations where a hello or just polite nod would do in English speaking lands.

**The long-term**

Having started with a mentality of in-and-out (with as many mountains as possible in the meantime) I have found myself getting somewhat more established here. I got extended several times to 2.5 years, met a Swiss girl, moved in with her, and am now looking for further work.

For me adapting and getting used to life here was fairly easy. I made friends via work, and my housemate. I explored every part of the country (far more than most of my Swiss acquaintances). Through watching and reading the news I now understand much better how the country works and the variations in who votes and thinks what. I can’t name the president or most of the politicians, but they are not so influential here and having no say myself in the politics I have an excuse there.

There has been some frustration and feeling of being useless and/or isolated. I sometimes get a desire for home, without actually knowing what home even is to me anymore. But generally it has been very positive. 

I only really miss a few things:

* Food. Swiss food tends to be a little less exotic than the options in the UK. I really miss the omnipresent cheap curry-houses. Likewise standard food in the supermarkets (whilst almost always good) is less exotic.

* Spicy food. Food listed as hot/spicy here tends to have all the power of slightly tangy ketchup. But this might just be a result of years of idiotic English competitive curry culture on my behalf.

* Cappuccino. This is often a standard cup of coffee with a few mm of slightly foamed milk on top. Getting what I would call a proper cappuccino is a rare and exciting experience here. 

* Culture. You can talk English with locals but it just isn’t the same. Hanging out with fellow expats helps abit there, but they are often from all over the world so you often still miss out on a proper connection.

* Opening hours. I dream of shops that open on Sunday and/or beyond the early evening. 

The main downside has been that the longer you spend somewhere the more mundane it becomes. A few days spent in Grindelwald or somewhere like that might leave you with the memory of the country as a magical place. But when you stay somewhere for longer then it becomes normal and less special with every passing day. I still love it here, but had I only stayed for the first summer than it would have stayed far more wonderful in my memory. Of course then I would just be yearning to come back.

**What would I do differently?**

If I were to repeat it again knowing what I do now (though they are all of course easier said than down):

* Allow more time for finding a flat. I got lucky on arrival, but now realise how long this process can be.

* Hit the language harder and faster. This was partly delayed by finishing up corrections and work for my PhD, but I really should have joined a class early on, and also have picked up French sooner once I started to get conversational with German.

* Make more effort to be social. I feel I integrated well, but could have done more to join a local club or been more socially outgoing on arrival.

**How to be Swiss**

* have some Aromat on your table (even if it is made by Unilever). 

* Swim in a lake/river during the summer.

* Join a club. Dancing, music, sport… just about everything exists and they are quite a big part of local social life and often a point of pride in the community. Though of course the language might be very off putting at first.

**Things to try:**

- If you are here more than a few weeks then try to get into every language region at least once. If you are here for a number of months then try and visit every little area. For a tiny country there is so much variation in landscape and culture.

- Wine. You can’t find it outside of the country, but Swiss wine is actually pretty good.

- Beer. [There are loads of small Breweries all over the country](https://bov.ch/beer/swissmaps.html), Switzerland apparently has the most breweries per capita in the world. Feldschlossen is the “standard” mass produced beer you find everywhere. Compared to the standards in other countries it isn’t too bad, but try and find something more interesting.

- Cheese. More than just Emmental. Try everything you can.

- Vermicelle. A desert made out of minced chestnut. Best in autumn.

**Useful quickfire points:**

- Swiss plugs are like (but not identical to) standard European ones. Standard European ones do not always fit here, come prepared with at least 1 Swiss specific plug.

- Kantons have lots of power and the way they are run can vary quite a bit. The Kanton and place you live in can have rather a large effect on the taxes, health insurance, and various quality of life factors.

- Catholics kantons have far more official holidays (on such days the shops in protestant kantons will fill up with shoppers from the surrounding kantons). Swiss holidays fall on a date, not day of the week, and many firms make bridge days for holidays on a Tuesday or Thursday. This means that year to year the number of official holidays you have can vary from almost none, to having what feels like the the whole of May off work. The absolute worst is holidays on a Saturday when you miss the day off, and all the bloody shops are closed.

- Look into at least getting the Half-Tax train pass even if you don’t plan to take public transport too often - it applies to most cable cars and ships too. Combined with supersaver tickets on the SBB app you can buy tickets for specific trains at quieter times for 25% of the normal cost. If you live with someone else who has it then you get a discount. Same with the GA: my girlfriend is a student, and I live with her, so we both save about a third off the GA.

- Name is last name, not first name (vorname), in German. I ruined countless forms until I got used to that.

- The Swiss 1 looks like an upside down V at times. That caused some confusion too.

- Look into [Reka money](https://reka.ch/en/rekamoney/seiten/reka-money.aspx). It is basically “voucher” money that is usable for leisure and travel in Switzerland (accommodation, food, transport, activities). You can’t use it everywhere, but you can get it at as little as 80% of the cost in CHF. Saving 20% off travel inside Switzerland is very nice. For best results see if your company has an account in place to help you get the checks or a savings account (mine gave it out as a summer holiday bonus). If you do use the banknote like checks bear in mind that you often don’t get change from them, so prepare a mix of the checks and coins to cover the full cost.

- Another useful thing is [Mobility car rental](https://www.mobility.ch/en/) where you can pick up a rental car (of various sizes) from numerous sites (mostly train stations). This is wonderfully useful if you just need to make the odd short trip to IKEA or for a particular hard to reach spot for a few hours. Registration to driving is a matter of hours, and after that booking a slot and setting off is a process of seconds.

- Charity shops are not a thing like they are in the UK. So cheap and easy 2nd hand things are not always so easy to find.

- Asterix and Obelix is rather popular here. Brush up on that for Switzerland and your country to understand the references.

- If you are swapping the side of the road you drive on, then try and cycle rather than drive as much as possible at first. It is much easier to quickly dash onto the pavement when you go wrong on a bike than with a car (maybe best if you stick to simple quiet roads). Cycling on the right helped me clear my left-sided instincts out so when I finally drove on the right it was natural.

**Not so useful points:**

- You will spend the first few months with a Swiss kezboard mixing up the z and y kezs.

I did reached out to one of my classmates who used to work there and he said the salary range for that position is apprx 65k-83k and recommends that i accept no less than 75k.

I do enjoy working at my current job at Company A which is a smaller firm. I also have a really good relationship with my current boss. Company B probably has more resources and would pay me over-time, meaning i could potentially earn more than 70k at company B. I plan to ask again for 75k, but should I even mention that 75k would be more competitive than what im making now at Caompany A? and if they reject that, is it even worth it to accept? "
8u3qf0,0,2018-06-26,[M4F] The Virgin Cumslut,dpone,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8u3qf0/m4f_the_virgin_cumslut/,"*This is a prompt for adults, by an adult, and is purely fantasy.*

One of my favorite fantasies lately is denying a woman access to her pussy, her primary pleasure center, and training her to prefer life that way - to thank me for it. I want to take that a step further, and groom a cute teenage girl to live this way right from the start. Before she's had more than a first kiss, maybe experimented with touching herself. Her life is to be one of service, but it's joyous, enthusiastic service.

Here are a few ways this could go down.

If you dig incest:

**Daddy's Little Pornstar**: In this world, the age of consent and the age for appearing in adult films have dropped to 14. Whether Daddy or daughter had the idea first, the daughter is going to become a pornstar. But she's inexperienced. Plus - she needs Daddy's permission, and Daddy has one condition. Lucky for her, it's a gimmick that could make her career.

**Fixing Daddy**: You (and your sister, if you like) have watched me over the past few years as I've dealt with the pain of losing your mother. As you've grown, it's become more difficult. You're the spitting image of her, and the increasingly skimpy outfits haven't been helping. After watching Daddy be miserable for far too long, you've decided you're going to make him happy - no matter what it takes.

If you don't:

**The Swallow Salon**: There's a place where men with enough money can go to enjoy service of a specific sort. You're one of the employees of the Swallow Salon, purchased when you came of age and trained to do a particular job.

**The Assistant**: You've applied for a competitive internship at a secretive company known for all kinds of clever inventions. The company's owner, CEO, and lead inventor is known for liking to keep things ""pristine."" You get the job, and find out that he's looking for a certain type of assistant.

~~

Regardless of which prompt you go with - or come at me with your own! - this is a prompt with orgasm denial and vaginal chastity at its core. If you want to take it even further, any of these prompts could lead to your character receiving chastity piercings - cute little heart-shaped locks and a clit shield making sure you never forget what and who you are. Whether you're spending your days sitting and squirming on Daddy's lap or working at the Swallow Salon, you'll be trapped in a needy, horny haze and come to prefer it that way.

This is an ageplay prompt, so I'd want to play with girls aged 14-17. It can be a daughter, twins, a neighbor, I'm open to ideas.

Even if something about this prompt does it for you that isn't ageplay related, I love the concept in general and would love to hear from you.

**KINKS**

Kinklist, 2018: https://i.imgur.com/ogBCvrX.png

Mainstream kinks: anal and oral, anal-only, forced/denied orgasms, slutty outfits, stealth/public toys, collars and leashes, cumplay, cock worship, hypnosis/mind control/drugging, free use

Niche Kinks: anal-only, vaginal chastity (required for this one!), ageplay, incest, beast

Turnoffs: blood, barf, bathroom, impreg, lactation, cuckold, feet

**COMMUNICATION**

I prefer to RP here. I'd rather keep RP here until we find out if we're compatible and going to hit it off. Initial replies should be a **few hundred characters long** at least. You can jump right into the RP if you like, but I'd love to chat first - tell me what appeals to you about the RP, what kind of relationship you'd like to play out - that kind of thing.

I don't have the time to do rapid-fire back and forth messages, but I'd love to exchange a few a day, or one really epic one a day. I can do first or third person, and prefer if we have some flexibility over character control but am open to other ideas. Give me some indication that you've read this far!

8u45z7,73,2018-06-26,In which I admit that sometimes I'm the asshole. (LONG),WutThEff,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8u45z7/in_which_i_admit_that_sometimes_im_the_asshole/,"*Note: Please, if you're going to lecture me on personal finance, don't. I've heard it all.*

So as an update, we [moved in with the in-laws](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8edvgq/llamas_we_got_incoming_advice_needed/). We're in their summer cabin through Labor Day, and they didn't join us until last week so until now we haven't been actually living *with* them. But now we are. Some backstory on why it sucks so hard and I'll probably need some advice on how to manage this:

I have a terrible relationship with my own mother (some details on BB), but the crux of the issue I'm having now is related to the year I lived with her after undergrad. I graduated in the winter, right as the last recession hit and decided to move home since there was no way in hell I was getting a job that could pay the rent. The plan was to get some kind of wage work job, apply to grad school in nearby major city, then live at home and commute when school started in the fall, and hopefully the economy would be on the rebound by the time I was out in two or three years. 

My mom was excited that I was coming to live with her. She said, ""EXCELLENT! You can be my HOUSEWIFE since you're not paying rent and I'll give you lists of stuff to get done."" There was never a question of paying rent. It was, you do all this stuff, or I'll yell at you and tell you that maybe I should treat you like a ROOMMATE instead of a DAUGHTER, with the insinuation that of course I should be a good daughter and that the roommate option was Bad and No Good. 

A few parts of that went according to plan. I started working at [Coffee chain] and I got into one of the schools I applied to. It was expensive, and I'd need to take out student loans to do it. Or, I could apply to one of the cheaper programs again and hope to get in next year. Or, I could wait out the economy working at Coffee Chain, continuing to apply to career jobs, and hoping for the best. But, every time I thought about living with my mother without an exit strategy or a plan, it made me physically ill. The rest of my family would call me worthless. I just couldn't do it. So I took out the loans and started school, believing that it would pay off when the economy rebounded and the extra degree looked good on my resume. 

So my week looked like this: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: Wake up at ass-o'clock AM to open Coffee Chain location, get off work, change in the car at stoplights on the way to the train station, take the 90 minute train ride to school, attend class for 6+ hours, take the train home, get home around 10pm, eat dinner, do the dishes, start the dishwasher, and then do some school work while trying not to fall asleep. I couldn't do it on the train, because I get motion sick if I'm not looking out the window. Tuesday/Thursday I would open the coffee shop, go home and take a nap, then do school work and whatever chores my mom had for me. 

Now, I was happy to do chores to earn my keep. But this schedule was HARD. She wanted me to do stuff like clean the bathrooms weekly, clean the kitchen daily, and god forbid I leave a single knife in the sink from the morning toast I ate before I rushed to get to work on time, because she would lose her ever loving shit. She expected me to unload the dishwasher (without making any noise, of course!) before I went to work at ass-o'clock to open the coffee shop, just so I could put away my single knife. If I hand washed it, she would be mad if it wasn't in the drawer. But of course, SHE was free to leave whatever dishes for me to wash when I came home at night. 

Then, when I came home from school, she would be over a bottle of wine deep all by herself and expected my undivided attention. When I was trying to do work, she would try to engage me in conversation on whatever TV show she was watching, i.e. every iteration of CSI/NCIS/any of those dumb fucking cookie cutter shows involving cops and murder - I'm sorry if you like them, but to me they're all the same and I hate them. She knows this and yet expected me to watch them with her, insisting, ""oh this one is different because there's a consultant! This one is different because there's a hot guy with a fun personality!"" In any case, she wanted me to watch them all, and got mad when I wasn't paying attention. I'd be doing school work, and she'd accuse me of chatting with my friends on Facebook and ignoring HER. Or she'd get up and shake me, yelling ""Pay attention to me!"" in my face, and then get mad when I got mad about that, because she was ""Just being silly."" (That's another thing - I was never allowed to be angry, if she was ""just being silly."" No personal boundaries WHATSOEVER). And sometimes I would get sick of it and tell her I wasn't interested in the show, I can't pay attention to her because I was busy. A few times, I snapped and REALLy went on a tirade about how this episode is really stupid because XY and Z is hella sexist, this plot point makes no sense because PHYSICS, this character is exactly the same fucking stock character as this other show, and everything is stupid, and I'm not fucking interested, I have better things to do, stop pestering. And then she would yell at me. More than a few times, this ended in her screaming in my face about how terrible I was and how she was JUST TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WUTTHEFF, then stomping upstairs to bed. Then, she would come to my place of work the next morning with big blotchy eyes, say, ""I'm sorry"" and then leave. But, that apology never came with a change in behavior. The next night, it would happen again.

Oh, and she also never EVER let me sleep in on my days off. If I wasn't up by 8am, she'd send the dog in. Sometimes she would jump on the bed and say ""WAKE UUUUPP.""

This is just some of it. There was also the whole issue with her getting laid off, getting a new puppy, and then getting a job within a few weeks and expecting me to take care of the puppy. Or the part where I wasn't allowed to spend my little time off with my friends or my boyfriend. She would get upset if I, a 24 year old, was out past 11pm with my boyfriend. I started spending the night at his place on my Saturdays off, and she'd start blowing up my phone at 7am with some asinine chore that needed to get done RIGHT NOW, or asking if I was late for work because she was JUST CONCERNED, or some kind of family drama bullshit or whatever.

Toward the end of the first semester of school, I couldn't do it anymore. I was still getting my school work done to satisfactory levels, but it really wasn't my best. I was falling asleep in class. And I just couldn't be under her thumb anymore. So I found some roommates, found an apartment, transferred Coffee Chain locations, and took out extra student loans for living expenses so that I could afford to move out (Coffee Chain didn't pay near enough to cover rent in that area). This was obviously not the best choice financially, but honestly, if I hadn't done that, I don't know where I would be. I'm not convinced I would be alive, to be frank, especially when my boyfriend broke up with me 6 months later. If I had still been living with her, I honestly can't imagine how I would have handled it. 

The school program was two years, and when I got out, the economy had not rebounded as planned. But, I now had a master's degree and was competing for entry-level jobs with others who were just out of undergrad. I was a month from having to move back when I was able to get a minimum wage internship at a seed-stage startup. 

This is already a long story, so suffice it to say, over the next few years I moved up in the world, met my now husband, and we moved into our own place together, etc etc etc. As you can tell by my post history, I'm working on setting boundaries and maintaining a LC/VLC relationship with my mother. It's been a hard road out of the FOG, and I'm still not there yet. 

The point being, **it is very important to me to stand on my own and have my own things and my own space.** I'm still paying for those 2 years in school and out of her house every month, and I don't regret it for a single second, because I honestly don't believe I would have survived living in my mother's house, working at Coffee Chain, with no exit strategy. 

To present day - as I have said in previous posts, my husband got laid off earlier this year, and then I got laid off back in April. I used to make over 6 figures and had some savings, but was mostly focusing on paying off my debt. So, both of us getting laid off was not good. 

My MIL had been begging us for years to come live with them when we were ready to leave the area and move to their less expensive area, so at this point we agreed that this was the right time and that it would be the smart move. I previously addressed some issues with her and baby rabies (see BB), and there have been some infantilization issues with her, but I didn't feel like we really had a better choice. 

So, starting Memorial Day, we had the summer cabin to ourselves. We've both started working at the local restaurant (for those sweet sweet summer tourist tips), I've been working on building a freelancing business, and we've both been working on our resumes and evaluating the job prospects in the in-laws area to see what might be a good fit once the summer restaurant work dries up. It's been really good. Things move at a slower pace up here, we've had some time to just breathe, save some money, and get our heads on straight. 

So here's the part where I'm the asshole. The in-laws came up for the summer last week, and it has been really hard for me. I gave up a lot and worked hard to make my own life and have my own things and my own space, and now I'm back living with parentals. It's a huge blow to my ego, and...I wouldn't say I'm traumatized from living with my mom but...am I? I don't know. So as such, I've been probably oversensitive to infantilization, to feeling ordered around or stuffed into boxes. I've been trying really hard to tell the difference between, ""Okay, this is her house and she's allowed to want X for her own house,"" and when it's appropriate to set boundaries. 

It's HARD. And the trouble is, this is again a huge blow to my ego to even be here in the first place. And I know they're doing us a huge favor by allowing us to stay with them. But, I'm an adult. I've been doing things my own way for a long time. So, no MIL, I don't need you to second-guess my judgment on whether that plant will do well there, or whether X items will fit into X storage bin, and I don't need you to talk to me like a third grader, ""You'd better do X with X food item otherwise you're just saying to the mice, COME ON AND EAT.""

And, I snapped at her when she tried to ""suggest"" what I should eat for lunch. Well, my husband says I ""snapped,"" I think I cut her off mid sentence and said, ""I'll figure out my own lunch, but thank you!"" There have been a few other examples of me being short or getting too heated on a dime, but this is just the most recent.  

We talked about it, and hubs has been annoyed with some of the stuff. But really, a lot of it's just BEC and I will say, she is great in a lot of ways. (Maybe it will help to make a list of the ways in which she's a Yes?) Regardless, a huge part of the problem is I'm sometimes the asshole. I'm definitely raw and wounded and overreacting for reasons that she doesn't know about and that aren't her fault. 

My husband has offered to talk to her about the infantilization stuff. I'm not convinced that will work. But I also know that she's not responsible for the emotional shit going down on my end, and I know that it's going to take me some time to work through it. I'm having a really hard time feeling good about where I'm at and letting go of (or at least softening myself on) the idea that my independence = self worth. 

The other problem: My mom and my MIL are friends. She doesn't know that I'm LC/VLC, although I imagine that she has  a suspicion about it because my mom has said, ""HI! I MISS YOU! I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LIFE!"" the last two times we all had dinner together. I feel like there's a chance she might understand better what I'm going through and why I've been such a dick. But, I don't know that I can explain to her about the history there and why this is so hard for me. I don't trust that she won't try to talk to my mom about it (who will most definitely try to re-write history and/or blame me for everything, OR deny it ever happened at all), and I don't trust that she'd believe me if I did. She has a history of refusing to believe or understand that life is any harder or more complicated than the plot of a Hallmark movie.  

I hope this all makes sense. It's helped writing this all out. You guys are great, thank you. "

8u4d5x,5,2018-06-26,High school programmer who doesn't know where to go,SalamosaurusRex,Cplusplus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cplusplus/comments/8u4d5x/high_school_programmer_who_doesnt_know_where_to_go/,"I have been teaching myself to program for about three years now. I started with Java when I was 11ish/12ish but after about a year or so I learned C++ and have really enjoyed using it. Originally, I was solely interested in game development (I picked up Java because of Minecraft), but over the years I became much more open minded. I have experience in OpenGL, SDL, GDI, Win32, WinSock, precalc, linear algebra and other things. For whatever reason, I really enjoy working at a lower level and have recently picked up a little x86 assembly. My problem that I face is that I really have no idea where to go. For the past 3ish years I have just been doing this on my own and making programs and libraries I think is interesting for me. I seem to find myself at a stage where I am too young or inexperienced for some opportunities but I think I am too advanced for the classes/opportunities offered for someone my age. I took a quick look at some open source projects, but I think I am far too inexperienced and uneducated to contribute to the ones I have seen. I have also been looking for internships or classes but haven't found anything really suitable yet, most things require you to be in college. (Obviously, I can and will continue to learn on my own via videos, papers, online documentation, articles, books, etc. but in this particular example I was looking for something more structured for the summer as per request of my parents. I myself have also never worked in a team setting before and would definitely enjoy getting that experience.) I have noticed there tends to be a lot more opportunities in Web and Mobile development (areas I do have baseline knowledge in but I always tended to shy away from) and fear I may not be open minded enough? Lately I have grown an interest in some of the more complicated algorithms and data structures, along with computer architecture and design patterns but I tend to find it hard to spend extended periods of time reading up on such subjects. Not sure why, I always love learning and challenging myself. Anyway, I am just wondering if anyone out there has some advice on where to go, things to look for, or what to do next to improve myself. Or if someone knows of any person/company/team willing to take on a high schooler as an ""apprentice"" of some sorts. I hope I'm not being lazy or picky, I always try to constantly improve my paradigm. Some of the stuff I have worked on in the past I put into a github repo: [https://github.com/stephenverderame](https://github.com/stephenverderame)

Not 100&amp;#37; sure where the best place for this post is, but I really appreciate anybody who takes time to read this and considers giving advice. Thanks in advanced and sorry for the barely coherent, wordy mess."

I was an intern for a high-end brand. They're carried at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Harrods -- all the big names ​in fashion. I've always had an interest in fashion and I'm thinking about becoming a buyer.

Anyway, this summer I found an internship in the New York showroom with an onsite atelier. It was one of my all-time favorite brands, and I was so excited to represent them. I wasn't sure if working for a luxury brand would fit the stereotypes I've seen in the media. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I was incredibly well-respected, and the workplace was surprisingly diverse. The lead designer was Hispanic and the other team members were from Japan. Honestly, it shattered the stereotypes I had about the industry. That is, until \*she\* arrived.

A few weeks into my internship, I was placed under the supervision of a new hire. We'll call her ""Victoria"". Victoria is 22 and she just graduated from an institution in the city. This was her third job in fashion. At first, things were okay between us, but later, they began to derail.

Every time Victoria needed an assignment completed, she would give it to me right before it was due. She's done this several times. She won't give me work very far in advance and she won't communicate deadlines until the last minute. I think she has unrealistic time expectations for things to get done. However, it takes time to complete assignments!

Every time gives me something to do, she asks, ""Why is it taking you so long? Are you almost done? It shouldn't take this long."" I can never do my work in peace. 

I fear that I came across as incompetent, when in reality, I wasn't given enough time or notice in advance to complete assignments. This led to undue  pressure for both me &amp; Victoria. However, I feel that when I am dealing with spreadsheets detailing finances, styles, and other important details, I have to make sure it's accurate. I would hate for there to be an error for the team. I'm often requested to finish things in an impossible time frame.  I also think this created an illusion of disinterest.

Last week Monday, I bought lunch for an office party. I purchased 20 sandwiches, paper plates, utensils, and two salads, and lugged it back to the office. Then, I set it up in the open room upstairs. As soon as everyone arrived to eat, Victoria asked me to leave. She tells me that her assignment was due at 12:30pm, and she asked me to go to the office to finish working on it. Mind you, I wasn't told it was due at 12:30 until 1:00pm.

I brought my laptop upstairs so I could appease her. I found a quiet corner in the room, and I sat down to finish the assignment. Then, the lead designer came up to me, and he said ""Why are you working? Come join the party!"" 

Then, the CEO of the parent company came over and said the same thing when I did not move. I finally put my work away to enjoy the party. Victoria asked me to leave to finish the assignment after I was finished.

Then, I was assigned to pack up the entire showroom for Paris and Milan with no help whatsoever. I was supposed to pack up maybe 70 articles of clothing and 150 hangers. Not only did I have to fold the (very expensive) clothes, but I had to put them in plastic bags for protection and set up the boxes. Then, I had to cross check everything against a spreadsheet with photos to make sure it was the right item. This was a huge undertaking. The whole thing would've been done so much faster if I had assistance.

Victoria came over several times to check in on my progress. Then, she said ""I didn't think it would take this long."" I mean, you asked me to pack up an entire office space in 2-3 hours. She was frustrated &amp; furious. The entire place needed a lesson in time management. 

She also got mad at me for folding the clothes so gingerly. I mean feel like I would get in trouble if I didn't, so....

While I was folding the samples, I noticed there were several mistakes on the packing list.  A few of the photos did not match up with the written style. I circled the mistakes and checked the website to make absolute sure they were incorrect. 

When I informed Victoria about the (numerous) mistakes, she insisted that she was correct, and that I had been wrong. This occurred several times. I was certain the images were wrong, but she wouldn't listen to me.  

Victoria made a few mistakes in the past that I fixed. 

Later on in the day, she asked me to get bigger boxes. She sent me to Fedex to retrieve the largest boxes in stock. They were 28 x 28 x 28 an they were extremely heavy. I got the boxes and dragged them across three city blocks. I'm 5 foot tall, and so were the boxes. I had a very hard time and I had to stop because my arms were in so much pain.

Along the way, I saw Victoria on her way to lunch. She had to have seen how huge the boxes were. She stops to comment, ""Those are perfect! I'm so glad we got 3 of those."" Then, she continued on her way to lunch. She didn't even offer to help me.

Then, I get back to the office. We went head to head when she tried to force me to do something I was physically unable to do. ""The boxes are too big,"" she tells me. ""Can you please return them?""

""I'm so sorry Victoria, but I am physically unable to carry the boxes. I really need someone to help me.""

""Well they need to be returned now. I need you to do it. Are we on the same page?""

""They're too heavy!""

""Well, it needs to get done. Just return it to the nearest Fedex. Are we on the same page?""

I asked someone in the office to assist me. However, everyone was extraordinarily busy. So I decided to hide the boxes in a closet until someone could help me carry them. I wasn't doing it all by myself.

In the interim, I ran an errand for her to get more smaller boxes. She contacted me twice within 30 minutes to find out when I was coming back. One text, one phone call.

She also shortened my one-hour lunch break (for the second time) so I could help with packing the showroom. 

When I returned, she asked if I returned the boxes. I lied and said ""yes."" Another coworker told me he would help me, but he could not provide assistance the moment. I needed to cover my ass because she wouldn't listen to me. I wasn't about to endure her rage, and returning the boxes wasn't crucial.

""Good,"" she said.

When we had to move the seven boxes to be shipped to Paris &amp; Milan, she had everyone in the office help her move them. She was like ""All hand on deck."" Everyone dropped what they were doing to help her. 

""Do we really have to help?""

""Yes, it's a lot of work. We need all hands on deck.""

However, when I told her I needed help, all I got was sass.

Later on in the day, Victoria asked me if I had the receipts for the box return. I told her no, as I had not yet returned the box. She sent me to Fedex to get the receipt. Because I still needed help with the package, I ran around the office asking for help. I finally found a nice, strong man to help me. 

However, Victoria saw me running around the place asking everyone for help. She said, ""What's going on?"" Then, I confessed I still had to return the box.

""What? Why are you bothering all these people asking for help. They have duties. They have responsibilities. We're all busy around here."" 

""But I told you I was physically unable to carry the box. I really needed help.""

""Well, you should've asked for help!""

""But I did!""

""You should've called me and asked for help. Also, you brought the boxes here just fine. Well, I've had 5 internships, and I never said no to my bosses. I always found a way to make I work. You have to get things done."" 

After that, I just burst into tears. I didn't even know what else to say.

On Friday, I woke up to the news of my dismissal. I was furious about the way this situation was handled. 

I will admit that I did make mistakes at the company. I arrived late on several occasions. However, this was because I live further than the other employees. My train was delayed on several occasions, and yes, I should've made an effort to make an earlier train. No conflict. However, I wasn't questioned about this at all. Nobody told me I was coming late.

Also, I'm 100&amp;#37; aware that I made various mistakes on assignments. I take ownership for stupid things that I've done, 100&amp;#37;. But that's also because of the constant miscommunication between me &amp; Victoria.

Two of the other reasons cited for my firing were 100&amp;#37; not true. They can be disproven through documented communications.

My responsibility as an intern is to learn. However, how am I supposed to do so if I'm not told my mistakes? 

What do you guys think I should do next? Speak up about Victoria? "

I'm 20, 5'11"", fairly fit, and white. I have brown hair, and I've been told I'm cute. I'm more than happy to send pics/verify once we start talking! I'm a college student, and I'm currently working for the summer as an intern. I'm a computer science major, and in my free time I enjoy computers, pc games, and hanging out with friends. Also I'm currently in an open relationship where we are not kinky with each other, and my girflriend knows and is 100&amp;#37; okay with me seeking this. 

Kink wise ,I'm a switch. I'm pretty inexperienced as a dom. I do, however, have experience as a sub so I'm not completely flying blind here. I think it's good to have the perspective of having been a sub for being a dom.  My favorite kinks are body worship, tease/denial, and some bondage. I also really like aftercare, I think it's important. I'm not comfortable with or looking for any watersports, scat play, or any pain that leaves a really lasting mark (like cuts or bruises). That being said, I'm very open to trying new kinks so as long as it's not one of those few I'm game to try! Obviously I will respect any and all limits you have.

I'm looking for a submissive girl or transgirl in the Boston area. You don't have to be in the city itself (I'm not). I'd really like to get to know you, your kinks, and have a friendship outside of kink as well. It would be nice to start online (preferably with kik) to get to know each other, then meet up once we're comfortable! If this sounds interesting at all to you send me a pm with a bit about yourself (and maybe a picture?) . I'd love to chat!"

*Casa Rosada, Buenos Aires*

---

---

**Reform in Educational Spending, Improving Tertiary Education, and Other Changes**

&amp;nbsp;

Despite having one of the highest rates of literacy in all of Latin America, Argentine education is still severely lacking. As the politicians of Argentina strive in the various provincial capital and in Buenos Aires to push the country forward, it has become increasingly painstakingly obvious that education must be incentivized over almost any other thing in the country. Preparing the country's future generations to deal with the problems of today and tomorrow is a necessity, and it is undeniably them that will lead the country into what can only be dreamed of in the here and now. It is the dream of any developing nation such as Argentina to model itself after the Republic of Korea, which has outpaced Argentina to such an incredible degree. In the 1970s, Argentina had roughly five times the GDP of South Korea, but today South Korea has around two-three times that of Argentina. This in large part has come as a result of the massive Korean focus on education, which has been somewhat neglected by Argentina since the late 60s. Education is an undeniable driver of the economy, returning every cent and more put into it. Should Argentina continue to ignore this reality, it will continue to be a backwater state only remarkable for its history in the 1900s. Some initiatives however have been undertaken to curb the dismal state of Argentine education, such as the [**mandating of education to start at age four**](https://cedoc.infd.edu.ar/upload/Ley27045_ObligatoriedadEscolar.pdf). A handful of steps won't save Argentina, especially when it becomes an increasingly more exposed state to the world where education is becoming more accessible and the economies of the globe more competitive.

##**Tertiary Education in Argentina**

According to a [**study in 2010**](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/world-view/argentina-top-%E2%80%94-its-dropout-rate), Argentina was home to one of the highest tertiary dropout rates in the world. This cannot be seen as acceptable, and change must be implemented before this can continue to reap its disastrous effect and cause more long-lasting damage on the country. In order to stymie this, changes must be made from the very first day a child sets his foot in school at the age of four. At the tertiary level however, change is still possible to help relieve the problem. The public universities of the country will begin taking bold steps in instilling the idea of students dropping out as ""not-an-option"" through various methods such as offering multiple options like state-sponsored tutoring, degree changing, school switching, and generally advertising the negative effects of dropping out. 

Taking a page out of the City University of New York' book, all public universities in Argentina have begun programs similar to ASAP. Students who are leaning or showing signs of dropping out will be enrolled in the program, requiring them to attend college full time and will as well heavily encourage the students to begin taking developmental courses and better paced classes which will put them on a graduation schedule closer to as what they desire. Things such as career services, internship networking, tutoring, and being individually assigned a tutor shall be some of the main features of the program, as well as helping to assist in living expenses and transportation which are often not covered in the state-paid tuition.

Another change to be undertaken in Argentine higher education is the changing of the way in which students enter into it. Becoming one of the only countries in the western world to begin this practice, Argentine universities will be moving away from university acceptance based on test scores, GPAs, and other related items, and instead introducing entrance policies similar to that seen in Japan. That is, the introduction of entrance exams. Both private and public universities are to begin this practice, with the amount and difficulty of those being taken dependant on the prestige of the given university. Most public universities in Argentina will be issuing two entrance exams, with the first being a federally issued one which is to be uniform in all provinces, and the second being that of the university. This will promote competition to enter the university. While slightly decreasing attendance rates, this will serve to increase the university's spending-per-student, and give students a stronger drive to learn. Those who do not enter the university of their choice will be pointed towards the easier two-year vocational academies, who will undertake a similar entrance practice but will have lower standards than a large four-twelve year school. This will not go effect until the beginning of the next academic year.

##**Improving Educational Spending**

As currently mandated by law in Argentina, the country is regulated to spend at least six percent of its entire Gross Domestic Product on educational spending and related expenditures. A new bill shall be introduced which shall mandate this to be improved to at least six point five percent of the Gross Domestic Product, but will strongly encourage the budget to reflect up to seven percent of it being spent on education. This relatively large spike in educational funding will be directed at the construction of new classrooms, modernizing current ones, massively raising teacher salaries, and the construction of new facilities otherwise. In times of fiscal emergencies, this bill contains a clause allowing this to be vacated back to six or even four percent until the National Congress deems the financial crisis has ceased. 

A primary target of the funding increase is to be rural public schools, looking to modernize their facilities and construct new ones as needed. Community colleges in these rural areas shall also receive funding grants based on initiatives taken by the school to develop STEM education further. An initiative shall be launched in these rural provinces, aiming to equip each student in a given school with a laptop, chromebook, iPad, or other similar device. While stimulating the information technology education of students, it will also hopefully stimulate the growing technology sector of the country, making this a win-win scenario. Teachers in these schools will be seeing improvements in the technology being used in the classroom as well, being granted equipment such as smart-boards, projectors, and other modern educational equipment. A significant portion of the funding shall go towards increasing rural teacher training, hoping to improve educator performance and quality. 

##**Changes in Argentine Primary Schooling**

It is primary education that serves as a base for the future of any student. Should they fail in this, it is very much so likely that the student will be left behind their peers, and as a result failing in society later in life due to their poor education. The methods in which primary schools in Argentina operate are only fostering this development. Aiming to improve this, the Ministry of Education shall be taking a stronger role in the primary schools of the provinces, which have often been under the near complete control of the provinces themselves and the local districts. While not aiming to be intrusive, the federal government sees it necessary to introduce a degree of changes. 

* Educators and school officials shall be made more responsible for the performance of the school and its students. Each primary school in Argentina shall receive an improvement plan and advisor by the Ministry of Education. Should schools follow this improvement plan well, they will receive incentives in the form of grants, increases in salary by the state, and even more autonomy. Those which don't follow this or produce results may see decreases in autonomy and more intrusion by the federal government to take precautions. 
* Introduction of a national school measuring system. Although each state shall maintain its system, the federal government has created a standard which all provinces must base their own off of. One aspect of this is in the rating system is the gauging of performance in five primary categories: 

 - (1) Unacceptable
 - (2) Below average
 - (3) Basic
 - (4) Above average
 - (5) Excellent

* All schools will be required to keep a public and transparent record of their rating, which is to be annually assessed by state-sent advisors.

* All public schools in Argentina will begin mandating students to take part in at least one extracurricular activity such as a club or sport. Many of these clubs may vary, ranging from literature clubs, farming clubs, film clubs, etc. Sports will also be encouraged, ranging from tennis, baseball, football (normal, not American), rugby, track and field, swimming, and more. This will help to promote a more closely linked and talented society. Exceptions may be made, but only on rare circumstances. 

The educational infrastructure in place is also in need of updating, or putting in place to begin with. Some examples being that in many cases students don't have easy access to even attend a school due to their location. With the surge in educational funding by the Argentine Government, initiatives shall be launched to provide more schools throughout the country with busses for transport of students and for extracurricular activities.

8u4zc8,3,2018-06-26,[27F4M Dom/Sub roleplay with IRL component mimicking our story. Let’s have some secret fun!],[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8u4zc8/27f4m_domsub_roleplay_with_irl_component/,"Today started out as any other normal Friday.  You got up early, had breakfast, drove to your office, and entered your workspace unaware that your life was about to change drastically within the next 30 minutes.
As you finish up some last minute paperwork for the regional office, there is a knock on your office door.
“Come in!” you arrogantly yell out lazily as I sigh out loud.  
I saunter in with a coy smile on my face, and when you see me I think I may see your mouth open so widely that your tongue hits the floor.  In this “boy’s club” you call a company, it isn’t every day that a beautiful 27 year-old redhead walks through your door.
“Hello?”  I say with a “cat that caught the mouse” look on my face.
You log out of your personal account after glancing at the number. The automatic withdrawal from the company's petty cash coffer complete, and you are now $14,500 richer. It started small, but then as you went along and nobody noticed, you kept going. Sometimes the guys around the office wonder how you can afford your Tesla Model S, and your loft in the city, all while going on expensive vacations twice a year.  But no one around here asks too many questions.
""Well hello there, gorgeous,"" you say as you settle back in your chair. ""What blew you into my office today?"" Your confidence brims over as your eyes hungrily trace up and down my frame. 
When I hear the first words out of your piggish mouth, any regret that I MIGHT have been feeling for what I am going to do to you goes right out the window. I furrow my brow, and look at you with hatred in my eyes.
“First of all, my name is Nikki...it is not “gorgeous.”
I take a moment to compose myself, or else I fear that I will simply start screaming at you right here in the office.
“And second of all, you sound like a pompous fool when you talk.”
I walk right up to your desk, and sit down in a chair in front of you crossing my right leg over my left. Although I am wearing a somewhat professional looking black business suit, there is lots of leg showing, and I am wearing 3 inch high heels.
""And I expect the new interns to call me Mr...."" you start, before I cut you off and fire my insult about your second question back at you. ""Excuse me, young lady?"" you say, with anger and authority in your eyes.  ""You should watch your tone, or you won't last two weeks here.""
Your eyes can't help but navigate down to my legs as I cross them, before they dart back up to my face. ""Just what is the meaning of this? I have a meeting starting in here in seven minutes, so it had better be quick, Nikki.""
Even though I am still searing mad from your “gorgeous” comment, when you tell me that I should “watch my tone”, I can’t help but nearly burst out laughing. I do my best to keep a straight face as I see your eyes check out my beautiful legs. I have always had sexy legs, and have used them more than once in the past to ensnare perverts much worse than you to do what I say.
I hesitate for a second, uncross my legs, and then recross them left leg over right.
“You don’t recognize me, do you?”
Your eyes follow the contour of my legs, and you lick your lips salaciously without paying attention to a word I just said.
""Huh?"" you question, glancing up into my eyes. ""You say something, Nikki?""
There is something recognizable about me. But you can't figure it out, to save your life.
I shake my head with disgust, and take a deep breathe. My plan here was to give you the bad news slowly, but you are being so unbelievable obnoxious that I might have to be direct. Or I could just kick you in your balls and leave you reeling on the floor.
“Holy Shit, enough already. Stop your godamm talking and just look at me for a second.”
As you at least attempt to figure out what I am talking about (for all I know you are trying to picture me with your cock in my mouth), I continue.
“I’ll give you a hint, hotshot...my last name is Carmichael.....you know....the same last name as the man who owns this fucking company!  I have been following things very closely for the last few months, and KNOW about all the money you have been stealing from the company.   Now do yourself a huge favor and shut the fuck up unless I tell you otherwise. For some reason you think you are a hotshot, probably because of my daddy’s money that you stole, but honestly no matter HOW important or successful you USED to be, that went away with your first transaction of $324.98 that was done exactly 3 years ago today. “Happy Anniversary”, by the way because three years a little at a time adds up to a whole fucking lot of money doesn’t it?”  I pause for affect.
“You can answer me now hotshot, but if the next words out of your mouth are not an apology AND a confession, I have NOTHING further to say to you and I will get security on the phone and let the police and FBI take things from here!”

HI everyone, I am Nikki, and it is great to meet you!  I am 27f and am NOT only looking for a roleplay partner for this particular story, but I am also looking for someone IRL that wants to play a little dom/sub game with me at the same time.  The game is this:  We will mirror the roleplay towards REAL LIFE, and you will follow rules, instructions, tasks, punishments, humiliations, pleasure, etc. the same way we write about in the roleplay. (as if I am controlling you from afar using pictures for proof and inspiration WITHOUT SHOWING EITHER OF OUR FACES).  This will be like a real-life video game of domination.  
I will be flexible as to who I feel is a fit for me here, but am generally looking for a partner who has thought about having an online Mistress, but either never got around to it, or hasn’t had luck finding the right person.  I would love to ideally find someone inexperienced in this realm if at all possible.  
I am VERY experienced, VERY creative, and VERY interested in finding my right submissive.  In this roleplay (written and IRL), I plan on delving into lots of different things, and want someone who is open to at least exploring most/all aspects of humiliation, femdom, chastity, cuckold, strap on training, cum eating, punishment, body worship, and anything else I can think of.  
I can work within hard limits AND real life schedules, spouses, relationships, etc, but the person I will ultimately match up with best will have few limits, some restrictions that we will HAVE to work around through deception of your partner and sneaking around your workplace, and a hunger for trying new things in a creative way.
Since there will also be a huge component of writing involved, I am looking for someone who is well versed with the English language, and is also creatively talented with their writing style.  I love to throw curve balls at my sub, and would hope to have some thrown back at me once in a while.
I just came off this idea with someone else who absolutely LOVED every minute of the roleplay and IRL game, but had to leave the site for unrelated reasons.  I am ONLY going to work with ONE person at a time on this, so if you are interested at all, don’t hesitate to send me a message QUICKLY, and I will get back to you with any questions.
In your message to me, you will call me Miss.  That is ALL you will ever call me unless I tell you differently.  And I will call you “my pet”….or “anything else I want to call you.”  
I would like you to respectfully introduce yourself, tell me your experience level with this kind of play, your hard limits, your living situation, your work situation, etc. so that I know how much free time you have on your hands IRL  ( I don’t want someone available 24 hours per day…it kills the realism aspect.)  I would also ask that you write at least a few paragraphs of verbiage expressing your “inner thoughts” of the situation you are now in.  This will give me an idea as to how you think, and also your style of writing.
Please be aware that there is no “Findom” in this roleplay (I hate that word), so you don’t have to worry about anything financial IRL.  Believe me…I don’t need your money….I am just a bored Dom housewife, and this is my excitement, lol.
Let’s see that Inbox light up with messages, boys.  I only have one open spot, and as long as this posting is up, I haven’t found the perfect person yet. "

Would you?",haemo_goblin,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/8u52zy/i_have_a_unique_opportunity_to_leave_medicine_no/,"Hi all!  As my title suggests, I'm facing a relatively unique crossroads where I have an opportunity to completely walk away from medicine.  The problem is, I'm just not sure if  I should.

For background, I was a 4\-year Air Force HPSP student now nearing the end of my service committment.  I went to school at one of the more expensive allopathic schools on the East coast, I have a 1\-year IM internship under my belt, and in 1 year I'll be a civilian with zero debt and about $150,000 in the bank from money I've saved up while on deployments and such.  

I don't absolutely hate medicine, but I sure as hell don't love it as much as I was expecting I would.  The original plan was to apply to civilian residencies here in the next few months (both in the US and my native Canada), but just the thought of going back to ""school"" fills me with so much dread that I've started seriously considering other options.  I know I don't want to practice forever, and I really wouldn't have a whole lot of heartache about walking away from the time I've invested in this field if a better opportunity came up.  But I just don't really know what else is out there for non\-practicing MDs.  I know there are plenty of policy, consulting, or other non\-clinical gigs out there.  But the harsh reality is that, without a residency, as you guys know, an MD doesn't really carry that much weight.  

Anyone else out there faced similar crossroads in the past?  Heard of any other cool routes for MDs?  If you were in my shoes, what do you think you would do?  Not looking for anyone to solve my problems on my behalf, but always nice to hear different perspectives!"

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.


---


The story below is just a sample. I am very open to any prompt you would like to throw out there as long as there is an erotic element that is sensual first sexual second. 

For example: 

My name is Chase and I live with my mom in a small apartment in the north end of town. Our apartment is not very big it has a kitchen area a bathroom one bedroom and a living space. My bed is a pull out couch in the living space and my mothers bed is in the bedroom. I have some semblance of privacy at times but mostly my life is an open book to her. She knows everything about me. I wouldn't say we have a weird relationship but it is awfully close. She had me when she was 16 and ever since I turned 13 she always wants to talk to me as if we are best friends. Which is why she is desperate to see me succeed in life.

She wants to see her bff be successful and happy. Which is a nice sentiment but I have very little interest in being a typical guy. I don't want a girlfriend because it seems like to much effort to make sure I am as presentable as possible at all times. I am a more go with the flow type person. I am not the type of person to decide on my life decisions by myself I like being told what my choice is. I feel that it takes away any bad repercussions that could happen. I like being able to blame the decision maker and not myself. Which is why my mom is struggling to motivate me.

She has tried to ask me what I want to do with my life and I just shrug her off. I think it is getting to her because every morning she comes out of her bedroom with a large sigh seeing me on my pullout bed still sleeping. I think she sees me as being lazy but like I said I am just anxious of making the wrong decision. 

So she found a job beta testing games for VR. However something changed once I got a new game called ‘The Academy' she hasn't a clue what the game is about, but she heard it was an X-rated game, so I was trying to keep it hush, hush from her, for I know she doesn't appreciate filth like this in her home. She saw me playing it and wanted to say something, but realizing I was twenty-three and an adult, maybe in age, but not mentally, she feels I have a right to do what I want. Well she was pleasantly surprised to hear nice music coming from the game, almost classical music, easy to listen to. The graphics were truly spectacular, it almost looked like I was watching a daytime soap opera, the characters looked that real. She noticed there was a white noise being generated in the background. She guessed it was a meadow scene and it was supposed to be the wind or something. The dialog was interesting too. First it sounded like real people talking, not a computer-generated voice at all. It looked like this was an adventure game, where the person was given puzzles to solve, to find clues or hidden things, which help solve the game. Kind of like the Telltale Games.
 
She noticed that my character was a female, a very [sexy cougar](http://i.imgur.com/CfrGtii.jpg) in fact. She found this interesting that I would choose such a character I am not your typical guy but she figured I would choose a male character to live out the fantasies. It was almost embarrassing how beautiful she was too. She was almost jealous she didn't look like her.
 
I heard the beautiful, skimpily dressed girl, my character was standing next too, saying, ""My, my. You need to date  him to get that information that you seek girl. You look like such a tomboy. You need to make yourself look sexy and appealing, for him otherwise he will have no interest in you. Let me get you ready so you will know how to dress properly in the future. I'm sure you can get an outfit that will make his eyeballs pop out of his sockets when he sees you. Come with me dear.""
 
The character that was helping stated, ""Oh Cedric , but I'll let you find out what those things are from him. Come let us take a bath and remove all of your body hair, so you are silky smooth. Then I'll wash your lovely hair and put it up in the most beautiful of locks, that any girl would be jealous of."" With this the other girl took off all her clothes and the both of them went into the hot spring to wash.
 
She noticed I was was getting sexually excited, judging by the bulge she saw in my pants. 

So I am finding this interesting and sexually stimulating huh? She was beginning to wonder why her son would even consider playing this game? This is too weird. It's so girly, why would a boi possibly play this character in the game? She thought she better have a talk with me about this.

A bit about me, I am [Mysti](https://i.imgur.com/PzHlNpE.jpg) .

8u6yp1,1,2018-06-27,[Futa4f/m] Celebrities with something extra,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8u6yp1/futa4fm_celebrities_with_something_extra/,"**I'm an adult looking for another adult for a complete fantasy rp**

'ello there!

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this little post of mine, I hope that you'll find something that interests you in it!

First time writing a post here on reddit so might not be the best! You have been warned.

**One liners will be ignored. Put some effort into it like I did with this post.**

Quick Edit: I'd also be very open to playing rule34 styled things as well. Like Arya stark or Daenarys Targarean in the GoT universe and such!

So, I'll fully admit that I'm a very big fan of celebrities and the status that they hold in the eyes of many 'normal' people. I'm also a big fan of futanari/shemales who's packing big piece of swinging meat between their legs. So I thought, why not pair those two things together and made a RP post about it?

Needless to say, I'm looking to play some very well endowed celebrities (internet celebs included, like youtubers!) who gets into all kinds of lewd and naughty fun with people that they meet and work with. While I am primarily looking for female partners, I am very much open to partners who plays feminine boys as well.

Please be literate, detailed and be able to write decent amounts of text. I'm a multi-paragraph rper myself.

Some ideas to get the thoughts rolling, but keep in mind I'd be more than happy to hear any other ideas as well.

Personal Assistant: You're a personal assistant to the stars, you get to meet all the most famous and hot actresses and singers. All from the women from the all too popular Game of Thrones series to singers like Rihanna and Taylor swift. You get to follow them to the nicest locations, to the best resorts, to their own getaways and houses scattered across the world. Of course your job is to keep them happy, to get them the food they want, the entertainment they want, the clothes they want, the alcohol the they and so on. But since you're in such a high paying job and getting very nice bonuses because of it.. Well.. You have to take care of their other needs, any time, any where.

Comic Con meet up (works with any Con really): A con is always a good place to get the chance to meet some celebs, maybe they're doing a meet and greet, maybe they're doing a bit of autograph signing, maybe they're just nerds that wants to enjoy it like a normal person? Whatever the reason, you get to meet the celeb(s) of your dream! Maybe you met them after a Q&amp;A where they thought you were cute when you fumbled with your question, maybe you met them back at the hotel. You couldn't quite remember, but here you are regardless.. What luck, eh?

Co-worker: Being an up and coming young individual in the industry can be daunting to say the least. There's always someone that's more important than you, always someone who knows more than you, always someone that can get you fired with one phone call just around the corner when you're running with that hot coffee in your hand. Needless to say, you have to be careful. But at the same time it's a fantastic opportunity! Maybe you get to know your more famous co-star privately? Maybe you want to make that sex scene just look that more real? Maybe you actually did make some enemies and are trying to make up for it?

Intern: Let's face it, being an intern sucks. You always have to go get food and coffee for stuck up producers and even just to the people one step higher than you on the company ladder. But it's not all bad. You still get to meet plenty of beautiful famous people. Perhaps you see this as an opportunity to get close to them? Befriend them? Use them to maybe make your life a bit easier?.. Or maybe you simply end up as their toy when they find out you're really underage?

While I hate to do this, please write Big Dick Celeb in the title of your message to let me know you've read this far. Silly I know but best I could come up with!

So there's 4 quick little prompts, nothing fancy but it's better than nothing. Like I said, I'd be more than happy to hear out any other ideas as well, so don't be shy! I'm down for pretty much everything, from them being complete strangers to friends to family members to being married!

Here's a list over celebrities that I enjoy playing: Emilia Clarke, Ronda Rousey, Daisy Ridley, Dodger/presshearttocontinue, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Emma Watson, Pokimane, Avril Lavigne, Shakira, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Emma stone, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Amy Adams, Alexa Bliss, AJ Lee, Paige, Sasha Banks, Becky Lynch, Eva Marie, Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman, Ariel Winter, Gal Gadot, Christina Hendricks, Sarah Hyland, Alyson Hannigan, Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Zooey Deschanel.

8u754m,2,2018-06-27,Career Advice Help!: Unique Situation between Public Practice vs. Government,Major_Foodie,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8u754m/career_advice_help_unique_situation_between/,"So I need some career advice. I'm from Canada and just graduated from a university with an Accounting degree. Back in Fall 2017, I accepted a job offer with a local public firm that employs around 50 people. They are like a typical firm that will pay for my CPA, provide me experience in audit &amp; tax and pays around 45k salary. The benefits aren't that good either.  I honestly do not know how I got the job offer because I didn't feel like I fit their culture while attending their events and interviews.  It was my only offer back then so I decided to accept. Ever since then I attended one of their staff events and a Christmas party. I still feel like I don't fit in and I'm starting to dread working here. This job starts in Fall 2018. 

Fast forward to this summer now. I saw a posting for a government position at my old internship place from two years ago. It's for a Financial Analyst position that will pay a range between 54k-76k and will pay for CPA as well. It also includes better benefits ( pension, vacation, health etc. ) of a government employee.  I haven't applied to any other jobs since accepting the local firm's offer because I wanted to keep my promise and I would feel guilty. However I applied for the government job because it seemed too good to pass up and I will most likely get the job because I've worked there before. I'm now passed the first two rounds of the application and just received an invite for the third round for an in person interview. They are requesting references this time. Up until now, I haven't contacted anyone from my old government internship so they don't know I have applied. If I do ask them for a reference, I know I am now obligated to accept the government job offer if I do get it. 

 The local public firm will provide me with accounting experience with different industries. My job with them will start in a few months and it's going to look bad if I go back from my offer now. I don't even know if I am allowed to do this in the accounting world?! The government position will pay better, have better benefits and I know I will enjoying working with the people more. My only problem is that working in the government right after graduation may close doors for me and my accounting career might become stagnant.

I am in quite a dilemma right now. Should I just suck it up and stay with local public firm or should I go forward with the government position?"

We met in September at school she's Swedish 25 and I am french 24.we started working together and then lovers. For 2 months it was incredible we were basically living at each other place, sex was great, rehearsing together, spending time together.

Then she had to go back to her country in January and situation started to deteriorate at the beginning i was not present enough and then I improved. She was really busy so everytime it was inconvenient for me to come according to her. But we still had the project to both work in the same city and live together. Then she had a very stressful internship and got a job. I am incredibly proud of her but it is in Stockholm.
I won't be able to find a job in Stockholm, i was rejected everywhere i applied.

And now we are on the verge of break-up:
We love each other but she doesn't want to invest in a relationship with someone she doesn't live with day to day. So she wants us to just be friends until we can be in the same city and if at this point we are both single we can start over.

I offered to do all the travelling coming to see her regularly, sending messages and stuff and she just refuses. As long as it is a long distance relationship she doesn't want it for her it's not a true relationship.

But i know myself i know i will be unable to not wait thise two years with hope, i won't be capable to see her with an other man i won't be able to date other girls she's the one i want.

But for her I am the one going to the disaster and willing to break up because her solution is fine.

How can i convince her to let me try a LDR or what should i do?


**TL;DR: our relation is crumbling how to save it or convince her to even try a LDR**"

I'm applying for the [Health Educator in Secondary and Vocational Schools position in Mongolia] (https://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/volunteer-openings/health-educator-in-secondary-and-vocational-schools-5374br/)

Any and all feedback is welcome! Some of my current concerns:

- Have I properly addressed and spent enough of my essay on overcoming challenges?
- I'm of Chinese descent, but I took it out of this version of the statement since it felt too disjointed. Do they care more about personal or professional challenges? I also recently hurt my foot in Indonesia requiring two visits to the emergency room and crutches. Is that stronger than what I have in there now about overcoming communities resistant to change?
- Does the flow make sense or do I need to move up my Mongolia visit so that my health and nutrition experiences are together?
- My current job as a systems implementation technology consultant requires spending a lot of time facilitating needs assessment and training workshops, but that's not currently reflected in my motivational statement. Should some of that experience replace what's in my current statement iteration or is there already too many ""experiences"" in the statement?
- Is worth noting that I met up with a Mongolia RPCV while I was in Mongolia? Just had dinner with him and talked about his experiences and challenges. 

Thanks!

**EDIT 1**

&gt;My journey to apply for Peace Corps has not always been straightforward. I can’t remember the first time I heard about Peace Corps; however, I know I was intimidated by the idea of leaving behind my friends and family, of living in an environment below my current standard of living, of living in a culture and language that I did not understand. In the years since, I attended an out-of-state University and spent time traveling the world experiencing new cultures and communicating through hand signals. I recently began researching Peace Corps and realized I no longer fear the unknown and of being alone in a foreign country. I am ready to go back to my health education roots and help carry out Peace Corps’ three goals in Mongolia.

&gt;My journey starts in high school and college volunteering for the Asian Liver Center (ALC). We worked with local communities to translate education materials and medical forms for Chinese clients during our screening and vaccination program. It was my first exposure into health education and outreach and I was hooked! It is incredibly moving to go into the local community and see how small amounts of education can ensure that they are protected for life from a disease that is preventable, but is initially a taboo.

&gt;I had an amazing opportunity to visit Mongolia and spending a week living with various nomadic families, experiencing their warmth and hospitality toward me, a stranger. It was also during these many shared meals that I experienced the Mongolian diet of meat and dairy. Prior to my trip, I anticipated applying for the education sector, but this trip made me realize how much the community could benefit from a healthier diet and lifestyle. I also thought about how my past health education and outreach experiences can be applied to Mongolia. During prior research, what continues to draw me to Peace Corps over other teaching programs, such as EPIK (Korea) is Goal One’s emphasis on creating a lasting impact on the community by enabling them to be self sustainable after we leave. I wanted the immersion experience and know that even if I have a small impact, it is a lifelong impact.

&gt;A week in Mongolian gers pales in comparison to challenges I will face during service in Peace Corps. Communities are hard to work with and not always receptive to change. It’s something I deal with as a food bank health ambassador. We promote healthier diets instead of only making sure clients are fed, but one of the challenges is convincing our clients to choose the healthier foods even if they are foreign or have a perception of not tasting good. Relating and developing relationships with them goes a long way in making them feel more at ease and open to new foods and recipes.

&gt;I’m excited to merge my passion for health education with my international experiences and bring those skills to the people of Mongolia as I continue my journey with Peace Corps.

I can’t remember the first time I heard about Peace Corps; however, I know I was intimidated by the idea of leaving behind my friends and family, of living in an environment below my current standard of living, of living in a culture and language that I did not understand. In the years since, I went to an out-of-state University and I’ve spent quite a bit of time traveling the world and experiencing new cultures where, sometimes, I could only communicate through hand signals. I recently heard Peace Corps casually mentioned, and it prompted me to once again research Peace Corps. What I’ve come to realize is that I no longer feared the unknown and of being alone in a foreign country. I finally feel ready to go back to my health education roots and help carry out Peace Corps’ goals with emotional and intellectual maturity.

&gt; My journey starts in high school when I first volunteered for the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University (ALC). We worked with local communities to translate education material and medical forms for Chinese clients during a multi-year screening and vaccination program. It was my first exposure into health education and outreach and I was hooked! I eventually increased the scope of my role within the ALC to an outreach and design intern. There’s something very moving about going into the local community and seeing how even a small amount of education can transform the community and ensure that they are protected for life from a disease that is completely preventable, but was initially a taboo subject.

&gt; I had the opportunity to visit Mongolia in April. It was an incredible experience; not just because the landscape is every bit as majestic as I’ve always heard it is, but also because of the Mongolian people and culture that I fell in love with. I spent a week living with various nomadic families experiencing their warmth and hospitality toward a stranger. It was also during this time that shared many meals and I experienced the Mongolian diet of meat and dairy. Prior to my Mongolian trip, I anticipated applying for the education sector, but this trip made me realize how much the community could benefit from a healthier diet and lifestyle. It got me thinking about my own past health education and outreach experience and I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied with teaching English. In the past, I had looked into programs such as EPIK (Korea), but what draws me to Peace Corps is Goal One of emphasis on creating a lasting impact on the community by enabling locals to be self sustainable long after we leave. I didn’t want to go in, teach English for a couple years, travel Asia, and then just leave. I wanted the immersion experience and feel that even if my impact is a small one on the community, it would be a lifelong impact.

&gt; Living a week in Mongolian gers pales in comparison to the challenges I will face during a full term of service with Peace Corps. Communities can be hard to work with and are not always be receptive to change. It’s something that I constantly deal with while volunteering as a health ambassador at the food bank. We’ve recently changed to promoting a healthier diet instead of just making sure that our clients are fed. One of the biggest challenges has been to convince our clients to choose the healthier food staples even if they are foreign to them or have a perception of not tasting good. Finding ways to relate and develop relationships with them goes a long way to making them feel more at ease and open to new foods and processes.

&gt; I’m excited to merge my passion for health education with my international experiences as I continue my journey with Peace Corps. I’m most enthusiastic about being able to bring my skills to the people of Mongolia to help bridge that information gap that currently within their healthy eating and life skills education initiatives."

At first it was fun, of course it would be, but now they are getting a little too involved. Too much meddling and next thing she knew she was basically the royal witch. And now with so many jobs being sent by those two they fear that their witch may not have the best education possible in her own art. 


They sent out requests for anyone who could teach their witch, despite her clear protests against this idea, and that evil bitch replied. Genuinely the epitome of what an evil queen of an empire could look like was to be her mentor. She used her cruel evil magic to take over city after city after city and now Kinzie was an intern for this bitch. This was the kind of woman that the king and queen would send their champion on a quest to kill, but now Kinzie was working for free under her. 


She spent days upon days sorting old dusty spell tones, drawing runes so that that bitch didn't have to, every boring part of sorcery. But one day something changed. Turns out this evil queen had scrying charms on all of her dark knights, which meant that time when Kinzie fucked that big hung futa knight... She was watching. Not only was this severely embarrassing, now she knew about Kinzie's depraved and sadistic ass. But when Kinzie thought she was going to be mocked, humiliated, or something to that effect but no. She was taken to a door and stopped outside.

Well, it looked like kinzie had her work cut out for her


Thanks for reading this far! I have left whatever is on the other side of that door ambiguous so you can decide exactly what kind of character you want to play. You could play one adventurer tasked with bringing down the evil queen, now meeting a bad ending at the hands of Kinzie, or a whole party of adventurers. You could be anyone from a toned orc barbarian to a thick milf cleric of the church. I love a big huge cock and am a major size queen but I am willing to play with regular women too. As well as that Kinzie could definitley cast a little incantation to give one of those adventurers a cock. I am open to plenty ideas including characters and how the scenario will play out. I am both interested in short and long term roleplays and could do Either with ease. Understand coming into this however, that despite Kinzie's size, she is a dominant girl at heart. She is super kinky and a pretty on the sadistic side when it came down to it.

Kinzie, my character, Is something of a recluse. With long black hair and green eyes under forrest green robes, the girl was very petite. Her chest was flat, her build was small, but at least she had a cute butt, it was just about her best asset. Tight, perky, and round, it brought her a little bit of joy any time she saw people looking on.

b. verstrekking van gegevens van algemene, feitelijke aard omtrent de  
samenstelling van ondernemingen en rechtspersonen ter bevordering van de  
economische belangen van handel, industrie, ambacht en dienstverlening; en  
voor  
c. het registreren van alle ondernemingen en rechtspersonen als onderdeel  
van de gegevenshuishouding die bijdraagt aan het efficiënt functioneren van  
de overheid.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De verplichte inschrijving in het handelsregister heeft tot doel  
inzichtelijk te maken welke onderneming, onder welke naam, waar is  
gevestigd, wie mag tekenen, wie aansprakelijk is, hoe de onderneming is te  
bereiken en welke activiteiten de onderneming heeft. Dit is in  
overeenstemming met genoemde drie functies van het handelsregister.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is niet zozeer het feit dat de KvK een tarief in rekening brengt bij de  
verstrekking van handelsregisterinformatie, het is de openbaarheid van het  
register die meebrengt dat de KvK de handelsregistergegevens moet  
verstrekken in het kader van haar wettelijke taak. Dit heeft tot gevolg dat  
derden over de handelsregistergegevens kunnen beschikken, waarbij de kans  
bestaat dat ze zich niet altijd aan de privacywetgeving houden; dit terwijl  
ook afnemers c.q. gebruikers van persoonsgegevens uit het handelsregister  
natuurlijk verplicht zijn om aan de vereisten van de privacywetgeving te  
voldoen. Elke gebruiker moet bijvoorbeeld een geldige grondslag hebben voor  
de verdere verwerking van persoonsgegevens uit het handelsregister, zoals  
een gerechtvaardigd belang dat zwaarder weegt dan het privacybelang van de  
betreffende ondernemer of de geldige toestemming.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij zzp’ers &amp;#40;eenmanszaken of persoonlijke vennootschappen&amp;#41; is de  
verwevenheid tussen de onderneming en de persoonlijke levenssfeer vaak  
groot. Wanneer men daarbij de eigen naam opneemt in de bedrijfsnaam, is  
gevestigd op het woonadres, geen postbus opgeeft als correspondentieadres,  
en hetzelfde telefoonnummer gebruikt voor zowel zakelijk verkeer als voor  
privé, dan zijn gegevens voor databedrijven eenvoudig te achterhalen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Deelt u de mening dat de wettelijke plicht om zich in te schrijven in het  
handelsregister er niet toe zou mogen leiden dat bedrijven via informatie  
die KvK aan anderen verkoopt met reclame benaderd worden? Zo ja, wat gaat u  
doen om dit te voorkomen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
De KvK verstrekt de handelsregistergegevens ter uitvoering van de artikelen  
21 en 22 van de Handelsregisterwet 2007, waarin staat dat de in de  
artikelen 9 tot en met 17 genoemde gegevens, met uitzondering van de in  
artikel 21 bedoelde gegevens, door een ieder kunnen worden ingezien en dat  
de KvK deze op basis van een verzoek verstrekt. Er is contact met de  
Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens over hoe deze verplichting tot levering van  
gegevens zich verhoudt tot de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming  
&amp;#40;AVG&amp;#41;. Momenteel is er geen wettelijke verplichting voor de KvK op basis  
waarvan zij dient te registreren dan wel toe te zien, voor welke doeleinden  
de verstrekte gegevens door afnemers worden gebruikt. Afnemers hebben hier  
een eigen verantwoordelijkheid om te handelen in overeenstemming met de  
privacy-wetgeving.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij de invoering van de Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens in 2000, in het  
bijzonder met het oog op artikel 41 van die wet &amp;#40;recht van verzet&amp;#41;, heeft  
de KvK de zogenoemde Non Mailing Indicator &amp;#40;NMI&amp;#41; geïntroduceerd. Een door  
de onderneming geactiveerde NMI houdt in dat de ondernemer niet wil dat het  
post- en bezoekadres worden gebruikt voor commerciële mailingen per fysieke  
post of via de huis-aan-huis verkoop. De NMI ziet enkel toe op deze  
kanalen. De KvK onderzoekt momenteel de mogelijkheden om de NMI uit te  
breiden naar e-mail en telefoon.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Een onderneming of een rechtspersoon kan op ieder gewenst moment &amp;#40;bij of na  
de inschrijving&amp;#41; de NMI activeren of deactiveren &amp;#40;zie ook www.kvk.nl/nmi&amp;#41;.  
Bij inschrijving wordt de NMI actief uitgevraagd bij de onderneming als  
onderdeel van het inschrijfproces. Veel ondernemingen maken gebruik van  
deze indicator &amp;#40;zo’n 80% van alle nieuwe inschrijvingen per jaar&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De KvK stelt deze NMI ter beschikking aan afnemers die openbare gegevens  
bij haar opvragen. De afnemer is verplicht om de keuze die een ondernemer  
via de NMI kenbaar maakt te respecteren. Doet de afnemer dit niet, dan kan  
dit worden beschouwd als een schending van het recht op bezwaar van de  
ondernemer.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De overige beschermingsmogelijkheden die zzp’ers hebben tegen bijvoorbeeld  
benadering per telefoon of e-mail, zijn verankerd in de Telecommunicatiewet  
&amp;#40;bijv. het bel-me-niet-register&amp;#41;. Wanneer ondernemers eerder klant bij een  
bedrijf zijn &amp;#40;geweest&amp;#41;, dan is benadering onder de huidige  
Telecommunicatiewet toegestaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Wordt er informatie uit andere basisregistraties dan het handelsregister,  
bijvoorbeeld de Basisregistratie Personen, aan derden voor commerciële  
doeleinden verkocht? Zo ja, uit welke basisregistraties? Zo nee, waarom  
niet en waarom wel uit het handelsregister?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
De Basisregistratie Personen is bedoeld voor intern gebruik binnen de  
overheid en heeft geen openbaar karakter. Het handelsregister en het  
Kadaster zijn vanwege hun wettelijke functies daarentegen wel openbare  
registers. De KvK is niet wettelijk verplicht om vooraf aan de afnemer van  
handelsregistergegevens te vragen voor welk doel deze gegevens gebruikt  
zullen worden. De basis voor de verstrekking ligt reeds in de  
Handelsregisterwet 2007.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Deelt u de mening dat bedrijven zich zouden moeten kunnen beschermen tegen  
het ongevraagd benaderd worden op basis van data die afkomstig is van de  
KvK? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
Ik ben van mening dat natuurlijke personen zich zouden moeten kunnen  
beschermen tegen het ongevraagd benaderd worden. Ik ga in mijn antwoord op  
vraag 6 in op de methoden die daarvoor voorhanden zijn.  
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
Hoe kunnen bedrijven zich tegen ongevraagde en gerichte reclame-uitingen  
wapenen? Acht u deze mogelijkheden afdoende? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, wat  
gaat u doen om bedrijven hiertegen te beschermen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord  
Vanwege de functies van het handelsregister is het belangrijk dat een  
onderneming fysiek bereikbaar is voor derden. Wanneer de ondernemer  
behoefte heeft aan meer privacy, wordt door de KvK geadviseerd een ander  
bezoekadres in te schrijven dan het woonadres. Behalve waar de  
bedrijfsactiviteit dit niet toelaat, denk aan een winkel of een fabriek,  
kan de ondernemer zelf kiezen wat &amp;#40;het bezoekadres van&amp;#41; de vestiging is.  
Voorwaarde is wel dat de onderneming er ook echt is gevestigd, hetgeen bij  
inschrijving moet worden aangetoond met een huurcontract of ander  
bewijsdocument.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bedrijven kunnen op verschillende manieren aangeven dat ze ongevraagde en  
gerichte reclame-uitingen niet wenselijk vinden. Zo heeft de KvK eerder  
genoemde NMI ontwikkeld. Elke ondernemer wordt door de KvK in de  
gelegenheid gesteld om verzet aan te tekenen &amp;#40;bezwaar te maken&amp;#41; tegen het  
gebruik van zijn post- en bezoekadres voor direct marketing per post en aan  
de deur door de NMI te activeren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast kunnen eenmanszaken en persoonlijke vennootschappen gebruik maken  
van het Bel-me-niet register dat een wettelijke basis in de  
Telecommunicatiewet kent. Telefoonnummers die in dit register zijn  
opgenomen, mogen niet worden gebruikt voor ongevraagde direct marketing  
&amp;#40;mits er nog geen klantrelatie is&amp;#41;. Zonder toestemming van consumenten en  
&amp;#40;alle&amp;#41; ondernemers is op grond van de Telecommunicatiewet ongevraagde  
direct marketing via digitale kanalen als mail, sms etc. in beginsel niet  
toegestaan. Het toezicht en de handhaving zijn belegd bij de Autoriteit  
Consument en Markt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
De KvK beziet welke mogelijkheden er zijn om ondernemers meer te  
faciliteren bij hun aanspraak op hun recht van bezwaar, o.a. door  
uitbreiding van de NMI naar telefoon en e-mail.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Naast de Handelsregisterwet 2007 verplicht ook andere &amp;#40;Europese&amp;#41;  
regelgeving ondernemers om hun bezoekadres op bijvoorbeeld hun website  
melden. Zo verplichten de artikelen 15d van Boek 3 en 230b van Boek 6 van  
het Burgerlijk Wetboek ondernemers om onder andere hun bezoekadres te  
vermelden op een website  die ze gebruiken voor het aanbieden van producten  
en diensten. Artikel 15d van Boek 3 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek betreft  
implementatie van EU-richtlijn nr. 2000/31 over elektronische handel en  
heeft als doel bevordering van transparantie in het handelsverkeer. Artikel  
230b van Boek 6 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek betreft implementatie van EU-  
richtlijn nr. 2006/123 betreffende diensten op de interne markt.

By David Walsh
27 June 2018

On June 24, the New York Times ran a lengthy (3,200-word) article, “How an Affair Between a Reporter and a Security Aide Has Rattled Washington Media,” by Michael M. Grynbaum, Scott Shane and Emily Flitter.

The somewhat peculiar piece recounts the details of a three-year relationship between journalist Ali Watkins, 26, who now writes for the Times, and James Wolfe, 57, senior aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Wolfe was arrested June 7 on charges of lying to investigators about his contacts with Watkins and three other reporters. Watkins has had her e-mail and phone records seized by federal prosecutors.

The case raises a number of issues. As the June 24 article notes, the “seizure of Ms. Watkins’s records was alarming to First Amendment advocates. With no allegation that classified information was disclosed, they said such a rare and aggressive tactic was unjustified and could undermine journalists’ ability to report on government misconduct.” The actions taken against Wolfe and Watkins form part of the Trump administration’s reactionary campaign against “leakers,” aimed at suppressing the exposure of US government criminality.

However, we are principally concerned here with another aspect of the Times’ coverage, which demonstrates the thoroughly two-faced and deceitful character of its editors’ prosecution of the ongoing #MeToo sexual harassment campaign.

Since October 2017, the New York Times and significant sections of the American media generally, along with leading Democratic Party politicians, have been attempting to convince the public that a wide variety of sexual activity in the entertainment industry in particular should be defined as harassment, abuse and rape. This has been a critical feature of a large-scale effort to mobilize and expand the Democratic Party’s constituency within the most affluent sections of the middle class, who consider issues of gender, sexual and racial identity to be closely related to their personal efforts at career advancement.

One of the fouler aspects of the sexual harassment campaign, which has run roughshod over democratic rights, has been the attempt, with far-reaching consequences, to stigmatize every sort of sexual stepping out of line or unorthodoxy as heinous and essentially illegal. There are many forms of sexual harassment, which extend from the annoying to the legally actionable to the outright criminal. But a vast range of activities, including many that reflect the ambiguities and complexities of human interactions, is being described as malevolent and even criminal.

This is not accidental. The distinctions between violent physical assault, “unwanted advances” and, one might add, engaging in sexual relations to advance one’s career have been deliberately and willfully glossed over for political and ideological reasons. When actor Matt Damon mildly pointed out that “There’s a difference between…patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,” he was ferociously attacked and told to shut up. It was vital for those leading the #MeToo witch-hunt to present an overheated picture of an epidemic of undifferentiated sexual abuse.

However, the Times has now undercut its own wretched, willfully ham-fisted approach to sexual harassment in its analysis of the Watkins-Wolfe relationship and, more generally, relationships between journalists and officials in Washington.

Without overly burdening the reader, who can turn to the Times article on his or her own, these are some of the relevant portions.

The three authors note that the Watkins-Wolfe relationship “played out in the insular world of Washington, where young, ambitious journalists compete for scoops while navigating relationships with powerful, often older, sources.” And: “The relationship has prompted concern in many newsrooms that Ms. Watkins’s conduct has made journalists, and particularly women, vulnerable to unfounded accusations of exchanging sex for information.”

The Times piece explains how Watkins, as an intern for McClatchy Newspapers, began “staking out” Senate Intelligence Committee’s meetings, which led to a series of articles on the CIA’s spying on the committee and earned her a full-time job with McClatchy. “It also brought her closer to Mr. Wolfe, who would later text her saying how ‘proud’ he was of her work on the series. In October 2014, after Ms. Watkins had jumped from McClatchy to the Huffington Post, Mr. Wolfe took her to a rooftop bar to celebrate her 23rd birthday; before the night was over, they kissed.”

In a key passage, the Times piece observes: “Relationships between reporters and sources are an art, not a science: In Washington, meals and late nights out with sources are part of a journalist’s job description. But becoming romantically involved is widely viewed as a conflict, opening a journalist to accusations of bias.”

Frankly, neither art nor science is involved here. This was at least in part crude career advancement, however Watkins may have justified it. One thinks of the ruthless, ambitious reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) in the television series House of Cards, who initiates a mutually advantageous business and sexual relationship with politician Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), which proves to have dire long-term costs.

This is not conduct to be commended, no matter how the Times tries to pretty it up.

But, in any event, what’s striking is that James Bennet and the Times editors have suddenly discovered nuance and intricacy in the “navigation” of intertwined professional and sexual relationships. Out of the blue, we learn that some young women may have motives for associating with “powerful, older men,” that a certain number may engage in conduct both consensual and not especially admirable. Moreover, the Times manages to treat both parties in an essentially sympathetic light.

To put it rather bluntly, the Times appears concerned, now that one of its own, as it were, has been caught out (a) not to alienate possible future sources of information and (b) not to undermine or rule out a useful tactic, the exchange of sex for information.

How delicately the newspaper here treats the complexity of relationships, especially when it might be the case the sexual relations involved are part of a quid pro quo that may lead to news scoops.

However, the Times’ treatment of the goings-on in Hollywood has been sharply different. It has never carried an article on the #MeToo allegations that read something like this:

“Relationships between aspiring actresses and producers are an art, not a science. In Hollywood, meals and late nights out with producers or directors are part of an actress’ path to parts and awards. Becoming romantically involved is widely viewed as a career move, opening an actress to accusations that she traded sex for a big role.”

Instead, for its own political purposes, the Times denounces everything and everyone in Hollywood as criminal this and criminal that, creates an unlikely set of wide-eyed innocents, on the one hand, and industry “monsters,” on the other. It ignores the unpleasant, murky social and psychological realities in the interests of whipping up the upper middle class identity politics crowd into a frenzy, with which effort the latter is only too eager and willing to go along.

The Watkins-Wolfe commentary further exposes the filthy hypocrisy and cynicism of the Times’ Bennet and his gang of sex scandal-mongers who pretend to be journalists."

Bear with me though, this will be a loooooong one, so props if you get to the end and serious props if you give any perspective on it!

# Background

* Been together for just over 2 and a half years.
* Met on Tinder, during her second year of University (her university wasn't far from me, so we had over a year of being a close distance relationship).
* Currently *kind of* a long distance relationship - She's in London and I'm not, the distance isn't exactly ""long"" (2 hours+ train travel), but it's enough that we only get to really see each other on weekends and around other commitments; meaning once every 2-3 weeks, sometimes every other week when lucky.
* For both of us we are our **second** relationships in life.
* For me I had a **3 and half year relationship** from the age 18 to 21 (I broke it off because we fell out of love, we were arguing because we weren't confronting our differences, and she had some insecurities that she'd take out on me; could get quite spiteful).
* For her she had an around **one year relationship** (I think, she hasn't spoken about the length in detail) before University.

# Us

* Her - 23 (soon 24) Law graduate, 6 months into her first job as a Paralegal at a major law firm in London. Very intelligent, hard worker, highest performing in her university year, destined for success (and considering it's law, probably a very high power and high pressure career).
* Me - 27 (turned recently) Designer, 5 years into career, doing well (but recently moved into a new, more specialist, role which I really consider to be essentially the beginning of my career in this field).

# Is There Love?

* **Hella**
* She's one of the loveliest people I've ever met, almost too nice (compared to my cynical ass).
* Honestly we **don't have much in common**; we have very different outlooks on life, very different approaches, very different opinions, literally no hobbies or interests in common whatsoever. It's kind of amazing this relationship has worked so well... and it has worked well; we've had 2 and a half years of incredible times and experiences.
* Ultimately I guess **love isn't the issue here** we both know we love each other, we both know that whatever happens we'll always love what we've had together. This leads me onto...

# The problem(s)

* **Marriage &amp; Kids**
   * About a year and a half ago were having a few drinks and the conversation about marriage and kids popped up. **I'm honestly not sure I even believe in marriage, and there's no part of me yet that is enthusiastic about kids.** Now, I did say that it's silly to say ""never"", and who knows how my thoughts and feelings might change later in my life, but right now, it's genuinely my intuitive gut feeling that I'm not interested in those two things (this is still the case).
   * This actually caused a tense conversation, because **she is pretty damn certain she wants those two things**.
   * The alcohol probably made the conversation less level-headed than it should have been, but my contention was that it was crazy for that subject to cause us any problems, considering that we'd only been together a year, and she hadn't even graduated yet!
   * I was a little taken aback that she was upset about that difference relatively early in the relationship, but ultimately we agreed **""this isn't a problem right now, won't be for a long time, so why let it affect us""**.
   * I did find out that this issue did cause her to have second thoughts at the time, because she **wants to be with the person she'll have kids with by 30** so she is of course on a **time limit** (being a bloke, I have the luxury of that not being as much of a concern).
   * Ultimately though we're both glad that we chose to ignore this difference (although to this day she doesn't like thinking about it), we're too young, too new to our lives and careers, and we've had amazing times because we've been together.
   * Some might say it's absolutely crazy that this hypothetical future problem could cause us issue now, and that has been my argument to her... but I think I'm realising that once you become aware that you have such a fundamental difference, it's always there looming in the background.
* **Moving in Together, Distance &amp; Independence**
   * Before she graduated she spent a few weeks living at my place (which I share with a friend) so she could more easily commute to an internship. It was enjoyable mostly! But it did prove that we weren't ready to live together long term (I later found out that she was a little disappointed, because she was hoping to **move in together after graduation.** I'm not supposed to know this, I only know that she was thinking like that at the time because my housemate told me she's said so. Again I was taken aback by her enthusiasm for these things at what I felt was an early and unrealistic stage for them).
   * I also **don't necessarily believe that cohabitation is essential for a loving relationship or that it should be an assumed next step of a relationship** (especially when it's the case that our relatively new careers keep us distant geographically, and we don't know where they may take us in the next few years).
   * She now lives in London with friends, we enjoy visiting each other when we can, but she has admitted that the distance and inability to see each other more often does bother her.
   * I've always been less bothered by this (not totally blasé about it though) because I am more independent and more okay with my own company (hobbies such musical instruments, reading, gym, design work, and socialising generally keep me busy and content when I'm on my own). **I will admit though that the distance is becoming more of a difficultly now, in the context of it being another thing as well as all these other concerns.**
   * She has stated that when she's done living with friends (could be a year, or two, or sooner!) she'd would expect to be moving in with a partner (which obviously means me right now). **A little voice in my soul screams ""noooooooo"" when I think about this.**
   * On a practical level - **I'm 6 months into a job that isn't in London, commuting from London would be hell for me, and I don't know if I could work remotely.**
   * If I moved to London to be with her **I** **wouldn't know anyone else in London and would be reliant on her for social interaction.**
   * Another thing we can both admit is that we have both sometimes felt like we're just ""going through the motions"", we still enjoy seeing each other, but perhaps some of the excitement has died, and the distance may be related to this.

But really the big one is this:

# I don't think I'm comfortable with the idea of moving in together (aside from the practical reasons as to why we can't any time soon) because I know that to her it represents a step on that ""fall in love &gt; move in together &gt; buy a place &gt; marriage &gt; kids"" timeline, which she wants to work towards by the age of 30. We're simply on different pages and on different timelines, and I know too little about myself and where I want to be to commit to that kind of a timeline. My worry is that any acquiescing to her timeline could be leading her on and could waste her time, while I work out who/what/where the hell I wanna be in life.

This worry is making me unhappy, and if I'm honest, it makes me hate myself, it makes me wonder why I can't just want what she wants, why I can't just be ""normal"", because I hate the idea that my uncertainties in myself could ever hold her back or cause her pain.We're currently trying a communication break (we've said a month but we'll see...)  to see if the space can help us think objectively about that's best for us, but I'm really struggling to get my head around all of this. Any perspective at all would be greatly appreciated! Questions I'm trying to work out:

* Is this because it's only my second relationship? I must admit I have had thoughts that we'd both be happier with people we have more in common with.
* Am I being an idiot? Should this impact us now?
* I'm not afraid of being single, I know that everyone recovers from breakups, but I'm afraid of throwing away something great because of hypothetical fears, even if they do seem fundamental.

**TL;DR 27M and 24M have fundamental differences in their future plans (marriage, kids, cohabitation) . This hasn't been a problem for 2 and a half years, now we're reaching a point where those differences are impacting the relationship. Currently on a break, we realise this could be the end, and could not. Are these worries rational?**"

In a key passage, the Times piece observes: “Relationships between reporters and sources are an art, not a science: In Washington, meals and late nights out with sources are part of a journalist’s job description. But becoming romantically involved is widely viewed as a conflict, opening a journalist to accusations of bias.”

Frankly, neither art nor science is involved here. This was at least in part crude career advancement, however Watkins may have justified it. One thinks of the ruthless, ambitious reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) in the television series House of Cards, who initiates a mutually advantageous business and sexual relationship with politician Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), which proves to have dire long-term costs.

This is not conduct to be commended, no matter how the Times tries to pretty it up.

But, in any event, what’s striking is that James Bennet and the Times editors have suddenly discovered nuance and intricacy in the “navigation” of intertwined professional and sexual relationships. Out of the blue, we learn that some young women may have motives for associating with “powerful, older men,” that a certain number may engage in conduct both consensual and not especially admirable. Moreover, the Times manages to treat both parties in an essentially sympathetic light.

To put it rather bluntly, the Times appears concerned, now that one of its own, as it were, has been caught out (a) not to alienate possible future sources of information and (b) not to undermine or rule out a useful tactic, the exchange of sex for information.

How delicately the newspaper here treats the complexity of relationships, especially when it might be the case the sexual relations involved are part of a quid pro quo that may lead to news scoops.

However, the Times’ treatment of the goings-on in Hollywood has been sharply different. It has never carried an article on the #MeToo allegations that read something like this:

“Relationships between aspiring actresses and producers are an art, not a science. In Hollywood, meals and late nights out with producers or directors are part of an actress’ path to parts and awards. Becoming romantically involved is widely viewed as a career move, opening an actress to accusations that she traded sex for a big role.”

Instead, for its own political purposes, the Times denounces everything and everyone in Hollywood as criminal this and criminal that, creates an unlikely set of wide-eyed innocents, on the one hand, and industry “monsters,” on the other. It ignores the unpleasant, murky social and psychological realities in the interests of whipping up the upper middle class identity politics crowd into a frenzy, with which effort the latter is only too eager and willing to go along.

The Watkins-Wolfe commentary further exposes the filthy hypocrisy and cynicism of the Times’ Bennet and his gang of sex scandal-mongers who pretend to be journalists.

8u9w7u,2,2018-06-27,Sex and the New York Times: When “Her Too” isn’t “Me Too” - By David Walsh - 27 June 2018 • r/WomenLiberation,FinnagainsAwake,LibertarianFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianFeminism/comments/8u9w7u/sex_and_the_new_york_times_when_her_too_isnt_me/,"Sex and the New York Times: When “Her Too” isn’t “Me Too” By David Walsh 27 June 2018

On June 24, the New York Times ran a lengthy (3,200-word) article, “How an Affair Between a Reporter and a Security Aide Has Rattled Washington Media,” by Michael M. Grynbaum, Scott Shane and Emily Flitter.

The somewhat peculiar piece recounts the details of a three-year relationship between journalist Ali Watkins, 26, who now writes for the Times, and James Wolfe, 57, senior aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Wolfe was arrested June 7 on charges of lying to investigators about his contacts with Watkins and three other reporters. Watkins has had her e-mail and phone records seized by federal prosecutors.

The case raises a number of issues. As the June 24 article notes, the “seizure of Ms. Watkins’s records was alarming to First Amendment advocates. With no allegation that classified information was disclosed, they said such a rare and aggressive tactic was unjustified and could undermine journalists’ ability to report on government misconduct.” The actions taken against Wolfe and Watkins form part of the Trump administration’s reactionary campaign against “leakers,” aimed at suppressing the exposure of US government criminality.

However, we are principally concerned here with another aspect of the Times’ coverage, which demonstrates the thoroughly two-faced and deceitful character of its editors’ prosecution of the ongoing #MeToo sexual harassment campaign.

Since October 2017, the New York Times and significant sections of the American media generally, along with leading Democratic Party politicians, have been attempting to convince the public that a wide variety of sexual activity in the entertainment industry in particular should be defined as harassment, abuse and rape. This has been a critical feature of a large-scale effort to mobilize and expand the Democratic Party’s constituency within the most affluent sections of the middle class, who consider issues of gender, sexual and racial identity to be closely related to their personal efforts at career advancement.

One of the fouler aspects of the sexual harassment campaign, which has run roughshod over democratic rights, has been the attempt, with far-reaching consequences, to stigmatize every sort of sexual stepping out of line or unorthodoxy as heinous and essentially illegal. There are many forms of sexual harassment, which extend from the annoying to the legally actionable to the outright criminal. But a vast range of activities, including many that reflect the ambiguities and complexities of human interactions, is being described as malevolent and even criminal.

This is not accidental. The distinctions between violent physical assault, “unwanted advances” and, one might add, engaging in sexual relations to advance one’s career have been deliberately and willfully glossed over for political and ideological reasons. When actor Matt Damon mildly pointed out that “There’s a difference between…patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,” he was ferociously attacked and told to shut up. It was vital for those leading the #MeToo witch-hunt to present an overheated picture of an epidemic of undifferentiated sexual abuse.

However, the Times has now undercut its own wretched, willfully ham-fisted approach to sexual harassment in its analysis of the Watkins-Wolfe relationship and, more generally, relationships between journalists and officials in Washington.

Without overly burdening the reader, who can turn to the Times article on his or her own, these are some of the relevant portions.

The three authors note that the Watkins-Wolfe relationship “played out in the insular world of Washington, where young, ambitious journalists compete for scoops while navigating relationships with powerful, often older, sources.” And: “The relationship has prompted concern in many newsrooms that Ms. Watkins’s conduct has made journalists, and particularly women, vulnerable to unfounded accusations of exchanging sex for information.”

The Times piece explains how Watkins, as an intern for McClatchy Newspapers, began “staking out” Senate Intelligence Committee’s meetings, which led to a series of articles on the CIA’s spying on the committee and earned her a full-time job with McClatchy. “It also brought her closer to Mr. Wolfe, who would later text her saying how ‘proud’ he was of her work on the series. In October 2014, after Ms. Watkins had jumped from McClatchy to the Huffington Post, Mr. Wolfe took her to a rooftop bar to celebrate her 23rd birthday; before the night was over, they kissed.”

8ua1wi,2,2018-06-27,Relationship anxiety,birdsofwar1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8ua1wi/relationship_anxiety/,"So...I had been dating someone for about 9/10 months, and I thought it was a great relationship. I was so happy, so in love, we were looking forward to a future together. Then, the real world hit him, and the idea of supporting himself and having to be an adult freaked him out because he wasn’t ready (25 and heavily supported by parents). Things started falling apart, and then I found out he cheated on me with an intern of his. The anxiety of us fighting, him cheating, was almost unbearable. 

I caught him, had proof. But he lied straight to my face. I believed him because, well, up until that point I had no reason not to. I trusted him with my life. He finally admitted to the cheating and we went on a break and decided to try and work on things and rebuild. I found out weeks later that for the entire time, almost a month, he had been lying through his teeth about almost everything. He was still pursuing this girl, I had even slept next to him in his bed while he was talking to and pursuing her. He kept me around as an option while he went after her. I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder. Throughout this entire process I could barely eat, sleep, get through work. I was having multiple panic attacks a day, and was throwing up multiple times a day and lost 10 pounds. He knew all of this, how much I was suffering. 

I have finally made solid progress in dealing with my anxiety and moving on. But, now my anxiety is roaring back because I’m getting messages from his friends about what happened. Apologies, they can’t believe it, they know the girl he cheated on me with and she’s apparently an unstable psycho. I’m finding out more and more about what happened, more dishonesty from him, more lies. Seems like everyone else got the truth but me. On top of that, I met someone great. He makes me happy and I like him, but the anxiety of being in a vulnerable place and getting hurt again is definitely there. I don’t want to push him away. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Where the anxiety from cheating has been a nightmare and/or are having anxiety going into a new relationship? I’ll take any advice at this point. 

I want to move on, I’m so ready. It’s just terrifying "
8ua9v4,20,2018-06-27,Should I learn ASP.NET before I learn ASP.NET Core? Or Neither?,maholeycow,csharp,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/8ua9v4/should_i_learn_aspnet_before_i_learn_aspnet_core/,"I've been struggling with this. I have very good front end skills and I was going to work through two courses that taught technologies like nodejs, expressjs, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB and then a follow up course that got into advanced topics like SSH, optimizations, Redis, TypeScript, Docker, etc.

I have a little over a year of C# experience with WPF development due to internships and also some game development. I have aspirations to build my own software products as a side hustle, and I think ASP.NET Core would be great. It also aligns well with my area as most companies use .NET tech. I just find most posts or books or videos seem to be for developers who have experience with [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) and [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) MVC... On top of this, I haven't really found courses like the two described above that give you a real round about delivery of Web App creations including continuous integration, deployment, etc.

So with all that being said, and for my entrepreneurial goals, is it better to learn [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) before [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core? Either way, what would you suggest as the best way to learn about it for a person with no backend experience (Full stack?). Should I ditch this idea all together, learn the Nodejs stack and try to rock the javascript world? I really am not a person trying to get married to a language. I just want to make cool things, useful things, and solve problem. I enjoy C#, Javascript, Web development, HTML, CSS, Databases, the works. I know my skills will need to be transferable throughout my career but I just want your personal opinions on a direction.

I was thinking do the two courses so I have a broad understanding of full stack development and deploying an actual product to the masses. So I would be learning nodejs first. Then, I could look at learning [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core and it will be easier to pick up thanks to my newfound knowledge, and then I can chooses when to use one runtime environment for my backend or the other depending on the products end goal. Good Idea? No? Tell me if I am being a moron."

Dan stood in his daughter's bedroom doorway, watching as she sat at her little dressing table, painstakingly applied her mascara. Her hair was up and braided as through she were going to prom, but she was still a couple of years away from that. Her dress, also, was somewhere between party and formal, and hugged her still-developing curves nicely., Brand new Victoria's Secret lingerie was helping out beneath, making her adolescent breasts look a little larger than they actually were.

""You told them that I didn't want to do anal, right?""

""I told them, sweetie, but I don't think you get to pick and choose like that. That will be up to the men.""

She nodded and returned to her makeup.

Between the gown, the lingerie, the stiletto heels, the mani/pedi, and the trip to the salon, Dan had maxed out his credit card. But it was worth it. His little girl looked stunning. And she needed to look stunning tonight for the first meeting with the Society's elders.

""And you'll be in the room, right?""

""Yes, darling. I'll be there for the whole thing. Watching out for my little mouse.""

She stood up and turned back toward him, beaming a smile. ""I'm ready, Daddy.""

Dan's heart swelled with pride. ""Yes, sweetheart. You are,"" he said as he blinked back a tear.

8uahou,6,2018-06-27,I got fired over email.,your_girl_got_fired,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8uahou/i_got_fired_over_email/,"On Friday, I woke up to the news of my dismissal from my summer internship. It was issued via email. I wasn't questioned regarding any of the reasons cited for my firing, which were numerous. I'm pretty sure my family &amp; friends are sick and tired of hearing me complain, so I'm going to vent here. I'm not sure what the next step is to take in this situation, and I'm looking for advice. Ideally, I'd love to be reinstated.

My family told me not to speak up about it, but I'm struggling to understand why. They're like, ""Welp, that's life!""

I was an intern for a high-end brand. They're carried at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Harrods -- all the big names ​in fashion. I've always had an interest in fashion and I'm thinking about becoming a buyer.

Anyway, this summer I found an internship in the New York showroom with an onsite atelier. It was one of my all-time favorite brands, and I was so excited to represent them. I wasn't sure if working for a luxury brand would fit the stereotypes I've seen in the media. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I was incredibly well-respected, and the workplace was surprisingly diverse. The lead designer was Hispanic and the other team members were from Japan. Honestly, it shattered the stereotypes I had about the industry. That is, until \*she\* arrived.

A few weeks into my internship, I was placed under the supervision of a new hire. We'll call her ""Victoria"". Victoria is 22 and she just graduated from an institution in the city. This was her third job in fashion. At first, things were okay between us, but later, they began to derail.

Every time Victoria needed an assignment completed, she would give it to me right before it was due. She's done this several times. She won't give me work very far in advance and she won't communicate deadlines until the last minute. I think she has unrealistic time expectations for things to get done. However, it takes time to complete assignments!

Every time gives me something to do, she asks, ""Why is it taking you so long? Are you almost done? It shouldn't take this long."" I can never do my work in peace. 

I fear that I came across as incompetent, when in reality, I wasn't given enough time or notice in advance to complete assignments. This led to undue  pressure for both me &amp; Victoria. However, I feel that when I am dealing with spreadsheets detailing finances, styles, and other important details, I have to make sure it's accurate. I would hate for there to be an error for the team. I'm often requested to finish things in an impossible time frame.  I also think this created an illusion of disinterest.

Last week Monday, I bought lunch for an office party. I purchased 20 sandwiches, paper plates, utensils, and two salads, and lugged it back to the office. Then, I set it up in the open room upstairs. As soon as everyone arrived to eat, Victoria asked me to leave. She tells me that her assignment was due at 12:30pm, and she asked me to go to the office to finish working on it. Mind you, I wasn't told it was due at 12:30 until 1:00pm.

I brought my laptop upstairs so I could appease her. I found a quiet corner in the room, and I sat down to finish the assignment. Then, the lead designer came up to me, and he said ""Why are you working? Come join the party!"" 

Then, the CEO of the parent company came over and said the same thing when I did not move. I finally put my work away to enjoy the party. Victoria asked me to leave to finish the assignment after I was finished.

Then, I was assigned to pack up the entire showroom for Paris and Milan with no help whatsoever. I was supposed to pack up maybe 70 articles of clothing and 150 hangers. Not only did I have to fold the (very expensive) clothes, but I had to put them in plastic bags for protection and set up the boxes. Then, I had to cross check everything against a spreadsheet with photos to make sure it was the right item. This was a huge undertaking. The whole thing would've been done so much faster if I had assistance.

Victoria came over several times to check in on my progress. Then, she said ""I didn't think it would take this long."" I mean, you asked me to pack up an entire office space in 2-3 hours. She was frustrated &amp; furious. The entire place needed a lesson in time management. 

She also got mad at me for folding the clothes so gingerly. I mean feel like I would get in trouble if I didn't, so....

While I was folding the samples, I noticed there were several mistakes on the packing list.  A few of the photos did not match up with the written style. I circled the mistakes and checked the website to make absolute sure they were incorrect. 

When I informed Victoria about the (numerous) mistakes, she insisted that she was correct, and that I had been wrong. This occurred several times. I was certain the images were wrong, but she wouldn't listen to me.  

Victoria made a few mistakes in the past that I fixed. 

Later on in the day, she asked me to get bigger boxes. She sent me to Fedex to retrieve the largest boxes in stock. They were 28 x 28 x 28 an they were extremely heavy. I got the boxes and dragged them across three city blocks. I'm 5 foot tall, and so were the boxes. I had a very hard time and I had to stop because my arms were in so much pain.

Along the way, I saw Victoria on her way to lunch. She had to have seen how huge the boxes were. She stops to comment, ""Those are perfect! I'm so glad we got 3 of those."" Then, she continued on her way to lunch. She didn't even offer to help me.

Then, I get back to the office. We went head to head when she tried to force me to do something I was physically unable to do. ""The boxes are too big,"" she tells me. ""Can you please return them?""

""I'm so sorry Victoria, but I am physically unable to carry the boxes. I really need someone to help me.""

""Well they need to be returned now. I need you to do it. Are we on the same page?""

""They're too heavy!""

""Well, it needs to get done. Just return it to the nearest Fedex. Are we on the same page?""

I asked someone in the office to assist me. However, everyone was extraordinarily busy. So I decided to hide the boxes in a closet until someone could help me carry them. I wasn't doing it all by myself.

In the interim, I ran an errand for her to get more smaller boxes. She contacted me twice within 30 minutes to find out when I was coming back. One text, one phone call.

She also shortened my one-hour lunch break (for the second time) so I could help with packing the showroom. 

When I returned, she asked if I returned the boxes. I lied and said ""yes."" Another coworker told me he would help me, but he could not provide assistance the moment. I needed to cover my ass because she wouldn't listen to me. I wasn't about to endure her rage, and returning the boxes wasn't crucial.

""Good,"" she said.

When we had to move the seven boxes to be shipped to Paris &amp; Milan, she had everyone in the office help her move them. She was like ""All hand on deck."" Everyone dropped what they were doing to help her. 

""Do we really have to help?""

""Yes, it's a lot of work. We need all hands on deck.""

However, when I told her I needed help, all I got was sass.

Later on in the day, Victoria asked me if I had the receipts for the box return. I told her no, as I had not yet returned the box. She sent me to Fedex to get the receipt. Because I still needed help with the package, I ran around the office asking for help. I finally found a nice, strong man to help me. 

However, Victoria saw me running around the place asking everyone for help. She said, ""What's going on?"" Then, I confessed I still had to return the box.

""What? Why are you bothering all these people asking for help. They have duties. They have responsibilities. We're all busy around here."" 

""But I told you I was physically unable to carry the box. I really needed help.""

""Well, you should've asked for help!""

""But I did!""

""You should've called me and asked for help. Also, you brought the boxes here just fine. Well, I've had 5 internships, and I never said no to my bosses. I always found a way to make I work. You have to get things done."" 

After that, I just burst into tears. I didn't even know what else to say.

On Friday, I woke up to the news of my dismissal. I was furious about the way this situation was handled. 

I will admit that I did make mistakes at the company. I arrived late on several occasions. However, this was because I live further than the other employees. My train was delayed on several occasions, and yes, I should've made an effort to make an earlier train. No conflict. However, I wasn't questioned about this at all. Nobody told me I was coming late.

Also, I'm 100&amp;#37; aware that I made various mistakes on assignments. I take ownership for stupid things that I've done, 100&amp;#37;. But that's also because of the constant miscommunication between me &amp; Victoria.

Two of the other reasons cited for my firing were 100&amp;#37; not true. They can be disproven through documented communications.

My responsibility as an intern is to learn. However, how am I supposed to do so if I'm not told my mistakes?

What do you guys think I should do next? Speak up about Victoria? "

8uao75,38,2018-06-27,"Hi, I am a Psychiatry residency dropout. About a year ago I quit what I thought would be my dream job. Ask me anything.",rileyjamesmcallister,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8uao75/hi_i_am_a_psychiatry_residency_dropout_about_a/,"[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/lPjaTGV) 

I had wanted to be a psychiatrist since middle school. Part of my motive was self-interest. I have lived with anxiety all my life and I wanted to get better. I had never felt comfortable admitting I had an unhealthy mind until my first year of medical school, as my anxiety was reaching new heights. Since then, through a combination of professional help, self-help books, psychology texts, training, and strong relationships, I have made pretty good progress in my transformation.  


After finishing medical school and getting accepted into a psychiatry residency, I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork to get my physician-in-training permit (a temporary medical license for my residency). Somewhere in that paperwork, I disclosed to the Texas Medical Board that I was taking an antidepressant. In my head, I figured I was telling them about my medical history to fight the stigma and normalize depression/anxiety. I was telling them, ""This is me, I'm not perfect, but all doctors are human"". They were, uhh, not receptive.   


To get my permit, the Board required me to surrender my psychiatrist's records, and based on what they read in those records, decided I needed to be in a monitoring program including random drug tests, routine psychiatric evaluations, and regular meetings with Alcoholics Anonymous. I had to pay for all of this out of pocket, and it wasn't cheap. I stuck with it for as long as I could, but about midway through my internship I told my program director I would be resigning at the end of the year.  


When I look back on my disclosure to the Board, I think my decision was maybe naive but I still think it was the right thing to do. I want to reiterate, the Board's decision was based solely on what I had told my psychiatrist in confidence. I had never been arrested, I had never worked impaired or had an accident or anything like that. I had been instructed by colleagues not to check that box on the paperwork, but I didn't want to start my career with a lie that could later be uncovered.   


While the monitoring program was a painful experience, it wasn't my only reason for quitting my job. There were parts of the work that I really didn't enjoy, which made me comfortable in my decision to leave. If psychiatry really were my dream job, I think I could have endured the monitoring program. 

During my internship I found out that I prefer the psychotherapeutic and psychosocial aspects of care, but much of psychiatry is biologically-oriented. I am definitely not anti-psychiatry, though - I don't think I would be where I am today without taking an antidepressant. I'm not currently taking any medications, but I would be open to restarting one if I had to.  


I imagine maybe some think my departure from the profession is good riddance, and maybe they are right. Still, I am one less psychiatrist in a field that is already understaffed.  


I have a few reasons for making this post:

1. I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while, and I think doing an AMA might be a cathartic process for me. 
2. I think my story is at the very least interesting, and might even be helpful for some people to hear - I think what I was put through was wrongful, and I hope things change for future doctors. Plus, I still want to work on normalizing mental health struggles, and fight the stigma.
3. Finally, I hope maybe y'all can give me some advice for moving forward! I've been searching for direction for the past year, and I've learned a lot, but I'm still trying to find my way. I know now that I want to be a psychotherapist, but I'm reluctant to go back to school and add on to my student loans. Also, tbh I'm a little apprehensive about subjecting myself to more licensing boards...

So please, ask me anything. I can provide the perspective of both clinician and patient. Or maybe you have questions about career changes/premature mid-life crises (I'm 30 years old, btw). Whatever your questions, I'm here for it.

8uaoz7,2,2018-06-27,Guy (23m) I (27F) am dating still talks to his ex (19F),throwaway_imessedup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uaoz7/guy_23m_i_27f_am_dating_still_talks_to_his_ex_19f/,"Throwaway because I'm not proud of what I did and I'm aware this problem is one of my own making. And I'm slightly terrified I'm going to be torn to shreds on here, but I've been anxiously obsessing about this all week so here goes...

Befriended a guy with a gf. Genuinely started as friends who shared the same anxious tendencies, humor, childhood, etc. Sometimes it was like we were reading each other's minds. He always avoided talking about his relationship but it was obvious he was unhappy with it. Emotional cheating and cuddling ensued. 

I hated myself for my behavior and cut contact. Before I did that, I prodded and learned he was waiting a month until his gf was done with her grad finals to break up with her because she was emotionally unstable and historically suicidal. And also because he needed time to emotionally prepare to move on from someone he had been dating for 1.5 years. Sure. I still went no contact.

Less than month in, I broke down and contacted him. He then broke up with his gf a week later, after her finals, like he said he would. Apparently he'd tried to break up with his gf right after I cut contact with him, but she freaked out so he continued to wait until after her finals. He was surprised to find that she took the second breakup attempt maturely, that she wanted to leave off as friends. She thanked him for waiting until after finals to break up with her. She then leaves for an internship in another state for the summer.

Me and the guy start hanging out and despite both of us saying we are going to take it slow, we don't. After a month we are workout buddies, confidants, fast friends.

But he still talks to his now ex once a week on the phone. He has explicitly told me that he will never be interested in dating her again due to her emotional volatility but that they hopefully will remain friends since they attend the same small grad school program. He has told her he doesn't ever see it working out between them and he believes she understands that. He wants her to move on but he doesn't want bad blood between them.

Only, she doesn't know that he's seeing me. And in a potential relationship I'd like the dude I'm dating to not, in essence, hide me. I realize one option would be to burn this mess to the ground and start over with someone new, very single, and not reboundy. But I'm here asking for advice on how to continue a relationship with him however messed up it began.

It feels like he's either leading her on or misleading me. Should I be understanding about this since we are technically not officially dating? Where should I draw the line? When does supporting his ex emotionally as a ""friend"" now start to disrespect me? Should I back away from him until he actually has time to resolve everything with his ex?

TL;DR Guy I'm dating who recently broke up with his ex for me (sort of) still talks to his ex once a week on the phone. What should I do?"
8uarsl,2,2018-06-27,Trying to find an internship opportunity with no success. Any advice is appreciated. Apologies in advance for the long story / rant,thebiffdog,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/8uarsl/trying_to_find_an_internship_opportunity_with_no/,"I have always been very passionate about art in all its forms. I'd rather go to look at graffiti walls than a sports outing. In high school I took any and all art classes possible (drawing, painting, ceramics, sculpture, multimedia, art history, senior portfolio). I enjoyed art so much I went to the careerline tech center for Visual Communications for two years during high school. The Visual Communications program was Graphic Design, that is where I found what I wanted to pursue and have as a career. I would spend half my day at high school learning the general requirements then I would ride a bus the the tech center to learn about graphic design. I went to a community college because my parents do not have the income to pay for a university nor do I. It's essentially all the same education anyways. Thankfully, I had received financial aid help me to go to college. I been studying graphic design for 4 years now in what is a ""2 year college"". I need an internship in order to get my associates degree in graphic design. I need to complete a total of 180 hours, write and submit what I learn each week to the college. I have a month now to complete the 100 hours I have left over. I've already completed 80 hours while working with a former MCC student suggested by my internship coordinator. However those 80 hours will mean nothing, soon I will have to pay $300 to take the internship class again so i can attempt to graduate once again. As for the 80 hours already completed, The former MCC student whom I had been interning for and his wife were soon welcoming another child into their lives and went from having a building to working out of their basement. It would take days or weeks for him to even respond to me for a new design task. I slowly learned about screenprinting and made some shirts but besides that I wasn't gaining much new knowledge. So I decided to try to get a different design internship, I asked the college for help or suggestions on where to apply to or how to land a position with no help. Fast forward months later, west Michigan still had little to none design internship opportunities or entry level job opportunities. Maybe once a month you would see a new opportunity. I drop everything in Michigan and move to west Florida. There are 20 new design opportunities here every week. I'm applying for everything design related. At this point I'd rather have my foot in the design door then worry about my associates degree as my concern is having any design experience is better than none.. yet I have no experience and six years of education. Still no luck landing a design position after two months of applying every single day. I want to know what am I doing wrong or right, or what are these hiring design companies and firms not seeing about me to pass up my creative design skills? Why am I not getting hired if i have a portfolio website, a resume, a cover letter, send a thank you letter for the interview? Do I need to give them a gift with my face on it to be like ""Hey Hire Me!!!""? I need advice on the graphic design industry and why it's such a darn depressing struggle to get a ""you're hired"". This has been the short life story of a struggling up and coming graphic designer. Advice, thoughts, prayers and criticism is welcomed."
8uaxti,5,2018-06-27,"Me (26F) and my friend (23M) of three months, suddenly everything he does is irritating me and I can't pin down why",yesssssssssssno,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8uaxti/me_26f_and_my_friend_23m_of_three_months_suddenly/,"I've been abroad with a government exchange program for the past ~5 months in China and early on my time here, I noticed a guy from another country that seemed like culture shock was hitting him really hard (like he practically looked like he was dissociating, he was in a total haze). Other exchange students from my country were being assholes and talking shit about him (calling him weird and stuff) but seeing as we didn't even know the guy, I thought their shit talking was mean and unfair, so I decided to try to befriend him and do my best to make his adjustment easier.



He was very awkward and shy at first but honestly that's totally okay with me, I've always been a part of friend groups that are quirky and usually those are some of the nicest people you'll meet. And that's the thing, he is very nice, he's very honest and takes friendship very seriously. We have practically nothing in common in terms of our values (he leans toward very conservative and he's very religious and I tend to lean toward the liberal side and I am an atheist, if you have to label it), but especially in the beginning everything was great, I enjoyed talking to him and learning about where he was coming from in terms of values and we have similar enough nerdy interests that it's okay. In a sea of people from my country that are quick to judge and label people without actually listening to each other, I thought it was very refreshing to hear his side of things and he was an equally a good listener.



But recently I've just been growing so frustrated with him. He tells a lot of the same jokes over and over, and I feel like he assumes that any time I have free is time that we should meet. This is also his first time away from living away from his parents, let alone being in another country, so he can sometimes act a bit childish and sheltered, and he often relies on me to talk to others in Chinese because he doesn't want to talk to others- he's an exchange student but he doesn't want to practice the language outside of our class at all.



But otherwise he's nice and friendly. I've tried to take steps to address my irritation with him, I figured maybe I just need more alone time. I've been able to get distance and even went on a solo trip around China for a week or so, and it was super refreshing for me. But as soon as I was back and saw him I realized that I was so much quicker go from 0-100 in terms of getting irritated by him. Anything he says now just bothers me so much, even though nothing he says has changed in the few months we've known each other. I feel like out of nowhere I've lost all patience with this dude, and I feel bad because I don't think he's done really anything to deserve it.



I guess what I want to know is, has anyone else had this happen before, and if so, what were the underlying reasons you felt this way and how did you deal with it? Is this just a suffocating friendship? Should I tell him directly that I need more space (if so, can I even do this without hurting his feelings??)- the thing is, even with space, things seemed to get worse afterwards. Is this just a problem with me? I don't know if my homesickness is impacting me or what. I feel like a shitty friend, especially considering I chose to befriend him and I'm one out of maybe 2 friends he's made here, and definitely the closest friend he has here, and now all of a sudden I feel compelled to distance myself from him and can't even look him in the eyes because I feel so annoyed by him.



Also, we had agreed a couple months ago that when I went to do an internship in Beijing that he would stop and visit during the few days that I have free during that time, but now just thinking about it makes me frustrated. Should I tell him not to come? How can I even do that politely?



I'd appreciate hearing anyone's insight and experiences with situations like this, I don't like being so irritable and I wish I could just be more patience, but it seems like I'm all out of it, it's been totally exhausted.



**tl;dr: ** I'm super pissy and irritable around this one friend and I would appreciate some outside perspective on how to understand and address it."

First off, it's a pretty big disadvantage now that he can only compress things with one hand (unless somehow his robot arm can). But I bet it will be much stronger than his previous arm which makes him more of a threat.

Also, when there was that clone of Mr. Compress helping Twice and Toga towards the end of the Internship arc, it looked like he had both arms. Does that mean twice can make clones of him that aren't missing his arm? Or was the clone just made before Compress lost his arm?"

8ubl51,6,2018-06-27,weed is objectively interfering and ruining my life and unfortunately i don't seem to care,fuckthisdrugtest,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8ubl51/weed_is_objectively_interfering_and_ruining_my/,"tl;dr: always go back to smoking weed no matter what is going on in my life, either positive or negative, and I dont think I can handle casually smoking--need total abstinence

hello leaves, i've been a long time lurker and have gotten so much help from reading the stories and responses of others, so I thought I would post my situation and see if anyone has insight; this is going to be a somewhat longer of a post so please bear with me :) 

I am a graduate student in a large midwest school. I have been an everyday smoker for 4 years. 

I started smoking weed my freshman year (in the same institution as my graduate program). I was introduced to it by a roommate, and it was never a problem. I would smoke maybe once or twice a week, and it was all in pure enjoyment. The ability of weed to give myself a different perspective than the one I was used to was the really intriguing part of weed. Naturally a curious person, weed gave me the lens to view things with a child-like wonder. 

The summer after freshmen year, I lived with a few guys who were stoners, and they got me really into smoking regularly. It started as an evening ritual that we would all do in the evening after work, but it quickly grew to occasional wake-and-bakes, and eventually I would call in sick for work maybe once a week and just get high all day. 

After the summer, the habit stuck with me for the rest of my college career. Moving out of the dorms and into the ""off-campus"" life sophomore year, I wasn't constantly surrounded by people and there wasn't really anyone to hold me accountable. My roommates and I had a rocky relationship--them being hard workers and prioritizing school, and me being a lazy stoner, and it just caused so much tension and guilt. I smoked everyday and my grades and mental health suffered. I lost interest in everything and fell into a depression, and weed was the only thing that kept me from feeling sad. I would stay in bed for weeks at a time, and not engage with anyone. 

By chance and luck, I received a highly competitive internship that allowed me to stay in my undergraduate institution over the summer. The summer came around, and, exactly like last summer, I was still smoking everyday, and essentially skipped going to the internship multiple times because of weed. After the internship, I stayed about one month back at home with my parents, without weed and everything felt better. I finally felt more normal, and things felt like how they felt in high school. 

After the summer, I moved out of the apartment with my old roommates, and junior year started off really well. Unfortunately, my sobriety from weed lasted a minute into the school year. I immediately picked up the habit and was in denial about how much of a problem it was going to be. Weed just ruined my motivation, and I was completely okay with being an average student. 

Things changed however, during my second semester, as I had to take a drug test in order to do my job. It took me 72 days to get clean, and I used alcohol as a ""replacement."" Although I was drunk a lot of the time that semester, my grades and motivation towards school drastically improved. This was the best I've done in school since freshmen year. 

However, right after I passed my drug test for my job, I immediately got back into smoking and did not have as productive of a summer as I could have been. The first two months of summer I just smoked all the time and went to work stoned--no one noticed but I wasn't engaged, almost like I was on auto-pilot.

My original plan during freshmen year was to go to medical school. I was in a challenging, selective program and all my peers seemed to be doing better than me, and that was incredibly demotivating. Instead, my career plan shifted a bit, and instead I decided to go to graduate school. 

My parents forced me home because they knew that I wasn't as productive in my college environment as I was back at home, and the last two months of summer, I studied for the GRE back at home and was successful. 

My senior year began, and I was still smoking everyday. It affected graduate school applications, as I did everything last minute. Luckily, I was successful in the application cycle, and decided to stay at my same undergraduate institution. Again, I smoked all the way through summer and didn't really do much.

Entering graduate school, I started to date my current boyfriend, and I was able to hide my addiction from him. He never really smoked before he met me, and I've smoked with him a few times and we enjoyed it together, but it wasn't his ""thing."" He knew I was a ""stoner,"" but I don't think he realized the severity of the problem until he got to know me better. He is my biggest fan and he really motivated me to change, and he was there to hold me accountable and be supportive--I knew this was something that I couldn't do alone. I was able to be 90 days sober during the first semester, and it changed my life. I was doing so much better in school, able to pay attention and just be engaged with my work. It was life changing. After a few days of sobriety, it seemed so strange how much time I would spend smoking weed and just being a shut in. 

However, I fell back into the habit the next semester, and hid this from my boyfriend. I would go out of my way to hide my smoking and it caused tension in our relationship since I would always be anxious of him finding out. 

He has supported me and loves me and is willing to help me get through this, and I really want to change too. I just feel that even when I'm sober and see the positive difference sobriety makes, I ALWAYS go back to smoking excessively. 

I used to think that after long periods of sobriety, I could reintroduce weed into my life, and have the sort of freshmen year weed experiences, full of joy and wonder, rather than maintenance of my mood. I don't think that is a possibility--regardless for how long I take a break for, I always go back to weed with a renewed voracity.

Minor Manga spoilers!

I've re-read his mini arc from the internship arc, and I've been inspired with an idea. As we know, Lumilion's hero costume is intwined with his hair so that it can follow him through his permeations;

What if Kirishima could do the same thing with HIS hair? We've already seen that it hardens with the rest of his body, so what if it could be woven into a sheet and then hardened during combat? he could make a manly, unbreakable shield, weapon or a possible restraint (Like if Lockrock used his quirk on a towel wrapped around your hand, effectively trapping you in that exact position). It would further his quest to become a stronger man who can protect people, beyond simply increasing his hardness.

At least hire some interns to fix it, it's not that hard, At least try. 

The playstore reviews are depressing, I can't see how they think it's just fine to leave it in such a terrible state. The only worse I have ever seen is Crave TV, another dumpster fire of an app for Android.

8ucj1x,7,2018-06-27,Help! Need interview advice,Arachnesloom,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8ucj1x/help_need_interview_advice/,"Hi guys,

I'm really struggling to get my first actuarial job and I could use any advice. 

I've been interviewing for full-time positions since last October, when I was still in school. I graduated last month. I've taken about five or six on-site interviews, for both large and small companies, which means I passed the preliminary phone and/or recorded video interviews. I've gotten no offers, so I'm really wondering what I'm doing wrong. 

Steps I've taken:

* revised my resume a lot, including taking off my first Master's degree because it isn't relevant. Now I just include my Bachelor's (music) and Master's in math/actuarial science
* taken mock interviews with recruiters from the type of company I would like to work for. I generally get good feedback like ""generally good, friendly tone, but talk more about this/emphasize this more""
* worked with a career coach in my college (science and tech) who gave me interview and resume tips. 
* asked lots of questions to my friend who works for an HR consulting firm and does some of their interviewing

Things I always say/do in interviews:

* read the bios of the people interviewing me

* know about the CEO and read stuff he's posted online

* stand up and shake hands when a new person enters the room
* dress conservatively, basically like Scully in the late 90s X-Files
* bring a leather padfolio and resumes
* act as polite and professional as possible. I'm by nature an intense and blunt person, so I've made efforts to pare down my energy as much as possible and say as little as possible while answering the questions. 
* describe in detail the Excel and R projects I've done (when prompted)
* describe in detail the work I did at my internship (Excel based) and my best understanding of what they did with the results (use in the reports to the office of the regulator)
* talk about why I'm enthusiastic about living in that city (when prompted. So far I've just been applying to jobs in cities where I want to live)
* ask about their exam support program and say ""sounds great""
* ask about their onboarding process/mentorship and say ""sounds great""
* ask the junior analysts about where they live and their commute
* talk about interesting papers/books I've read on subjects that are related to insurance/actuarial science
* be basically honest about my reasons for changing careers: 1) more mathematical thinking and problem solving; 2) more opportunities due to changing regulations, 3) overall job satisfaction according to surveys, 4) be part of a specialized, elite workforce and be valued by my employer/ job stability
* send thank-you notes especially to the HR contact/organizer

I've never managed to get feedback from the companies that reject me, but sometimes I know I said something wrong/awkward so I learn from it.
 
What am I missing??
Thank you! "
8ucklu,3,2018-06-27,Does the personal statement even matter?,FloridaFakesRapee,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8ucklu/does_the_personal_statement_even_matter/,"So I recently had to question the premed dogma that the personal statement is very important.

I ran across this monstrosity of a personal statement from an admitted student's blog. It is a regurgitation of their resume, full of cliches and clunky to read, focuses entirely on the doctors and the only patient mentioned is himself...and it even finishes off with the premed cherry on top of getting all of his medical inspiration from an orthopedic surgeon. Text below.

&gt;During my first varsity football game, I caught a pass and tried extending the play toward the sideline to conserve time. When making the cut I immediately fell to the turf with an excruciating pain in my left leg. As it turned out, that pain was a tear in my anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus, concomitant with a left femoral condyle fracture occurring at critical point in my physical development. Thus, my surgery, and my return to football, was delayed for more than 6 months due to the significant growth I was predicted to have. Throughout these months, I spent numerous hours in doctors’ offices and in rehabilitation, and very few hours where I longed to be—the football field. Despite this trying time, in hindsight I consider my injury and subsequent therapy to be crucial, life-altering events, as they sparked a fascination in medicine and anatomy that grew into an avid desire to help others. My surgeon was generous with his time and compassionately walked me through my surgery and recovery. His commitment to my care was instrumental in helping me determine that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping others in this way.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the duration of my recovery, I came to identify how teamwork among physical therapists, nurses, physicians and other disciplines led to an elevated level of care. My first exposure working in the medical field also emulated this message through an internship with the human resources talent acquisition team for Northwestern Medicine. In conducting exit interviews with terminated employees, I gained valuable insight into positive and negative aspects of a health system from a unique perspective. The most significant trend I observed in these interviews involved the correlation between how much employees valued their jobs and the sense of unity they felt in their environment. I explored this connection directly helping my own team by taking initiative in designing spreadsheets to better organize potential candidates. This required constant collaboration with associates for advice highlighting the importance of communication and teamwork in the hospital setting. The theme of unity was once again emphasized in a clinical observation program. On one rotation shadowing a trauma physician, a patient was rushed in with cerebral hypoxia from an attempted suicidal overdose. It was admirable and inspiring to see the emergency room personnel working together in unison towards the welfare of the patient despite the dire circumstances. I was instantly overcome with compassion and helplessness in this sad reality of medicine I had not encountered. Ultimately, it would highly motivate me to achieve my dream of one day helping others in these tragic moments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The clinical observation program further facilitated a greater understanding of the importance of teaching in medicine. As a dedicated and lifelong student, spending hours learning from physicians in many different areas of medicine invigorated my intellectual curiosity. This exposure led to a greater understanding of not only the various medical specialties, but also how each contributes into the larger narrative of a health system. Tutoring in chemistry and philosophy similarly highlighted these implications from a different standpoint. In relating the material to students, I better understood it as a scholar myself. Much like interactions between physicians and patients, each student is unique in their learning abilities and backgrounds. I learned to recognize and adapt to these differences to deliver a personalized educational experience. Understanding the importance of teaching as a student and tutor proved how instruction hinges upon communication. The rich knowledge I absorbed from shadowing was made possible through the articulate conveyance of information. Executive positions in governmental and sports organizations alike cultivated the skillset necessary to communicate with groups and individuals. Through these revelations I have internalized the value of teaching and effective communication and am committed to ongoing education.  
&gt;  
&gt;My direct clinical involvement continued with a research internship for the department of surgery at Greenville Memorial Hospital. In this role, I frequented the operating room weekly, seeing a wide range of surgical interventions. In addition, I worked on a research project with a team of minimally invasive hernia surgeons. At the end of the study, I was given the honor of presenting our findings; moreover, our manuscript was recently accepted for publication in *The American Surgeon*. This experience opened my eyes to the value of research as I could see the direct impact data can have on patient care, as well as the advancement of surgery. Even my ability to run today is the result of past clinical research. Through my contribution, I solidified a deep-rooted desire to continue researching in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;The clinical and university experiences along my journey have developed traits and internalized values necessary to fulfill my dream of becoming a physician capable of both researching and teaching. To this day I remember how the surgeon put my distraught feelings at ease through his care after I was stripped of athletics. The potential to do the same as a doctor is what excites, motivates and drives me."

Seeking advice.,irwtgoastsyd,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/8ucn55/i_may_be_done_with_this_career_seeking_advice/,"I am in year 4 of the TT. I spent two years at an institution teaching a 3/3. I moved to a new place to increase my quality of life (backfired) and live closer to family; I am teaching a 4/4 now. I live in a state that has cut Higher Ed tremendously. Our department should have 7 faculty; we have 4. Two faculty lines were cut.

My colleagues all have some administrative or intern supervision duties that take them to a 3/4, 3/3, 2/2, and 0/1 (chair). I am the only one who teaches 4/4. In the spring, one of those classes will be an evening block class an hour away from my home (I have toddlers at home who I wish very much to see every night). When I started, I was supposed to have 3 preps each semester, so 1 class should have 2 sections. That happened once. I have had a new prep almost every semester that I've been there, except this summer. From year 1 to year 2, my class sizes doubled. My fall semester I will have 2.5 times the students compared to my first semester. I have been offered 10 hours/week GA. Today I found out another class has almost doubled in size.

My bosses have little power, here, or so they're telling me.

I am completely overwhelmed. I have considerable student loan debt as a result of bad choices, learning tough lessons on how to be a good steward, dropping out due to mental health, and going to school forever. Money is a real issue for me, but I also do not tolerate this level of stress very well, at all. The recent story of the professor who committed suicide in the UK really connected with me - that desperation and hopelessness (to be clear, I am not suicidal).

I have to sign a contract next week promising I'll be back 18-19. I am meeting with my boss Friday and I don't know what to ask for. I have looked for other jobs and it's definitely possible I can go back to the real world, but take a $15-20,000 pay cut. I know the PhD may also make me overqualified for some of these jobs, too.

What are some ideas of what I could ask my boss for to make this fall manageable?

Is it a reputation killer to divulge my background to make my case?

Is it wise to threaten not to sign the contract? It is definitely not the outcome I want, but it looks like I will eventually exit academia if things don't change significantly.

Any other thoughts or suggestions?"

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this little post of mine, I hope that you'll find something that interests you in it!

First time writing a post here on reddit so might not be the best! You have been warned.

**One liners will be ignored. Put some effort into it like I did with this post.**

Quick Edit: I'd also be very open to playing rule34 styled things as well. Like Arya stark or Daenarys Targarean in the GoT universe and such!

So, I'll fully admit that I'm a very big fan of celebrities and the status that they hold in the eyes of many 'normal' people. I'm also a big fan of futanari/shemales who's packing big piece of swinging meat between their legs. So I thought, why not pair those two things together and made a RP post about it?

Needless to say, I'm looking to play some very well endowed celebrities (internet celebs included, like youtubers!) who gets into all kinds of lewd and naughty fun with people that they meet and work with. While I am primarily looking for female partners, I am very much open to partners who plays feminine boys as well.

Please be literate, detailed and be able to write decent amounts of text. I'm a multi-paragraph rper myself.

Some ideas to get the thoughts rolling, but keep in mind I'd be more than happy to hear any other ideas as well.

Personal Assistant: You're a personal assistant to the stars, you get to meet all the most famous and hot actresses and singers. All from the women from the all too popular Game of Thrones series to singers like Rihanna and Taylor swift. You get to follow them to the nicest locations, to the best resorts, to their own getaways and houses scattered across the world. Of course your job is to keep them happy, to get them the food they want, the entertainment they want, the clothes they want, the alcohol the they and so on. But since you're in such a high paying job and getting very nice bonuses because of it.. Well.. You have to take care of their other needs, any time, any where.

Comic Con meet up (works with any Con really): A con is always a good place to get the chance to meet some celebs, maybe they're doing a meet and greet, maybe they're doing a bit of autograph signing, maybe they're just nerds that wants to enjoy it like a normal person? Whatever the reason, you get to meet the celeb(s) of your dream! Maybe you met them after a Q&amp;A where they thought you were cute when you fumbled with your question, maybe you met them back at the hotel. You couldn't quite remember, but here you are regardless.. What luck, eh?

Co-worker: Being an up and coming young individual in the industry can be daunting to say the least. There's always someone that's more important than you, always someone who knows more than you, always someone that can get you fired with one phone call just around the corner when you're running with that hot coffee in your hand. Needless to say, you have to be careful. But at the same time it's a fantastic opportunity! Maybe you get to know your more famous co-star privately? Maybe you want to make that sex scene just look that more real? Maybe you actually did make some enemies and are trying to make up for it?

Intern: Let's face it, being an intern sucks. You always have to go get food and coffee for stuck up producers and even just to the people one step higher than you on the company ladder. But it's not all bad. You still get to meet plenty of beautiful famous people. Perhaps you see this as an opportunity to get close to them? Befriend them? Use them to maybe make your life a bit easier?.. Or maybe you simply end up as their toy?

While I hate to do this, please write Big Dick Celeb in the title of your message to let me know you've read this far. Silly I know but best I could come up with!

So there's 4 quick little prompts, nothing fancy but it's better than nothing. Like I said, I'd be more than happy to hear out any other ideas as well, so don't be shy! I'm down for pretty much everything, from them being complete strangers to friends to family members to being married!

Here's a list over celebrities that I enjoy playing: Emilia Clarke, Ronda Rousey, Daisy Ridley, Dodger/presshearttocontinue, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Emma Watson, Pokimane, Avril Lavigne, Shakira, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Emma stone, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Amy Adams, Alexa Bliss, AJ Lee, Paige, Sasha Banks, Becky Lynch, Eva Marie, Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman, Ariel Winter, Gal Gadot, Christina Hendricks, Sarah Hyland, Alyson Hannigan, Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Zooey Deschanel.

8uczpn,2,2018-06-27,Not sure what to do,wapey,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8uczpn/not_sure_what_to_do/,"About the past month I've had a lot of anxiety all related to my best friend. She transferred out of our college a bit over a year ago but we message on a daily basis and call each other every few weeks or so. This summer I started an internship at a company and it's mediocre at best. I'm extremely lonely because I rarely see other interns and I'm working alone most of the time, when I even have anything to do. I started to notice my anxiety flaring up whenever she wouldn't message me back or wouldn't read my messages. I also have found myself becoming pretty jealous of new friends she's making since she's living at a family vacation home over the summer and meeting new people there. Along with that I've also realize that I think I would be interested in a relationship with her and I've talked to her about it and she said she is with me too, but those plans are on hold for now since my anxiety is getting so bad and she also has her own stuff to deal with. My anxiety has gotten to the point where I'm eating much less than normal because I have almost no appetite. I'm starting to see a psychologist but my next appointment isn't for 2 weeks. In order to try and put a stop to this she blocked me on messenger and we decided that we're only going to talk intermittently for the next two weeks to see if it helps because that's what we did last summer when a similar albeit much less severe situation happened. essentially I think my issue is that she is by far my best friend and I care about her far more than anyone else whereas I am one of her best friends but she has other people she cares about as much as me too even if she doesn't talk to them nearly as often. I'm really struggling because I want to be the most important person in her life but I know that's a very irrational feeling to have. I want to change my perspective and get back to how I was before the summer, and maybe even change it from then on so that I'm not so concerned about her and her life. I just feel like I don't know what to do, clearly I need to accept the fact that she's going to have other friends that she spends time with and can't put 100% of her attention into me, and I need to worry about her a lot less. if anyone actually bothers to read through all this thanks, I know it's kind of a mess and I might delete it too. I just feel stupid because literally nothing is wrong, she's making friends which is awesome, still talking to me all the time, and even said that she would be interested in a relationship with me yet I'm developing so much anxiety because I have these insane expectations that I wonder are being caused by my job."

My boyfriend recently got a great summer internship in a really cool city. The unfortunate thing is it's really far from our home state (where we attend college together) and really short notice. Before he got the internship I had already planned to visit him in his home town. I had all my work shifts covered, which was hard to arrange. So despite him only being in his second week of his internship I came down anyway. I spent about two grand on flights and hotel. 


I knew I wouldn't get to see him a ton because he has his internship. I've been exploring the city myself and that's been fun. But my problem is that I feel he's not spending as much time with me as he could. I'm only here a week and then I won't see him for two months so I wanted to see him as much as possible. And I spent two grand to do it. But he texted me today that he'd be late getting home from work because he was getting dinner with new work friends. I want him to make friends at work of course but I still feel sad about not seeing him until later. Now I'm just sitting in my hotel room alone. I can't really go out because most of the tourist stuff has closed. 

I also asked him what he wanted to do on Saturday, my last full day and a day he has off work. He said he wouldn't be able to do a lot. I was confused because I thought he didn't have work. He told me I was right, but he had been planning some stuff with work friends but he could move it to Sunday. My question is, am I overreacting about him not spending every possible moment with me? I know it's also important for him to make friends and connections early on. But I still feel kinda lonely.

Outrage over the child separation had an impact. I made sure to call my representatives and senators daily until action was taken.

* Do not send e-mails they are easy to ignore. 

* Call them, leave messages, talk to the interns.

* Use strong language without resorting to vulgarity. Examples: Criminal investigation for treason, hypocrites, immoral cowards, etc...

* Make sure they know that you are ANGRY.

* Talk to your family, your friends, neighbors, and coworkers about this blatant power grab by the current Republican majority. Encourage them to call their Senators and get involved.

The world was a different place to Tony Stark now.

He had spent the past week dealing with almost a dozen different technological difficulties: wonders and all around fuck-ups. Having been partial creator of the monster that was Ultron, Tony had spent his weekend on a beach in one of those random tropical countries that had very little in the way of rain or anything that resembled a dark cloud. His other life, the life inside of the red and gold metal suit had been forgotten for the past forty eight hours. It was a symbiotic breakthrough. The suit needed more upgrades and repairs; and, the ammunition inside of the suit needed to be refilled, however. Tony himself needed to get some vitamin D. He needed to just get away from the modern world for a bit.

Tony was in the middle of an afternoon nap when his cellphone, the special one that only two people had the number for, buzzed. He opened his eyes and pushed the glasses, that had been perched on the tip of his nose, up. Tapping a button on the side of his glasses, the call connected.

""Mister Stark?""

**""Anatol! How are you doing?""**

""We... I am well, sir. Yourself?""

**""Lightly bronzed and very, very happy.""**

""That is excellent news to hear, mister Stark. I regret to inform you that-""

**""The suit's ready?""**

""Yes, sir. But, in other news, Christine Everhart has requested your presence on her show. Are you familiar with her?""

He knew the name, never saw her show though. She was one of those types who'd be popular with wine moms on Facebook. She takes a remotely conservative headline and runs with it until it either wasn't getting the headlines, or she had been proven right. Mostly the first one though, if she had ever been proven right, she never shut up about it.

**""Vaguely.""** Tony confirmed.

""She is quite the horrible woman. Unfortunately, Mister Stane has already confirmed your presence on the show. You will need to be back in New York soon.""

**""Now, why would he do that?""**

""I asked; the official response was he that was still running Stark Enterprises while you were off sunning yourself. Only in a slightly more colourful language. I believe he wishes to let you know that he is still in control of your business.""

That didn't surprise Tony. Whenever Obadiah went into one of his rages, he was famous for a string of expletives, all one after the other. Rolling his eyes, Tony pulled himself up to stand up off of the long deck chair. Tony's glasses flashed with a spray of information. Then, a descending list of numbers scrolled down the right lens. Tony finally looked to the skies before looking around the beach, getting the small bag he had taken down to the beach with him. Tony hoisted it up onto his shoulder and took a breath, before he walked towards the crystal blue waters of the ocean. Slipping his sandals off, the tech savant walked into the waters and let the pleasantly warm water lap at his ankles as he sighed softly.

**""So, when am I being picked up?""**

""The plane is due within the next two hours. It had to make a stop to pick up the merchandise,"" Anatol explained. The suit was ready to be loaded up and sent off for more action. ""We will take it back to Stark Tower and run through the necessary stress tests, while you make a start on the press circuit.""

Well... Back to reality.

The three men, Tony, Anatol and Happy hadn't been that eager for Tony to be on all the press shows, especially after the last time he had been on a show. But, with Tony now keeping himself fairly teetotal, he was on his best behaviour. His mind was right back to the usual smart, fast thinking man he had been for most of his adult life. Rubbing at the back of his neck, Tony walked forward and stepped into the view of the full-length mirror, hanging off of his own bedroom in his expensive New York suite. Looking over his wardrobe, Tony had opted for a pair of dark blue jeans, a smart casual baby blue v-neck shirt, and a dark blue blazer to match. Nodding his head as he looked himself over, Tony took these moments and regretted not having a female opinion on how he looked. He thought he looked good; but, what he thought was often incorrect in terms of his personal style. 

After smoothing down the front of his outfit, Tony made his way out of the room where Happy was waiting for him in the corridor.

""Boss, looking sharp!"" Happy whistled with a smile on his face.

That really made Tony pause. Did he have time to change? Happy placed a hand on Tony's shoulder and escorted him towards the elevator, which would take him down to the lobby. Sighing, Tony looked up at the small LED screen, flashing a series of numbers in a descending pattern. Stuffing his hands into his pockets, Tony took a couple of breaths before the doors slipped open and made his way out into the lobby with Happy in tow. The flash of cameras outside alerted the two men to the press were waiting for them. Happy tightened his grip on Tony's elbow and the pair briskly crossed across the hall and through the gaggle of paparazzi waiting for him.

""Mister Stark! Does your company employ underage children?""

""Mister Stark, are you in a secret relationship with Elon Musk?""

""Mister Stark, are you building technology for the Iron Man?""

""Mister Stark, are *you* Iron Man?""

Those were the only questions Tony could catch as he ducked his head and got inside the car. Happy quickly strapped him in. Within a matter of moments, the car was off towards the Everhart show. As he drummed his fingers along the car's inner wall, the Avenger thought to himself briefly before looking up.

**""Happy, do you think I should go public?""**

""Go public? Tony, the company already is... Oh... Oh."" The penny dropped, and Happy had a moment of reflection on what the man meant. Looking to the road and then over to Tony, Happy let out a slow sigh before shaking his head. ""I don't think you should, boss. I think going public will open up a can of worms. Not only for you, but for the company and, well, me. Think about what Stane wants to do to you with the Ten Rings. If he knows you're Iron Man, all he has to do is disconnect the lines on an elevator, or something, and we're stuck with a Stark pancake.""

Happy had a good point. He hated it when that happened. Tony rubbed at his chin, his finger raking through his goatee, before he brought up his cellphone and keyed in a number. Tony hit the big green 'Call' button and brought his cell phone up to his ear. Making sure to connect to the team leader who was working on the more PR friendly, good things coming out of Stark Enterprises now.

Quickly arranging to have some data sent over to him, Tony put the phone down and leaned back in his seat. Tony looked out the window smiled to himself. He knew that something good was going to happen from this little trip. His fingers ran over the hard plastic of the and thought about what he was going to do and how this was going to change the world. Tony Stark and Stark Enterprises were no longer going to be the warbringers they were famous for being. He was going to turn his own personal image around to something... better. 

The drive to the studios was fairly plain considering the mean New York traffic. Happy soon parked. Tony watched the man with a curious eye, for just how long had Happy been coaching himself how to park? He had never really noticed it before but while he was reversing into the space, Happy was actually talking to himself as if it were his first time inside of a car. The two made their way into the studios, and, almost immediately, Tony was whisked away to hair and makeup. 

The ordeal wasn't terrible, but, for someone with a mouth as big as his, Tony sure did have a problem with small talk. Finally, free fromthe chair and the cloak whisked off of his chest, Tony was let out of the room and he was free to roam the backstage area with a relative freedom. Tony spotted a blonde about his age by herself at the dining table, looking at one of the jelly doughnuts with a barely contained look of disgust. Walking up behind her, Tony smiled to himself and licked his lips, not wanting to appear overly predatory but also not wanting to have to deal with dry lips while he wanted to seduce this woman. Tony looked down at the doughnut and then over to her.

**""You know, if I was as sweet-looking as you, I wouldn't need the doughnut.""** Tony decided to start with an awful line before placing a hand on his heart and shaking his head. **""I'm sorry that was bad. Let me start over, I'm Tony Stark.""**

""Oh, I know who you are Mister Stark-""

**""Tony, please. I really don't believe in formalities.""**

""Tony, I'm just not so sure you should be flirting with random women on the set. You never know who could be listening.""

**""Let them listen. We're just talking. Not doing anything wrong, are we? Besides, don't you think talking to the star of the show will make you look good?""**

""I think you'll find that Miss Everhart is the star of the show, actually."" The blonde woman countered, a wry smile on her face as she tucked some errant strands of her sunshine coloured hair behind her ear.

**""I'm sure she is, whenever I'm not on the show. But, let's face it, she's not Tony Stark.""**

The woman opened her mouth to speak again, but an intern came over and pulled her to the side. She looked over her shoulder, shot Tony another wry smile and walked away. Tony watched her leave. The blonde did look at him again. 

She was definitely into him.

Happy walked over to Tony, a coffee in the minder’s hand, shaking his head gently.

""You have no idea who that was, do you?""

**""My next conquest?""** Tony offered, a dirty smile on his face as he turned to look at Happy. The other man chuckled and shook his head as he sipped on his coffee.

""That was Christine Everhart herself. She's the one who's supposed to be interviewing you, and you were trying to get into her pants."" Happy took another sip before shaking his head and clapping Tony on the shoulder. ""Well, good luck, boss.""

Tony sighed and made his way over to the set, where Christine was now sitting, and slipped into the seat opposite her. His eyes settled on her as he fell back in the seat, feeling so absolutely silly with himself. Rubbing at his forehead and then repositioned himself, Tony sighed and waited for the green light to come on, letting them know that they would be going live in the silent count of five. Tony watched the hand countdown. The sounds of the show's ident played in his earpiece, letting them know that the show was starting.

""Good afternoon, America. I'm Christine Everhart. Today, we have a very special guest on the show. Millionaire playboy and eligible bachelor Tony Stark is here to talk about the new sets of Jericho missiles being shipped off to the Middle East, that are no doubt killing innocent civilians and our own troops.""

Tony almost coughed at that lead-in. It was going to be one of those shows, if Tony didn't grab a hold of the situation, quick.

""Don't forget to join in the show with the hashtag *‘Stop Killing Kids’*.""

That was even worse!

""Mister Stark, welcome to the show. What can you tell me about the destructive purposes of the Jericho missile?"" Christine started, her eyes narrowing and moving right to focus on his face as he sat up in the chair.

Tony was quiet for a couple of seconds, before he leaned forward, his mouth closer to the dummy microphone. Tony could tell what the woman wanted from him. She wanted him to be unprepared for her and she wanted him to embarrass himself on her show again. So, for the time being, he could play along. He could act as if he were the very same drunk that had embarrassed himself on national television on his last big outing. A sly smirk moved over his face. Tony could see Happy just off set with a hand over his face as Tony’s minder knew exactly what Tony was going to do next.

**""I've spent a good amount of time after I came back to the mainland working on clearing up the name of Stark Enterprises-""**

""Yes, your garbage disposal is very impressive Mister Stark. But, it doesn't do much to work on clearing the sullied, blood-stained name of Stark Enterprises, does it?""

**""No. You're quite right, miss Everhart. That's why I've had my best people working on better technology. We've even came up with a nifty little hashtag that you can put on your show.""**

""Mister Stark, we don't do that here.""

**""No, you don't... But, I do.""**

Tony brought out his small cell phone, keyed a couple of buttons. Instantly, he had a basic control of the studio's computer displays and live stream. Tony wasn't going to be showing off too much; he’d be fairly discrete and not too overboard with the details.

In the top corner of the screen sat a little hashtag: ‘BetterWithTech’. Not done, Tony keyed in a couple more details. All of the photos he had gotten from the Stark Enterprises research and development department came up over the fancy LED screens that had previously been displaying the smug expression of Christine Everhart's face.

""Mister Stark-""

**""On the one behind me here, this is Riri Williams, a young girl from Massachusetts who had been struck by a runaway car. Girl had her spine severed and would never walk again. Except, there she is running, jumping, and- Hey! Shooting hoops too! Look at that throw! She wouldn't be standing up, if it weren't for my money, my mind, and my technology.""**

""So, you think-""

**""In the middle here, that's Paul Di'Ano, a Bronx man who had been born with a birth defect and was essentially missing his entire right ear. Now, with StarkTech, he has an, admittedly fake, but functioning ear piece that will work with his own hearing equilibrium. It's like he's got a brand new ear placed on him by God himself.""**

""So, you think you're God?""

**""In this respect? Definitely. If you'd turn your head, that last one is Cayleigh Elise. She broke her arm during a hiking accident. Now, she's got one new arm that's working just as well as her broken one did. It's only a temporary assist, sure, but it also beats having her arm in a cast for six to ten weeks, right?""**

""Mister Stark, this is all very impressive-""

**""Isn't it just?""**

""But, why is it that even after you made the formal announcement that Stark Enterprises will no longer be manufacturing weapons, your CEO Obadiah Stane has gone on record today saying that your contracts with the military will be too good to pass up?"" Christine sat back in her chair, looking over at him with another smug smirk on her face.

**""I'll have to get back to you on that. How about we discuss you and me going to dinner instead?""**

And, with that, the show quickly cut to a commercial. Tony was encouraged off the set and back to his car. Happy had spent the entire walk laughing. 

Though while Happy laughed, Tony wasn't.

He hadn't heard that Obadiah made the call. He certainly hadn't approved of it. Tony knew that this wasn't going to go down well with Obadiah, who had been very happy just selling garbage to whoever paid the most. This wasn't what Tony wanted to do with his father's company anymore. It definitely was not the impression Tony wanted to give out to the world. He wanted Stark Enterprises to be the jewel in the crown of modern medicine and technology. Tony started to wonder just what he was going to say to Obadiah when they were face-to-face.

""So, back to your place, Tony?"" Happy asked, snapping Tony out of his daydream.

**""No... No. Back to the office, please, Happy.""**

""You got it, boss."" Happy said with that tone that Tony knew what he meant by it.

The drive to the office was fairly quick, and the elevator ride up to Obadiah's office was even quicker. Tony was informed by the redhead, Stane's receptionist, that the man himself was free. Tony was inside of the office and charging up to talk to the older man.

Hard words were said, and the two came close to blows. Ultimately, after fifteen frantic minutes, they were done. Tony was back down on the elevator, riding down to his private lab. His arms were folded over his chest, and he was fuming with rage while he thought over what had happened. His cell phone rang and, though he was still annoyed, Tony answered the call.

**""Yes?""**

""Mister Stark? This is Colonel Rhodes from the US Navy. Are you available to talk?""

**""I’m sorry I’m not doing donations right now.”** Tony said, before he paused. **“How did you get this number, Rhodey?""**

""I... Please, don't call me Rhodey. I'm available to speak to you right now?""

**""Right now?""**

The doors slid open and to greet Tony at the bottom of the elevator's journey was three figures. He instantly knew Happy and Anatol. The change however was the tall linebacker-built African American man, his hair a perfect regulation cut, his face free of facial hair and his gaze lingering on Tony. Still in his dress blues, the Colonel took a step forward and extended his hand for Tony to shake.

**""Rhodey?""**

""Don't call me that."""
8ueehh,65,2018-06-27,Hostel Hookup,mrmaxnat96,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8ueehh/hostel_hookup/,"Hey so this is my first ever post... I created a reddit account just to share this since I really, desperately want to brag.

My name is Max, and I'm 22 years old. I've been living in France for the past year, and recently moved to Paris for an internship. I've been staying at a hostel until I find a more permanent situation. I sleep in a male-only, four person room. Being a red blooded gay male, I came in with some unrealistic fantasies of hot shirtless guys in close quarters, having one too many beers and engaging in hot sweaty group sex. The reality of the situation was much less pornagraphic. During the first week I shared my room with a loudmouth Pakistani guy who wouldn't shut up about EDM and an older man with sleep Apnea. At the beginning of the second week though, my third roommate arrived. He was exactly what my porn-addled mind had imagined. He was shorter, but well built and not overly defined, occupying some no-mans land between twink and jock, with asian features and skinny jeans that showed off his cute butt. That first day we engaged in some small talk. I found out that his name is Vince, and that he was born in the Philippines, but had lived in Finland most of his life, and that he was a little disappointed by Paris. His English was amazing, with just a little hint of an accent that drove me crazy. 

It's at this point where I should mention I am far out of his league. I'm thick, not so much in the hot two ""c""s way, but more in the ""he could manage to lose 15 pounds"" way. I'm very used to having unrequited lust for guys like Vince. So I don't really pursue anything, and settled for just seeing him in nothing but little black briefs when we walked to the bathroom in the morning.  We don't talk much for the next couple of days beyond ""good morning"" and asking each other if we're done in the bathroom. But on his second to last day, when it was just the two of us in the room, he struck up a conversation with me while I was hanging out on my top bunk. 

""Do any touring today?"" he asked me. 

I told him not really, just went to work and back here. We talk like this for a while, making small talk, when he says 

""its hard having a conversation like this, mind if I come up?"" 

I say yes, and he climbs up, and sits down cross legged across from me, just a little too close to be construed as friendly. I'm a bit nervous at this point. This feels flirty to me, and I'm not great in these situations. We have a pleasant enough conversation, and he keeps finding excuses to touch my shoulder and things like that. I feel like he's being pretty clear, so I decide to use a trick I hadn't tried since high school. I got the topic turned to music, and told him to come sit next to me so we could split earbuds, and I could show him some good music. I know it's incredibly corny, but once he sat next to me I wrapped my arm over his shoulder. We both sort of looked at each other, and started to make out pretty hard a second later. 

Our hands were all over each other. and we were naked pretty fast. He had such a hot chest, smooth except for a little treasure trail. He told me he liked having his nipples played with, and I was happy to oblige, tweaking them, licking all around them, tugging lightly at them with my teeth. We go on like this for a while, making out and heavy petting, shifting positions when he asked me to fuck him. It was so hot the way he asked, it sounded like he really wanted it. I warned him that I had never topped before. 

He held my hand through the process though and guided me through it. Het got down on his back, his cute ass slightly high, pulling me over him, spreading his legs, and wrapping them around me while I leaned over him. We both locked eyes while I adjusted, and slowly (with lube and a condom, were safe and smart but I didn't want to fuck up the flow of the story to tell you) inserted myself in him. The noises he made were so hot, I swear to god I got even harder inside him. From there it was like natural instinct took over. He jacked off while I fucked him. I'll admit I came first, but we both got there. 

The fucking was hot, and was my first time in a very, very long time, but I liked what we did after even more. We just laid there, totally naked snuggling. He did this hot thing where I would sit against the headboard, and he'd sit on top. We'd kiss every once in a while but mostly we just snuggled. We fell asleep like that. 

The next day, I helped him pack, and we gave each other kind of an awkward goodbye hug. I feel like this was a once in a lifetime thing. It's definitely inspired me to try topping more. I really liked it, and felt like I was pretty good. "

So, all of this happened awhile ago, but I'm someone who is very interested by mental health (I even own the DSM V) so as I grew out of the relationship more and more...I started to realize some things about it. I'll go ahead and list off some circumstances around the 10 month relationship. Covert narcissism, maybe?

-Relationship began pretty normally, and they were very excited for it. It was like the sun shined out my ass to them.

-Tells me early on about tragic upbringing, which in some cases, it was! Heard about how their parents were divorced and close-minded. Sad pet stories, their brother's drug abusive ex, self abuse stories, etc.

-Tells me about their mental health diagnosis pretty early on. Claims to maybe being autistic with an IQ of 130 or something. My father and brother have Asperger's, so to me the ex clearly didn't.

-I meet their friends and genuinely like the company! All pretty well-rounded people I could really have a fun conversation with.

-Ex meets my friends and does not engage. Zero. Looks at phone and only talks when spoken to. Even then, it is only a word or two. Basically asks that we not hang out with them.

-Meet their family, who I have been told has been not great (Shoved against walls, locked in rooms while the parents go out, belittled and threatened, etc), but they act like nothing is wrong. I'm on edge about meeting them. They want to see their family more.

-They meet my family, a wholesome, progressive group with no abusive history. Again, just like the friends, zero engagement. Eventually tells me that my family would never understand or appreciate me. Acts as if my sibling is the favorite child.

-Isolation is a-go, I can only hang out with their friends. With them there. A combination of full-time school and full-time work stress begins with a closing lack of support.

-I say I don't like doing a certain sexual act, and I propose a solution for it. Cue emotional outburst from them trying to guilt me about it.

-Is staying over during college breaks, and I ask for help around the apartment since they don't work and I work full-time. Am guilted when I confront them about things not being done, when chores are evenly split. Dog isn't even let outside while I'm at work, and they're at home. I worked 7-12 hour shifts.

-I like reassurance in relationships and like to check in about what my partners like about me and tell them what I like about them, and am fairly open about this need I have. Like many people, I've had episodes of depression, and reassurance helps me. Everytime I ask, they get upset that I ask and become emotional.

-I once said a sports team at the college we went to had a lot of good looking athletes, this was taken as a threat to them.

-Move in with me during summer whiIe I continue to work and have an unpaid internship, am busy 70-80 hours a week for both of these things and could really use help. Should have known better from previous stays. Only thing that changed was they worked 10 hours a week. Nothing at home being done, come home to them watching anime in pajamas. I'm doing every. Single. Chore.

-I'm paying for the food, rent and utilities. Not a dime is offered to help me with this. All trips are paid for by me.

-Moved in so much stuff. Filled my basement and bedroom with boxes they didn't even know what was inside. Talked about mutually going through our things and getting rid of duplicates. Am told that I'm being selfish and I shouldn't be bothered by their stuff.

-Become so stressed that I honestly lose my patience and begin raising my voice when heightened and throwing pillows at walls, not at them. I take ownership of that being a poor way to deal with stress. Be told that I'm abusive.

-Pet spills spices all over kitchen floor. They leave it for me when I get home, and they leave. Have a full, crying breakdown.

-Have a stress induced dream that I straight up committed suicide. Confide in them about it, that I want support, and I was told I was being too needy and that my dream wasn't their fault.

-They go visit their family without me for a long weekend.  They do no contact the whole time. They accidentally call me and I hear them trash talking me to their friends.

I'm nearing the end of my 9pm-5pm (Yes, 20 hours) work/internship shift when I get a text. This was the day they were scheduled to come back. Get told that their there with their mom to clear out their stuff and break up with me. Over text. While I'm at my internship. They tell me that I'm abusive and mentally unstable.

-At this point, this one of the only supports I have left and all the friends I had left were their friends, too. I ask for them to stay, or at least tell me in person. They tell me that they're basically threatened by me. I ask if we could try to at least be friendly, for the sake of the friend group, they say maybe. No contact again, haven't spoken since.

-I guess they almost took my dog? Heard that from a mutual friend. Thought I was abusive to him, too. Won't lie, I would have been calling the police and considering slashing tires if that happened. No one messes with my boi.

I just would like to know what people on this sub think? Like I said, it has been awhile since all this occurred and I'm in a much, much better place now. I wouldn't say that I'm angry at my ex now, I recognize that I made mistakes too, but not all of the mistakes were mine. That's life and relationships.

Thanks for your time! Stay strong."

I’ve been meaning to finally sit down and make an account to keep track of all my slutty adventures I’ll be having this summer, and I am finally doing it!

So, a little about me first: I am 19, a junior in college, and currently in a completely different state as a part of a summer internship. Lookswise I am 5’3 and 125 pounds with nice tits and a cute little ass.

As of about two and a half months ago, I had only slept with two guys my entire life. But after a breakup, I decided to finally let the slut in me soar and I have boosted that number up by a lot!

Last month I started thinking about how I wanted a regular fuck buddy over the summer — more than just a Tinder hookup, though. I wanted someone who could be much more dominant in the bedroom, who would treat me as a set of holes. 

So I made a post on r/BDSMPersonals, and after a LOT of digging and ghosting some of the more bizarre inquiries, I found the perfect guy. Despite the fact that we only see each other on the weekends due to a slight bit of distance, we are into all of the same things and he is always pushing me to be the sluttiest girl possible, plus he showed me this sub and convinced me to post on here. I guess this is also something of a success post about meeting strangers on Reddit and NOT being killed!

Now down to the part you all really want to hear — the threesome.

This was all my friend’s doing. We have discussed setting up a gang bang during the summer, and during his search he found a group of guys in my city that host regular gang bangs. He sent them my pictures and they were instantly interested.

Two of the men asked to meet me last Thursday, to make sure I am a real girl and possibly even fuck me. We meet at a bar, we start to feel comfortable with one another and they suggest we go get a room at a nearby motel. 

Both men were in their 40’s, both lawyers, and most likely both married (based on the tan line on their ring fingers). One guy later told my friend that I was the first girl he fucked that was born while he was in college.

We get into the hotel room and I could already feel how fucking wet I was, and one guy grabs me by the neck while the other strips me completely down. They put a blindfold on me and shove me onto the bed.

They run their hands all over my body, twisting a nipple here or scratching my inner thighs just because they know it’s my two biggest weaknesses. Then, one guy shoved my legs up and starting eating me out. Meanwhile, the other guy was taking pictures to send to my friend later on.

While one guy made me cum a few times with his tongue between my legs, the other stuck his cock down my throat. He was slapping my tits and telling me what a slut I was and how excited he was to fuck me.

Then, the guy who was going down on me roughly flipped me over and started fucking me as hard as he could. The guy whose cock was down my throat easily put my mouth back to use, all while taking videos of me being spitroasted for my friend to enjoy.

Then it was the other guy’s turn to fuck me. He has me on my back, with one hand around my throat while the other guy has me giving him a hand job.

The guy who was fucking me trades places with the other and makes his way over to my face. He makes me suck his cock before giving me a facial. I can feel his cum dripping down my chin when the other guy enters me and starts to fuck me harder than either one had. I couldn’t hold it anymore and I began to cum, my pussy wrapping tightly around his dick and causing him to cum also. 

We laid there for a few minutes. While this entire ordeal lasted maybe 25 minutes tops, both of them were completely exhausted after fucking my teen pussy.

My friend instructed that I not wipe their cum off my face, so I get dressed with my makeup smeared across my face, my hair a mess, and cum dripping from my chin onto my tits. 

I had to walk across the parking lot looking like a dirty fucking slut, and at least three people made a point to stare at me until I got into my car. I drove home as close to the sidewalk as possible so every time I stopped pedestrians could see what a mess I was. I parked and walked into my apartment, where my roommate stood in our kitchen and got a nice look at her cum dump of a roommate. Then I masturbated furiously as I looked through all of the pictures and videos for the rest of the night.

I hope you all enjoyed the story of my first MMF threesome! Next time the post (hopefully) won’t be quite as long, but I am sure to have a number of stories, especially with my 10+ men gang bang coming up next weekend 😏"

Well, I hate to bring up this ""power differential"" trope that some neopuritan lefty internet people tend to overapply to situations where it doesn't hold up. But there are definitely situations where it's not so easy to speak up (whether you're a man or a woman, although this gets tends to get framed almost exclusively as a women's issue). 


For example, IF the allegations against BDP are true, he allegedly had a ""taste"" for young interns who were just starting out. If you create expectations early on of ""this is normal and to be expected, and if you can't put up with it then this career isn't for you"" then that's quite a shitty part of the culture. If someone criticizes a part of Belgian culture (for example: shitty mobile internet) in hopes of changing it, then it's not always reasonable to go ""if you dislike it here so much then why don't you fuck off to another country?"" 



Independent of discussions of whether the pendulum has swung too far after MeToo, the movement itself is ostensibly all about encouraging women (and men, although they aren't in the spotlight to the same degree) to speak up about these things.

**On Tuesday night, Rep.

She distinguished herself with passionate advocacy for policies that would help as many people in her district as possible. People are desperate for resolute moral leadership, and their political energy is frequently going untapped because existing political leaders aren't providing it. In fighting Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee, they can tap it in the same way Ocasio-Cortez did, and get caught fighting. Or they can quit without trying.

8ugb50,55,2018-06-28,One year today- reflecting on a decade of alcohol abuse,prototype137,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8ugb50/one_year_today_reflecting_on_a_decade_of_alcohol/,"Today marks one year sober for me. I had meant to tell my story at 100 days, then 200. Now I figure I might as well. Wall of text incoming.

I didn't think I was an alcoholic. I was a successful student who got no DUIs or committed other crimes due to alcohol. I didn't drink \*that\* much. But my drinking was not healthy. I knew the signs at first; my mother's father died of among other things alcoholism 20 years before I was born. I lived with my grandfather who was a raging alcoholic (though he'd cut back by the time I lived with him). I heard stories of him being glassy eyed at dinner, then go up to his room and you'd hear the thud of him passing out. My father told the story of cleaning dog piss off the couch when it was actually his father's. I saw him drink glass of wine after glass, then a beer every day at 4pm. My mother's caretakers would document their time, and made note of how much he was drinking. Then he developed pulmonary fibrosis and entered hospice. He was never able to tell us how much pain he was in, my mother thought it might have been the booze. Of course as a curious teen, I snuck wine and stuff from my grandfather's boxes (they'd never know), and I remember being able to handle quite a bit and feel fine, which I knew was a risk factor for alcoholism. I was into punk at the time, and the straight-edge lifestyle appealed to me. I decided that for the history of alcoholism in my family and my experiences at home I wouldn't drink. 

I didn't drink through much of freshman year of college. I found a group of people who themselves were sober. Then I met my first serious boyfriend. I fell hard and wante d to do things with him. There wasn't really any discussion, but one day he poured me a drink and we hung out with his friends. I was responsible, and with my tolerance I often was the one who made sure all the drunk people were ok. I decided that I'd allow myself to drink in college, but I'd stop afterwards and be sober. Sophomore year me and my sober friends along with some others signed up to live on a substance-free hall. By the end of that year, I think everyone was drinking though for the most part we respected the rules of the hall. I broke up with my first boyfriend and started dating another guy who didn't drink. He had a rough home life, including a father who drank a lot. He told me if I ever drank he'd break up with me. I was fine with that, but I grew resentful that he had completely dismissed any idea of giving up meat for me (I'm vegetarian, and I didn't care if he ate meat) by saying ""but I eat it every day."" Soon it became ""Have a beer Proto, we won't tell."" 

I graduated college and entered grad school. I moved to a different city than my SO, and was excited by the freedom to have beer in my fridge without worrying about what he thought. My parents helped me move and for the first time I lived alone. The first thing I did was close all the blinds and walk around naked, haha. Second was get dressed and go to the store for booze. I got a minikeg of Heineken and probably drank half of it that first day. Over the course of the first year of school, things got difficult with my boyfriend and at times I was drinking just to spite him. I could tell that I was probably drinking too much, but it became tied to my independence. Sometimes I'd show up to teach a lab hungover and decide I wasn't going to do that again, then ended up drinking again that night. It didn't help that grad school was stressful and I wasn't happy with my decision to do it. I think this was the first time I started to lose control, and I remember being proud of myself the first night I was able to go to bed sober. 

So after a tumultuous few months, my boyfriend and I broke up (that's another story). I was devastated as at the time I thought we were going to end up married. I wasn't able to eat for a few days, but I also wasn't drinking. I think I managed to stay sober for about 4 months aside from a glass of wine at Christmas dinner. I just didn't have to prove my independence to anyone. Then it was St. Patrick's Day, and my friends and I went to a bar. People were drinking pitchers of green beer by themselves, I figured I'd join in on the fun (though I stuck to Guinness and Jameson).  I thought I was moderating well, and so I wasn't worried. 

I think I spent the next six years struggling without knowing. It was a balancing act that I always tipped. I'd have 3-4 beers on the weekend, then 6. I developed a penchent for craft beer and wanted to try everything. I'd go to the store for groceries, and since I was there I'd run by the alcohol aisle and see this craft I'd never tried. I'd drink one with dinner on a weeknight, then two. Then one day I'd be stressed out from work and endup finishing a six pack. Go in hungover the next day and promise I'd never do that again. I cut back, then gradually worked my way up again. By this time I'd entered medical school and was in my clinical years. Sometimes I'd ask my patients how much alcohol they drank, and these people with all these medical conditions would say less than I was. But it was ok, because it wasn't after college, or grad school, but I'd quit drinking when I graduated med school. From my schooling I knew I was a heavy drinker, and even had concerns when I took Tylenol for headache, but at the time I thought I was ok. 

Things got bad my fourth year of med school. Stress of applying for residencies compounded with doing audition rotations I needed to do well on. I moved in with my uncle for a while, and wouldn't you know there was a trendy bar a few doors down. It was like living the life: work all day then come home to your personal watering hole. I got to know the bartenders who would serve me their latest crafts and food as I studied. Then I'd go in the next morning and sometiems barely be able to keep my eyes open. I thought it was normal as this was a busy time, med students are supposed to be exhausted. On more than one occasion I was hungover as fuck, but I said everyone has bad days. Then one time after I'd been busy and hadn't been drinking much, I went to a workout with my workout club that I hadn't been able to see for a while. As custom we went out for a beer after the workout (we were health nuts, amirite?) and I had a liter. Then I think I had a beer at the bar on my way home waiting for the ferry. Then a big fosters on the ferry. I ended up puking all over my uncle's bathroom, but in my drunken state I thought I cleaned it up. Nope, he said it looked awful to the point of him giving his cleaner an extra $20 to clean it. I felt awful, but was able to convince him I was just feeling sick. I don't know if he believed me. My interview season was not going as I had hoped, and I was depressed, which lead to more drinking to escape I think. It was the only thing I had that kept the anxiety down. 

I made some New Years resolutions that year which included cutting back on the drinking (now that I remember, I made resolutions in 2011 and 2012 to quit entirely but obviously did not lol). For a month I did really well, maybe had 12 drinks the entire month. Then I started a rotation that ended up being a twice per week thing. All this time on my hands, no real responsibility as applications were in (just gotta pass), and I started drinking more. By March I was back to binging on weekends. I did match neurosurgery, but it was my second to last choice. I was a bit disappointed but could have been worse, so I drank quite a bit Match week in celebration (big snow storm, work was mostly cancelled that week). Now that I was matched, no worries about anything and I continued to drink quite a bit. 

After I'd finished my rotations, I had a month off. My current boyfriend and I were (and are) long distance, and I decided to spend the month with him. On some level I knew I had been really going hard the past few months and so I had planned on not drinking while I was with him, and I told him as much. That lasted a week before I went to the store and found tons of new beers and hard sodas to try. I didn't want to disappoint him, so naturally I hid my drinking from him. He'd go to work in the morning, and I'd go to the gym, study for a bit, then spend the afternoon cleaning his house and playing video games while drinking. I knew around when he'd get home, so I knew to take out the bottles or hide them in the basement. But I wasn't hiding my drinking, right? Just didn't want to disappoint him because I said I wouldn't. 

After that month, I went to stay with another uncle of mine while I searched for places to live during residency. He had an office party where he bought a lot of wine and beer. I helped out his party, and was sipping on a drink. Then I went off to read or play video games, continuing to drink. By midnight I realized that I had probably 14 beers in my room. Oops. I was pretty hungover the next day, but I thought I cleaned up and hid it well. 

I went home to my parents' house after I'd found an apt and done some onboarding stuff. Alcohol had always been a touchy subject in my house, and my brother and I never overtly let my parents know we were drinking (especially when I was underage). I figured I'd be ok to keep a six pack in the rerigerator, but when I finished it in one night my mother got on me. It was ok, I was on vacation and she mentioned that as well. So naturally I began hiding my booze again. Around this time I started feeling the weight of my alcohol use. I went to visit my old music teacher, a bit hungover. She was getting older and her health was not as good as it once was. I remember thinking ""she knew me when I was 10, what would she think of me if she knew I was hungover?"" I may have teared up a bit. I think this was the beginning of the turning point for me. 

After this I moved into my new apt. As was my tradition, after the move and everyone left I went and got a sampler pack of beer and drank in celebration. I was Skyping with my boyfriend and something came up. It was a stupid argument, but unfortuantely I was drunker than I thought I was. We got in a huge fight. In my drunken state I just wanted to let him know I wasn't happy with what he did and I just couldn't let it go. We talked the next day, I was hungover as fuck, and he told me he was very hurt. He said I was so aggressive with my anger and I called him some very nasty things. I mentioned I was hungover and he was like ""oh, so you were drunk."" This was the first thing that led to my sobriety. 

As part of my orientation we had a presentation from one of the addiction specialists about substance abuse by physicians. I dismissed it as one of the dumb things we had to do. Yeah, yeah, if your collegue shows up drunk report that shit, blah blah. Then at the end he opened up and said he wished he got help when he needed it. That kind of changed my tune. I remembered how the past few months had been, and how I dismissed it as me being without responsibility and I wouldn't do this forever. I could see I was following the path where I'd be the woman standing in front of a group of entering residents telling them my story, and I didn't want that. 

Then around the same time, I was browsing reddit and came across a post by a guy who had quit drinking a few months prior. One of the things he mentioned was that he thought he was a ""functional alcoholic"" but in the time since he quit his boss had told him that it was like he was on super mode. I thought back to all the times I probably wasn't functioning at my best, and that maybe I was kidding myself. I remembered how I was always able to run farther and faster when I hadn't been drinking. 

All of this together led me to remember what I'd said ten years ago, that one day I'd stop drinking. And I realized that now was the time. So I decided to stop that day. Then I found this interesting IPA at the store, so I said ""tomorrow."" Then I found some stout that called my name. Finally, my new program director had a picnic for the new class. I decided that I'd have alcohol if there was some, otherwise it would be day one. Sure enough, he did not serve any alcohol at his picnic. That was one year ago today. 

This past year has been great in some ways, but not amazing. I don't think I ever had strong cravings to go back to alcohol, it's just in the back of my mind. I'm sure it would be nice to be able to get a nice buzz, but I keep thinking of all the headaches and hangovers, the loss of productivity, the fatigue, and I tell myself it's better to not drink. My mood is much better, and I no longer take antidepressant substances. Waking up early is so much easier, and I get much more work done. I feel smarter as well. But there's no ""great"" feelings after the first few weeks. Once the initial relaxation and increased energy wore off, I was thinking ""is this it?"" I think this might be why it's hard to stay sober for some people. 

About a month into my sobriety, my mother texted me. She was on vacation with my family, and wanted to check in. At one point, she said she was really worried about my drinking. I had hoped to quietly quit due to the embarassment of letting myself get to the point where I thought I needed to, but I texted back ""I stopped."" She seemed so relieved. Apparently the uncles I lived with said they were concerned about how much I was drinking when I was with them. Apparently I wasn't hiding it as well as I thought. But now I don't have to do that, and it is so relieving. 

In the past year, I've heard some stories. One of my senior residents told me once that he was working a few nights, then had a day off before having clinic. He told me he'd probably be hungover in clinic. I thought that was a stupid thing to think, then I realized I could have been that person. Another time one of my attendings said he worked NYE, and the person who was supposed to come on after him apparently didn't realize he was and had done some ""partying"" the night before and was not in condition to work. I do like knowing I won't have that happen to me. And just the other weekend one of the transitional interns in our medicine program was sent to the ER with alcohol poisoning from the end of year party. They're not lying when they say physicians have a problem with substances.

8ugb6p,37,2018-06-28,It's easier to be a fucking loaf of bread than a man on OkCupid,OkCupidBreadProfile,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ugb6p/its_easier_to_be_a_fucking_loaf_of_bread_than_a/,"21M here. So, about two and a half years ago I had an allergic reaction to a facial product, which I kept using for a few weeks before I knew what was happening. This triggered some serious, like, disfiguring adult acne and shredded my self confidence. Great. In spite of this, my friends, and my own ambition helped me to focus on ignoring the severe, and later moderate adult acne I'd have for the following years. I focused my energy into working out, now I have an athletic build - nice. Then, I focused on school and trying to start a business. Business failed but I got far with it and learned a lot. Now I've got another two years of school and then I have a decent job lined up afterward - nice. After some hard core accutane, my face looks pretty good again, besides some faded hyperpigmentation. I saved my money, worked hard at a lot of part-time jobs and an internship, plus my business made some good money, so now I can afford a nice, modern apartment without debt while I finish school - nice. All of these things made me pretty fucking proud and confident. I even practiced a lot of charisma techniques and talking to people. I'm a far throw from Ryan Reynolds, but I can say with confidence that I'm a far throw from being ugly or socially awkward any more.

So, after years of disfiguring acne, I felt like I'd finally built up enough confidence to get back in to having sex, having relationships, and all that other jazz. I'd missed practically all of that since I was 18 because significant adult acne looks fucking awful. So I got some photos done by a professional. Post them on Facebook, a lot of my friends are telling me I look amazing, hot, great. So I open up my OkCupid profile. This is where things go downward.

On OkC I've received \~22 likes over the past three weeks. Most of these likes are from girls I didn't even find particularly attractive - not setting standards high, but they had significant features/behaviour I found unattractive. Nevertheless, I figured I'd try to talk to all of them anyway, conversation never hurts! Of my 22 matches, only 9 even responded. 3 of these conversations ghosted me a few lines in. Of the remaining 6, several of them felt like I was doing the conversational heavy lifting. I'd make a quip, they'd respond ""ahaha"". I'd share a story, they'd respond with one sentence. Of all 22 matches, there was only one who I REALLY liked. After four days of back and forth, I asked her to coffee. But the day we were supposed to get coffee, she ignored my messages. I went to the coffee shop myself with futile hopes there was some miscommunication - but noooope, she was just ignoring me. It really fucking sucks to be stood up on your first date in almost three years.

Two days ago, I decided to open a fake OkC account as a girl to match my main account with, and get the other side's perspective. This was a test account, and I didn't want to use a real girl's face on a 'romantic' website, even if it was a stock image. So I used a stock image of a loaf of bread as my profile picture. The bread's name is Claire. She is 21 years old. In less than 48 hours, Claire has accumulated 153 likes on OkC.

I'd laugh if I didn't want to cry lol. It seriously is depressing. I feel like I spent 2 and a half years being guided by the 'work on yourself' mentality, fantasizing about how I'd finally jump back into the relationship world to grand applause - or at least a single date. But here I am, and nobody gives a shit what my story, or my effort is. I feel pretty objectified, being one of perhaps hundreds of guys any girl (or loaf of bread) will match with. Lord knows if I'm the only guy, or the fifth guy she's talking to at any given time. All the unanswered likes, all the conversations where I'm supposed to entertain the girl to get a few words of her attention, all the times I've gotten my hopes up and had them torn down. I feel eviscerated right now, and I feel like it would just be easier to try traditional dating at the bar. On the bright side, Claire seems to be getting a lot of potential suitors.

I've been using Tinder for a week now, and the results appear to be shaping up to be similar.

**TL;DR**, **my fake female account that was a picture of a loaf of bread got over 7 times more likes in 48 hours than my main, male account did in 3 weeks. This is after I spent 2.5 years focusing on improving my looks, my physique, my job prospects, and my savings. But as soon as I step into a dating app, I'm treated like less than shit, or at least less than a loaf of bread.**"

8ugek3,3,2018-06-28,"Inner conflict, and NParents want to meet my boyfriend.",own_person,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8ugek3/inner_conflict_and_nparents_want_to_meet_my/,"Sorry, this turned out longer than expected. The conflict that I’m describing didn’t seem to make sense without writing bits of the history and insecurity that it involved.

I have been reading this subreddit for about two years now. It’s really helped me to read about the experiences of others, because it’s made me finally question whether my NParents’ behaviors, which I had to rationalize for years, were really right.

Still, I have the same internal struggle that I’ve always had.

Am I really being gaslighted, or am I as forgetful or as deceitful as my mom says I am? Are my memories of events that she denies even real? Do I have a right to be angry for all the emotional abuse that I do trust myself to remember correctly? I have suffered from chronic depression since around 6 or 7 years old, which I have only made major progress on in the last year. I really feel that it had to do with these things. Mom blames it on military lifestyle of moving around every 2-3 years, but I don’t think it was just that.

My parents in general took care of me materially, which I am grateful for. I did make it into college (because it happened to be aligned with what they wanted me to do.), so at least now I am able to work towards a better life, that I choose for myself. Neither of my parents are nurturing people, however, so any bit of emotional intelligence that I have gained has been the result of my own healing process (online self-help, writing, taking advantage of free temporary counseling on my campus, etc.). I felt like I made a lot of progress towards physical, emotional and mental freedom while away at college.

I am currently home from college for the summer quarter, since I unfortunately am not independent yet. It has been pure torture. I do notice changes in our relationship due to my finally laying down some soft boundaries, but otherwise, I feel so entirely helpless and worthless again. It’s amplified because now my NGrandma, the one who gave my mom all those behaviors, is also around.

After all the years of my childhood, and finally gaining the courage to stand up for myself in an abusive friendship that lasted nearly seven years about a year ago, I didn’t think I would be able to invest myself emotionally in someone again. But, as I spent time this school year working on myself and working towards the life I want, I met my current partner, who I have a great deal of trust in. I feel cared for, genuinely listened to and downright respected by him. He and I communicate very openly about every aspect of the relationship we have and it’s the most satisfying thing.

But, today, my mom asked when she was going to meet him. I ended up telling her about him because for him that as a demonstration of how serious I am about our relationship . And, I think, the part of me that feels like I am wrong to be upset about anything my parents have done, wanted me to keep acting like everything is normal between us. Like I’m in the wrong, and I should just shut up and be obedient.

It’s my birthday in a few days and they’re asking if he wants to meet up for lunch that day, since they haven’t met him and we haven’t seen each other for a few weeks. He’s busy with an internship and I’m busy jobhunting.

I’m so afraid of that meeting for some reason.

I know that they’re not going to be mean to him or anything. Of course they will want to put up the same facade they always put up with people.

What I’m worried about is that I won’t be able to be myself. When I’m with him I feel safe, but around my parents I’m a shell of myself, always on guard. I don’t know if I would even be able to smile at him, or hug him, or any of the simple things that feel so easy when we’re together that used to terrify me before. I’m afraid he’ll be so confused about why I’m so different if that happens. We have very briefly spoken about how my relationship with my parents isn’t the best, but I don’t think I am ready yet to explain to him the level of control that they have exerted over my life and my self. The level of control that in the past year I have tried so, so hard to grow out of but I know won’t be fully free of until I have at least had more professional therapy.

I’m also worried that they’ll also sabotage me in some way with him. This has happened before. I had a cousin reach out to me and we bonded over our mutual interest in computers. My mom made sure say mean things about me to both him and his wife. I thought I was doing her a favor by not being around. But it seemed more like she just hated that I had a good bond with somebody.

I almost feel like I need to explain everything to him. I feel that he would listen and try to genuinely understand and accept me, but I’m still afraid that he will be overwhelmed by the emotional baggage that I seem to have. We’ve been open about these things too, about what has hurt us and what we’re working on and how we’re trying to be better. But I still feel like I need to hide my family’s other side from people. Though, that may be due to my mother’s threats in the past of bodily harm if I ever ran away, or “talked shit about her” to anyone.

I actually am going to see him tomorrow, before an important meeting, for about 15 minutes. I have already asked him if he wants to meet for lunch this weekend, and that my parents want to meet him. I wish that I had some concise, clear way of expressing my inner conflict that didn’t stress him out more than the thought of meeting my parents already is. I think I want to tell him that I would like to discuss it with him, but I also don’t want to be depressing when we literally have only 15 minutes together, alone, after three weeks apart.

TL;DR NParents want to meet my boyfriend, which I want because I’m not sure if I want to go NC, but also am pretty nervous about.  Part cathartic release, part asking for advice.

Does this resonate with anyone? Does anyone have a similar experience to share? What the actual hell can I do to deal with this. Thank you for your time.

Edit:

I took a mix of everyone's advice and gave him a brief rundown of my feelings. I asked him if he was ready to run for the hills. He said yes, but only if I was on the other side. I guess it went well."
8ughwa,93,2018-06-28,A Beginner’s Guide to joining the Blue Wave,Watchdogs66,BlueMidterm2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueMidterm2018/comments/8ughwa/a_beginners_guide_to_joining_the_blue_wave/,"Hello Everyone. Recently (especially due to the Kennedy retirement) there has been much questioning on the best way to contribute to the blue wave. If you are reading this, congratulations! Know that we will do everything we can to get you to “all cylinders firing” in our drive to retake our country!  

The first thing to understand is that opportunities exist for everyone to contribute to the blue wave, but will be different for each of you. Every state needs a different strategy, due to the unique demographic/political environment. What will attract needed voters in Massachusetts won't work if applied to outreach efforts in Utah, for instance. Location matters greatly when developing a ""blue wave"" strategy. While much attention is placed on the House and the Senate, there's also attention on state legislative offices, school boards, and other elected positions. Knowing which congressional district you live in is a start, as well as who your senators are.  

https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative  

The above link locates which congressional district you are in, which will always be on the ballot on November.  

Every state has a different site to find out which local state house (or assembly) or senate districts you live in. If you do not know where to find it, then you can also use the following link to identify your districts.  

https://ballotpedia.org/Who_represents_me%3F  
Important note: You don't have to enter an email address on this site, as the tool will still work if that field is left blank.

Also pay attention to any city council, or other local elections that are occurring in your area. Make note of any seats that can be flipped there.  

If any of your districts are red, consider Sister District, which is one of the best resources on flipping those red state legislative seats:  
https://www.sisterdistrict.com 

Flippable is another resource for this end:  
https://www.flippable.org

Once you know who your legislative leaders are, call them! Do not email them where your emails can be easily ignored! Leave messages if they don’t answer and/or talk to the interns. Be firm and resolute, but do NOT use vulgar language. Double emphasis if they are Republican. If any of your legislative leaders have any scheduled town halls in the future, ATTEND THEM. If any of your leaders are hard-line conservatives, the following link is a good resource to get them on the same wavelength:  

https://crooked.com/podcast-series/majority-54/  

If any of your representatives/senators are Republican, contact the campaign of the Democratic challenger if your state’s primaries have already happened. Every campaign should have a link to volunteer/donate! Find out if they are needing extra people in ANYTHING. Vote in the near future if they have not. If you live in a solid blue district, then Swing Left will locate the nearest red district for you, and you can get started there:  
https://swingleft.org   

In particular, the Senate Races in these eight states warrant heavy attention, as it is widely known that control of the Senate will depend on victories there. If you live in ANY of these states, I strongly suggest you volunteer or donate to the Dem candidate there:  

Indiana: Joe Donnelly  
Website: https://joeforindiana.com/  

North Dakota: Heidi Heitkamp  
Website: https://heidifornorthdakota.com/  

Florida: Bill Nelson

Nevada: Jacky Rosen  
Website: https://www.rosenfornevada.com/  

West Virginia: Joe Manchin  
Website: https://joemanchinwv.com/  

Now that you've established a sufficient knowledge of the local political scene, the next step is to register to vote if you have not done so already! And make sure that everyone you know (friends, acquaintances, etc.) is registered as well! The following links provide you with everything you need to accomplish this:

Need help getting to the polls? No problem! If you also can take people to the polls, then you might want to consider volunteering!  
https://carpoolvote.com  

Outside of the United States? Also not a problem! Visit the following website:  
https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/vote/home.htm  

Even if you are already registered, **verify your registration!** This is easily done through the following link:

If your registration has disappeared for some reason, then use the following registration tool provided by the following link:

**If you require a customized strategy, then post which districts you live in and we will most likely be able to give you a proper direction!** Also look at this subreddit’s right pane for important and helpful links to maximize your efforts!  

Good luck everyone, and hopefully we can focus our fire on where we need it.

8ugt7c,22,2018-06-28,Jurassic World - Evolution of Claire - Book Highlights and Overview,ItsFromMars,JurassicPark,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/8ugt7c/jurassic_world_evolution_of_claire_book/,"Hi all!  

I just finished reading through the new Jurassic World novel that expands the film universe a bit that was released yesterday, titled **Jurassic World - The Evolution of Claire.**   

I figured I would write a little summary on lore-bits for those who might be interested in those sorts of things, but not necessarily interested in reading the book.   

So, to start, I'd like to say **I personally do not think this book is required reading for Jurassic Park fans.** I can recommend it to those who want a fun side story that expands on a few key characters in the Jurassic World movies as well as shows a little bit of the world in the couple of years before Jurassic World opens. It is also important to note that this is a **young-adult novel**, and the tone and writing style reflects that. If any of that strikes your fancy, by all means, give the book a shot. It's a quick read for sure.  Do not go in expecting to read a Michael Crichton novel.      



**---Highlights!---**   

**-Isla Sorna:** I begin with what is likely going to be the one topic people might be interested in when reading this book: further background into Isla Sorna post-JPIII and into Jurassic World and how it fits into current film canon. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot here that hasn't been stated before. In the book, it's stated that Masrani is slowly moving individual dinosaur species from Isla Sorna to Isla Nublar to streamline species' integration into their respective habitats. Other than that, there isn't much said. Claire (our protagonist and narrator in the book) does make mention that Masrani has been extremely hush on details given to the public since the announcement of Jurassic World, and it makes her suspicious of exactly why. No mention on what exactly is happening on the island itself in terms of ecosystem and population. Lastly, there is mention of the San Diego Incident a couple of times in the book, mainly to establish that the incident was indeed the first time a living dinosaur had been revealed to the public and the event had a huge effect on large portion of the population.  

**-Claire Dearing:** One of the main protagonists of the Jurassic World films is given the spotlight here, which means a bit more character background, depth, and development. Her arc in the book is essentially showing that from the beginning she's always had a soft spot for animals (to help connect to Fallen Kingdom) as she even once had ambitions to become a veterinarian, but eventually went into Political Sciences. She is accepted to be an intern for Masrani at the currently under-development Jurassic World. She uncovers a mystery dealing with a first failed round of interns that came to the island that was seemingly covered up by Masrani after some tragic event occured. By the end of the book, the events on Isla Nublar harden her to the point where we see the beginning of her development into where we meet her at the beginning of the first Jurassic World. Not too much new information is given, other than a short-lived (literally) love interest as well as her relationships with both Masrani and Dr. Wu given a bit more depth.  She ends the book essentially accepting a job offer from Simon Masrani to help run Jurassic World. 

**-Dr. Wu:** Easily one of my biggest highlights of the book is the extra depth given to Dr. Henry Wu's character. He, at first, seems very atagonistic and stubborn (much how we see him in Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom) but eventually starts to open up a bit to Claire in the final chapters of the book. He's portrayed as someone who's simply extremely dedicated to his craft and his career and takes every opportunity he can get to advance his practice further, but he doesn't seem to be doing it for malicious intent. He says a particularly potent line that perfectly reflects his character in the final couple chapters.    

""The island takes, yes. But it gives too. That is nature, Claire. That is Life""...""You move forward. Step by step. Some days it is hard. But the more days you put behind you, the easier it gets. The more you learn about what it is to have a calling. To do work that is *more* than just you or your colleagues.""...""We take precautions. We have protocols and weaponry and drills. But sometimes mistakes happen. That is what it means to be human.""    

**-Simon Masrani:** I don't have too much to say about Mr. Masrani, but seeing his character expanded on in the story was great and further cemented him as an extremely likable character in Jurassic World.  

**-Jurassic World's Operations:** Even though the book takes place roughly a year before the opening of Jurassic World, you get to see a ton of the nitty gritty in terms of how the park operates that hasn't been seen in quite this much detail before in a Jurassic movie. If you are interested in talk about the dinos' health, gyroscope calibration and safety, development of unique medical techniques to use on the dinosaurs, species integration and more, then chances are you might enjoy this book. I for one found all of this extra detail extremely interesting for the most part.     

**-Rexy:** Yup. The characters call her Rexy in the story. I didn't mind it so much but I know some people despise the name that has been given to her over the years.   

So, this might be unfortunate to some, but that's about it in terms of ""lore"" expansion. Most of it is really just dealing with increasing character depth for a couple of key characters in the series. But if any of what I mentioned up above sounds like it might be of interest, by all means give it a shot. Like I said before, I do not think this should be considered required reading for most Jurassic Park fans as it doesn't expand on a whole lot of what is already established in-canon. I enjoyed it for what it was, which is a YA Novel taking place within the Jurassic Park/World universe that adds some interesting character background and depth for Claire Dearing and Dr. Henry Wu.

8ugt95,2,2018-06-28,[Futa4F/M] Celebrities with something extra,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8ugt95/futa4fm_celebrities_with_something_extra/,"**I'm an adult looking for another adult for a complete fantasy rp**

'ello there!

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this little post of mine, I hope that you'll find something that interests you in it!

First time writing a post here on reddit so might not be the best! You have been warned.

**One liners will be ignored. Put some effort into it like I did with this post.**

Quick Edit: I'd also be very open to playing rule34 styled things as well. Like Arya stark or Daenarys Targarean in the GoT universe and such!

So, I'll fully admit that I'm a very big fan of celebrities and the status that they hold in the eyes of many 'normal' people. I'm also a big fan of futanari/shemales who's packing big piece of swinging meat between their legs. So I thought, why not pair those two things together and made a RP post about it?

Needless to say, I'm looking to play some very well endowed celebrities (internet celebs included, like youtubers!) who gets into all kinds of lewd and naughty fun with people that they meet and work with. While I am primarily looking for female partners, I am very much open to partners who plays feminine boys as well.

Please be literate, detailed and be able to write decent amounts of text. I'm a multi-paragraph rper myself.

Some ideas to get the thoughts rolling, but keep in mind I'd be more than happy to hear any other ideas as well.

Personal Assistant: You're a personal assistant to the stars, you get to meet all the most famous and hot actresses and singers. All from the women from the all too popular Game of Thrones series to singers like Rihanna and Taylor swift. You get to follow them to the nicest locations, to the best resorts, to their own getaways and houses scattered across the world. Of course your job is to keep them happy, to get them the food they want, the entertainment they want, the clothes they want, the alcohol the they and so on. But since you're in such a high paying job and getting very nice bonuses because of it.. Well.. You have to take care of their other needs, any time, any where.

Comic Con meet up (works with any Con really): A con is always a good place to get the chance to meet some celebs, maybe they're doing a meet and greet, maybe they're doing a bit of autograph signing, maybe they're just nerds that wants to enjoy it like a normal person? Whatever the reason, you get to meet the celeb(s) of your dream! Maybe you met them after a Q&amp;A where they thought you were cute when you fumbled with your question, maybe you met them back at the hotel. You couldn't quite remember, but here you are regardless.. What luck, eh?

Co-worker: Being an up and coming young individual in the industry can be daunting to say the least. There's always someone that's more important than you, always someone who knows more than you, always someone that can get you fired with one phone call just around the corner when you're running with that hot coffee in your hand. Needless to say, you have to be careful. But at the same time it's a fantastic opportunity! Maybe you get to know your more famous co-star privately? Maybe you want to make that sex scene just look that more real? Maybe you actually did make some enemies and are trying to make up for it?

Intern: Let's face it, being an intern sucks. You always have to go get food and coffee for stuck up producers and even just to the people one step higher than you on the company ladder. But it's not all bad. You still get to meet plenty of beautiful famous people. Perhaps you see this as an opportunity to get close to them? Befriend them? Use them to maybe make your life a bit easier?.. Or maybe you simply end up as their toy when they find out you're really underage?

While I hate to do this, please write Big Dick Celeb in the title of your message to let me know you've read this far. Silly I know but best I could come up with!

So there's 4 quick little prompts, nothing fancy but it's better than nothing. Like I said, I'd be more than happy to hear out any other ideas as well, so don't be shy! I'm down for pretty much everything, from them being complete strangers to friends to family members to being married!

Here's a list over celebrities that I enjoy playing: Emilia Clarke, Ronda Rousey, Daisy Ridley, Dodger/presshearttocontinue, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Emma Watson, Pokimane, Avril Lavigne, Shakira, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Emma stone, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Amy Adams, Alexa Bliss, AJ Lee, Paige, Sasha Banks, Becky Lynch, Eva Marie, Emma Stone, Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman, Ariel Winter, Gal Gadot, Christina Hendricks, Sarah Hyland, Alyson Hannigan, Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Zooey Deschanel.

I have a handy kinklist right over here [https://i.imgur.com/1YJX4kD.png](https://i.imgur.com/1YJX4kD.png)

I follow the prime directive to the T, practically. I’m looking to beat a 0.01% interest rate on my savings (i literally get 1 cent deposits on an account with 6k+ in it at all times.. it's horrible). The options I’m looking at right now: 

* Ally High Yield CD, 5 year (2.65% APY)
* Capital One 360, 5 year (2.90% APY)

My goal is to buy a place to live ASAP out of college, so that’s why I’m looking at CDs. 

Questions
For the CD, can I just continually deposit/buy more? I want to put in $50-150 monthly.
How do I pick between the two banks? Capital One has a higher rate but Ally has more rapport on this sub.
Can I put gained interest directly back into the CD?

Potential Results

1. $8k principal, 5 years at 2.9%, $50 contributed a month = **$12,450**

2. $8k principal, 5 years at 2.65%, $50 contributed a month = **$12,320**

3. $10k principal, 5 years at 2.9%, $50 contributed a month = **$14,750**

4. $10k principal, 5 years at 2.65%, $50 contributed a month = **$14,600**

I really really like these results, as they’d be awesome for a down payment. Also, as I move through my college years my intern pay will increase. Your thoughts?

I .. am just looking for a fight. And I feel bad, because my bf is getting the brunt of it.. because he's the one that's there.

I'm just so mad.

I started out today in such a great mood. I was going to go car shopping! For the first time ever! ... and then my mom decided she didn't want to go.

And then I found out the pc shop is charging me $40 just for diagnosing my pc, after I had been told (by an intern) that it would be free.

And then I had a conversation with my dad about my mom, and found out some things that I don't want to go into, but.. they are things that really made me mad.

And then I got a letter, not *from* SSA.. from another government area.. but it says, in the letter, that my SSI Federal and State payments have stopped, and I am losing my food stamps, and my medical insurance.

And .. I cried, for a long time. I *just got approved* in May. I have received exactly 1 check from SSA. Now this? I fought this shit.. to get approved.. for almost 10 years. Now they just want to take it away? Again, the letter was not from SSA itself, so I have.. no answers. Maybe it's a mistake. I don't know. I called my attorney but by the time I got the letter it was almost 7 pm, so.. I just left a message.

I seriously considered swallowing an entire bottle of pills, tonight, because.. I just can't do this anymore. I can't continue this fight.

And then.. I went into my parents room, and my mom asked me what ""LGBT"" stands for, and I tell her, and she says ""Oh okay, that's cool, it's in this article about LGBT Marvel characters.. there are a few, but more are coming?"" and I say ""Oh, cool. Deadpool is pansexual.""

And there is a brief discussion over what ""pansexual"" means, and my mom is just nodding and listening, and trying to understand, and my dad is just *scowling* at me. 

""How do you know? You don't read the comics."" He's right. I have only ever read one Deadpool comic in my entire life. But I tell him, I don't need to read the comics - the information is online. It's been a huge topic for a while now. I have read many bits of comics, showing Deadpool admitting attraction to Thor and flirting with Spider-Man, and the fact that DP's creator himself has said DP's sexuality is fluid (in more words).

""But he's only ever *been* with women."" You know, I suppose that's true - but that doesn't make him any less queer. I didn't say that part, to my dad, I just shrugged.

My dad continued to scowl. So I came back to my room, and I mentioned to a friend about how my dad reacted when I said that Deadpool was an LGBT character, because.. I was mad, and hurt.

And this friend responds with:

""Wot

How

Not that I really care, cause deadpool is shit

But how is it lgbt?""

And I don't know, maybe this friend really had no idea, maybe they were just curious, but it hit a switch in my brain, and it really pissed me off. I mean I was already mad, but now .. super pissed.

I hate being mad, but right now - while mad - I hate who I am when I'm not mad. I'm too fucking nice. I don't know how to say ""no"". I don't know how to stand up for myself.

But when I'm mad like this, too... I blow up at everything. Which I also don't like.

I guess I just don't like *me*, period. But I hate the world even more."

I'm 25yo from Portugal with a bachelor's degree (3 years) and a post graduation (unfinished Master's with all courses finished, 2 years, 270/300 ECTS) in Electrical Engineering, considering moving to Canada to look for new opportunities. I already have some work experience as well, as I took part of a 9-month internship in my field of study.

I have been investigating the Canadian Immigration process and have some doubts about what's the correct way to proceed.

Should I start by looking for a job while overseas, and with a valid offer apply to the Express Entry program?

Should I first start with the immigration process, starting my Express Entry application and then start looking for a job?

Or, should I simply move to Canada with an eTA, find a temporary or permanent job to cover cost of living, get an open work permit and later start my Express Entry application?

Or maybe another option I haven't considered.

Thanks in advance!"

8uizu5,3,2018-06-28,My inner struggles,childmelancolia,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8uizu5/my_inner_struggles/," Hello. This is my first post. I’m a 31 years old man from Brazil. Yeah, people here do behave in real life as they do on the internet. I ask your patience if you desire to read all this. My english is no good and I'm writing from my phone; this post ended up being way too big. I'd never talked to anyone about all of this, so forgive me if it's too confusing. Please take my hand as I review my pathetic story; I'm not sure if I want help or just to vent.

I remember feeling down as a little boy. For no reason, when I was alone, I would think about the future and despair. The fact that my father was an abusive alcoholic probably didn't help. Back then, my mother would send me to sleep at around 10 PM. My father would already be in bed by then and my mother would stay up watching the soap opera (you'd think soccer is our national sport, nope, watching soap operas is the main pass time here). I would lay in my bed waiting for it: my father would wake up, go to the bathroom, then to the living room, where my poor mother was, and would say horrible things to her. For no reason. Then he would go back to sleep. That happened every night and kept me awake for hours, terrified. I sometimes would get up and go hug her, but I didn't want her to worry about me. Only many years later I would realize that my father was a drunk.

My mother eventualy divorced my father. We moved to another town and, for the first time in my life, I had peace; I could sleep. I was 11 by then and had to change schools. Oh boy, that sucked. Hard. 

Until then, although we were under constant pressure because of my father's behaviour, me and my mother had always been together, but now she had to work to support us. Being away from her and just thinking about her hardships while I was at school made me cry all the time. I distinctly remember being shown no empathy from my teachers and colleagues. Of course I was bullied; I was extremely shy back then.

My mother raised me by herself. She made sure I always had what I needed. She was a very protective mother and wouldn't let me do any chores around the house or even ask me to buy stuff. I believe this helped shaping me into a socially inept individual. Still, I owe everything to my mother.

I often find myself in positions where I don't know how to react. I make mistakes, only to chastise myself later for failing to act appropriately.

I finished high school with no social life whatsoever. I had a few friends, but when they started to go out and partying and drinking, I started to distance myself from them. I don't drink and I don't like to go to parties. Even surrounded by people, I always feel alone.

I then got into college. Luckily, there was a public one in the same town I live (public colleges are the best and most sought after in Brazil; one needs to pass a test to be accepted).

When I started college, was when I first realized that I suffer from anxiety and depression. What I felt back when I started school after my parents divorced, that crippling despair, came back much stronger. I had a very bad first year. Eventually, after almost dropping out, I think I got used to it and was able to graduate. I believe I become extremely distressed every time a change happens in my life. I have a very hard time getting out of my comfort zone.

Then 25 and finally a Civil Engineer, I had to find a job. I quickly got one right here, on the same town, thanks to a contact I made as an intern. I was elated for, at last, being able to pay the bills and help my mom become bebt free. 

It all went downhill again, as I found myself, for the third time, severy depressed. Having to work all day and answering to people made me real uncomfortable. The situation didn't improve this time; I wouldn't get better. I couldn’t concentrate on the job and would cry all the time at home. I didn’t want to work. With help from my mother and from her cousin, a psychologist, I started taking venlafaxine. That really helped me, as I was able to concentrate. I stopped crying and slowly got used to working there. I started to think that I was actually good at what I was doing and that I belonged.

It wasn’t until my second year working at that place that I realized something was wrong. For starters, they nevet came through with their promise of paying what a Civil Engineer (by law) should receive. They also refused to let me do some things and to become more involved with the operation. The lack of information made by job much harder; the other employees, all part of the owners’s family or circle of friends, would mock me for no apparent reason. I had to work with a group of fat, frustrated women who would harass me whenever no one else was around. I also learned about some shady businesses by them. I needed out bad.

On my second year as a blue collar worker, the opportunity to change my life presented itself: a government job, of couse, right here in my town. I actually was approved after taking the test. There wasn’t a known number of people they woule call up, so I had to wait up to four years. That was in 2014. A year later, after taking way too much shit from my boss and with faith that I would land that job as a civil servant, I quit. I remember coming home and, with tears in my eyes, telling my mom I couldn’t take it anymore. I also sued my former employer (because I’d been severily underpaid), more out of anger and a desire for revenge than for justice or greed. I didn’t need money: I’d saved up and I would, sooner or later, be called to take the government job.

So I spent the last three years waiting. I don’t have friends, so I mostly stayed at home. I would occasionaly go to the gym. I actually improved my eating habits, I’m healthier than I have ever been. I also played video games, watched TV and did nothing even remotely close to working. Then, this month, the deadline expired: my dream job, the one I blindly believed in, was gone. No future for me. No connections to get another job. No desire to move forward. Nothing. My only hope now is to get the money from the lawsuit, which I already won, and, by putting all of it in a bank, I might be able to get a little monthly income from now on.

These past few years were mentaly tough, as well. I broke down many times, out of fear that I wouldn’t be called to take the job, what ultimately happened. Right now, I’m thinking about going back to college and try to get a major; I have no desire, though. It’s to keep me occupied so my mom won’t be as worried about me. If it wasn’t for her, I would probably either jump to death (have a few certain-death locations mapped out) or become a hikikomori.

To look back and realize that I threw away three years over a lie, a dumb belief, is so frustrating. I have the horrible habit of comparing myself to others and today I decided to search, on social media, for some of my former colleagues, who graduated with me. Damn, they all seem to have done well. While I understand they worked for it and deserve it, I can’t help but feel envy; I wish I could experience success. Do the things they do, like travel, even though I don’t really want to. But because they do, I feel like I should, too.

I wish I knew how to make friends. How to get a girlfriend. How to find a job. I know it sounds like a joke, but I lived until now like I was on auto-pilot. Now that my plans failed, I don’t know what to do. What I want to do. What I can do.

Over the last years, I felt angry all the time. Frustrated because I didn’t react to the abuse I suffered many times throughout my life. I would plan how I would get back at my “enemies”. When the news that my job was gone arived, all that vanished. I don’t care about revenge anymore. On the past few days, I’ve read about mindfulness. I tend to get lost in delusions, so I think it might be useful; and also to keep my anxiety at bay, since the uncertanty of my current situation doesn’t help my mental health. If someone can comment on anything of this wall of text, please do. I hope you could understand it, I know I’m all over the place. Did I ruin my life by doing nothing for three years? Is my professional carreer over? Any idea on how I can meet people? Everything you have to say, I'll consider, even your silence.

Thank you."

(25F with Nmom)",algoreical,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8ukc4k/i_wish_youd_spend_more_time_with_me_before_i_die/,"...those were the first words out of my mother's mouth when I told her that my FH and I were going to get engaged. She is 50 and in perfectly good health.

I never really considered that my mom might be a narcissist, but I think all the signs are there? I'm new here, recommended by a friend.

The reason I never saw my parents as narcissists is that I had a pretty good childhood. I suffered abuse at the hands of other relatives, and I always felt that my parents were there to protect me. Everything changed when I went away to college.

I had won a full tuition scholarship to a school all the way across the U.S., and they guilt tripped me about it for months until the last day, when I decided not to go. I basically stayed at home and spent a year at a liberal arts college nearby, then transferred to a school in Boston, about an hour flight away.

Despite being much closer to home, my mother was STILL upset. I went to one of the top schools in the country, always brought home As and Bs, and generally was pretty happy and successful. Not once did my mom visit me at school. My dad technically came to my school to pick up or drop off my stuff as necessary, but he never really came down to just hang out, either.

Every time I experienced some form of success that kept me away from home, my mother was resentful. I spent a summer working a customer service job at home just for the sake of being close to them, and I hated it. The next year, I got a summer internship in Congress AND won a fellowship to pay for it, which was important because my parents had very little money and it meant I was self-sufficient. She expressed some pride in me, but I definitely heard a bit of resentment that I wasn't going to be spending the summer at home.

When I was graduating in 2015, I was one of the first people I knew from my class to get a job offer at an amazing company in DC. My parents were really upset that I wasn't going to be moving back home.

Now, I felt particularly bad for my mom that year because she suffered a workplace injury and received very little in the way of care, just physical therapy instead of the surgery she should have had. She still works, but has chronic neck pain because of it.

When I graduated from college, my parents *promised* that they would be there for months and then decided the day before that my mom shouldn't go because of her neck. My grandma (Dad's mom) had actually saved up and traveled to spend grad weekend with me, and my dad showed up by himself, interrupting a special dinner we planned out. He was angry that we were at dinner instead of waiting for him to show up so he could pack my stuff.

Dad complained about stomach pain that whole day and then bailed as soon as I let him, missing my graduation. The stomach pain magically disappeared when he got home.

Around that time, I was so angry that I promised myself I would cut myself off from them. However, I had a month at their house between graduation and the big move to DC, so things softened between then.

I really should have stood my ground. As soon as I moved to DC, my dad was laid off from his job, which turned into a long road of me ""loaning"" my folks money. I have given them somewhere between $8K and $10K since 2015. He's currently working, but not with the same hours or salary that he used to have. All my parents do is fight and complain about money. I can spend time with my dad and have it be generally warm and fun, but most conversations with my mother are centered on how hard she works and how bad she has it.

I recently moved to NYC and make a decent salary, but I realized I need to cut back because I wanted to save up for my wedding (and, you know, for the sake of having savings). Giving money to my parents has been OK, except that I'm living more frugally than I need to.

My parents asked for $2000 for a down payment on a car because they want to exchange theirs, but it's a perfectly good car...I had to put my foot down and say no, and my mom treated me like I'm selfish, and that I'm ""not making enough money and should ask for a raise."" I am totally making enough money where I am in my current job. It's just that all of these financial gifts set me back substantially.

While I was in DC, I met the love of my life and we began a long distance relationship (DC-&gt;NYC). My mom started to resent the fact that I was taking the train up to NYC once a month and ""only"" visiting my parents every 3 months. I keep inviting my parents to come visit us in NYC (it's about 6 hours by car, 45 mins by plane) and offering to pay for tickets or gas, but they're always busy working and ""can't get days off."" Somehow they always manage to get time off when I'm visiting them, though...

My parents don't yet know that my FH and I are engaged, but they know it's supposedly coming down the line soon. I am really happy about the relationship, but starting to dread the public engagement. FH and I are really close with his family because they all live here and are supportive people. My parents have literally never visited me, but they always whine about how we spend so much time with FH's parents. I know my folks don't have much money, but I really want them to do something nice for us when we get engaged, like a little party. Even just something simple, like a weekend visit. I feel like it's not going to happen.

This feels largely incoherent on my end but I just wanted to vent here. Does this sound narcissistic? Does anyone have any advice or similar stories here? I feel that I am trying my best and I've never been a better daughter to them, but my mom in particular doesn't appreciate it..."

I got out of my narc's household about 3.5 years ago when I left for college. I thought that I was doing well at college, and that I didn't really have any significant triggers/remnants of abuse left. 
However, in my internship this summer I've noticed that I fear both of my managers like I used to fear my parents: I fear messing up, I fear when my manager chastises me if I make a mistake, etc. 

I've also noticed that I reverted back to my ""walking on eggshells"" mode when my manager chastised me today.

You were the shining example of an attractive, successful co-ed in college. The girl who balanced school, a social life, and all the other millions of things you got involved in. The college student who wasn’t against a fun night out for drinks or at the club every once in a while, but also studious and dedicated to her studies and future first and foremost. The lady who loved the proactive crop tops and skintight leggings, but looked stunning in a professional suit or simple blouse and business casual skirt.

That all changed junior year...you were usually so careful, but one night out with your friends, a few too many drinks, so many guys, and...well.

Boom. Babytown. Population: you.

You knew this would possibly end your career expectations, but against the advice of most friends and family, you decided to keep it. You managed to finish your semester, just barely, before having to take time off. And when you were secure enough to go back to school, it was mostly night and online classes. Still, you didn’t regret the decision for a moment. You gave birth to a beautiful, healthy boy, as sweet, smart, and kind as you.

And against all odds, your career didn’t turn purely into “single mom.” It took several years longer than most, but you finished your degree, chipping away at it credit by credit. A degree let you fit in an underpaid internship amongst the several minimum wage jobs that barely kept you and your boy afloat. An internship that soon turned into a solid position with benefits, letting you trade in the waitressing and hotel desk jobs for a real career. Which led to an MBA...before you knew it, you were head of HR at a fairly large company just shy of your mid 30s. You were as well-off if not better than most of your peers.

Yet...you always sighed at what you missed out on. You said you wouldn’t trade having a kid for the world - which was true. But those long days and nights of constant work, little sleep, trying to balance everything...it was stressful. Your friends all drifted off with their own lives, you barely a ghost not included in any yearbooks or reunions. Dating was a non-starter - even with your well-paying position, age and a child were hurdles in today’s dating culture. You just wished you could let your hair back again and relax...

Your chance seemed to come. You received an award at work, giving you a nice bonus and a two-week vacation at a spa resort for two. You were thrilled at the time off...except for the “for two” part. You  couldn’t find any guys interested - even practically advertising it on dating sites did little but draw a few spambots and get your account temporarily suspended. You disappointedly considered selling them and just taking a starvation...until you looked at the tickets more closely...

“Valid for couple’s spa vacation package or ‘mother/daughter bonding’ package.” 

That gave you hope...your son, now 18 and heading into the summer before college, had plenty of time before starting his studies. Perhaps you could...”condition” him. Just for two weeks! You knew a few “programs” that could help. He wouldn’t even realize if it was done right. You’ve given him the world his whole life...he can temporarily give you a daughter, right? It would be a great bonding opportunity...not to mention, an opportunity for you to explore some “feminine urges” you always wished you could have experienced with your girlfriends back in college...
————————————
If you read this far, thanks for your interest! The prompt will involve the mother (you) conditioning her son (me) into being her daughter for a special lengthy spa retreat vacation. I’d expect gentle femdom, femdom, feminization, brainwashing, pegging, and more to be involved. Would love to focus on the actually changes, mental and physical, as well as the “sexytime” stuff :p Hard limits include gore, extreme pain/violence, and death. If you have any other favorite kinks, just ask!

I am more interested in Start-Up jobs and entrepreneurship works, looking for life changing opportunities in the abroad because in Turkey, Polymer engineering does not in the position i beleive it deserves and the vision in here about engineering is not fit to my point of view.

During my study years i had my internship in Berlin, Haemato Pharm company and learned a lot about Germany, Polymer Engineering and life in Berlin. At the same time i had lovely friends, met so many kind people while i was working. We are still in touch with these lovely people, my friends, and thanks to them i got more and more interested in Berlin.

If anyone here know any start-up or internship job related to Polymers, Plastics, Material Engineerin etc. can s/he let me know about it. I beleive i have a good CV and references, so i can share them with you if you are looking for a competent person about Polymers :).  Or if you know any internet site i can look for please share with me :).

Wo Robin &amp; David gerne mal über oben genannte ""News-Sender"" ablästern, glaube ich, dass der Gawker-Fall ein extrem spannendes Thema für uns sein kann. Viele Methoden Gawkers werden heute als Vorlage für die Arbeit von digitalen Boulevardblättern genutzt, beispielsweise das Bezahlen der Mitarbeiter nach Klick- &amp; Postanzahl. Auch der Nerv den sie Auslösen, sowie das damit verbundene Image, ist vergleichbar mit dem was ihre deutschen Ableger hierzulande abbekommen und damit auch die Reaktionen &amp; vielleicht auch die Konsequenzen...

# Die Charaktere:

**Nick Denton**, Gründer von Gawker und Vater des News-Blogging.

**Peter Thiel**, Mitgründer von PayPal &amp; erster Großinvestor in Facebook. Heute Multi-Milliardär.

**Mr. A**, Komplize Thiels, der für ihn die Verschwörung im detail durchführt.

**Hulk Hogan**, professioneller Wrestler, ehemaliges Mitglied der WWE Hall of Fame.

# Die Story:

**In** **2007 outed Gawker Peter Thiel als** **s\*\*\*\*chwul.** Das Ganze kam unerwartet. Thiels sexuelle Orientierung war seiner Familie &amp; seinem Freundeskreis bekannt, jedoch teilte er es niemanden offen initiativ mit, wodurch es eine unausgesprochene Wahrheit blieb.

Dies ist jedoch Gawkers Geschäft: Unausgesprochene Wahrheiten verbreiten. Über Dinge schreiben, die sich Reporter vielleicht Abends in einer Bar gegenseitig erzählen, aber nie darüber schreiben würden. Dies war genau die Prämisse des späteren Mediengiganten.

So kommt es am 19.12.07 zu einem Post mit der Überschrift ""[Peter Thiel is totally gay, people](http://gawker.com/335894/peter-thiel-is-totally-gay-people)"" in dem ein Ableger von Gawker ohne jegliche Angabe von Quellen über die Sexualität von Peter Thiel schreibt.

Thiel ist vom Outing nicht direkt betroffen und regt sich auch nicht speziell über dieses auf. Was ihn viel mehr zur Weißglut bringt, ist ein Kommentar von Nick Denton unter dem Artikel. In diesem spekuliert der CEO des Magazins, warum Peter sich bis Dato noch nicht selbst geouted hat. Er vermutet, dass Thiel psychische Probleme im Bezug auf seine Sexualität haben könnte, da er seine Liebe für Männer ja nicht gerade rausposaunt.

Peter regt sich am meisten aus politischen Gründen auf. Er kann nicht verstehen, warum jemand einfach so Dinge aus dem Privatleben einer anderen Person veröffentlicht, ohne einen wirklichen Grund dafür zu haben. Ein Mitarbeiter Gawkers, den Thiel, auf der Suche nach Antworten für sein Unverständnis, interviewt, wird nachher sagen: ""Peters Blickwinkel auf das Thema ist gerade zu europäisch."" Dies ist möglicherweise auf seine deutsche Herkunft zurückzuführen. Er ist ein bekennender Liberaler, er steht stark für Werte wie die Privatsphäre ein.

In Gawker sieht er den Feind dieser Freiheit. Nicht nur das der Artikel und eine reihe Weiterer für zusätzlichen Stress, in einer für ihn ohnehin unternehmerisch schwierigen Zeit, sorgen, auch bei seinen Kollegen im Silicon Valley merkt er wie diese Art von ""Journalismus"" für Angst sorgt. Niemand möchte der Nächste sein, über dem auf [gawker.com](https://gawker.com) gelästert wird.

Ein Beispiel, das zeigt, wie Geschäftsschädigend das Ganze sein kann, ist [der Diebstahl eines Gizmodo-Reporters](https://www.fastcompany.com/1621516/iphone-4-leak-saga-start-finish) (Gizmodo ist ein Tech-Ableger Gawkers) von einem Prototypen des damaligen IPhone 4. Peter geht sogar soweit Gawker intern nur noch als MBTO zu bezeichnen (Abkürzung für: Manhattan based terror organisation), so groß empfindet er die Bedrohung durch das Gossip-Blatt.

All dies und weitere Recherchen bringen den Milliardär dazu zu handeln. **Thiel beschließt Gawker unschädlich zu machen.**

Der schlussendlich ausschlaggebende Momente für diese Entscheidung kommt jedoch erst knapp 3,5 Jahre später in Berlin. Thiel spricht hier auf einer Konferenz und trifft sich, so wie er es als Investor oft tut, mit einer jungen, ambitionierten Person zum Abendessen.

Der damals 26-jährige Australier, der in der Öffentlichkeit ([vermutlich](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/this-is-the-man-who-helped-peter-thiel-demolish-gawker-mr-a)) nur als Mr. A zu identifizieren ist, stellt ihm jedoch nicht eine Idee für ein neues Start-up vor, sondern [unterbreitet ihm ein ganz anderes Angebot](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/the-dinner-that-destroyed-gawker/): Er wolle innerhalb von 3-5 Jahren mit einem Kapital von 10 Millionen Dollar dafür sorgen, dass Gawker ein Ende findet. Sein erster Plan wäre es alle Archive von Gawker zu durchforsten und nach anklage-würdigen Belastungsmaterial zu suchen.

Peter gibt jedoch erst das wieder, was er von so vielen anderen Menschen zuvor gehört hat, denen er von seinem Ärgernis mit Gawker erzählt hat: Da kann man nichts machen. Mr. A antwortet darauf mit Worten, auf die nur ein idealistischer Jüngling kommen kann: ""Peter, wenn jeder so denken würde, was wäre das für eine Welt in der wir leben?"" So schafft es Mr. A den Investor von seinem Plan zu überzeugen.

Der mögliche Gerichtsfall, der Gawker zur Strecke bringen könnte, ist auch relativ schnell gefunden: Am 07.03.2012 berichtet die Nachrichtenseite TMZ darüber, dass wohl ein Sextape vom Ex-Wrestler Hulk Hogan existiert. Eine Erklärung dazu, wie es entstanden ist, an die Öffentlichkeit kommen konnte und alles drumherum, ist kompliziert und beinhaltet die Frau von Hogans besten Freund, einen Mann der seinen Namen offiziell in ""Bubba the Love Sponge"" ändern lassen hat und das FBI.

Wichtig für uns ist nur, dass Hogan unwissend und ungewollt gefilmt wurde, von der Existenz der Tapes nichts wusste und, nach den ersten Gerüchten auf TMZ, öffentlich angedroht hat, jeden zu verklagen, der das Tape im Netz verbreitet.

**Gawker kommt nun in den Besitz des Hulk Hogan Sextapes und stellt es online.** Wie es auch nicht anders von Gawker zu erwarten ist.

Es ist genau das, wovon Mr. A &amp; Thiel geträumt haben! Sie beauftragen den Anwalt Charles Harder, der später auch Anwalt von Donald Trump wird, damit, Kontakt zu Hogan aufzunehmen und ihm mitzuteilen, dass sie gewillt sind, die Anklage finanziell zu tragen.

In den USA ist das Rechtssystem, wie wir alle wissen, etwas anders, besonders aber auch viel teurer als hier in Deutschland. Es gab im Vorhinein schon Anklagen gegen Gawker, die bis dahin aber immer fallen gelassen werden mussten, da die Kläger die Gerichtskosten nicht tragen konnten. Mit jemanden wie Peter Thiel im Rücken ist dieses Problem jedoch nicht existent.

Hogan nimmt an. **Peter Thiel unterstützt Hulk Hogan finanziell bei seiner Anklage gegen Gawker.** Die geforderte Summe an Gawker: 100 Millionen Dollar. Genug für die Pleite des Unternehmens.

Nun vergeht erneut einiges an Zeit. Erst vor zwei Jahren am 07.03.2016, genau vier Jahre nach den ersten Veröffentlichungen um das Tape, kommt es zur Eröffnung des Falls vor dem Gericht von Florida. In der Zwischenzeit geschehen jedoch noch einige Dinge, die aufzeigen, wie toxisch sich die Kultur der Firma auch intern auf die Strukturen dieser auswirken.

Am wohl bekanntesten wird der ""Ausrutscher"" von  A.J. Daulerio, früherer Gawker-Redakteur und verantwortlich für die Veröffentlichung des Sextapes. In einer aufgezeichneten Voranhörung, die, wie ihm im Vorhinein mitgeteilt wurde, gegen ihm vor Gericht verwendet werden kann, erklärte er auf die Frage: ""Können sie sich eine Situation vorstellen, in welcher ein Sextape eines Promis nicht berichtenswert ist?"", ""Wenn der Promi ein Kind ist."" Daraufhin die Gegenfrage: ""Bis zu welchem alter?"" A.J. antwortet ""im Spaß"": ""Vier.""

**Am Ende kommt es zur Verurteilung. Gawker muss Hogan 140 Millionen Dollar** **Strafe** **zahlen.** 40 Millionen mehr als gefordert. **Die Firma geht damit pleite.**

# Die Konsequenzen

Der Mediengigant, der bis Dato als einfach faktisch zu akzeptieren galt, ist bezwungen. Die Folgen dessen waren erstmal schwer abzusehen.

[Rechtsexperten spekulierten darüber](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/business/media/legal-experts-see-little-effect-on-news-media-from-hulk-hogan-verdict.html) und waren sich, bis sich herausstellte, dass Peter Thiel hinter dem ganzen steckte, zum Großteil einig, dass das Ganze, keine weiteren Auswirkungen, auf die Gefahr vor Anklagen gegen wirklich seriösen Journalismus, hat.

Bei den Auswirkungen auf das Nivea der Medienlandschaft selbst hat sich inzwischen abgezeichnet, dass das ""Gawker Problem"" durch das Bankrott des Unternehmens, gelöst werden konnte. Es gab tatsächlich Rettungsversuche, um die Seite weiter am Leben zu erhalten, z.B. durch eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne von ehemaligen Mitarbeitern. Diese erhielt aber lange nicht genug Unterstützer. Es gibt einfach niemanden, der solche Medien auf lange Sicht unterstützen will.

Es schien, als hätte der Gründer Nick Denton einfach einen perfekten Zeitpunkt abgefangen, in dem sein Unternehmen wachsen konnte. Aber sobald Gawker von der Fläche verschwand, hat es auch keiner wirklich vermisst. So wie Unkraut, dass zwischendurch mal grünen konnte, sobald es aber gerupft wurde, keiner mehr danach fragt.

**Denkt ihr so würde es auch in Deutschland ausgehen?** Angenommen die Bild und RTL würden nicht mehr existieren, könnten sich der Sender und das Boulevardblatt in derselben Zeit, ohne Ressourcen außer ihrer Kontakte, unter unseren heutigen Umständen, auf die gleiche Machtstellung zurück arbeiten?

Oder das gleiche Beispiel mal auf YouTube bezogen: Angenommen eine Bibi, ein Leon Machère, eine Katja oder der Made my Day-Channel währen von einem Tag auf den Anderen mit all ihren Videos und Social Media Accounts weg. Denkt ihr, sie könnten ihre Größe und Einfluss ohne Probleme wieder herstellen?

Meiner Meinung nach hängt das davon ab, welche Art von Content momentan gefördert wird (Weswegen unter den heutigen Bedingungen, die eben genannten YouTuber, wohl wenig Probleme mit dieser Challenge hätten), aber auch die Content Producer haben die Möglichkeit Einfluss zu nehmen, da Produzenten &amp; Konsumenten in einer voneinander abhängigen Beziehung stehen. Wie HoB in der Rede beim Webvideopreis sagte, Influencer sollten aktiv positiven Einfluss auf ihrer Community nehmen. Am Ende des Tages, ist, denke ich, gute Bildung der Schlüssel. Sei es durch die Eltern, die Schule, oder eben deinen Lieblings Internet-Star.

[Die Story wird nun auch verfilmt](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/hunger-games-director-francis-lawrence-hulk-hogan-gawker-movie-1202840886/)**.** Auf der Basis des Buches über den Fall mit dem Titel ""Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue"" von Ryan Holiday, wird der Drehbuchautor des preisgekrönten Films ""The Big Short,"" Charles Randolph, eine Filmadaption schreiben. Regisseur wird kein geringerer als Francis Lawrence, welcher bereits für die Produktion von zuletzt ""Red Sparrow"" und ""Die Tribute von Panem"" verantwortlich war. Der CEO der Produktionsfirma hat bereits angekündigt, dass er einen A-List Cast für den Film aufstellen möchte. Wir können also auf Großes gespannt sein!

Beim ersten Hören klingt die ganze Geschichte zu verrückt, um wahr zu sein und ich glaube genau das ist es, was geholfen hat, dass die Aktion wirklich funktionieren konnte. Peter Thiel sagte später: ""Was sagt es über Gawker aus, dass seine selbsternannten investigativen Reporter nicht merken konnten, dass unter ihrer Nase eine Verschwörung gegen sie selbst durchgeführt wurde?"" Ryan Holiday schrieb sinngemäß im Intro seines Buches: Es gibt viele Verschwörungstheorien, aber wenige tatsächliche Verschwörungen, vielleicht zu wenige...

In dem Sinne, lasst uns nicht vergessen, dass Taten oft mehr bewirken als Worte und in manchen Fällen ein Eingriff das Beste ist, dass wir tun können. Lasst uns Verantwortung für unsere Gesellschaft übernehmen, damit sie nicht wie ein Garten voller Unkraut verwuchert, sondern Lebenswert &amp; Kraft spendend bleibt und wird.

Vielen Dank fürs Lesen :) Ich würde mich sehr über Eure Meinung freuen!

Denen, die mehr zum Fall lesen wollen, kann ich sehr, Ryan Holidays episches und gleichzeitig extrem lehrreiches Buch, ""Conspiracy"" ans Herz legen. Ihr könnte es auf[ Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Conspiracy-Peter-Gawker-Anatomy-Intrigue/dp/0735217645/) bestellen oder auf [Audible](https://www.audible.de/pd/English-Nonfiction/Conspiracy-Hoerbuch/B079F5BSZH) zum Hörbuch lauschen.

8ukxra,4,2018-06-28,"How do I prepare to see my Nmom tomorrow, for the first time in a year?",TheBellaBubbles,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8ukxra/how_do_i_prepare_to_see_my_nmom_tomorrow_for_the/,"I am seeing my Nmom for the first time after over a year for a dinner in the town I live in. My Nmom has been teasing this meeting for months, always changing the date, and I was about 70&amp;#37; sure she would never come here. She never asked me if she could see me, she just expected it. Everyone told me not to see her, my therapist told me I could tell her I didn't want to see her, but I came to the conclusion that I couldn't not go and wonder for the rest of my life what she wanted from me. 

What my Nmom had to do to make this meeting happen is crazy... She lives in Utah, where I left over a year ago. She flew to New Jersey to go to a conference for work. Then drove to New York to see her mom and bring her down with her. The original plan was for her to be bringing my brother back with her from his internship with our uncle in Georgia, but while my brother was in Tennessee with my Uncle, my Dad went and picked him up. So my Nmom was supposed to be driving from New York to Georgia to pick my brother up, and drive him back to North Carolina where my Dad and I live. But now there is no need for her to come twice, but she still is, driving from New York to North Carolina to see us for dinner, then driving to Georgia, then back up to North Carolina, flying from North Carolina back to Utah. She has not given us a date for when she will be here the 2nd time, which for my work schedule means I probably will be too busy with the 4th of July to see her. 

The last time I saw my Nmom she had kicked me out of the house for ""not doing enough for her"" even though I was a full time college student with a job, giving all my money to her, and taking care of my younger brother for her, and trying my best to clean up after her in her hoarder house, and her 14 dogs that she also hoarded. I was living in my car in the gym parking lot with major depression, and anxiety disorder. She finally let me back to the house and insisted that I was crazy and had just left, even though I was a ""spoiled rich kid"". During that time I had $90 in my bank account and was expected to live on that for the last 3 months that I lived there, and wasn't allowed to any of the food in the house unless I did things for my Nmom. I was so anxious I couldn't leave my room. I attempted a suicide and my Nmom didn't care enough about me to visit me in the ER, and just complained about the medical cost. 

After that I moved away with my Dad, have a great job, and life but still deal with the ordeal daily. After moving I believe she regretted everything she had done throughout that time and also my childhood, but she never apologized for anything she ever did. She just called me and acted really nice to me over the phone many times, and only talking about herself and her problems to me. The only time she let her real self slip out again was when I confided in her about having a miscarriage, and she told me it was because ""I didn't remember she was my mother, and didn't ask her to come down. That I didn't care enough about her, had only bothered to call her twice that year, and that it was ultimately my fault that I had bad luck because I was selfish when it came to our relationship."" On mother's day she sent me a gift basket with lotions and what not with a card that said ""Happy Mother's Day."" 

It's now the day before she is supposed to come, for the last couple weeks I've been extremely anxious and paranoid, remembering everything that happened before, and questioning if any of it was real, if I was really just a crazy person hallucinating like my Nmom had said. I want to prove to her that I am not a child anymore, and shouldn't be viewed as one. I want to be strong and be able to defend myself, and set clear boundaries. I don't want to be made a fool or torn down to my Nana and brother. I think she wants them there so that she can try to make them hate me or something. How can I defend myself and actions to her if she brings up the topic? How do I appear confident when I'm terrified? How does this experience not wreck the rest of my year? And how do I keep from having her manipulate me into feeling guilty?"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

8ulm5x,1,2018-06-28,"An Open Letter to Leaders of the Democratic Party from ""The Base""",fromtop2bottomguys,politicsdebate,https://www.reddit.com/r/politicsdebate/comments/8ulm5x/an_open_letter_to_leaders_of_the_democratic_party/,"Dear **Democrat Leaders**,

As a Democrat, I am fed up with going [high when they go low](http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/sarah-huckabee-sanders-red-hen-kirstjen-nielsen-discourse-20180626.html). We must play a ground game. If Democrats and their leaders can not come up with a message of what Democrats stand for, then it is time to start fighting fire with fire. It is time to crawl out from under the rock we are planted under. We have allowed the other side to steal our [Presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore), and now the future of the [Supreme Court](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-27/anthony-kennedy-retires-hands-trump-keys-to-the-future). Democrats have lost it. The Dem’s are on the ground and allowing themselves to be kicked in their literal Democratic asses.

What am I calling for? What should be done.

1. Craft a [winning message](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/11/democratic-campaign-messaging-hollywood-637364) about what the future of the country could be and stick to it. Beat a dead horse with it. Democratic leaders are horrible at crafting winning narratives. I haven’t heard one since the [90’](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4685325/bill-clinton-1996-bridge-21st-century)s, and “Yes We Can” became No He Didn’t.
2. Rally the base. “THE BASE” of the party is not reflected by the leadership. I can promise that. Not one of the congressmen and women representing our party knows what it is like to be “the base.” Get your asses in the street, find those narratives, speak the language of the people in the “base” of the party, and not just in liberal strongholds. Invade conservative territory. Stop messages that are a reaction to Trump policies and make a Democratic narrative instead of following Trumps chaotic and sporadic agenda.  [Trump has shown that it is possible to win with just your base.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/06/24/luis_gutierrez_trump_is_using_cruel_tactics_to_gin_up_republican_base_and_it_seems_to_be_working.html) If he does it again. Shame on you Democratic Leaders.
3. START CAMPAINING NOW! [Trump never stopped campaigning](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/06/28/trump-rally-fargo-nd) and he is keeping his base motivated, while Democratic congressmen and women sit on the sidelines whining about having any power. Again, get your asses out of the damn capitol where you have no power and take your message to the people. The people and their votes are the power.
4. All the above is probably preaching to the choir, but damn; then why does the choir suck? Why can’t the choir make some noise and speak the truth instead of running after Trumps lies?
5. So, the last suggestion is radical but necessary. [Create Chaos](https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRldmRpc2NvdXJzZS5jb20vQXJ0aWNsZS80NTM3NS13b21lbi1wbGFuLWNpdmlsLWRpc29iZWRpZW5jZS1hY3Rpb24taW4td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1hZ2FpbnN0LXRydW1wL05vcnRoJTIwQW1lcmljYdIBwgFodHRwczovL3d3dy1kZXZkaXNjb3Vyc2UtY29tLmNkbi5hbXBwcm9qZWN0Lm9yZy92L3Mvd3d3LmRldmRpc2NvdXJzZS5jb20vQXJ0aWNsZS80NTM3NS13b21lbi1wbGFuLWNpdmlsLWRpc29iZWRpZW5jZS1hY3Rpb24taW4td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1hZ2FpbnN0LXRydW1wL05vcnRoJTIwQW1lcmljYT9hbXAmYW1wX2pzX3Y9MC4xI3dlYnZpZXc9MQ?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen). Not anarchy, which there is a line that could be crossed; but crafted and narrative chaos. Democrats need to embrace all parts of the party if we are going to win in November.

When I couldn’t wait to get out of an institution and a community of people that just weren’t responsive to my needs. Just as it was then, it is happening now.

If Democrats cannot create a positive or cathartic release valve for our base and the party, not only will Democrats have lost an opportunity, they will have squandered the only energy Democrats have left. Because at this point. I don’t feel like voting. It doesn’t matter.

I will try to be as short as possible. Basically I have had panic disorder and anxiety with agoraphobia for many years. Never did anything about it until it got worst lets say 5-6 years ago. Went to college started drinking and as you can imagine the 2-3 beers that calmed my anxiety increased to larger amounts.Tolerance was relatively low as I wasn’t a drinker at all before turning 20, but yes it took the edge off so there it began. Drinking daily in college for around 3 good years, not a huge amount as mentioned earlier due to low tolerance. 

Then 3 years ago when the alcool got out of control I was dealing with three problems (anxiety, alcohol, and panic attacks) and I had to seek help. Started having withdrawals and going back home to my parents from university I couldn’t hide my drinking easily. I got he courage to tell my mother and I was put in Xanax and fluoxetine. It worked I stopped drinking for 2 years. Took Xanax as needed for my panic attacks. Even though it’s not meant for long term it helped quit a lot. Move abroad for an internship experience, didn’t drink one drop. Surrounded by a lot of drinkers and young people having a good time I resisted amazingly and did a lot of things that I never imagined without drinking such as stadiums. Crowds, subway. However I lost all contact with friends I felt isolated as a non drinker my age 

Then a year ago I moved to a new place all alone quite difficult, and then yes started drinking again to be more sociable go out and have a good time. And here I am again with huge daily alcohol consumption especially recently. I know loneliness has had a major impact on this I am an only child as well, but I can’t believe I am back to where I was 3 years ago. I can manage to stop for 2 or 3 days but then start again. It’s all back, the vomits, the headaches, the memory loss you name it. 

I feel because I am used to living in my own world of anxiety drinking and loneliness I can’t even socialize probably anymore 

Please share your experiences if similar, I’m only 25 this is horrible. I believe the alcohol is also increasing my depression and sadness even though it takes the edge of for a couple of hours.  Can this relapse be cured easily? Should I see a professional? I can’t go through the pain of telling my parents again 

If you managed to read this thank you.

8umaj5,1,2018-06-28,I'm 23(F) and I can't stop obsessively checking my Ex (23M)'s Ex (23F)'s Instagram/social media.,instathrowaway101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8umaj5/im_23f_and_i_cant_stop_obsessively_checking_my_ex/,"Hi Reddit! I am using this throwaway account to ask for some advice about my situation, and use this as a way to finally put my thoughts into text because this situation has really consumed me mentally for the past couple of days, even though it shouldn’t at ALL.

A little background on me, I am a pretty normal student studying for a professional accounting license and am currently doing an internship in pursuit of that goal. I would say I’m more driven than most of my peers around my age, and this drive has allowed me to accomplish a lot of things in a past couple of years such as travelling, running an entrepreneurial pursuit, being rather involved in my school community, etcetc, however because of my focus on career I realized that I neglected to prioritize my personal relationships, up until around a year ago when I realized that personal relationships are equally, if not more important, for my own future.

Anyway, I started dating a guy I met on a study abroad term last year. We are from the same country but about 4 hour’s flight away from each other. We clicked the first time I met him. At first, I didn’t really fall for him – I kept thinking about the people I knew back home and thinking they were more ambitious, driven, and overall more mature. However, we went on a short weekend trip together and that’s when the sparks flew. I discovered that his family background was pretty similar to mine, and I began to like him for his good qualities. We are extremely similar. I gradually spent more time with him, and ended up travelling to several countries together alone with him for an entire month. We actually broke up once and got together again during the last leg of our trip but we eventually decided to pursue a long distance relationship when we both moved back to our respective home towns. We were in love, but also practical enough about it because we are both fairly independent people with goals.

When we were abroad together, I learned that he had an ex (let’s call her Tee) that he dated for 4 years. Oddly enough, this was one of the qualities I liked about him since the guy I dated right before him had commitment issues. I didn’t have a problem with her at the time because I was pretty occupied with travelling – I was in a happy place. 

Fast forward to about 6 months into our relationship. I find out that she was going to Europe for a summer internship at a large company because he told me. I was curious, so I looked up her Instagram account. Oh my god, I really shouldn’t have done that, because I kept going back to check. I find out that we are also extremely similar in our physical traits, she’s also a business student, she’s into sports, photography, and travelling. Actually, I think we could get along as good friends.

My boyfriend and I broke up for about 2 months now. I broke up with him because I didn’t see our future locations aligning (he wants to get into med school in his own city, but I want to stay in mine). But every single day, I’ve still been checking Tee’s Instagram. She doesn’t even have many followers, doesn’t post all too often. I have been checking every single one of her stories, then blocking them. I made a fake account to follow her in the same manner. 

One day, I slipped and forgot to block her after checking her profile. The next day, my ex sends me screenshots of Tee’s messages to my ex (I guess you can say our ex now…another similarity) and asked him if he met me last year while he was abroad. I had a suspicion that they were destined to be together in the end, because they had dated for so damn long, and I think they would make a great couple. This made me realize that my ex and Tee had not kept in touch at all, and this was the first time they were talking in a long time. In a way, my deepest fears (of him falling back with her again) were realized. Anyway, I panicked. I ignored my ex’s messages so he doesn’t know that I’ve read them. In the conversation, Tee told him she found out by going through the list of users who viewed her Insta stories, then checking again later only to notice that I wasn’t in that list anymore. Curious, Tee asked a friend to show her my profile from their account. That’s how she found out I blocked her.

How should I respond to my ex’s message? I feel so stupid that I forgot to block her again afterward, but also stupid for letting myself do this for so long in the first place. Everyone in this story is broken up and should be moving on, but I am still stuck on it. I still have an inch of hope that my ex will get into school in a city close to where I am, so that we might be together in the future. At the same time, I haven’t been meeting anyone new because I keep focusing on spending time with my family and friends since I was gone travelling for so long. 

Thank you for reading this mess of an essay – I left out many details and some thoughts about my own behavior (related to my own upbringing, life situation, etc.) because I don’t want to ramble for too long, so feel free to ask for more if you think it’ll help you form an opinion on an answer. 

**TLDR; I broke up with my long-distance BF of 8 months 2 months ago, but I still keep checking his ex’s Instagram stories and posts, then blocking her immediately afterward. She found out I had been doing this, confronted him to ask why, and he asked me why. I have no idea how to &amp; if I should respond to him at all.**"
8umibn,6,2018-06-28,Left full time job as illustration and graphic artist to pursue my interest in mobile apps [need help],lathbrokragnar,pakistan,https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/8umibn/left_full_time_job_as_illustration_and_graphic/,"I hope you guys are fine. 

During the time of my graduation I developed interest in mobile apps. Especially augmented reality apps inspired me a lot and during the last year of graduation I learned to code in Java and made few apps. Then my plan was to get a job as android developer instead on starting a career related to my education. 

After graduation and based on my skills I got a paid internship as android developer and made few apps but out of nowhere someone wanted to hire me as illustration and graphic artist for their animation house as I have a good portfolio in design and they offered good pay scale. I accepted the offer and decided to make android apps on my own in free time but it didn't happen. 

During my job I always felt less passionate about my work and wanted to pursue in apps, so I decided to quit. Now I am job less at the moment, applying for entry level jobs as android dev. I have also experimented with Google Arcore recently (its for augmented reality apps) and now I have made like 15+ apps overall. 

If someone can refer me to entry level job or paid internship as android developer (Java) in Lahore, it would be amazing. I am looking for a good place with great team, company that already got few other android developers. 

Note: If anyone knows Arcore/AR specific places, that would be great as I am unable to find any place in Lahore, where Arcore is being utilized. Android developer would be fine too. 

Thanks guys. "
8un876,7,2018-06-28,I am pretty sure I need to leave my husband,hiltin,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/8un876/i_am_pretty_sure_i_need_to_leave_my_husband/,"My husband has done the very least he could to get by since I met him and began to date him six years ago. I was kind of the same way then. We smoked a ton of marijuana, and we continued to do so until I quit several months ago (he still does, if not more now). He’s been through several phases of unemployment, unmotivated to find another job at these times. When employed, always unmotivated to find a different job that pays better or makes him happier, always happy to settle. He’s fine to watch me beg him for help around the house, help in the yard, help buying groceries, help raising our toddler, while he sleeps until 3pm every day that he’s not working. He accuses me of being the cause for whatever his problem may be at the time. He never apologizes, never attempts to converse with me or spend time as a family, only interested in sleeping, smoking cigarettes and marijuana, and playing the guitar. 

This has gone on for years. In our toddler’s babyhood, I suffered postpartum depression with which I begged for help,crying to him, and he would just look on, as if he couldn’t hold a crying baby. As if he couldn’t wash a sink full of dishes. 

He has had spells of lying in bed for months at a time drinking. Currently he doesn’t drink. Every time we plan an outing, such as a cartoon concert for my daughter, he chooses those times to have an episode of rage or sadness (maybe he doesn’t choose the time but it feels that way. It’s always a time for someone else’s enjoyment). 

While I was working a part time bartending job in the evenings, along with attending school full time, my husband would care for my daughter as he would be home from his position as teacher assistant. When I would arrive home my daughter would not be bathed and there would be dirty diapers lying all over the house. The house would be a disaster as though she had been home alone. 

Recently I started a new full time job/internship with the federal government an hour from home. It’s very important to me, and so is my daughter’s wellbeing obviously. Although I had my doubts, I left my daughter with my husband at 6am that morning, both asleep in the same bed. The next thing I knew, my mom, who lives nearby, had become worried about them around 1pm and went to check on them at my house. She knocked loudly and repeatedly and received no answer so she went inside to find my daughter shut in her room crying hysterically, still in pjs and wet pull up, while my husband slept. 

I have had doubts about this relationship from the time when we got engaged, but I just went along with it because it’s the thing to do I guess. I got pregnant before the date of our planned wedding so we pushed the date up, and I remember not being excited at all. I don’t feel romantically in love with him anymore. His behavior has pushed me apart and it’s easier to be a single mom than a single mom who has a husband sleeping in the next room. I just feel bad about his obvious mental illness! I’ve begged and pleaded for him to get help, but he has always opted to treat himself with marijuana he’s purchased off the street which is obviously not doing any good! My best option is to move my daughter and me into my parents house. Then I will have constant help with her as I’m trying to better our lives with this internship. I feel my husband is pulling me down, but I feel selfish too. "
8unb9t,1,2018-06-28,M4F - mother/teenage daughter bonding! But with her adult son...,Hola2346,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8unb9t/m4f_motherteenage_daughter_bonding_but_with_her/,"It hasn’t been easy for you, being a single mother.

You were the shining example of an attractive, successful co-ed in college. The girl who balanced school, a social life, and all the other millions of things you got involved in. The college student who wasn’t against a fun night out for drinks or at the club every once in a while, but also studious and dedicated to her studies and future first and foremost. The lady who loved the proactive crop tops and skintight leggings, but looked stunning in a professional suit or simple blouse and business casual skirt.

That all changed junior year...you were usually so careful, but one night out with your friends, a few too many drinks, so many guys, and...well.

Boom. Babytown. Population: you.

You knew this would possibly end your career expectations, but against the advice of most friends and family, you decided to keep it. You managed to finish your semester, just barely, before having to take time off. And when you were secure enough to go back to school, it was mostly night and online classes. Still, you didn’t regret the decision for a moment. You gave birth to a beautiful, healthy boy, as sweet, smart, and kind as you.

And against all odds, your career didn’t turn purely into “single mom.” It took several years longer than most, but you finished your degree, chipping away at it credit by credit. A degree let you fit in an underpaid internship amongst the several minimum wage jobs that barely kept you and your boy afloat. An internship that soon turned into a solid position with benefits, letting you trade in the waitressing and hotel desk jobs for a real career. Which led to an MBA...before you knew it, you were head of HR at a fairly large company while in your 30s. You were as well-off if not better than most of your peers.

Yet...you always sighed at what you missed out on. You said you wouldn’t trade having a kid for the world - which was true. But those long days and nights of constant work, little sleep, trying to balance everything...it was stressful. Your friends all drifted off with their own lives, you barely a ghost not included in any yearbooks or reunions. Dating was a non-starter - even with your well-paying position, age and a child were hurdles in today’s dating culture. You just wished you could let your hair back again and relax...

Your chance seemed to come. You received an award at work, giving you a nice bonus and a two-week vacation at a spa resort for two. You were thrilled at the time off...except for the “for two” part. You  couldn’t find any guys interested - even practically advertising it on dating sites did little but draw a few spambots and get your account temporarily suspended. You disappointedly considered selling them and just taking a starvation...until you looked at the tickets more closely...

“Valid for couple’s spa vacation package or ‘mother/daughter bonding’ package.” 

That gave you hope...your son, now in his 20z and with the summer off between semesters. Perhaps you could...”condition” him. Just for two weeks! You knew a few “programs” that could help. Perhaps knock him back to his teen or even preteen years, just...as a girl. He wouldn’t even realize if it was done right. And you read how it is important to be in touch with your feminine side even as a guy. You’ve given him the world his whole life...he can temporarily give you a daughter, right? It would be a great bonding opportunity...not to mention, an opportunity for you to explore some “feminine urges” you always wished you could have experienced with your girlfriends back in college...
————————————
If you read this far, thanks for your interest! The prompt will involve the mother (you) conditioning her son (me) into being her daughter for a special lengthy spa retreat vacation. I’d expect gentle femdom, femdom, feminization, brainwashing, pegging, and more to be involved. Hard limits include gore, extreme pain/violence, and death. If you have any other favorite kinks, just ask!

Shoot me a message if you’re interested with a description and/or pic of your character and any additions/changes you’d like to make!"

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi immediately called for gun control after a shooting was reported at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland on Thursday.

Five are [confirmed](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2018/06/28/reports-of-shots-fired-in-annapolis/) dead after a shooter unleashed a barrage of bullets on Capital Gazette employees.

The suspect is being [described](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2018/06/28/reports-of-shots-fired-in-annapolis/) as a white man in his 20’s; no ID on the shooter yet.

Capital Gazette employees inside the building tweeted about the shooting.

One intern tweeted, “Help me” as the shooter rampaged through the office shooting people.

Another reporter said, “Gunman shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees. Can’t say much more and don’t want to declare anyone dead, but it’s bad.”

Without skipping a beat, without having an ID on the shooter, Nancy Pelosi called for more gun control.

Never let a crisis go to waste, right?

**Pelosi tweeted**: Praying for everyone injured &amp; the families of those lost in today’s shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. Congress has a responsibility to take action to prevent the tragedy of gun violence. Every day it fails to do so is a stain on our country.

8unmvt,2,2018-06-28,i just want to tell internet strangers what i'm going through [warning: wall of text],EfficientOrange,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8unmvt/i_just_want_to_tell_internet_strangers_what_im/,"it's strange, i'm in my room crying and writing this, i usually never tell my emotions to other people, but i can't help, today i want to.

i shouldn't be in such a bad mood, for a serie of reason my life has got what many would define 'better' than it was just half a year ago but... i don't know, i feel so fucking lonely in this.

i underestimated the power of close social interactions, even it was basically just my family, i miss so much being home.

less than two months i'm in a big city from the other side of the country, prior to this i was in a kinda-neetish phase. while i was at college in theory, first two years of which went actually quite well, one and a half year followed without me passing any exam, just some sporadic attendance to lessons (it's never been a problem, since first year i almost never went to lessons and did my exams just fine but it's like i've lost my energy to keep studying at some point).

with my college career at half i decided to put a pause to it and go job hunting. i was actually pretty lucky to find a ""job"" at my first interview, i should be thankful for this, no? anyway i went, they offered me a 6 months internship with an almost 100% probability of being employed at the end.

i packed my bags and i went in this big city at the other side of the country in which i am living from one and a half month roughly.

the job is not terrible, it's a corporate it type of thing, where the company has big clients and i'm helping with fixing stuff and/or developing new features for a client's e-commerce portal. i kinda isolated myselft in the lunch break and i hate myself for this, a couple of days i went declining offer to join some of my colleagues for lunch until they stopped asking, and now is one month i am eating alone, at first i loved it but now i hate it and i would love to have company and i'm too shy to ask them again to go to lunch together. i started avoiding the places where they might go to lunch for fear of meeting them (i think i have social anxiety but i'm not sure, i really open myself to people i trust, but they seem to be very rare, i'm scared to interact with most other people). i am also developing bad eating habits, let's talk about that.

one would say it's a miracle: i've been between overweight and obese my entire life and i'm experiencing a sudden weight loss since moving in the city. a couple of days ago i bought a scale off amazon, same day delivery, perks of living in the big city i guess?, i couldn't believe it, i lost 8 kgs (18 lbs) in just a month and a half. i've lost most of my appetite, i eat shitty foods and i never want to cook, company pays a couple of € per working day to spend on meals at restaurants and grocery stores, i've started eating almost entirely at fast food joints at lunch and that's it, i can't remember last time i had breakfast or dinner. some days i'm not even hungry for lunch anymore, but i eat anyway to keep my stomach from growling in the office. and it's scary because it's the first time in my life i'm experiencing this thing. i am afraid to use the kitchen in the house because i want to avoid social interaction, let's talk about roomates, shall we?

little note here: writing down i'm feeling a bit better

here's the thing: i'm just a stupid intern in a big city, maybe the only one still economically ok in a country not doing very well, i get paid something but it's not like i can afford to live on my own unless i plan to give up on everything else and spend 100% on rent. so i did the obvious thing and i am renting a room in a house with 5 other people, students, workers, or both.

I was always scared by social interaction but i took a courage pill and did my best to start this period of my life with best intentions, positive mind and all this meaningless bullshit. needless to say, i already had some confrontation with another roomate, or more than confrontation i should say he yelling at me over something trivial i didn't even do, two other roomates are basically his friends and even thought they haven't told me directly, i have a feeling like they kinda hate me. a couple of days ago he apologized to me and even seemed sincere, but i still feel a lot of negativity going on, like i'm not wanted from half of the house, i hope i explained myself well.

i'm avoiding interactions, i don't want to use the kitchen to cook dinner because i don't want to meet them, and i'm limiting all other possible encounters, i'm still in my room like at the start of this post and i rarely go out around the house.

one positive note about my roomates: there is this other one, the same day i had the confrontation, which made me go out with him and some of this friends the same night, and it was the fucking best moment since i'm here, he admitted he had problems too in the house, also because the roomate i had problems with he's a bit of a racist fuck, and this other roomate is african so there's that. i enjoyed myself that night just talking face to face with other people, even thought i don't talk much, but i still felt very positive and i told this guy and his friends we should hang around again soon but since we never did (more than a week passed at this point).

working a full time job has been exhausting, i have maybe a couple of hours in the night before i have to go to bed, then wake up and go to work again, it's a pain in the ass. the job is bad as working on terrible corporate systems can be, but is not terribly hard, i just miss the time. i'm kind of a ""slow"" person and i feel i have zero time. couple that with chores, going to the store to buy necessities, doing laundry, ironing the shirts, can leave me with very little time, even in weekends. being ""slow"" i really hated stress and this new full-time commitment has been really challenging so far and i feel like i'm at the brink of denial.

i'm sorry if i bothered you, or if you think i'm looking for attention and that i have a life other people would like to have: i mean, i have a job, nobody of my loved ones died yet, there's worse in life, right?

still i felt like i needed to write, i'm tired of crying alone in my room, i feel both alienated by this routine and alone in this big unforgiving city. i miss being close to my family very much. i hate myself for being so problematic with social interaction.

i just wanted to tell some of my thoughts. maybe no one will read this loooong boring wall of text and at this point i don't even care. if you did, i thank you very very much and excuse my shaky english."
8unr60,2,2018-06-28,HELP: Accounts to Strategy,JazzyHappyButterfly,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/8unr60/help_accounts_to_strategy/,"Hi everyone -

I'm about 9 months into my first job out of college, and I'm starting to think about the transition I want to make. Currently, I am working in accounts for a **pharma** client at a big creative agency in NYC. While I was still in college, I knew I wanted to work in strategy, but realized it later than everyone else. I did not have any internship related to strategy or advertising in general.

I took the accounts position because I thought **1)** who am I to complain about a job in advertising when I don't have any experience at all, **2)** it would be a good introduction to the industry, and **3)** I knew getting into strategy would be hard.

So far, I can say that I've learned a lot of soft skills: working with different teams within the agency, handling ridiculous deadlines from clients, and even direct client interactions. I also did a little strategy project for a non-pharma account. What I know for certain is that I am not learning anything relevant to strategy/planning. 

I can wait until my one year mark and apply for a rotation to a different department, but there is *bias* against pharma folks (be it accounts or creative) within the agency. It also depends on whether or not there are open positions in strategy.

Long story short: 

I for sure do not want to work in pharma advertising, and I don't want to stay there for too long to be *boxed* as a pharma person.

**Help?** How should I go about this transition? "
8unrow,10,2018-06-28,Grieving for my college years.,PapaNurgleLovesU,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8unrow/grieving_for_my_college_years/,"For the first time I think I was able to truly grieve the potential that was lost from my time in college (graduated 2017). I realize I was so shaken up by my father stealing my savings and so depressed from the trauma that I never thought very far ahead for my career. I had always felt I would die early and thus there was not really a need for future planning.

I have spent a long time being cruel to myself for having ""been asleep"" and not having a plan to get a career out of college. For having been too anxious to build a large network or grow close to people. For being in my twenties and not on the career track I wanted.

Only over the last year, having been accepted into a graduate program in psychology and discovering I did not want to do counseling anymore did I realize what I wanted to do with my future. I want to work in I/O psychology and so I need to go to another program and complete another Master's or a PhD. My future is much more clear now, at age 23 then it ever was throughout my undergraduate. It means I have a lot of work to do, and I have to do it now. I have to keep applying for internships, doing research, building connections. I can't sit here and torment myself anymore with criticism and shame anymore.

Now i am able to grieve for my past. Not to condemn me for not knowing what to do in college, but to feel sorrow that my abuse made it hard to think that far ahead. I can feel sympathy for myself, not as a helpless victim or a contemptible weakling, but as someone who was hurting badly. I can grieve that I lost a chance to try out something or make long term plans. 

I am hoping that soon I can forgive myself my past mistakes and help myself to make the right choices now. I hope grief will help me toward accepting where I am now and helping myself to reach for the position I want now."

8uoas0,2149,2018-06-28,JNMILITW - Grandmother has to save baaaabyyys trip,WinterFraser,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8uoas0/jnmilitw_grandmother_has_to_save_baaaabyyys_trip/,"First, am on mobile, its late and I am exhausted, yet, I cannot sleep for some reason so I thought I'd give your llamas a snack. Sorry if its all over the place, my brain doesnt seem to function when Im tired. I will update on the MIL-wearing-white-sending-letter-story tomorrow as I want to do it properly. But here comes the snack.

As some of you know, I am a teacher for 5-12th grade. Now, every year we take our 12th graders on a graduation trip to the land of the freeeeeee. Every pupil from 5th grade onwards looks forward to that trip and so do we teachers (yay for shopping cheap clothes because no taxation on clothes in certain state with giiigantic mall). We usually fly to NY, spend a couple of days ther, go to our partner school in certain state for a week and the fly to Florida to visit either Disney World or the Universal Studios and then back home. Its a big trip and the classes work during their school years to raise money for it (not that they really need it because I teach at a school with rather wealthy parents but we do want them to pay for part of it themselves). 

As of right now, it seems that we won't be able to take the trip next year because we have 3 pupils in next years class who fall under the new immigration ban (thank you Donald). We as staff have said that it wouldn't be fair to exclude them from the trip and decided to go somewhere else (probably London and Edinburgh). Before we decided this, we held a class meeting on Monday and informed the class in question what was going on and they decided together that either all of them would go or none of them (goodness I'm so proud).

Yesterday, a lady crashed our break at school. The lady in question is the wife of one of our main sponsors and the grandmother of one of our pupils in said class. He has two siblings that have already had their trip and is one of the kindest human beings I have ever met. So, the lady just walked into our break room (don't ask me how on earth she got in there. We don't have security like you have it in the states, so I know how she got into the building but our the teachers break room is not accessible to anyone without a key and she definitly doesn't have one.) She started berating one of our interns as they sit right next to the door (its their job to answer the door when the students ring the bell in case they need something). My colleague went to save them and pointed her in our direction and she went OFF on us. How DARE we cancel the trip her baaaaabyyy deserved for all of his hard work, he is sooooooo upset about the trip not happening, who cares if those foreigners can't go with them, he is soooooo upset about the trip not happening, it's not as if they belong with the class or pay for that trip by themselves (two of them are on scholarships), yadiyadiyadiyaaaaaa.

Now, you don't interrupt a teachers well-deserved 20 minute break. We need coffee or cuppa. We need breathable air (not the deodorant-testosteron-old sweat- contaminated air), gossip about the newest loves on the school yard, etc. 

Before I could say anything my colleage went off on her. He doesn't take shite from anyone, especially not from this old hag and especially not when her grandson was the first one who stood up and said he wouldn't go if the others weren't allowed to go. He gave her a dressing down and our headmaster kicked her out. 

Today we received a visit from the DIL and her husband, who came to aplogise for her behaviour. Turns out, baaaaabyy came home and told his parents what happened and Grandma happened to be there and made huge deal out of it, made grandson sad about it and took it upon herself to make it right again. 

We deal with plenty of mothers and fathers of our pupils but a grandcunt is a new one even for me."

Kink wise ,I'm a switch. I'm pretty inexperienced as a dom. I do, however, have experience as a sub so I'm not completely flying blind here. I think it's good to have the perspective of having been a sub for being a dom. My favorite kinks are body worship, tease/denial, and some bondage. I also really like aftercare, I think it's important. I'm not comfortable with or looking for any watersports, scat play, or any pain that leaves a really lasting mark (like cuts or bruises). That being said, I'm very open to trying new kinks so as long as it's not one of those few I'm game to try! Obviously I will respect any and all limits you have.

I'm looking for a submissive girl or transgirl in the Boston area. You don't have to be in the city itself (I'm not). I'd really like to get to know you, your kinks, and have a friendship outside of kink as well. It would be nice to start online (preferably with kik) to get to know each other, then meet up once we're comfortable!

8upd7z,6,2018-06-28,What can I do,truck64,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8upd7z/what_can_i_do/,"Hey so, I have been dating my gf for a little over 2 years now. The sex was great and plentiful in the beginning. We would have sex 3 times a day sometimes, or each time we got to see each other.  Not the case anymore. Last time we had sex was in February... and I cant even remember the time before that. We don't spend as much time together as I'd like though. She is very busy with school, work, internship and her crazy family. Keep in mind though I to, go to school and have a job, but I feel like I'm always the only one initiating our dates. Whenever I do get to spend time with her, I love ever second of it. She makes me smile and happy, and I do the same for her. 

I have always been the one to initiate the sex, and she used to accept. Not anymore though. Lately whenever I try to initiate it, she doesn't say anything like ""no"" or ""not right now"" but rather just gives off this vibe that she doesn't want to. It's hard to explain but I can pick up on it (its happened a lot). So I end up stopping my advances and try and change the subject, while trying not to show my frustration. I know she can see my frustration when she shuts me down, but we usually end up talking about something else until its out of both of our minds. 

It doesn't really make me mad, it just kind of bugs me. Like we used to be all over each other. I could give her a ""look"" and it would turn her on. Not anymore though and that sucks. Is there anything I can do to help bring back the sexy time? lol

Thanks! 

btw I'm 23 and shes 25

Update: Well, you guys were right. On July 2nd, she ended the relationship. She said she didn’t know what she wanted right now, and feels like we rushed into the relationship, and that she never had time to let go of her past (ex). Kind of makes me feel bad though. We dated for 2 years and I couldn’t get her to forget about her past? This whole situation sucks. Idk what to do "
8upeco,1,2018-06-28,26 [M4F] Quality Mother/Daughter bonding time! But with her son...,Hola2346,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8upeco/26_m4f_quality_motherdaughter_bonding_time_but/,"It hasn’t been easy for you, being a single mother.

You were the shining example of an attractive, successful co-ed in college. The girl who balanced school, a social life, and all the other millions of things you got involved in. The college student who wasn’t against a fun night out for drinks or at the club every once in a while, but also studious and dedicated to her studies and future first and foremost. The lady who loved the proactive crop tops and skintight leggings, but looked stunning in a professional suit or simple blouse and business casual skirt.

That all changed junior year...you were usually so careful, but one night out with your friends, a few too many drinks, so many guys, and...well.

Boom. Babytown. Population: you.

You knew this would possibly end your career expectations, but against the advice of most friends and family, you decided to keep it. You managed to finish your semester, just barely, before having to take time off. And when you were secure enough to go back to school, it was mostly night and online classes. Still, you didn’t regret the decision for a moment. You gave birth to a beautiful, healthy boy, as sweet, smart, and kind as you.

And against all odds, your career didn’t turn purely into “single mom.” It took several years longer than most, but you finished your degree, chipping away at it credit by credit. A degree let you fit in an underpaid internship amongst the several minimum wage jobs that barely kept you and your boy afloat. An internship that soon turned into a solid position with benefits, letting you trade in the waitressing and hotel desk jobs for a real career. Which led to an MBA...before you knew it, you were head of HR at a fairly large company just shy of your mid 30s. You were as well-off if not better than most of your peers.

Yet...you always sighed at what you missed out on. You said you wouldn’t trade having a kid for the world - which was true. But those long days and nights of constant work, little sleep, trying to balance everything...it was stressful. Your friends all drifted off with their own lives, you barely a ghost not included in any yearbooks or reunions. Dating was a non-starter - even with your well-paying position, age and a child were hurdles in today’s dating culture. You just wished you could let your hair back again and relax...

Your chance seemed to come. You received an award at work, giving you a nice bonus and a two-week vacation at a spa resort for two. You were thrilled at the time off...except for the “for two” part. You  couldn’t find any guys interested - even practically advertising it on dating sites did little but draw a few spambots and get your account temporarily suspended. You disappointedly considered selling them and just taking a starvation...until you looked at the tickets more closely...

“Valid for couple’s spa vacation package or ‘mother/daughter bonding’ package.” 

That gave you hope...your son, now 18 and heading into the summer before college, had plenty of time before starting his studies. Perhaps you could...”condition” him. Just for two weeks! You knew a few “programs” that could help. He wouldn’t even realize if it was done right. You’ve given him the world his whole life...he can temporarily give you a daughter, right? It would be a great bonding opportunity...not to mention, an opportunity for you to explore some “feminine urges” you always wished you could have experienced with your girlfriends back in college...
————————————
If you read this far, thanks for your interest! The prompt will involve the mother (you) conditioning her son (me) into being her daughter for a special lengthy spa retreat vacation. I’d expect gentle femdom, femdom, feminization, brainwashing, pegging, and more to be involved. Would love to focus on the actually changes, mental and physical, as well as the “sexytime” stuff :p Hard limits include gore, extreme pain/violence, and death. If you have any other favorite kinks, just ask!

I’ve been having a shit time trying to find a job in my wheelhouse. I broadened my job search to anything entry level just because I need a job. I received an offer from statefarm insurance yesterday and accepted it. 

I’m a recent college grad with a BA in psych and has experience solely with criminals and addicts. I know nothing about insurance or sales for that matter. 

Here’s a bit of a back story: 

I’m 22. I’m the girl who had it all, the nice car, the perfect boyfriend, nice family. Just the girl next door. Until I got a phone call from my boyfriends mom in January telling me my boyfriend is dead. He got his hands on some pills laced with fentanyl and he died on the bathroom floor. Little did I know, he was battling an uphill battle with addiction. A week beforehand, I accepted an internship in probation and parole. 80% of my case load was dealing with drug addicts.

My internship became extremely personal. I shared my story with the hard heads that said oh I’ll never OD. I began to sympathize and understand things I never thought I’d deal with or understand. Like many people,  I thought of addicts as a “junkie” until January 20th 2018. 

Tonight, I was sitting at my kitchen table and 8:50PM my phone rings and an unknown number pops up. I ignore it, thinking it’s some bs call or someone has the wrong number. I listen to the voicemail that was left and it’s from a rehab facility that I applied to a while ago. 

I immediately call him back on the cellphone number he left. He was very happy to hear from me and said you are quite impressive on paper. I want to bring you in for an interview, how does tomorrow sound? I accepted the offer for the interview. 

Ironically tomorrow was the day I was going to apply for my insurance license to begin working for statefarm. I think this is all just a big sign flashing, telling me don’t do it. 

If you can’t tell, I’m pretty stoked. "
8uq2jx,36,2018-06-28,The Scarab At Jung's Window. The Subconscious as A Mediator between Inner Self and Outer Reality,Earth-Is-A-Prison,C_S_T,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8uq2jx/the_scarab_at_jungs_window_the_subconscious_as_a/,"&gt;Jung's most famous case of synchronicity in psychotherapy was with the woman patient who recited a dream she had had in which she was given a costly piece of jewelry, a golden scarab (beetle). While she was relating the dream Jung heard something tapping at the window from outside. Jung opened the window and in flew a scarbaeid beetle which he caught in his hand, its gold-green color resembling that of the golden scarab in the woman's dream. He handed the beetle to his patient and said, ""Here is your scarab.""

&gt;The woman, who was highly educated and intelligent, had been resisting dealing with her feelings and emotions. She was very adept at rationalization and intellectualizing. After the scary scarab experience she was able to get to the root of her emotional problems and to make real progress in her growth toward wholeness.

&gt;The universe had somehow cooperated in her therapy by giving her a meaningful coincidence. The scarab that tapped on Jung's window was no ordinary bug. It was somewhat rare in those parts. It has, as one writer notes, ""perennially symbolized transformation and metamorphosis, the very things that this woman's unconscious was calling out for. It was as if the struggle in her soul had been projected like a powerful movie image into the outer world"" (SMALL MIRACLES, p. 20) and the universe responded accordingly.

I've had things like this happen to me. I've manifested things into my life, or have seen things in the minds eye come true later in the future.

A few years ago I was thinking about getting a job in the oil industry because its good money, and spent a few days looking at different positions and how to get into the industry. A week later I helped my parents at a garage sale and sole a whole bunch of vinyl records to this guys who talked up a storm with me about conspiracies and being consciously aware. He asked me what I do for work, and I told him it was just a side job doing valet parking at the time. He then mentions he's in the Oil industry and will help get me in if I want to. I was floored, shocked, and never the same since then. 

I've also manifested things into my life that were a mistake. ""Careful what you ask for is true."" The Hot intern at work, yeah I got her but she was a manipulative hot head with tons of emotional daddy issues. That motorcyle I always wanted? Yeah I ended up crashing. That 6 month job in japan they needed somebody to manage which was triple the pay? Yeah it was not worth going through the most stressful period of my life I've ever been through.

All this to say, that reality is malleable, and somehow, the subconscious is a sort of mediator between our conscious minds and external reality. Be careful what you put in it"
8uq53x,57,2018-06-29,July is (almost) here [Residency],deer_field_perox,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8uq53x/july_is_almost_here_residency/,"Our interns already had their first day recently. With some creative liberties, this was one of my interns' first patient of residency:

It's day 1 in the MICU. You get a 63 year old woman with diabetes, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and recently diagnosed renal cell cancer who got chemo a month ago, admitted to the floor 3 days ago for acute kidney injury and pain control. Your senior brings her over to the MICU due to altered mental status. Knowing that it's your first day, he's about to basically dictate orders to you when the pager goes off for a cardiac arrest. He says to do the best you can with the new admit and page him if there's an emergency. You find a woman who is basically making incoherent sounds. She has edema up to the knees and elbows, a soft ejection murmur, diminished lung sounds, prominent masses in her abdomen, hands and feet feel warm. Her pulse is 130, BP is intermittently unreadable because of the edema issue but eventually looks like 75/35, respiratory rate is 40, pulse ox is 91% on room air, temp is 100.4 F/38.0 C. 

At this point you are just a little freaked out because the last time you laid eyes on a patient was in October last year but you force yourself to remember your training so while the ICU nurses are getting her hooked up to the monitors and stuff you pull her up on the computer. Luckily the floor team drew some labs before transferring, and they look like this:

WBC 20, Hgb 10, Plt 180  
Na 130, K 4, Cl 100, bicarb 6, BUN 50, creatinine 5  
AST 500, ALT 300, total bili 5, direct bili 4, alk phos 400, albumin 2, protein 5  
pH 7.11, PCO2 12, PO2 60 (arterial stick)  
Lactic acid 11

In coming up with the next steps, try to think about the following questions:

* What is the number one problem that is causing all of these derangements and is going to kill this patient in the next 30 minutes before your senior gets back from the code? (Hint: this is one word)
* What is the main underlying diagnosis that is causing problem number one? (Another single word)
* What do you immediately need to do to start managing problem number one?
* What main complication is likely to arise in the next 30 minutes while your senior is stabilizing that other patient, and what do you need to be prepared to do? (ie, what is problem number two)

Good luck! (My intern did not deal with this alone, luckily there was no code I had to run off to)"

Sieg Heil! I mean... Beep Boop, I am a robot.

My purpose is to find and link comments in r/Politics that contain the word 'Hitler'

Since my birth, I have found a total of 14456 Hitlers in r/Politics. On average, I found 81 Hitlers per day.

Today, I read 55467 comments. In total, I have read 7464973 comments."
8uqts6,2,2018-06-29,I need to open an US bank account so that I can receive my salary for my short-term internship. What's the best bank for that? (in Silicon Valley),Cernstudent,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8uqts6/i_need_to_open_an_us_bank_account_so_that_i_can/,"I'm an European on an internship in the US until end of August. It seems I only get my salary if I can provide an US bank account where they can send the money to via direct deposit. After some asking around, it seems most people recommend me to find a bank that has some kind of join incentive (e.g. ""you get X$ if you join us and deposit at least 10000$ on your account in the first month"", [example from a bank called 'chase'](https://accounts.chase.com/consumer/banking/online?px=GD69222&amp;jp_cmp=rb/401638/aff/3_47/na&amp;CODE=SWlnSnn6x54-XAymwa.1tKy3H95gkwNgiQ&amp;MSC=SWlnSnn6x54-XAymwa.1tKy3H95gkwNgiQ) ).

My question is now: Is there any bank or special offer that can be recommended for that? I'll only use the bank account for paying my taxes (which I think I need an US bank account for) and forwarding the rest of the money to my European account, so I believe I only need a good online banking functionality.

Timeline: I'll leave the US on the first of September.

8uqyu7,1748,2018-06-29,"Seagull Talks with Devs Goodman, Mercer, Kaplan, and Mourey on Stream | Recap from Twitch VOD",Seagull_No1_Fanboy,Competitiveoverwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/8uqyu7/seagull_talks_with_devs_goodman_mercer_kaplan_and/,"Today Seagull played the new hero and PTR patch [on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=34m50s) while talking to some of the OW devs. Here's a rough recap.

###[Geoff Goodman | Principal Designer](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=34m50s)

&gt;- Wrecking Ball was one of their original concepts of heroes

&gt;- Started off as a ""junkyard magnet bot""

&gt;- Went through a lot of different iteration

&gt;- Adam Puhl was the initial designer on Wrecking Ball

&gt;- Slam and Grappling Claw abilities were added later

&gt;- They talk about Grappling Claw ""rollouts"" and the ability's depth

&gt;- Wrecking Ball is faster down slopes and slides down naturally

&gt;- Mines from the ultimate Minefield separate more the higher up Wrecking Ball is since the mines drop at an angle

&gt;- Mines can be destroyed and currently have 50 HP. Currently do 120/130 damage. Good combo with Zarya's ult

&gt;- Great at area denial, weak to CC, huge hitbox

&gt;- Adaptive shield buffer doesn't give ult charge to enemy team when they shoot it. Lucio's sound barrier currently does. They might change his.

&gt;- Didn't want to add more shields to the game to add more visual clutter so they came up with adaptive shield

&gt;- Adaptive shield has 100 extra shields plus 100 per enemy hero in his range which is shown by an indicator in the bottom of the HUD

&gt;- Seagull thinks the community won't call the hero ""Wrecking Ball""

&gt;- Piledriver drives enemies up into the air and limits airstrafing similar to Doomfist's Uppercut

&gt;- Piledriver can do from 20 to 100 damage, has falloff

&gt;- Minefield visuals/sounds worked on as recently as two days ago, have been iterating a lot on it

&gt;- Seagull tries to grapple under King's Row 

**Seagull asks if the game is getting too crazy with a rolling hamster ball and a hero with like a 10 second cooldown teleporter**

&gt;- Game has always been a little crazy, important you feel like there are unique opportunities for every hero and what they can bring to a team

&gt;- Seagull's team gets backcapped by the enemy Wrecking Ball grappling under King's Row - [**Video**](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousLongButterflyBlargNaut)

&gt;- Getting feedback that Sym's primary fire is difficult to charge up/has short range, but concerned about insane damage potential

&gt;- Sym offers many more options now

&gt;- Seagull keeps getting sleep darted

&gt;- Recognize the feedback on Sombra changes that some think the nerfs outweigh the buffs. Will keep an eye on her

&gt;- Aware of bug where ball mode animation doesn't show correctly

&gt;- Minefield lasts 20 seconds

&gt;- Ideas tried with Torb

&gt;     - Turret tossed like Tracer's pulse bomb

&gt;     - Turret levels up as it gets kills

&gt;     - Automatically levels up to level 2(still testing)

&gt;     - Mini molten cores as ability

&gt;     - Ult as something different

&gt;     - Seagull brings up his critbox size

&gt;     - Much faster reload while ulting

&gt;- Trying to make Torb more viable on offense while wanting to keep the turret

&gt;- Still heavily in flux on Torb

**Chat Questions**

**ANA?**

&gt;- Trying to bring her more in balance while keeping her weaknesses. Mobility buff unlikely.

&gt;- Seagull mentions healers were weaker across the board in the past. Mercy and Zen had less healing

&gt;- Realize Ana shooting through teammates had a cost(prehealing)

&gt;- Don't believe Ana needs a total rework

&gt;- Seagull thinks Mercy is just the easier healer to play with her raw healing throughput and mobility

**Falloff damage changes?**

&gt;- Should help McCree, Soldier, Mei against Widow or Pharah

&gt;- Mei no falloff damage may not stay. Was tried in the past

&gt;- Mei likely strong if Wrecking Ball is strong

**REIN?**

&gt;- Currently trying to fix all his bugs. Actively working on them. Likely a lot fixed in next patch

&gt;- Seagull mentions Rein's hammer swing is much stronger then at launch since you can knock enemies back

&gt;- Recognizes feedback that Wrecking Ball brings more knockback things that mess with Rein

&gt;- Working on a systemic change to make charging characters colliding with each other more consistent

&gt;- Should be knocking down both characters. Might be different for Brig. Possibly in next patch

&gt;- Afterwards they will reevaluate to make sure Rein is still viable

###[Scott Mercer | Principal Designer](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=01h21m46s)

&gt;- Team did an amazing job on the animations, models, sounds, everything

&gt;- Wrecking Ball will be available in competitive mode 2 weeks after release on the live version. Same for Symmetra

&gt;- Sym won't be available in OWL playoffs. Will be on Hanzo patch 1.25

&gt;- LFG has reduced toxicity by a lot

&gt;- People naturally assume the worst about their teammates in solo queue. Not the same through grouping for the most part

&gt;- Recognizes feedback on allowing private profiles. Seagull likes the feature and thinks it has helped reduce toxicity

&gt;- Already have changes coming through feedback

&gt;     - Filters weren't saving. Will be fixed

&gt;- Seagull's game crashes. PTR :P

&gt;- SMS Protect for Top 500. Not anywhere near half of Top 500 were smurfs as some claimed. Seagull says ""Thanks Calvin""

&gt;- Need 50 games played with SMS protect on to qualify for leaderboard. 

&gt;- Not all groups are shown at once in LFG. Features help players experience OW how they want

&gt;- Seagull mentions endorsements have made players nicer. 

&gt;- Trying to correct player behavior through warnings before bans. Adding more feedback

**Chat Questions**

**Colorblind Mode?**

&gt;- Working on more colorblind features. People on dev team who are colorblind. Multiple forms of colorblindness making it difficult

**Guild/Clan Systems?**

&gt;- Something we are definitely very interested in. I think it would be an awesome addition to game. We'll see what we do in the future with that

&gt;- Seagull comments on how Sym's ult is similar to Winston's shield in that you can dance back and forth

**Hero most exicited about going into next season?**

&gt;- Wrecking Ball. So much fun to play

&gt;- Hoping for clever strats with Sym's teleporter

&gt;- Seagull worried about mobility creep. One of the reasons for the damage falloff changes

&gt;- World Cup Group Stages possibly playing on PTR patch

&gt;- Sym turrets can be shot while moving through the air. Seagull mentions seeing a McCree High Noon being blocked by a turret

**Replays/Demos?**

&gt;- Still working on it. Want to do it. Want to do them at a high quality, easy to use, don't have to manage all the files. Want to do it right.

&gt;- Trying to stomp out server/client side bugs like you see when a Tracer bomb looks like it sticks in OWL

&gt;- Want to allow players to learn through VOD reviews that are not just limited to whatever the observer was looking at. 

&gt;- Seagull mentions he watched other OWL D.vas' VODs which allowed him to learn D.va quickly. Would be a great tool to help players improve

**Genji?**

&gt;- Genji still has a lot of amazing things about him. Recognizes he's not as viable as before though he still can be run.

&gt;- Nowhere near Sym who was never picked in OWL

&gt;- Trying to make Torb less snowbally like they have done with Sym

&gt;- Not all custom game options working for Wrecking Ball yet.

&gt;     - One of them is roll mode is always on

&gt;- Sym's ult was getting destroyed on the Oasis map with the cars because of the cars

**Lucio?**

&gt;- Will have to wait and see. Speedboost is a great mechanic. Still seems viable

**Map Editor?**

&gt;- Not going to get to anytime soon. Mentions he got his start in design because of the Starcraft editor. Want to do more, but it's a long process. Continue to have hope.

**Competitive Rewards?**

&gt;- Don't want to add anymore since people should play competitive mode for competitive play and don't think rewards like gold weapons will make that better

**Tournament Systems**

&gt;- Worked on WC3 tournament system. Thinks it could be really cool. Matter of priorities. Top 500 kinda provides that. Could see a more short term super competitive system in the future. Nothing super soon

###[Jeff Kaplan | Game Director](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=02h07m41s)

&gt;- Heard they singlehandedly saved the game with LFG and then destroyed it by releasing a hamster as a hero

&gt;- Used to not have to interact with teleporter, but could troll team

&gt;- Seagull mentions Sym's left click doesn't seem worth it in most cases. Devs talked about if it was in a proper place yesterday. Think Zarya is in a good place. Not done with Sym

&gt;- Seagull brings up he tried to exploit endorsements by unfriending his friends to get endorsed

&gt;- Jeff asks what teleporters will bring in OWL - Seagull says teams will no longer have to wait on cooldowns as much to engage

&gt;- Just wants to see Symmetra played once in OWL. Won't be in OWL playoffs since it's such a major change. 

&gt;- Feels bad for reliability engineers who didn't want to put the PTR patch out since it had many bugs still

&gt;- Happy to have Seagull back streaming

&gt;- Seagull doesn't think players outside of the person playing Sombra will notice her changes much

&gt;- Surprised Sombras contested the objective since he didn't see it at his skill level. Made fun of Genji main friend for having top objective time

&gt;- Thinks Genji is a highly effective character who has his place. Depends on meta. 2 top played heroes by a longshot were Genji and Mercy before Brigitte was released. Would cause a lot of community uproar for Mercy to be nerfed

&gt;- Seagull still upset Genji triple jump was removed

&gt;- Wrecking Ball was one of the earlier characters concepted

&gt;- Arnold Tsang, assistant art director, designed the early prototype of Wrecking Ball and gave him his name

&gt;- Initially Wrecking Ball's kit was all to do with magnetism. Hopefully we will see these ideas in future heroes

&gt;- Tsang later sent out mailing lists showing the hamster as part of Wrecking Ball

&gt;- Wrecking Ball became the most controversial hero within the dev team. Half the team think it's the best thing ever while the other half thinks it's ruining the game

&gt;- Jeffrey Brill put a meeting on the calendar for 10 years from now(6 years now) to ask did Wrecking Ball wreck the game

&gt;- Explains lore of Hammond. Genetic therapy made him more intelligent and larger. He's now Pikachu sized. Primates on Lunar Colony revolted. Hammond hitches a ride on Winston's escape module, but detaches and lands near Junkertown. 

&gt;- Winston and Hammond can communicate since of course all animals can communicate with each other

&gt;- Hammond can only speak through a sound board through his mech. Two voice actors for Wrecking Ball. One for the hamster, one for the mech

&gt;- Saw a great LFG called ""I need healing"" that was one tank spot and five support ones

&gt;- Wrecking Ball's guns sound and look different when he's running low on ammo

&gt;- Infinity Ward helped them learn how to make weapons more visceral

&gt;- Seagull worried about adding another mobile tank with good burst damage. Winston/Wrecking Ball/D.va dive could be very strong

&gt;- Seagull thinks Zen, Reaper, Mei, Sym, basically any character with CC will be good against Wrecking Ball.

&gt;- Wrecking Ball has a lot of easy knobs they can tune if he is unbalanced. Don't want to lose fun factor

&gt;- Seagull believes his adaptive shields will likely need a nerf

&gt;- [Stream crashed](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278714582)

&gt;- Jeff apologizes for being a small indie company

**Chat Questions**

**Optimization?**

&gt;- Will look into optimizing the game

**Colorblind Optimization?**

&gt;- Almost made 1.26 patch. Will be able to set color of hero outlines instead of just red.

**Reinhardt?**

&gt;- Working on fixing his bugs first then they will look if he needs a buff

&gt;- Seagull asks about wallclimb bugs. Not actively working on them. Asks for video clips of bugs so they can reproduce them

###[Ryan Mourey | Servers Engineer](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278714582?t=07m11s)

&gt;- Worked on LFG

&gt;- Seagull thinks Wrecking Ball will work best with Winston and D.va

&gt;- Seagull believes some pros will become insane on Wrecking Ball and concerned about his ultimate damage

**Chat Questions**

**Plans for LFG?**

&gt;- Nothing major planned yet. Watching feedback

**Funniest bug had to deal with?**

&gt;- No clip as Baby D.va on Volskaya

&gt;- Seagull comments on minefield visuals being hard to differentiate between friendly and enemy

**Favorite OW map?**

&gt;- Château. Love deathmatch

**Increasing avoid count?**

&gt;- Worried about increasing avoid count as it could possibly increase queue times especially at high MMRs. No definite answer

**Silhouettes through walls for anyone not just supports?**

&gt;- Will have to ask about that. Seagull mentions he grouped up with his Zen to see where he was easily since his outline was green

**Decaying Endorsements?**

&gt;- Level 5 is very hard to get. There is always decay above level 1. Depends on in game time apparently

**Colorblind options?**

&gt;- Hopefully not too far away

**Why can't you get endorsed in mystery heroes/arcade modes?**

&gt;- Meant for more serious modes. May change in future

**144 tick servers?**

&gt;- Hard on servers and latency of online has an impact

**Biggest challenge faced with bugs?**

&gt;- Reproducing them. Can't figure out how they happen. Best thing to do is take a video of the bug

**Programming language of choice?**

&gt;- C++ have programmed in many languages

&gt;- Seagull mentions FPS drops when pressing tab and Mourey says they'll look into it

**Match History**

&gt;- Still a ways off

**Will there ever be a scoreboard/veto maps?**

&gt;- Probably not

**How did you end of working at Blizzard?**

&gt;- Started as an intern. Made mobile games when younger. Advises others to just start making games, you learn a ton.

8uqyza,39,2018-06-29,"Seagull Talks with Devs Goodman, Mercer, Kaplan, and Mourey on Stream | Recap from Twitch VOD",Seagull_No1_Fanboy,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/8uqyza/seagull_talks_with_devs_goodman_mercer_kaplan_and/,"Today Seagull played the new hero and PTR patch [on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=34m50s) while talking to some of the OW devs. Here's a rough recap.

###[Geoff Goodman | Principal Designer](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=34m50s)

&gt;- Wrecking Ball was one of their original concepts of heroes

&gt;- Started off as a ""junkyard magnet bot""

&gt;- Went through a lot of different iteration

&gt;- Adam Puhl was the initial designer on Wrecking Ball

&gt;- Slam and Grappling Claw abilities were added later

&gt;- They talk about Grappling Claw ""rollouts"" and the ability's depth

&gt;- Wrecking Ball is faster down slopes and slides down naturally

&gt;- Mines from the ultimate Minefield separate more the higher up Wrecking Ball is since the mines drop at an angle

&gt;- Mines can be destroyed and currently have 50 HP. Currently do 120/130 damage. Good combo with Zarya's ult

&gt;- Great at area denial, weak to CC, huge hitbox

&gt;- Adaptive shield buffer doesn't give ult charge to enemy team when they shoot it. Lucio's sound barrier currently does. They might change his.

&gt;- Didn't want to add more shields to the game to add more visual clutter so they came up with adaptive shield

&gt;- Adaptive shield has 100 extra shields plus 100 per enemy hero in his range which is shown by an indicator in the bottom of the HUD

&gt;- Seagull thinks the community won't call the hero ""Wrecking Ball""

&gt;- Piledriver drives enemies up into the air and limits airstrafing similar to Doomfist's Uppercut

&gt;- Piledriver can do from 20 to 100 damage, has falloff

&gt;- Minefield visuals/sounds worked on as recently as two days ago, have been iterating a lot on it

&gt;- Seagull tries to grapple under King's Row 

**Seagull asks if the game is getting too crazy with a rolling hamster ball and a hero with like a 10 second cooldown teleporter**

&gt;- Game has always been a little crazy, important you feel like there are unique opportunities for every hero and what they can bring to a team

&gt;- Seagull's team gets backcapped by the enemy Wrecking Ball grappling under King's Row - [**Video**](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousLongButterflyBlargNaut)

&gt;- Getting feedback that Sym's primary fire is difficult to charge up/has short range, but concerned about insane damage potential

&gt;- Sym offers many more options now

&gt;- Seagull keeps getting sleep darted

&gt;- Recognize the feedback on Sombra changes that some think the nerfs outweigh the buffs. Will keep an eye on her

&gt;- Aware of bug where ball mode animation doesn't show correctly

&gt;- Minefield lasts 20 seconds

&gt;- Ideas tried with Torb

&gt;     - Turret tossed like Tracer's pulse bomb

&gt;     - Turret levels up as it gets kills

&gt;     - Automatically levels up to level 2(still testing)

&gt;     - Mini molten cores as ability

&gt;     - Ult as something different

&gt;     - Seagull brings up his critbox size

&gt;     - Much faster reload while ulting

&gt;- Trying to make Torb more viable on offense while wanting to keep the turret

&gt;- Still heavily in flux on Torb

**Chat Questions**

**ANA?**

&gt;- Trying to bring her more in balance while keeping her weaknesses. Mobility buff unlikely.

&gt;- Seagull mentions healers were weaker across the board in the past. Mercy and Zen had less healing

&gt;- Realize Ana shooting through teammates had a cost(prehealing)

&gt;- Don't believe Ana needs a total rework

&gt;- Seagull thinks Mercy is just the easier healer to play with her raw healing throughput and mobility

**Falloff damage changes?**

&gt;- Should help McCree, Soldier, Mei against Widow or Pharah

&gt;- Mei no falloff damage may not stay. Was tried in the past

&gt;- Mei likely strong if Wrecking Ball is strong

**REIN?**

&gt;- Currently trying to fix all his bugs. Actively working on them. Likely a lot fixed in next patch

&gt;- Seagull mentions Rein's hammer swing is much stronger then at launch since you can knock enemies back

&gt;- Recognizes feedback that Wrecking Ball brings more knockback things that mess with Rein

&gt;- Working on a systemic change to make charging characters colliding with each other more consistent

&gt;- Should be knocking down both characters. Might be different for Brig. Possibly in next patch

&gt;- Afterwards they will reevaluate to make sure Rein is still viable

###[Scott Mercer | Principal Designer](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/278653958?t=01h21m46s)

&gt;- Team did an amazing job on the animations, models, sounds, everything

&gt;- Wrecking Ball will be available in competitive mode 2 weeks after release on the live version. Same for Symmetra

&gt;- Sym won't be available in OWL playoffs. Will be on Hanzo patch 1.25

&gt;- LFG has reduced toxicity by a lot

&gt;- People naturally assume the worst about their teammates in solo queue. Not the same through grouping for the most part

&gt;- Recognizes feedback on allowing private profiles. Seagull likes the feature and thinks it has helped reduce toxicity

&gt;- Already have changes coming through feedback

&gt;     - Filters weren't saving. Will be fixed

&gt;- Seagull's game crashes. PTR :P

&gt;- SMS Protect for Top 500. Not anywhere near half of Top 500 were smurfs as some claimed. Seagull says ""Thanks Calvin""

&gt;- Need 50 games played with SMS protect on to qualify for leaderboard. 

&gt;- Not all groups are shown at once in LFG. Features help players experience OW how they want

&gt;- Seagull mentions endorsements have made players nicer. 

&gt;- Trying to correct player behavior through warnings before bans. Adding more feedback

**Chat Questions**

**Colorblind Mode?**

&gt;- Working on more colorblind features. People on dev team who are colorblind. Multiple forms of colorblindness making it difficult

**Guild/Clan Systems?**

&gt;- Something we are definitely very interested in. I think it would be an awesome addition to game. We'll see what we do in the future with that

&gt;- Seagull comments on how Sym's ult is similar to Winston's shield in that you can dance back and forth

**Hero most exicited about going into next season?**

8urd6p,8,2018-06-29,Disconnect between interviews and actual work,wearefarming101,csinterviewproblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/csinterviewproblems/comments/8urd6p/disconnect_between_interviews_and_actual_work/,"So, before the summer I interviewed for some Web Dev jobs. Nothing too fancy, since I was just applying as an intern.

Some companies (the big names ones) asked the sort of questions you’d expect to see in competitive programming.

I can do web Dev, have built applications in the past, but do not have much experience with algorithm based questions. So, after doing poorly on some interviews, I started wondering, is there really a need to test all candidates on those sort of questions?

I understand it gives employers a sense of our critical thinking abilities. Most of the questions they ask, people have already made implementations for, and the fact they we have to come up with our answer, which matches their answer in that short of amount doesn’t sound like a good way to test someone’s skill.

I’m just wondering what your opinion is on the interview process."
8urv52,9,2018-06-29,What would Dave do?,[deleted],DaveRamsey,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaveRamsey/comments/8urv52/what_would_dave_do/,"I’m gonna be honest, friends. I’m burnt out as hell right now.

Current jobs and time commitments:

- 40 hours a week as a hotel night auditor ($10/hr)
- 30 hours a week (part-time) working at a local hospital ($18/hr)
- 0-24 hours a week (PRN) working at *another* hospital... during the summer it’s consistently 24 hours since so many salaried folks take PTO ($15/hr)
- 16 hours a week at an unpaid internship (required for my masters degree which I have been cash flowing) 
- 12 hours of class
- 8 hours a week working in a research lab (small stipend but not enough to really count, so consider it volunteer work)

I’m SO burnt out. I hate my hotel job but it is a way to get the debt snowball rolling. With this setup I’m averaging an annual salary of about $55k, which is great (I have ~$100k of debt from being stupid in my younger years). But it is at the expense of my health and sanity. I’m getting about 3-5 hours of sleep per day, and that’s usually split up in 3 naps because of my schedule. I’m actually at my hotel job right now typing this, and the minute I get off the clock I’m driving 20 miles to go to internship. I’ll be awake for 36 hours with only a 2-hour nap in-between.

I know Dave likes to say, “You can sleep when you’re debt free”, but there has to be a boundary. I’m just having a really difficult time figuring out where the boundary is. I’ve been throwing ~$2000/mo at my debt snowball and that’s been feeling AMAZING, and I’m so scared to lose that momentum if I quit a job. (The hotel would be the first to go - graveyard shift is killing me...)"
8uryia,1,2018-06-29,[Futa4F/M] Celebrities with something extra,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8uryia/futa4fm_celebrities_with_something_extra/,"'ello there!

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this little post of mine, I hope that you'll find something that interests you in it!

First time writing a post here on reddit so might not be the best! You have been warned.

**One liners will be ignored. Put some effort into it like I did with this post.**

Quick Edit: I'd also be very open to playing rule34 styled things as well. Like Arya stark or Daenarys Targarean in the GoT universe and such!

So, I'll fully admit that I'm a very big fan of celebrities and the status that they hold in the eyes of many 'normal' people. I'm also a big fan of futanari/shemales who's packing big piece of swinging meat between their legs. So I thought, why not pair those two things together and made a RP post about it?

Needless to say, I'm looking to play some very well endowed celebrities (internet celebs included, like youtubers!) who gets into all kinds of lewd and naughty fun with people that they meet and work with. While I am primarily looking for female partners, I am very much open to partners who plays feminine boys as well.

Please be literate, detailed and be able to write decent amounts of text. I'm a multi-paragraph rper myself.

Some ideas to get the thoughts rolling, but keep in mind I'd be more than happy to hear any other ideas as well.

Personal Assistant: You're a personal assistant to the stars, you get to meet all the most famous and hot actresses and singers. All from the women from the all too popular Game of Thrones series to singers like Rihanna and Taylor swift. You get to follow them to the nicest locations, to the best resorts, to their own getaways and houses scattered across the world. Of course your job is to keep them happy, to get them the food they want, the entertainment they want, the clothes they want, the alcohol the they and so on. But since you're in such a high paying job and getting very nice bonuses because of it.. Well.. You have to take care of their other needs, any time, any where.

Comic Con meet up (works with any Con really): A con is always a good place to get the chance to meet some celebs, maybe they're doing a meet and greet, maybe they're doing a bit of autograph signing, maybe they're just nerds that wants to enjoy it like a normal person? Whatever the reason, you get to meet the celeb(s) of your dream! Maybe you met them after a Q&amp;A where they thought you were cute when you fumbled with your question, maybe you met them back at the hotel. You couldn't quite remember, but here you are regardless.. What luck, eh?

Co-worker: Being an up and coming young individual in the industry can be daunting to say the least. There's always someone that's more important than you, always someone who knows more than you, always someone that can get you fired with one phone call just around the corner when you're running with that hot coffee in your hand. Needless to say, you have to be careful. But at the same time it's a fantastic opportunity! Maybe you get to know your more famous co-star privately? Maybe you want to make that sex scene just look that more real? Maybe you actually did make some enemies and are trying to make up for it?

Intern: Let's face it, being an intern sucks. You always have to go get food and coffee for stuck up producers and even just to the people one step higher than you on the company ladder. But it's not all bad. You still get to meet plenty of beautiful famous people. Perhaps you see this as an opportunity to get close to them? Befriend them? Use them to maybe make your life a bit easier?.. Or maybe you simply end up as their toy?

'ello there!

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this little post of mine, I hope that you'll find something that interests you in it!

First time writing a post here on reddit so might not be the best! You have been warned.

**One liners will be ignored. Put some effort into it like I did with this post.**

Quick Edit: I'd also be very open to playing rule34 styled things as well. Like Arya stark or Daenarys Targarean in the GoT universe and such!

So, I'll fully admit that I'm a very big fan of celebrities and the status that they hold in the eyes of many 'normal' people. I'm also a big fan of futanari/shemales who's packing big piece of swinging meat between their legs. So I thought, why not pair those two things together and made a RP post about it?

Needless to say, I'm looking to play some very well endowed celebrities (internet celebs included, like youtubers!) who gets into all kinds of lewd and naughty fun with people that they meet and work with. While I am primarily looking for female partners, I am very much open to partners who plays feminine boys as well.

Please be literate, detailed and be able to write decent amounts of text. I'm a multi-paragraph rper myself.

Some ideas to get the thoughts rolling, but keep in mind I'd be more than happy to hear any other ideas as well.

Personal Assistant: You're a personal assistant to the stars, you get to meet all the most famous and hot actresses and singers. All from the women from the all too popular Game of Thrones series to singers like Rihanna and Taylor swift. You get to follow them to the nicest locations, to the best resorts, to their own getaways and houses scattered across the world. Of course your job is to keep them happy, to get them the food they want, the entertainment they want, the clothes they want, the alcohol the they and so on. But since you're in such a high paying job and getting very nice bonuses because of it.. Well.. You have to take care of their other needs, any time, any where.

Comic Con meet up (works with any Con really): A con is always a good place to get the chance to meet some celebs, maybe they're doing a meet and greet, maybe they're doing a bit of autograph signing, maybe they're just nerds that wants to enjoy it like a normal person? Whatever the reason, you get to meet the celeb(s) of your dream! Maybe you met them after a Q&amp;A where they thought you were cute when you fumbled with your question, maybe you met them back at the hotel. You couldn't quite remember, but here you are regardless.. What luck, eh?

Co-worker: Being an up and coming young individual in the industry can be daunting to say the least. There's always someone that's more important than you, always someone who knows more than you, always someone that can get you fired with one phone call just around the corner when you're running with that hot coffee in your hand. Needless to say, you have to be careful. But at the same time it's a fantastic opportunity! Maybe you get to know your more famous co-star privately? Maybe you want to make that sex scene just look that more real? Maybe you actually did make some enemies and are trying to make up for it? Maybe you're a child actor that ended up in a situation that you didn't quite plan for?

Intern: Let's face it, being an intern sucks. You always have to go get food and coffee for stuck up producers and even just to the people one step higher than you on the company ladder. But it's not all bad. You still get to meet plenty of beautiful famous people. Perhaps you see this as an opportunity to get close to them? Befriend them? Use them to maybe make your life a bit easier?.. Or maybe you simply end up as their toy when they find out you're really underage?

While I hate to do this, please write Big Dick Celeb in the title of your message to let me know you've read this far. Silly I know but best I could come up with! Also, please tell me some kinks, maybe some fav celebs and some thoughts on what you wanna do in the first message!

8us0pd,2,2018-06-29,My mother's golden child AKA herself,2015nesler,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8us0pd/my_mothers_golden_child_aka_herself/,"My mother stopped caring about me since the day I turned 8. my mom only cares about her golden child (my older brother) he is the middle child the attention he receives he doesn't even want. My brother is a super genius he graduated top of his highschool with the highest GPA in the school's history with a 4.67 he's only 19 and already making more than my father as a intern with PNC banking. Long story short my brother is already successful. Anyways my mother has been using my brother as a trophy or something she did all by herself. Every one of my brothers (even the successful one) truly despises this woman because of her bipolar outbreaks, pettiness, bitching, and (the reason I'm here) her narcissism. My mother trys to use my brother as an extension of herself. Something that could only have been done by herself. Saying things like ""things like (insert brother's name here) don't just happen!"" and believing he is her exact replica even though herself is a struggling real estate agent with a accounting bacholers at Duquesne. (Yeah something real hard to aquire) I have in total 3 brothers a 30yr old, a 26yr old, the golden child (19yr old). My mom was in a previous marriage before I was born with a man in which she had my 3 half brothers. She than was cheated on by that man (because he was on the edge of insanity by being married to that monster) with an Asian lady ( this becomes important later in the story) so than 2 years after this divorce I'm born with her and my dad as her than boyfriend. I grow up a pretty normal 13 years until the day that it finally ""clicks"" my mother doesn't love me. She actually hates me for nothing I did just the matter alone that I exist. The reason why my mother doesn't love me is because I am not from the man that she loves she still married my father 3 years after my birth but really she does not love him or me. She is still attached to the man from her previous marriage the father of My Three Brothers. Her last real connection with that man was my 19 yr old brother. They divorced when he was at the age of 3. I can't really explain to you their relationship because I wasn't around I hadn't been born yet. Moving on. My 26 year-old brother and I became very close suddenly when I went to go see him in Phoenix one time and I expressed my feelings towards our mother to him for the first time. That day I realized that it wasn't just me that my mom supposedly hated. My brother had explain to me for his whole life since my other brother was born my mom just didn't care about him anymore. My mom puts him over anything and everyone. He then tell me stories about the fucked up shit my mother would constantly do. (PAUSE I AM SICK OF WRITING OUT 19YR OLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM NOW ON I WILL REFER TO HIM AS JACK)  like wishing we were never born or saying of how we were mistakes or you'll never be as good as Jack or oh you should look up to jack even though you're older than him. Or he would tell me stories of how Mom would criticize me even when I was little. one time she even encountered her ex-husband at one of Jack's swim meets and would complain about my existence when I was only around 6 years old while I was at home with my father. Another thing I should point out my mom kept the last name of her previous marriage she never changed it over to my father's last name because she claimed it would give her a connection with my brother. Even though that's bullshit that she's not willing to admit she's not over her previous husband. my dad would constantly beg her to change her name but then it ended up in a fight and then he just gave up after a few years. Even when I was a little kid a little little kid we're talking maybe from 3 to 8 years old my mom would still put my older brother me in the littlest of situations. when it came to things like Christmas or birthday or what he wanted to do my mom would always try her best for my brother instead of anyone else. Once Jack reached middle school and was exceeding in every aspect of life and education my mom really put him as a priority. She would try to invade his life even though he never wanted it. He put him on the gifted program and local ""kid genius"" gameshows (that's not a lie she actually got him on a goddamn gameshow) and other bullshit. you see my mom was a huge control freak. She saw herself as the end-all-be-all even jokingly naming herself ""The Matriarch"". When College came around and my brother was being thrown offers left and right and being able to go to almost any school that he wanted he decided to go to the University of Southern California or USC and I always thought that his decision was really weird because when I was younger I thought wow that's weird of him to go to the opposite side of the country (my family is from Pittsburgh) and in the same year my older brother the twenty-seven-year-old moved to Phoenix and my other other brother was in the military so he was constantly moving. So then it was just me alone with my mom and my dad. At this point I was in the 7th grade and was just starting to get into more academically challenging education. My mom would constantly bicker and bitch at me when I even got a little under an A on anything. My mother would even threaten if I got Below an 85% on any assignment I would be grounded for 9 weeks until I received my next report card with 100% in that subject. She would constantly claim to me that she never received anything lower than a A- in school EVER. My uncle (my mom's brother) lives with us since recovering from drug addiction but still pays rent and has a career and is just getting back on his feet. Anyway one time when she was bickering at me about my grades and glorifying herself as Einstein he then butts in and said ""wait that's not true I remember when you were a teen you failing a few classes"" she then cut him off and told him to shut up. So now I know that it's bullshit and she isn't as smart as she claims to be. After years of being told I was a dumbass for not being perfect in every subject in the Common Core subjects I truly thought that I was a dumbass and a failure. Never thinking positively of myself going into a deep depression at the young age of 13 and not being able to cope. Luckily at this age I had received a phone so I would constantly be in touch with my brother in Phoenix. We we talk almost daily for at least a half hour about stupid stuff like video games and pop culture. Until after awhile it moved into more heavy stuff speaking about how I'm going to deal with my mom and how he did it when he was my age. He said he dealt with the same things being called a dumbass or being ridiculed for not being perfect. And being discriminated against when it comes to ""mother's love"" and said when the day Jack was born that was the day that mom didn't treat me as her son. For no reason at all even before Jack became great just as a baby my mom thought that he was going to be amazing. And she was right but at the same time she put us aside like we were some distant relative. Anyway you guys I know that my mom just thinks that Jack is her world. But let's move on into the other fuckedupshit that she would constantly do. My mom is a severe bipolar. She has random outbreaks with random outcomes. During these outbreaks of rage she would mentally abuse me. With wishes of me being dead with wishes of me running away with wishes of me never existing ETC. Even when she at wasn't having one of these outbreaks she would still be very mean person. She is a super racist person so if you aren't white she has some beef with you for some odd reason. Hell two of my biggest fights with my mom worried about her being racist towards people she didn't know and badgering other people for talking to them. Like Jack was dating a Asian at USC and my mom didn't approve because her previous husband had cheated on her with an Asian. Since that day she associates all Asian women as whores. (Makes a whole lotta sense am I right? 😂) Even going to the extent as ""if Jack marries this woman I will kill myself"" even though jack had been dating this girl for me maybe 3 or 4 weeks. He still is by the way and she's still pissed about it 😂. Or one time one of us had a Muslim friend who was a female and my mom behind her back to us would complain saying shit like oh be sure not to look at her neck without her burka because she'll report you for rape or something like that. Or when she would get angry at us which happens a lot should use the N word as an insult. Just a lot of racist stuff I'm not going to list every single thing here because that would be a post in itself. When it came to things like her birthday Christmas or Mother's Day she would always expect the best. Usually most people don't spend over $50 on their mother's presents if they're under the age of 23 or something along those lines. But I have memories when I was 6 or 7 and I didn't get my mom a present (because I wasn't able to) and her then holding a grudge against me for months on end and being petty enough to just shit on my holidays as well. Take Mother's Day of this year for example she wanted to get something called micro-blading for her eyebrows. It's a procedure that costs $700! She asked me her son who is still  under the age of 18 for a lavish gift like that. I mean I have a well paying job but still that is absolutely ridiculous! And when I didn't get it for her she was still a little upset the morning of! One of my worst mom stories is when we went to Disney World the year before we went my grandfather had passed away my mom was very close to him and was very upset at his passing. One night we go out for Hibachi and my dad thinking it was Father's Day and was wrong by one day brought it up saying hey so did you guys get me anything as kind of like oh wow thanks guys because that would have pissed me off if nobody got me anything on Father's Day 😂 but he was quickly corrected and laughed off. Soon after you could see that my mom was clearly upset she was cranky and not really speaking to anybody I than ask her what's wrong and then the can of whoop-ass was unleashed. my mom starts yelling and screaming in the middle of the restaurant talking about why my dad would care about himself on Father's Day instead of her deceased father from a year ago. She than starts to cry and yell and my dad and starts to apologize. I then (thinking that this was a good idea) say to my upset mother ""hey mom maybe instead of thinking about the bad things that happened towards the end of his life maybe you should try to reminisce about the great things that you loved about him and maybe you'll feel a lot better"" she then full out screams in this restaurant shut the fuck up you don't know anything. And my dad then stuck up for me which she does a lot (I love my dad but hate my mom) saying that it wasn't my fault she's just in a mood this is a constant thing that I have to endure. That was just an example. At the same dinner before she flipped out, Jack had to leave to go back home for work so he joined us for Disney for a little bit then left and so did my other brother the same day in the morning. A total of 6 hours have passed since Jack left and mom was already reminiscing about how he when he was here like it was some distant memory. Jack hadn't gone back to Los Angeles he had literally just gone back home we will see him in two days once our vacation has ended. My other brother on the contrary had gone back to Phoenix and my mom would never see him for another year or so. so my mom was more concerned about my brother that she would see in two days then my brother that she wouldn't see for a whole year and I asked her why and her response was oh because he's whiny and jack isn't Jack is perfect. Got into arguments with her about why she loves Jack more than me and she says I don't love any child more than the other I just think Jack is the better role model for you. she talks about constantly of how I should be more like Jack instead of being myself. I should also mention the reason why my oldest brother isn't really involved in this relationship with our mother. When Jack was born he was already going to college so he never really experienced what me and my brother did when it came to Jack and Mom. This post is becoming absurdly long I might do a part to if I feel like it. Thank you for letting me vent and I'm proud to find a community of people that experienced the same thing that I did"

But hiring someone, depending on someone to train my clients, and represent my business freaks me out. 

Do any of you have a probationary period? Would you start with an internship? One thing I don't want to do is hire the first person that shows interest in the position. I want to find the RIGHT person. 

Also, what will I need when hiring? I assume this is the point where I find a lawyer to draw up contracts? What are the legalities I'll want to keep in mind when hiring? Are your trainers considered independent contractors or employees of the business?

Thanks in advance. As you can see, I'm not sure where to start and feeling a little overwhelmed. "

It must be a wonderful learning experience"" ""Come along now, It is not every day that your queen pays for your education""


Kinzie was getting real sick and tired of that king and queen by this point. The pair were Luddites, they had no clue what went into magic and they outlawed necromancy, Kinzie's one speciality, in their city. And yet time and time again her little back alley store of the occult and necromantic arts always got a visit from them. At first it was fun, of course it would be, but now they are getting a little too involved. Too much meddling and next thing she knew she was basically the royal witch. And now with so many jobs being sent by those two they fear that their witch may not have the best education possible in her own art. 


They sent out requests for anyone who could teach their witch, despite her clear protests against this idea, and that evil bitch replied. Genuinely the epitome of what an evil queen of an empire could look like was to be her mentor. She used her cruel evil magic to take over city after city after city and now Kinzie was an intern for this bitch. This was the kind of woman that the king and queen would send their champion on a quest to kill, but now Kinzie was working for free under her. 


She spent days upon days sorting old dusty spell tones, drawing runes so that that bitch didn't have to, every boring part of sorcery. But one day something changed. Turns out this evil queen had scrying charms on all of her dark knights, which meant that time when Kinzie fucked that big hung futa knight... She was watching. Not only was this severely embarrassing, now she knew about Kinzie's depraved and sadistic ass. But when Kinzie thought she was going to be mocked, humiliated, or something to that effect but no. She was taken to a door and stopped outside. 


""Kinzie, We both know I saw everything you did last night""


""Yeah... Let me guess you are go-""


""I couldn't be more proud of you. When I was your age I was too scared to hurt a fly""


""Uh... how old do you think I am?""


""Never mind that elf, there are more important matters at hand. Another attempt on my life was committed and those responsible are behind this door. I am entrusting you to show them what happens when you cross me. I will give you one chance to do this, do it right or end up in their position""


Well, it looked like kinzie had her work cut out for her


Thanks for reading this far! I have left whatever is on the other side of that door ambiguous so you can decide exactly what kind of character you want to play. You could play one adventurer tasked with bringing down the evil queen, now meeting a bad ending at the hands of Kinzie, or a whole party of adventurers. You could be anyone from a toned orc barbarian to a thick milf cleric of the church. I love a big huge cock and am a major size queen but I am willing to play with regular women too. As well as that Kinzie could definitley cast a little incantation to give one of those adventurers a cock. I am open to plenty ideas including characters and how the scenario will play out. I am both interested in short and long term roleplays and could do Either with ease. Understand coming into this however, that despite Kinzie's size, she is a dominant girl at heart. She is super kinky and a pretty on the sadistic side when it came down to it.

Kinzie, my character, Is something of a recluse. With long black hair and green eyes under forrest green robes, the girl was very petite. Her chest was flat, her build was small, but at least she had a cute butt, it was just about her best asset. Tight, perky, and round, it brought her a little bit of joy any time she saw people looking on. She only stood at about 5'3"" but she managed to make up for her small stature with her prowess in handling those she summoned from the underworld.

8utkt4,1,2018-06-29,M4F - Mother/teenaged daughter bonding! But with her adult son...,Hola2346,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8utkt4/m4f_motherteenaged_daughter_bonding_but_with_her/,"It hasn’t been easy for you, being a single mother.

You were the shining example of an attractive, successful co-ed in college. The girl who balanced school, a social life, and all the other millions of things you got involved in. The college student who wasn’t against a fun night out for drinks or at the club every once in a while, but also studious and dedicated to her studies and future first and foremost. The lady who loved the proactive crop tops and skintight leggings, but looked stunning in a professional suit or simple blouse and business casual skirt.

That all changed junior year...you were usually so careful, but one night out with your friends, a few too many drinks, so many guys, and...well.

Boom. Babytown. Population: you.

You knew this would possibly end your career expectations, but against the advice of most friends and family, you decided to keep it. You managed to finish your semester, just barely, before having to take time off. And when you were secure enough to go back to school, it was mostly night and online classes. Still, you didn’t regret the decision for a moment. You gave birth to a beautiful, healthy boy, as sweet, smart, and kind as you.

And against all odds, your career didn’t turn purely into “single mom.” It took several years longer than most, but you finished your degree, chipping away at it credit by credit. A degree let you fit in an underpaid internship amongst the several minimum wage jobs that barely kept you and your boy afloat. An internship that soon turned into a solid position with benefits, letting you trade in the waitressing and hotel desk jobs for a real career. Which led to an MBA...before you knew it, you were head of HR at a fairly large company while in your 30s. You were as well-off if not better than most of your peers.

Yet...you always sighed at what you missed out on. You said you wouldn’t trade having a kid for the world - which was true. But those long days and nights of constant work, little sleep, trying to balance everything...it was stressful. Your friends all drifted off with their own lives, you barely a ghost not included in any yearbooks or reunions. Dating was a non-starter - even with your well-paying position, age and a child were hurdles in today’s dating culture. You just wished you could let your hair back again and relax...

Your chance seemed to come. You received an award at work, giving you a nice bonus and a two-week vacation at a spa resort for two. You were thrilled at the time off...except for the “for two” part. You  couldn’t find any guys interested - even practically advertising it on dating sites did little but draw a few spambots and get your account temporarily suspended. You disappointedly considered selling them and just taking a starvation...until you looked at the tickets more closely...

“Valid for couple’s spa vacation package or ‘mother/daughter bonding’ package.” 

That gave you hope...your son, now in his 20z and with the summer off between semesters. Perhaps you could...”condition” him. Just for two weeks! You knew a few “programs” that could help. Perhaps knock him back to his teen or even preteen years, just...as a girl. He wouldn’t even realize if it was done right. And you read how it is important to be in touch with your feminine side even as a guy. You’ve given him the world his whole life...he can temporarily give you a daughter, right? It would be a great bonding opportunity...not to mention, an opportunity for you to explore some “feminine urges” you always wished you could have experienced with your girlfriends back in college...
————————————
If you read this far, thanks for your interest! The prompt will involve the mother (you) conditioning her son (me) into being her daughter for a special lengthy spa retreat vacation. I’d expect gentle femdom, femdom, feminization, brainwashing, pegging, and more to be involved. Hard limits include gore, extreme pain/violence, and death. If you have any other favorite kinks, just ask!

Shoot me a message if you’re interested with a description and/or pic of your character and any additions/changes you’d like to make!"

So i am doing my IT internship at my school and we have some old laptops that we give to the teachers for free.

They can pick them up and just take them home for private use. They arent super fast or have high specs most of them have i3 intel core's and 6GB ram. So this guy comes in and asks me to show him one of these laptops. I take one out of the shelves and go over the laptop with him. Then he asks me if there are any better ones in there. He told me he wanted one that has a i5 - 16GB ram and a 500GB SSD. So i was thinking he wants bassicly my personal laptop but for free. I told him we didn't give those away for free and he got kinda pissed at me. Eventually he left and said he was gone come back later. Is this a choosingbeggar?"

8utr7d,2,2018-06-29,My ex with uBPD need some advice,DoctorWithoutAHeart,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/8utr7d/my_ex_with_ubpd_need_some_advice/,"So apparently after lurking in this sub I am starting to figure things out. We had the love bombing period for 5 months then she moved away. I flew her out and she would fly out to see me then convinced me to move halfway across the country. Before this move when I flew to visit her I noticed she was more distant and the sex wasn't the same. I asked her about it and she said she was stressed about her work (she was in her intern year being a doctor). We got into a crazy fight where she struck me then struck herself multiple times, like rolling around on the floor hitting herself in the face and head. I had never experienced anything like it and it was the second red flag that I ignored, the first one being that she was being distant.

Anyways for the next year we visited each other and there were periods of love and periods of fighting like crazy over absolutely nothing. She convinced me to move across country to be with her. I supported her for the next 7 years while she became a doctor (sub speciality). We plan to move back across country as she gets her job and she suddenly decides she needs a break (at the time I couldn't see why). She was distant and then was trying to let me down easy I guess. I went to my parents' house for a week out of state. I came back to get closure and ask her what is going on and catch her cheating on me. Then my snooping took ahold and I found out she was cheating on me for close to 7 years. I remember questioning her about this and she would always say what you are worried about this guy? He is just a work friend, you are amazing and successful and good looking, you have nothing to worry about (talk about gaslighting). Last weekend I moved most of my stuff out of the house after she stole half my stuff like an expensive DSLR camera, my tools, silverware, some speakers, etc. I have to move the rest of my stuff out this weekend and am wondering if I should ask her for my expensive stuff back? It was never hers, and the stuff I bought for her (really expensive purses, clothes, etc) I don't want back, but my camera I do.

 I started NC about a week ago after LC. Oh by the way we were engaged and there are no children involved. During the NC she texted me at first asking me where I was, how I was, if I could talk, etc. She begged me to talk during her license hearing in the other state (she has some OVI's and a dropped assault and battery charge on me). I know she passed her hearing, and I stopped answering her texts. I don't think she has moved yet but I am sure she is planning on it. Her family has contacted me and apologized and asked if I had heard from her since she has not spoken to them in 3 weeks. I told them I heard from her last week but the whole situation is messed up but I hold nothing against them. Her mom said she considered me her son and she was extremely sorry and was crying. 

She used to tell me that her father was a horrible person and cheated on her mother all the time and would get worked up about the issue. It is very ironic considering what happened in our relationship, we were engaged and she was cheating the whole time with multiple people. She would also take up issues on feminism and be a very vocal proponent of feminism, and when I would point out that I am all about equal rights but there are upsides to being a female as well including prison sentences and especially when dealing with law enforcement. She would go off on me about things like this and other miniscule arguments. Some stuff that would make a normal person just brush it off or not make a big deal she would flip out about. She also kept talking about suicide multiple times and that she isn't happy and doesn't know how to be happy. Keep in mind she is a doctor and knows she needs therapy. During our last conversation she said that these things took years and she didn't have the money or means to go to therapy plus there is a stigma for doctors going to therapy. I remember telling her I would pay for her therapy, but she said she could not take anymore from me. I also at one point mentioned BPD and she paused and said, ""that's offensive... I have seen people with BPD and they don't function"". I am pretty sure she knows she has BPD and now knows I know.

Also I did find out through various means that the new guy she was seeing she is probably married to. He has a 6 year old daughter. She married him literally within 2 weeks of me leaving. Seems like a real BPD thing to do. I just don't get why she tried reaching out to me when I initiated NC. For our first time at NC it was like a week and a half and then she said things like I found a house out here, but driving here is going to remind me of you everyday. Then she said something like ""I am so sorry for everything"". ""I wish you would text me something"". Then finally she got me on the hook when an important piece of mail came to the house and I had to talk to her and go pick it up. During the conversation we talked about happiness and she admitted she didn't know what made her happy aside from work. She also begged me to call her during her hearing which I said I would. And she ended it with I love you, but I hesitated when saying it. The next day was moving day for me and the hearing for her, she texted me multiple times but I held back as I was shell shocked moving all of my stuff from our old house. I still love her and want to get her the help she needs. My friends and family all say that I should NEVER get back with her; but for some reason I have doubts. 

I also ended up having a rebound with a girl who I wanted to get to know more about. That made me feel better (yeah I know codependence I am working on that) but then I sort of stopped contact with her, which is shitty of me because she seemed like someone I wanted to get to know... 

Anyways I am taking it one day at a time and working out constantly, am planning on learning to ride a motorcyle, and have started a few business pet projects of mine. It seems to get easier day by day but sometimes I will have days where I am like should I find out what she is doing, how is she, is she depressed, does she regret what she did, or if there will ever be a future for us. I am still relatively young at 31 but feel a bit lost since the plan was to get married to this pwBPD. She also had crazy visions of the future like she would be famous, etc, so some narcassism is definitely there and a whole lot of the other cluster B personality disorders. 

Writing this out helped me feel better, but yeah sometimes I still yearn but I know I need to move on as our relationship was toxic because of her and I was giving in to every little thing she wanted and did not have a spine. I actually hated the person I was with her, I am outgoing, successful, good looking, and have a sense of humor. When I was with her I felt like I had lost myself to this person and gave up 99&amp;#37; of my soul. Hoping that I can stay NC and never think of her in a kind way again because this person never existed."

Is there somewhere in the US that's heavily in need of Motion graphic designers? The job hunt struggle has been real. I've been lucky enough to do a few small freelance gigs while I await application results, but no fish seem to be biting.

I currently live in DC, and I don't seem to find many options. Of the few I've found, only a handful gave me a call or interview... but that's been weeks now. I'm using Glassdoor, Indeed, Craigslist, and Ziprecruiter to find job opportunities, but even with all those resources I only come up with a handful.

I'm willing to move out of DC, but I don't really know where I should go. I've heard LA is pretty good, but that I would be one of a billion designers, so it's not that worth it to move all the way out west. I'd love to move down south if an opportunity arises!

Not sure what my deal is. I have internship experience, I'm a veteran, and I did really well in school. All my interviews have had great things to say, but I guess they just found somebody more suitable for the positions.

Any help/advice will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

It’s been another rough quarter for the rollout of [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s Model 3. The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a [tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern. 

Now the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline—a rate of 5,000 cars per week by the end of June—is coming to an end. The quarter concludes Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday. Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.

Here’s our rundown of what to expect. 

## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker

Back in February, Bloomberg introduced an experimental tool to [track the Model 3 rollout](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). The tracker uses vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to estimate production in real time. The model projects that Tesla finished the quarter making 27,957 Model 3s—or 4,533 per a week, shy of Musk’s goal. Since production of the Model 3 began in July 2017, the Bloomberg tracker estimates that 40,409 of the sedans have been made.   


Musk himself has suggested that this estimate is too low. An analyst report by Goldman Sachs, which projected quarterly production that’s just 43 cars more than the Bloomberg estimate, prompted the CEO to send an email to his employees. “They are [in for a rude awakening](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/musk-says-rude-awakening-awaits-bearish-goldman-sachs-analyst),” Musk wrote. 

The Bloomberg model is, by design, slow to reflect sudden shifts in production and could underestimate Tesla’s last-minute manufacturing push that spilled into a gigantic tent outside the factory in Fremont, California. Back in the first quarter, the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker underestimated the actual production total by less than 5 percent—coming closer than the Wall Street consensus. The tool doesn’t estimate total deliveries, which can vary based on the number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter.  

## Wall Street Doesn’t Think Tesla Made It

Wall Street has also been placing their bets on Tesla’s quarterly figures. The average of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,121 cars. Three analysts also gave estimates for production, which averaged 30,167.

The number most people are watching is Tesla’s weekly production rate, a squishy figure that Musk has set up as his quarterly benchmark. Tesla initially targeted a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017, but the company has since moved that target back twice. Only one firm stuck their neck out with an estimate of weekly production: Evercore ISI predicts that Tesla will hit 4,600 during the final week.  

Total shipments for Models S and X are expected to be around 22,622 units, according to an average of six estimates. 

One thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles. [Tesla may be suppressing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D2D9D68C80000) U.S. sales as the quarter ends as way to extend its federal electric-vehicle tax credit of $7,500 per car. The subsidy begins to phase out one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla sells its 200,000th electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain an additional three months of tax credits that could be worth [more than $400 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D66D868BC0000) to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates. 

In June, Tesla filled Model 3 orders to reservation holders in Canada ahead of deliveries to some U.S. customers. There are other actions Tesla may be taking, including accelerating its overseas deliveries for the Model S and Model X and stockpiling cars at holding facilities, all of which could push quarterly revenue into the third quarter, which is when Musk vows that Tesla will finally become profitable. 

Tesla’s stock has been on a tear in the second quarter, boosted by apparent progress on Model 3 production. The stock has climbed 31 percent to close at $349.93 on Thursday. Tesla’s market value reached $59.4 billion—more than long-established rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.

Here’s a roundup of what analysts’ are saying ahead of the key delivery figures: 

**Goldman Sachs, David Tamberrino:**   
**(**Sell, price target $195)

* “We believe that Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus.”
* “Investor conversations on the stock have moved past the 5,000/week run-rate production target (as we believe most investors are giving the company credit for achieving this level entering third quarter) toward vehicle profit margins and conversion of Model 3 reservations to higher priced vehicles.”
* Forecasts Tesla achieving about 22,000 Model 3 deliveries to customers in the quarter, up from Goldman’s previous 19,000 estimate, but well below consensus. His forecast for production is 28,000, in line with the [Bloomberg Tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). 
* Believes Tesla is tracking below its 2018 Model S/X guidance of about 100,000 units, based on the quarter-to-date May cadence.

**Barclays, Brian Johnson**  
(Underweight, price target $210)

* “While we appreciate the steps taken to raise capacity, we believe the admission that it needed a second general assembly line to reach 5,000/week is another indicator of the challenges in ramping production.”
* “On the path to reaching 10,000 model 3/week, one key item to be addressed is paint shop capacity. The paint shop will need to have capacity added to handle 10,000 Model 3/week in addition to 2,000 S/X per week.”

**Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi**  
(Market-perform, price target $265)

* Says Tesla’s Automotive segment’s gross margins may be overstated, noting a steep plunge in the gross margins of the Services and Other segment.
* Expects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,000.

**Evercore ISI, Arndt Ellinghorst &amp; George Galliers**  
(In-line, price target )

* Expects Tesla to deliver “21,800 Model S/X during the quarter and 30,700 Model 3, with Model 3 production at a run-rate of 4,600 during the final week versus guidance of 5,000.'”
* Notes comments by Panasonic executive that a pick-up in Model 3 production has resulted in occasional battery shortages.

**Guggenheim, Robert Cihra**  
(Buy, price target $430)

* Still sees Tesla flipping from “losses to profits in second half of 2018” and the prospect of a profitable Tesla setting up a “meaningfully more positive stock narrative.”
* “Tesla producing as many as 35,000 Model 3s and shipping 29,000, up from just over 8,000 in the first quarter and 2,000 in the fourth quarter.”
* “While 6 months later than projected, we continue to estimate that 5,000/week bogey then setting up Tesla’s overall model to flip from sizable cash burn in first half of 2018 to profitability in second half, as Model 3 volumes drive big revenue, margin and free cash flow leverage off the big fixed-cost structure Tesla has been building.”

**Consumer Edge, James Albertine**  
(Overweight, price target $385)

* “Production of the Model 3 is still the primary driver of upside to expectations and shares in 2018.”
* “We visited the Gigafactory in May, which is when we learned about Tesla’s push to 5,000 units per week of Model 3 production by second quarter-end, a goal we believe many investors did not believe management could achieve prior to our visit.”
* Estimates second-quarter Model 3 deliveries to stand at 25,000 units.

**Baird, Ben Kallo**  
(Outperform, price target $411)

* “We expect the focus will be on exit rate Model 3 production and total Model 3 production in June, in that order, and believe the stock could trade up if Tesla approaches its 5,000/week production target.”
* “We think TSLA may deliver about 25,000 vehicles.”
* “Consensus estimates for second-quarter deliveries may be too high, particularly given our belief there could be a larger-than-normal delta between production and deliveries due to the ramp during the quarter.”"

He loves it there and that is awesome! 


What is not awesome, however, is that he's been living in my studio because the internship was closer to my house than his but I feel like hotel girlfriend. 


He loves his job so much that he sometimes stays there until 10/11 pm even though he is not required to. He told me they stay late in Tuesdays to work on their portfolio, but he's there every night. So when he does come to my house, it's already 11.30 pm and he goes straight to bed. In the last 5 months he haven't had a dinner together once (on workdays that is), he makes a mess that he doesn't clean and I feel like I am not important enough to spend ONE Friday evening with.


I already told him that I can live with it while his internship is going on, but I'm not about to decide on a lifetime with someone who I barely see at all. And even though he seems to understand where I am coming from, he doesn't actually *do* something about it. 


One think about him is that he has ADD so that could be a reason he doesn't grasp the reality of time as well when he is working. Other than that I am at a loss about what I should do.

8uvhne,2,2018-06-29,"Getting ready to start my aerospace engineering program after 2 years of receiving my A.A., looking for some study advice or tips...",thet3d,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/8uvhne/getting_ready_to_start_my_aerospace_engineering/,"Hello. I graduated community college a couple years ago and did well enough to get accepted for Florida Tech's aerospace engineering program.  It is also a small school, which I prefer. I've had to push my acceptance a at least a year for financial or timing reasons, and while I'm more ready than ever to be back in school, my nerves catch up to me regarding taking much harder classes than ever. Being away from hard math and science doesn't help either. I will be taking:

 **Intro to Aerospace engineering**

 **Statics**

 **A 5-week Linear algebra for D.E. class**

 **Technical Communications**

 **Intro to C++ programming**

 **And another Python Programming intro class**

Two of these classes are only one credit so I had to fill the gaps to hit full time status for scholarships and whatnot.

So far I've broken down my subjects by folder and starting to father as many resources for each subject so that I can get a head start on refreshing my brain not just how to learn again but to learn shit that is very difficult. I registered for a couple of EdX courses for programming. I have some online lecture courses saved for Aerospace and statics from YouTube. And o have ally old notes from community college. I feel I just need to get my foundations for these classes fresh again. If I can have notes for about the first 3 weeks of these classes, I think that will really help me stay caught up even when I know I will feel like I'm falling behind. I'll be 30 come the start of classes so my mental strength has had much time to develop which is good but I just wanna see how others are preparing for the Fall in similar situations?  I also managed to score at least an interview as a part-time unpaid propulsion engineering intern for Larsen Motorsports, the turbo jet drag racing team.  I would consider this like a club, but merging my passions for automotive and jet aircrafts is something I could not pass up on.  Anyone ever intern with Larsen before?  Thank you all in advance!

P.S. [AeroStudents.com](https://AeroStudents.com) is an amazingly helpful site..."

Someone to dirty chat, sext and cum together with, maybe try some JO instructions and talk about the day! If you're gay, bi or straight it all works!

We can talk about fantasies, girls we find hot, find new ways to make each other cum. If you have a gf you want to use here we can do that too! Bonus if there's footage for us to enjoy! ;)

We can see Whether the new intern is into you or not. Let's also talk about your day and other non-sexual things and hopefully that makes the experience all the better!

If you can be horny as ever but also know how to have a conversation then let's give this a try! Everyone's welcome!

I'm 26 and I'm into asses the most, tits, Asian girls, fit girls, blowjobs, cum, fingering and threesomes. Anacheri, Kim K, Kylie Jenner, and any girl with a stellar body and ass to name a few of my interests! Don't mind showing off either ;).

PM for me more details if you're interested and let me know a little bit about yourself and what you're into! It's a late night here so I'll definitely respond a little later but I will get bacck to you!

Please read the whole post and get back to me, I'd prefer a message longer than a couple of words! Thanks!"
8uvj9g,4,2018-06-29,Current PY4 witnessing grad-interns not getting hired. Need Advice!,readreddit8899,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/8uvj9g/current_py4_witnessing_gradinterns_not_getting/," Hey everyone! I posted this on another forum but I also closely follow the reddit community so I thought I'd post this here as well. As we all know, job market for pharmacy sucks and hours are getting cut  left and right. I knew this when I started pharmacy school in 2015, and  my strategy to counter this was to intern as much as I can and work my  ass off without ever complaining.  
 

I have been with the same grocery-store chain for the past 4 years and  literally gave them everything I had, never saying no to any requests. I  would work any weekends and evenings they asked of me (holidays and  all), come in every time a tech called in sick with 30 minutes notice -  literally cancelling any plans I had (I even left in the middle of lunch  dates with my girlfriend on several occasions…luckily she’s very  understanding), and no matter how little sleep I had or if my schoolwork  was hurting, I would never say no (Pass/Fail system at school). I was  their “yes” man and they knew it. My metrics were one of the highest, my  customer service skills are outstanding (from years of experience as a  waiter/server), and as the years progressed my knowledge base expanded,  I was literally running circles around some of the older pharmacists.  
 

Now here comes the cold water…you would think after the sacrifices and  paying your due diligence that the company would recognize you and hire  you on as one of their own. But NOPE! Current Rph hours just got cut  even more, so not only are the Rph’s who are already employed fighting  amongst each other for more hours, but all the grad-interns of 2018  pretty much all got laid off. In my district there were about 15-18 of  them and from what I’ve seen, only 1-2 were hired on but they are far  far farrrrr from full time lol…maybe even per diem.  
 

To make matters worse, I know for sure this is happening in other  organizations as well. A friend of mine is in the same boat as I am and  currently interns for a well-known company (won’t say the name but it is  German if you can guess it). My friend told me that they witness with  their very own eyes a post grad who just passed their NAPLEX/Law and was  an officially licensed pharmacists get laid off as a grad intern the  moment they passed their boards. Now can you imagine…this moment in your  life that is supposed to be one of the happiest…after 8 years of  grinding through school and accumulating 6 figure student loans and  instead of celebrating the pinnacle of your hard work with your license  in hand…you instead get laid off due to no available positions  regardless of your competencies/loyalty/experience.  
 

So here I am on my APPE rotations…1 year away from meeting the fate of  this year’s graduates and never feeling more hopeless than I have ever  felt in my life. Any piece of advice would be greatly appreciated. I  live in the northwest and still busting my ass. My rotation site is 3  hours from my home store so I would do my rotations from 9-6pm M-F and  drive home. Work both days on weekends and after getting off at 6pm on  Sunday drive another 3 hours back to my site. Rinse and repeat – no days  off. Should I start interning at other chains – it does seem like the  big 3 have more prospects from reading forums and talking to my  classmates. BTW my company doesn’t do contracts, so you won’t know your  fate until you have license in hands. At this point I will work anywhere  and for anyone, $200k+ in loans and still growing.  
 

TL;DR – worked my ass off during pharmacy school. Current job market is  crap, my company just cut more hours. I have 6+ years of retail  experience, any advice on getting hired on when I graduate in a year?  "
8uw02l,15,2018-06-29,DISCUSSION: Pitch your MOS2,shablam96,DC_Cinematic,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/8uw02l/discussion_pitch_your_mos2/,"We all talk about how much we want it, but what do we want from it? I got two ideas, I'm leaning more towards the first

Superman: Last City of Krypton. Lois and Clark return to Martha Kent's after their honeymoon. The next day a rocket appears to enter the atmosphere. Clark goes to investigate and is shocked to discover it is Kryptonian, and the girl inside wears the House of El emblem. After taking her back to Smallville, he finds she is Kara Zor-El, his cousin. She is horrified to discover she has been gone for thirty years. She tells him how Kandor was stolen by Brainiac as the planet collapsed. Kara asks Clark/Kal to come with her and rescue Kandor. Just before they set off Lois says ""Just get back before the baby gets here."" So off they go into space. What to them feels like a week or so actually ends up being 9 months. I got a few different ideas depending on what i'd do for a Supergirl spin-off, but essentially Kal and Kara travel through space and are joined along the way by Adam Strange, Kyle Rayner (or John Stewart) and Shayera Thal. At one point Clark and Lobo get in a bar fight, we see the ruined remains of Yod-Colu to give some context to Brainiac, we see Clark and Kara bond and Clark think about the life he could've had, and never did due to Krypton's destruction. Eventually they face Brainiac, but are easily defeated. But then the Thanagarians and other races come to join the fight. They get Kandor and the other cities out and escape. They blow up Brainiac's ship, but in a post-credit scene we find Brainiac is still alive. They console the fact that they can't restore Kandor, but hope to find a way to reverse these effects eventually. The team get back as Lois is going into labour, and Clark races back down to earth to get there in time. He does, and Jonathan Samuel Lane-Kent is born. The next morning, Kyle and Adam leave (Shayera had already returned to Thanagar), and Kara says she'll stick around on Earth.

Superman Revenge Squadron. OK it's a working title. It starts with Clark catching Volcana. On return to the Daily Planet he and Lois are introduced to her new intern Jack Olsen (Jimmy's younger brother). Next John Corben is leaving Lexcorp, and sets off in the car with his wife Leslie Willis. He has just been fired, and she is ranting about how she'll blast Lexcorp on her next Vlog and he says that won't end well. But then the brakes give out and their car comes crashing down the hill. Lex kidnaps and turns them into Metallo and Livewire. They wake up amnesiac; all they remember is they care for each other, they just don't know why. Lex also creates Conner Kent/Kon-El and builds his powersuit. He tells them Superman is to blame for their situations. So they each try to take him down in revenge. To prove Superman's innocence to these people, Clark Lois and Jack investigate the circumstances surrounding these people. They are nearly caught one time but Jack gets the evidence before they have to escape. Finally they prove to John, Leslie and Conner that Lex had lied to them (at tis point it's also revealed that Kon-El was created from a mix of Lex and Clark's DNA). John and Leslie get their memories back, so they all turn on Lex, but then he reveals his back-up plan; he sets Metallo to shoot into the atmosphere and self-destruct, creating a cloud of Kryptonite gas that would envelope the earth and result in Clark having to leave Earth or die. Lex also uses his conditioning to set Conner on Clark. Kal tries to convince him to stop, that he doesn't have to do this ""I would never hurt you son."" Confused, Conner knocks him through a wall then takes off. Livewire fights Lex, but he defeats her and gets away. Finally Clark lifts Metallo up into space, away from the earth (before they do John and Leslie share one final kiss). Clark falls back down to earth barely conscious from the Kryptonite poisoning, but Kon-El catches him in time. We skip to a couple days ahead, and Lois and Clark are back in their apartment. Leslie is saying goodbye to them, saying how she will leave town and try to figure out what to do now. After she leaves, Lois comments how they never caught Lex, and that Conner is still out there. Clark says they'll find Lex eventually. Lois says she knows Clark wants to go after Conner/Kon-El, and Clark says yes but right now they need to go back to work/daily life. We see in the last shot Conner is watching them from a rooftop, before disappearing off into the distance.

Casting wise? KJ Apa or Quinn Lord for Jack Olsen, Eiza Gonzalez for Livewire, Kieran Shipka for Supergirl. I'm not sure about Metallo but maybe Alden Ehrenreich

I have a version of the second that's actually a sequel to the first one, but Kara becomes a Red Lantern, Jon saves the day by carrying Metallo into space and Parasite is also involved (Joshua Michael Allen, Lexcorp janitor has alien being planted in closet that attaches to him; Lex hired Lobo to collect it and we get a brief fight between Clark and Lobo too)

EDIT: Also Kon-El would have the New52 suit design. The characterization was awful but it was the best design for a Superboy costume I've seen; his YJ one is just clothes, whereas this actually looked like armour. I'd love for them to use that design, but his pre-flashpoint characterization

So what do you want from MOS2"
8uw1qy,1,2018-06-29,[F4F/Futa] Punished Adventurers,Names_are_Just_Words,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8uw1qy/f4ffuta_punished_adventurers/,"""We found a sorceress that was offering training courses"" ""Are you sure you do not want to go? It must be a wonderful learning experience"" ""Come along now, It is not every day that your queen pays for your education""


Kinzie was getting real sick and tired of that king and queen by this point. The pair were Luddites, they had no clue what went into magic and they outlawed necromancy, Kinzie's one speciality, in their city. And yet time and time again her little back alley store of the occult and necromantic arts always got a visit from them. At first it was fun, of course it would be, but now they are getting a little too involved. Too much meddling and next thing she knew she was basically the royal witch. And now with so many jobs being sent by those two they fear that their witch may not have the best education possible in her own art. 


They sent out requests for anyone who could teach their witch, despite her clear protests against this idea, and that evil bitch replied. Genuinely the epitome of what an evil queen of an empire could look like was to be her mentor. She used her cruel evil magic to take over city after city after city and now Kinzie was an intern for this bitch. This was the kind of woman that the king and queen would send their champion on a quest to kill, but now Kinzie was working for free under her. 


She spent days upon days sorting old dusty spell tones, drawing runes so that that bitch didn't have to, every boring part of sorcery. But one day something changed. Turns out this evil queen had scrying charms on all of her dark knights, which meant that time when Kinzie fucked that big hung futa knight... She was watching. Not only was this severely embarrassing, now she knew about Kinzie's depraved and sadistic ass. But when Kinzie thought she was going to be mocked, humiliated, or something to that effect but no. She was taken to a door and stopped outside. 


""Kinzie, We both know I saw everything you did last night""


""Yeah... Let me guess you are go-""


""I couldn't be more proud of you. When I was your age I was too scared to hurt a fly""


""Uh... how old do you think I am?""


""Never mind that elf, there are more important matters at hand. Another attempt on my life was committed and those responsible are behind this door. I am entrusting you to show them what happens when you cross me. I will give you one chance to do this, do it right or end up in their position""


Well, it looked like kinzie had her work cut out for her


Thanks for reading this far! I have left whatever is on the other side of that door ambiguous so you can decide exactly what kind of character you want to play. You could play one adventurer tasked with bringing down the evil queen, now meeting a bad ending at the hands of Kinzie, or a whole party of adventurers. You could be anyone from a toned orc barbarian to a thick milf cleric of the church. I love a big huge cock and am a major size queen but I am willing to play with regular women too. As well as that Kinzie could definitley cast a little incantation to give one of those adventurers a cock. I am open to plenty ideas including characters and how the scenario will play out. I am both interested in short and long term roleplays and could do Either with ease. Understand coming into this however, that despite Kinzie's size, she is a dominant girl at heart. She is super kinky and a pretty on the sadistic side when it came down to it.

Kinzie, my character, Is something of a recluse. With long black hair and green eyes under forrest green robes, the girl was very petite. Her chest was flat, her build was small, but at least she had a cute butt, it was just about her best asset. Tight, perky, and round, it brought her a little bit of joy any time she saw people looking on. She only stood at about 5'3"" but she managed to make up for her small stature with her prowess in handling those she summoned from the underworld.

I cant wait to see those orange envelopes flying in!"

My nfamily lives in LA. 

My nmom has lately been bugging me and wouldn’t stop texting me, asking me to call her because she had a surprise she wanted to tell me. I didn’t want to contact her so I ignored it. She eventually got mad and claimed I “didn’t give a shit about her.” and generally threw a huge embarrassing hissy fit. This only made me annoyed and I ignored her further. But earlier today I couldn’t stop thinking about what this “surprise” was. I texted my brother and asked what it was, he refused to tell me as well, only telling me that, “I probably won’t like it.” When I asked him for more details he gave me attitude and kept shutting me down and told me to just call mom. Before all of this bullshit I was actually having a pretty good day, but this ruined it in an instant and pretty much gave me major anxiety and I was immediately stressed. He knows I don’t like my nmom because of all the abuse she’s put me through, but he apparently just doesn’t give two shits. 🙄

I finally give in and called her. The “surprise” was that her boyfriend (who’ve I never met and don’t even know what he looks like) was moving in. I thought that was weird, and when I come home at xmas break it’s going to be awkward as all fuck. But whatever, I’ve been through worse. 

But then I asked her how my cats were (I have 3 total) and apparently she gave two of them away to her fucking co-worker. I had raised them both since they were kittens and I had them for 4-6 years. They were always been there for me and I hadn’t seen them since goddamn January. I was SO looking forward to seeing them at the end of the year and now I fucking can’t. My nmom says I can probably visit her co-worker’s place a few times when I get home for Xmas break and play with my cats there, but it’s not the same. I still have my other cat at home and I am thankful for that, but I’m so fucking depressed and pissed. I spent the WHOLE fucking day being emotionally blackmailed by my brother and when I finally interact with my fucktard family they fucking steal my pets and betray me. 

I feel so fucking empty inside I just wanna fucking die. I hate living like this, I don’t know what the fuck I did to deserve this. I screamed and screamed for almost 30 min when I found out and now I’m just exhausted on every level. I’m just gonna get drunk and self harm later bc I can’t handle this anymore. I raised those kittens, bought them food, cleaned up after them, and was practically their mom and they’ve just been ripped away from me. 

My nmom has done similar shit before, I used to have four cats, but she would constantly let the fourth cat go outside even when I told her not to over and over and over again. So eventually my fourth cat pretty much ran away and my nfamily claims they haven’t seen her in over 6 months. I hate my evil fucking nfamily.
She also sexually abused me when i was younger and tried to kill me on multiple occasions. It got so intense that CPS had to be called. She also tried to kill herself in front of me at one point.

Im so fucking empty and numb inside. I want to die so bad. I hate that I’m fucking cursed to live like this. Ugh.

I miss my cats so fucking much. "

I am an IT Intern at a software company. The company provides full life-cycle financial and payment tracking method software to its users, primarily fraternal organizations. This allows members of the fraternal organizations to pay for; membership dues, room and board, events, etc. While the HQ of the fraternal organization can monitor, analyze, and view current funds.

Part of our Intern project is to investigate the European market and if our software would have a competitive advantage.

What I am attempting to find through research, is what other “membership/payment” softwares are currently being used in amateur/semi-pro Sports Clubs around Europe. I know a lot of European citizens have been or are associated with these clubs, any information would be extremely helpful!

Questions:

What software (if any) does your Club use to receive payments?

And

Is there a plethora of these “membership/payment” software’s in the Club market?

I do apologize if this is against the rules. If so, could someone please direct me to the correct subreddit.

Thank you,"

So many of the alt people I meet think people are obsessed with them because they have tattoos or green hair or whatever the fuck. They think that they can't find jobs and get weird looks in public because people are overcome by their individuality and fearlessness to ""be themselves"". No, it's because you clearly don't know how to conduct yourself in an environment that isn't a concert. They put down other people for ""playing the game"" and trying to support themselves by not dressing however they want all of the time. Sorry that my lack of visible tattoos or ear gauges makes me less of a legitimate metalhead than you, or that I have to dress in a moderately professional way for my internship so my coworkers don't think I'm a fucking lunatic. 

You can be an adult and also look how you want, but with adulthood comes a balance and you don't get to ""be yourself"" all the time."
8ux4sl,2,2018-06-29,SO Is Getting Clingy And It's Getting on My Nerves,frustrated_and_hurt,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ux4sl/so_is_getting_clingy_and_its_getting_on_my_nerves/,"Hello! First time poster, hope I'm doing this right...

First a little bit of background. Me (21F) and my SO (21M) are both college students at the same college, which is where we met a little over 7 months ago. We started dating after a month of getting to know each other, and things were really great because we were both living on campus and could spend the majority of the week together. He's very introverted and on the autism spectrum so he has a hard time socializing with others, and he's had some bad relationships in the past and at times gets really insecure about himself and about relationships with others (including me). I'm introverted as well, but I can be pretty social and have lots of friends from high school that I keep in contact with even though I go to college out of state and don't see them that often. 

Now, like I said, things were great. We've gotten pretty serious over the last few months, but we're taking it slow in terms of long term commitments (on my assistance-- I know some people work it out and get married quick and live happily every after, but I'm a bit more cynical due to family history). This is also partially because we're both really young, broke, and both still living with our parents with no foreseeable future of being able to live together, much less afford the grand wedding he wants and all that jazz. But we've actually talked about that sort of thing, and I can realistically see us getting married one day. Well, I could. But right now I'm so frustrated and don't know anymore and that's where I need some advice.

We've been out of college for the summer for about 2 months now, and we both live in different states, totally about an 7 1/2-8 hr straight drive between us. During the school year we talked about visiting each other, but with my current internship schedule and his lack of work and therefore money, we haven't been able to actually do any of that stuff, and probably won't be able to. It sucks, but that's how life goes, and we'll be seeing each other in a month in a half. I really miss him and I talk to him everyday, and we Skype at least once a week. However, like I said, I have an internship that goes 8-5 and on weekends I have a part time job that usually takes up my evenings. During the week I usually come home and eat dinner, spend some time with my mom, or go out and do something. Him, on the other hand, has a 3 day/week internship that's 6 hours a day, and no part time job. So, understandably, he's bored and lonely, and he misses me just as much as I miss him and wants to talk and Skype all the time. He understands that I'm busy, but sometimes he just starts to pester me so much about it that it gets on my nerves. It's been like this all summer, but it's been nothing I can't handle and he's been pretty good about not pushing too much.

However, this week things have escalated and he's been on a pity party woe is me type of thing. Every conversation we have someone loops around to him going on about how lonely and bored he is, and talks about how he's so boring and no one likes him, etc. Every time he does I do my best to cheer him up, but he still gets all mopey. It doesn't matter if I'm at work or at home, he'll start messaging me about this stuff. That part is annoying, but nothing too bad, but what aggravates me the most lately is that the things he complains about are things that he can actually do something about. I took literally 5 minutes to google search events that involve his interests and all he replied was ""i dont know"" or ""that wouldn't work bc xyz"" or ""well i dont want to go alone"". So I suggest maybe checking out Facebook groups of people of similar interests, so that way he could maybe just chat with people of similar interests (since he's introverted it would be less of a hassle for him to go out and meet a stranger) and once again, ""I don't know."" Every suggestion I make got the ""I don't know"" answer, but he continues to persist in his moping. 

It came to a head his morning when first thing (I'm talking 8am) he's already starting his whole ""I suck"" spiel and I am just so tired and emotionally drained that I finally snapped a bit (which is my bad, but I did my best to keep calm and properly express my feelings and use 'I"" statements) and told him I don't know what he expects from me. Listening day in and out of this is draining for me and it makes me not want to talk to him even more, which I know makes him feel even more lonely and bored. And then he starts going off on how I'm always doing things and how he's jealous, and even went as far as to say he was jealous of **mom** of all people because I spend time with her??? It feels like he expects me to be miserable just because he's miserable and I shouldn't feel guilty for having fun with my friends. I'm not his mom, I shouldn't be the one having to push him to have a social life, and all I can do is try to support him but he doesn't seem to want my support, he just wants to complain all the time. I know it may not seem like that big of a deal right now because once we're back together in two months he'll stop being so clingy, but it doesn't bode well for a healthy, sustainable future if he constantly needs me to be his social life and gets upset with me all the time for having friends and doing things without him. This is a hill I'm willing to die on, because this is a part of who I am and this isolation and guilt is early signs of controlling behavior and abuse and I've been in unhealthy relationships before and won't go through again.

Sorry this is drawn out and all over the place, I'm just so frustrated right now. So, dear reddit, how do I address this problem? Counseling isn't an option, and I'm not breaking up with him (yet, and hopefully it doesn't come to that). He really is a good guy, and he's been making a lot of genuine improvements towards being less clingy, there's just still a huge difference between our social lives that can't be fixed overnight and is causing a lot of issues right now. I want him to know that I love and support him, and that I don't mind that he's venting to me and being honest, but at the same time I don't want to be his emotional punching bag and have to hear the same thing day in and day out when he refuses to do anything about the situation. 

So just, how do I address this topic or do you have any suggestions on how to deal with the situation?

Thank you!

TL;DR: In a long-distance relationship and my SO is getting really clingy and throwing a woe is me party. It's become super emotionally draining and I don't know how to deal with the situation and need advice."
8uxiz5,4,2018-06-29,A lecturer over twice my age hit on me and tried to play it cool by being pushy,askatekira,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8uxiz5/a_lecturer_over_twice_my_age_hit_on_me_and_tried/,"Warning: Long story. TL:DR at the bottom

I am currently a 20yo student at university and over the course of the last semester I have developed a good working relationship with one of my lecturers who's in his mid 40s now. This is only important because of the industry I am training for it's all about who you know more so than what you know.

After finishing this university year I got a good internship within the industry i want to work in which also meant occasionally running into said lecturer as his professional office is close to the one i got to work in. 

Anyway to the important bit - a few weeks ago he's offered to meet up after work for a drink to discuss 'my plans after the internship and any opportunities etc', I have agreed straight away as I saw it just as a business/networking meeting that could provide me with some good work opportunities for the summer. Time goes by and we settle on meeting on the last day of my internship a few days ago, all is great. After deciding on a pub to sit in and talk he straight away suggests to get a bottle of wine between us. Don't get me wrong I do like a good drink with my mates but on a /as i thought/ business meeting it seemed a bit off but I went along with it anyway. We have a great chat over a few hours, discussing some cool projects that we've worked on or are working at at the moment he asks if i would like another drink to which I respond with 'I would just like some water now but thank you', off he goes! Five minutes later I see him come back with another strong gin drink and a comment 'you like gin, right?' Fair enough I do but I did ask for water, which I pointed out, and drinking on pretty much empty stomach the alcohol has managed to hit me a little bit by then  so I gave in and had that drink anyway. Looking back I do realise how silly it was of me to let him bring me an 'open top' drink in the first place, i do know.  

So some more time passes by with chit chat and that \*one to many\* drinks and all of a sudden decides to sit right next to me on a tiny bench that was across from where he was sat and starts *kissing me*. Properly going for twenty little pecks going all the way from my cheek straight to my mouth. I froze for a split second when he got stuck no my face and then instantly sobered up and shook myself out of his firm hold saying very loudly and clearly 

**NO, YOU NEED TO STOP RIGHT NOW THIS IS MAKING ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE**

And fair enough he did stop but kept pushing it even further asking a bazillion of questions like 'Oh what if i was 20 years younger?', 'Do you find me attractive?', 'YOU, are SO hot I obviously find you attractive c'mon'. All of them made it so much worse, it made me feel like i had to explain myself to hiI m to make him stop and get myself some space to escape from being squeezed between the table and him. I'm really annoyed because he wouldn't stop until I told him that 'Actually, I am kinda wanting to see someone else right now' i was so close to just saying 'Hi, I am a lesbian and am not interested in your over-twice-of-my-age-ass' as nothing else seemed to work. Promptly left the pub and escaped home.

I guess I was being really naive with the way I behaved around him trying to make myself look better in his eyes (purely for career building reasons), letting weird flirty comments slide past in the conversation like 'oh, YOU are single!? there is no way that's true' and things alike. I know that nothing \*bad\* happened and I stopped it in time before he took it any further yet still a day later I find myself thinking - maybe i did something wrong and shouldn't have behaved the way I did. I don't think that *anyone* deserves to be left feeling that way and even though, again, what happened to me wasn't major I was left feeling extremely objectified and I am so truly sorry for all people who have gone through any sort of sexual harassment because if what I experienced was the mildest gist of it - I cannot comprehend how much anything 'major or important' scars people and the way they go about their lives.

This is all folks. I just want to let all the people out there know that you can never be too careful even with people who you seemingly know, do know your limits and be vocal if you don't like the situation that you're in. Also just to share this with someone as it is sitting heavy on my mind rn. If I had not been the assertive, not easy to intimidate person, I really don't want to know where that night would have gone.

Some people are dicks.

tl:dr Thought I had a business/networking meeting with my lecturer but he had a different idea as to what the meeting was going to be with kissing me in the middle of it. I promptly tried to escaped the situation. Not cool man."
8uxp9t,2,2018-06-29,Crushing on a girl; boyfriend approves. Next steps?,iiimperatrice,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/8uxp9t/crushing_on_a_girl_boyfriend_approves_next_steps/,"This is my first time posting here, so hello! :)

This is about me [F26], my bf, [M25], and a co-worker [F21].

- - -


**Some background:**

I have always identified as a straight woman. Despite this, there have been a handful of times in my life where I felt a romantic and/or sexual attraction to a girl. As a young teen I was very afraid of penetrative sex. I am not particularly aroused by porn that involves PIV sex or penises in general. I have always enjoyed the sensuality of lesbian porn and I am a huge fan of anything ""light touch"".

I have never actually pursued a woman before, but I have had fantasies about it over the years. I eventually just shook off these feelings because I was not comfortable with myself, and I am still not very comfortable with myself sexually due to past abuse from boyfriends and poor sex education.

- - -


**The general situation:**

My boyfriend and I intern at a co-working space and there is a very beautiful girl who recently started working there who I immediately had a good working friendship with. Super intelligent, very funny/witty, absolutely gorgeous.

My boyfriend, after I had confessed some things to him on an unrelated topic, told me that he thought she was attractive (in an attempt to meet a confession with a confession to build trust). I agreed with him in the conversation and said it wasn't weird for him to think that, but in the days afterward, I started feeling very insecure and that he had some secret crush on her and that he was cheating on me.

We go to couples' therapy every 2 weeks, so I brought this up in therapy, and my bf and therapist were very confused as to why I would jump to that conclusion. So I took a step back and re-evaluated my thought process and feelings, and apologized to my bf who did nothing wrong and was hurt by my accusation. We are past this at this point.

What I've realized, as of last night, is that *I'm* actually the one who has the crush on her.

- - -

**To the point:**

Last night there was a work party/event at the place we intern. The co-worker [F21] arrives and I decide after having a glass of wine that I want to address my feelings of insecurity to her directly. I basically told her that I wanted to put it out there and clear the air that I was feeling insecure about her around my boyfriend because I think she is really pretty, etc. She was extremely understanding; told me that she would talk to him less if that would make me feel better; told me that she ""likes {me} more than him anyway"" and we went about our night with no tension in the air about it. I had a great time and I felt much more at ease about the situation.

I'm not sure exactly when I realized it, but I felt a sexual magnetism toward her. She invited me and my bf out to her other place of work (a bar/restaurant) where her boyfriend was bartending. We happily accepted and on the way there, I confessed to my bf how I was feeling about our co-worker. I think this is an appropriate time for me to say that when I was first getting to know her at work she told me that she is bisexual. If she had not told me this, I would not even be making this post.

My boyfriend told me on the way to the bar that I have his full permission to attempt to pursue her for what would be (if she actually accepts and it's okay with her bf) my first girl-on-girl sexual encounter. He and I talked at length about it and I believe him that as long as I communicated the details of the situation to him honestly and openly that he is actually truly accepting of me having a sexual event with another female without him there. Him saying that sent my imagination wild and when we got to the bar all I wanted to do was chat her up and flirt with her.

She showed me her tattoos which were in very hot locations on her body, and she was very close to me (think sitting so close in bar seats that our knees were touching/arms were touching) throughout most of the outing. Before she left she kissed me on the cheek! I know at one point I think I accidentally/after more wine and less inhibitions gave her bedroom eyes, and I don't know if she caught that or not.

Basically now I'm wondering what to do next. I know there's a big possibility that she will not be into it or not be able to/comfortable with doing stuff with me due to her being in a relationship. She is also leaving town in about 2 months or so to go back to college in another state, so I'm thinking this might be a good opportunity for me to try out something new, even if I do get rejected. I believe that she is a mature enough individual that we could still maintain a friendship even if she is not interested in exploring things with me sexually.

Some specific questions...

• How long do I wait until I try to bring this proposition up to her? Should I do it outside of our internship (I already expressed to her a few times that I would love to hang out with her outside of work)?

• Is there a ""best way"" or ""low impact"" way to gauge her feelings without outright telling her I'm sexually attracted to her and want to see if she would be willing to experiment with me as my first female sexual partner? If not, what the heck should I say to not scare her away from friendship if she's not interested in being intimate with me? I really don't want to make her feel uncomfortable and I want to be as respectful as possible because I know that's what I would want in return.

Thinking about her actually being intimate with me makes me feel so nervous but also really excited... it's a very exhilarating feeling I have not felt in a long time and it's all very new and interesting to me. I kind of feel like I'm unveiling a part of myself that I've always been ashamed of.

- - -

**TL;DR &amp; Clarifications:**

• I have felt sexual attraction to women in the past but this is the first time I have an opportunity to make a move.

• The girl I want to be intimate with works with my bf and I at an unpaid internship at a co-working space for creative professionals. We have known each other for about a month.

• This internship ends in August for me and her as well, and at that point she will be going to another state for college.

• My boyfriend is totally okay with me propositioning this girl for sex and I think he is actually pretty turned on by it as well.

• She told me that she is bisexual otherwise I would not have considered this scenario as a possibility.

• I want to ask her about how she feels regarding setting aside some time to have an intimate session with me.

• I believe that trying out sex with a woman will broaden my sexual horizons and help me discover and learn more about myself.

• I'm here to ask what the best way to go about this situation is, and to ask for general advice about trying this out.

Thanks to anyone who reads this! Double thanks to anyone who might be able to provide me with some insight or advice! &lt;3 I've always really liked this subreddit; y'all are cool people and I appreciate any and all feedback. :)

He is thinking we should take a break because we too far from each other. I keep telling him that we shouldnt take a break. 
He means a lot to me. I became really attached to him after we made love for the first time and losing my virginity to him. I cant take a break it hurts so much when he talks about and I feel myself about to breakdown and cry. 
I really think we can make this work but for him the diatance he says its making him miss me even more. He wants to come home from work and hold me and talk to me face to face I want that more anything myself. I keep telling him I only have 2 years left and I graduate with my PharmD and I can literally work anywhere there is a pharmacy/hospital.

8uz49i,369,2018-06-29,I scored a major victory this week.,ACfireandiceDC,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8uz49i/i_scored_a_major_victory_this_week/,"People always post about their failings on here - which I can understand, as this is a support sub, but I wanted to post something really positive to change the mood a bit.

My life [23M] has recently collapsed. My mental illness made a relapse, I wasted a savings of $6,300 and now I'm $1,200 in debt. I failed my last semester in school, have three more years to go, and was very pessimistic about it, until recently. My OCD made me feel morrible obsessive thoughts. I got rejected from my dream school earlier this year. And even though I wasn't doing anything, I wasn't taking any free time, either. So I had almost no hobbies and interests to show for myself, didn't watch any TV shows, etc. I am a great runner and a great guitar player, but that's the only thing I -have- had going for myself as of late.

In my major (mechanical engineering), it is essential to have internships, otherwise no one will hire you as an engineer, even if you have a 4.0 GPA. So, I completed one and a half applications for two different engineering firms I found on craigslist. *Okay, whatever, might as well so this*.

Then, last Tuesday, I got a call from some random number. It was one of the companies that I applied to. They told me that they saw my resume and that they were interested in doing an interview. I showed up that afternoon, was shown around the shop, and got the job on the spot.

I am now making $12 an hour, 30 hours per week for an aerospace engineering company that manufactures landing gear for aircraft, and I am re-taking my Calculus II class over the summer. I spent my work day today revising the drawings of several mechanical parts that are going to be used by several of their customers, including Boeing.

Now, not only will I be able to pay off my debt in no time, I'll also be able to save up for different things that I have wanted to buy soon afterwards. The fact that I am so busy just completely diminishes my mental illness/obsessive OCD thoughts.

KEEP GOING THROUGH, PEOPLE! IT GETS BETTER."

8uzu83,5,2018-06-30,Today was my NMom's birthday,StillContest,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8uzu83/today_was_my_nmoms_birthday/,"Hi all, bit of a huge vent post coming through. I (21, F) just found this subreddit today and really needed some place to voice my thoughts; I'm really glad that there seems to be a community of people struggling through the same things I've struggled with for a long time and hopefully this is an appropriate place to post.

Like it says in the title, today was my mom's birthday. I've always had a strained relationship with my mom who is overbearing, overprotective, narcissistic, and physically/mentally ill. She is completely controlling of everything I do and I have struggled with the anxiety, self-consciousness, and depression this has caused. Without getting too into the nitty gritty, she has very severe rheumatoid arthritis, often has severe mood swings and irrational paranoia and delusions, and is generally very angry and bitter about everything in her life. I genuinely feel bad for her pain because she is my mother and raised me for so many years and I still crave love and affection from her often. 

I wanted to do something for her so I handwrote her a card with some drawings on it and made an album of my college graduation photos to surprise her since she was too sick to go. I gave her these presents today and she seemed happy enough at first, but then gradually got angrier and angrier as she flipped through the album. All she did was make biting comments about how awful I looked--my cap was wrong, my dress looks too short, I look like a fool and I'm humiliating myself and look so ugly. One of my mom's irrational delusions is basically that Jews/Chinese people are responsible for everything in her life (we are Chinese). She had a bad childhood growing up in China and for some reason she's just chosen Jews to be her scapegoat for everything bad that's happened since. I have long hair, and my cap was slipping off in some of my photos, and she was completely triggered by this and went into a rant about how I looked like I was wearing a ""Jew hat"" and this is yet another thing I'm doing to betray her by associating myself with ""the Jews"". 

She is incredibly racist even beyond her delusions and it has always been frustrating to deal with because she refuses to listen to reason. When I try to argue that she's being ridiculous about it, she clams up like a 5 year old and locks herself in her room, screaming and yelling to herself (in English, which is unsettling because she tends to speak Chinese). She is absolutely offended at the idea of seeing a doctor for either her mental or physical issues because she is convinced all doctors are evil and trying to kill her. 

She is always using this to control my friendships. I have never had a friend she approved of, and she retroactively labels them all as ""evil"" and ""Jewish"" or ""Chinese"" as insults so consistently that I am constantly having to rotate through fake friend names because she's hated all of my friends so much. I am an only child and she cannot stand the fact that I will have to move away from her; she has invested everything into me and is of the mindset that I am her property until she dies. I recently graduated, and am moving two states away after this summer, and she is constantly reminding me of how I am hurting her and disappointing her and I do not make her proud at all. I've never wanted anything but for her to be proud of me, and I am just really put down by the fact that even my Uber driver seems to be able to muster more excitement for my accomplishments in life than she is. 

I work in software engineering and she is convinced that every single big name company I could want to work for is ""Jewish"" and that I am associating myself with people who want to hurt her and I am betraying her. She doesn't want me to work at all, she wants me to stay here at home forever even if I don't talk to her while I am here so that she can have peace of mind. I've given up an internship because of how violently she rejected the idea, and I feel that she is constantly impeding my chances at career advancement. She is always threatening me by saying things like ""if you do this, you won't be my daughter anymore"" or threatening to leave me which always guilt trips me into staying. I've put my foot down about my upcoming full time job, but she is laying on the guilt trips so heavily these days.

It is so heart breaking to me because even though I resent her, I loved her and still do love her so much. I was definitely a ""mommy's girl"" growing up and I have had a hard time letting go of all the good times and sacrifices she's made for me because she really did give up a lot to take care of me. She is not always mean to me. On her good days, she can be loving and affectionate and these are the times that make it so hard for me to just cut off our relationship. 

On a side note my dad is my lifeline and I don't think I could be here or cope with it without him. He is the most supportive and loving parent I could have asked for and I feel so bad that he constantly has to deal with the fallout of my mom's bad moods even more than I do. He is not of great health and the guilt is killing me that all of these family issues will stress him out and affect his health more. I know that my anxiety and depression can't be making it any easier on him  although I try my best to be a positive part of his life. 

Today I also gave her my card, which she later gave back to me and told me to redraw the little chibi version of myself I had drawn on the front because it ""looked awful and nothing like me"". I'm genuinely really hurt by this. She hasn't ever done anything like this before, and I really put a lot of time into making this card and the album and she threw them both back in my face and told me to redo them. I don't even want to redo the card anymore because I am feeling so discouraged by her reaction and feeling bad about myself in general. I wish she could have just...pretended she liked it or something to spare my feelings, and it is things like these that make me very afraid to ever show or talk to her about anything. 

Thanks for reading through this if you've gotten this far! I'm not even sure what I am looking for, but it was killing me to keep it bottled inside and even typing this out has helped me sort through my feelings. 

Good luck to all of us out here. &lt;3 "
8uzww6,3,2018-06-30,Day 1,surferbb,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8uzww6/day_1/,"Rising senior in college.  Stopped at school for a month and a half, was doing really well.  I was seeing someone who was also sober, but a little crazy.  She started drinking again, so I did too, and just fell down the rabbit hole.  Took a sip of the elixir and have been wanting a drink since.  Spent this week hungover every morning and nearly missing meetings for this great internship I’m doing.  Being home, my sister usually has the car so I’m just at home alone with nothing to do, when I used to be able to go surf after work, so I end up just smoking and drinking and cooking.  Basically dizzy by the time I’m ready for bed, per usual.  Met with a friend last night who was always a mentor to me and I laughed and told him I went to AA earlier in the year, and he said he does MA and hasn’t smoked for a year (another thing I’m stopping).  But the friend recommended this subreddit, so here I am!  I’m so tired of being hungover and hating myself whenever I start drinking again.  Didn’t drink today though!"
8uzzz6,5,2018-06-30,Adventures Continue (intern out of town),roblestion,Hotwife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hotwife/comments/8uzzz6/adventures_continue_intern_out_of_town/,"So if you’ve been following my progress and updates, my wife and I have been easing into this lifestyle and she recently gave her first blowjob to another man since we’ve been married to her intern. Check out my posts to get caught up and for the details of that story.

Anywho, flash forward to this week and my wife and I have been having great sex. She told me how hot it was knowing I was watching her have another dick in her mouth and how great it felt. I’m glad she’s positive about it because I was afraid she’d reflect back and regret it. So this Thursday was my companies early 4th of July party since most people would be out Friday and next week. My company comped us a room at the hotel where they threw he party and the plan was to invite the intern to our hotel and have a whole night of fun. That didn’t work out because he had to leave town on Monday for a personal situation. We were bummed but decided to try other stuff at the hotel.

At the party we decided to try some hotwife stuff. My wife wore a tight black dress with her cleavage showing. I loved that my co workers were ogling at her and she flirted as well but my co workers were too nice to try anything which I guess is a good thing lol. We both decided to head up to the room early and plan sexier stuff. We checked out CL and thought about posting an add but then we decided to try something else. We were going to order room service and have my wife totally naked when the employee comes in. We’d done something similar in the past but just her in her lingerie. This would be totally nude and we agreed to go with the flow and see what happens. My wife laid on the hotel bed totally naked and I called room service and ordered some wine. We both sat there trying desperately not to have sex being so turned on. Then there was a knock on the door.

When my wife heard the knock she spread her legs wide open and made her pussy visible. I went to answer the door and let the employee in. He was a young black man. This turned me on so much for some reason. My wife’s never mentioned liking black men but the thought of something happening turned me on. We’re both Indian by the way born and raised in the states. Any who, the employee put the wine on the table and turned around and saw my wife on the bed. His eyes almost popped out of his head and his profession voice turned much more street lol. He just said damn. He then asked if she was my wife I said yes and asked him what he thought. He said he’d smash in a heartbeat. She smiled and said hmm idk about that but I’m okay with you looking. I thought it was done and he’d leave but he said shit I’ll take whatever you give me. I said it’s up to her. She said well come closer and let’s see what I can give you. I couldn’t believe it. My wife invited him closer on her own. She wanted him! I was so hard at this point I immediately took my cock out.

He walked up right next to her and I followed. He asked what she wanted to do. My wife replied by saying let’s go with the flow he reached out and touched her left tit and she let out a moan. I walked to the other side of her and she grabbed my dick and started stroking i noticed him take his out as well. He was very well hung. Not overly huge but above average for sure. He asked if he could get some too. I still couldn’t believe this was happening. She smiled at me and turned over to him and put her hand on his dick. She now had one in each hand but was def more focused on his stroking it up and down almost like she was getting to know it lol. At this point I saw his hand leave her chest and slide down to her pussy. He stuck a finger in her and she moaned as he picked up the pace. He then said he doesn’t have condoms she said that’s okay let’s just do other stuff. I knew there wouldn’t be sex going in we’re not there yet but I’m glad he was okay with it. 

After a few minutes of stroking us both she slowed down as the guy started slamming his fingers in her. I could tell she was gonna cum. Then like clockwork, for the first time I witnessed my wife cumming by another man. She screamed orgasm moans and he kept going. Just as she was cumming he moved close to her and basically shoved his cock into her moaning mouth! I was so amazed and turned on! This is the first guy that just seized the opportunity and went for it! She made a gargling sound and was surprised for sure to to MY surprise she didn’t move her mouth and started sucking immediately and jacking me off intensely while sucking him. He was moaning loud too and still playing with her pussy but soon moved his hands behind my wife’s head and started fucking her mouth! Like he was fucking it really hard! I came right then and there all over my wife’s body and she moved her hand off my cock and on his stomach almost to push him off I thought but she actually grabbed his waste and brought him in closer.

He fucked my wifes mouth like a madman while she moaned until he held her head still. I knew he was cumming deep in my wife’s throat! I could here here gargling and gagging. My wife doesn’t really like swallowing so I thought she might hate it and be angry I was actually afraid of him pulling his dick out. To my surprise once he pulled his dick out she immediately looked up at him and opened her mouth showing him there was no cum and she swallowed it all. He immediately put on his underwear and pants and said he has to get back to work ASAP. He said thanks and hope I didn’t mind I said I didn’t he wrote his number down on a napkin and said call whenever to do it again. Once he left my wife layed on the bed catching her breath. I couldn’t believe I just saw my wife get her mouth fucked by a black man. She looked over at me her body covered in my cum and her mouth messy and red and told me I better fuck her right now. I jumped right on top and went in. During sex she told me to kiss the mouth that sucked on a big black cock and asked if I liked watching her get her mouth fucked. We fucked for like 40 minutes before I came in her. 

The next morning we checked out of the hotel I guess the guy from the night before told his coworkers what happened because a few other black guys were looking at us and said “y’all had fun huh?” I said we sure did. My wife looked at them and said A LOT OF FUN. The stared at her in a sexual way as we left. We talked about how awesome that all was but she says she wants a break for a bit and just wants it to be us which I think is a really good idea. I’ve realized it’s important to have love and truly be attracted to one another to live this life or it gets messy fast.

All in all I’m still letting it all sync in. She mentioned that she felt like a total slut when getting her mouth fucked but in a good way. That she just wanted him to use her. That turned me on so much haha.

But yea that was this week. Well probably take it easy for a while but let me know what you guys thought!"
8v05n4,104,2018-06-30,Bodega Boys NYC Guide for non-New Yorkers,lightanldutchie,bodegaboys,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodegaboys/comments/8v05n4/bodega_boys_nyc_guide_for_nonnew_yorkers/,"I noticed that a lot of ya aren't from New York and I thought I'd put together a quick hood Yelp guide of some of the spots they often mention on the podcast because I'm a Queens native now living in Harlem and actively go or have been to a lot of these spots and maybe ya think they're fictional or are wondering what they're actually like. Not sure if anyone has put something like this together already and this definitely doesn't include all the spots so feel free to add them below if you remember any. ***Disclaimer: some of these places are mad hood so maybe don't go if you look like food (white) and/or don't got the hammer with you.***

**Salsa con Fuego**

A restaurant/lounge/club at different times of the day. Food is mad good but the wait is kind of long. Crowd is an interesting mix, lots of Puerto Rican aunts with the yiddies out but also young Dominican chicks. Come just so you say you've gone but not a favorite for me personally for grub or going out at night. I rate it **3/5 bodega cats.**

**Don Coqui (at City Island)**

The spot you took your moms to on mother's day. AC is very weak, parking is a scam, hookah in abundance but the pernil &amp; paella are poppin. **4/5 bodega cats.**

**La Marina**

Lot of fake sand, exposed skin, hookah smoke &amp; Dominican divorcées. A must though, shit can get a little expensive so pre-game but you'll never have a bad time here, it's a real mess. Good spot to come with a big group or your boo to get those instagram shots of the water you feel me  **5/5 bodega cats, no question**

**Dallas BBQ (referred to as just BBQ's)**

Straight up don't come here, especially not to the Bronx or Times Square or any of the locations if you value yourself. This is the type of place you have a major life epiphany at after consuming mad wings and an enormous henny colada garnished with a test tube of tequila or rum and/or a Coronita bottle that you'll sweat for the next 12 hours of rethinking your life and the choices that led you to this establishment. My waitress quit half way through her shift while serving us to go fight her man outside, this is where dreams go to die. You've been warned. **0/5 bodega cats, I can't in good conscience give it a rating, don't go here!**

**THE McDonald's -**\-(near Yankee Stadium)

The above ground pool of ratchet McDonald's. ""24 hours"" (you probably don't want to be there after midnight to be honest). Looks a bit like a methadone clinic. Lots of dope fiends and homeless people but the staff are easily the worst people in the building. Probably a good spot to get hepatitis. **1/5 bodega cats because the cashiers can't count so they be giving out extra sauces.**

**Down The Hatch**

A sports/dive bar type of spot. Not really a spot I be at regularly, I think I've gone maybe once or twice kind of surprised Desus is a patron. Wings are fire though but it's just a pretty standard bar, nothing special. **3/5 bodega cats**

**Sue's Rendevouz (RIP)**

Was a gentleman's club (strip joint) in Mount Vernon. Basically like any other strip club except super Bronxified. I got robbed there once but it wasn't violent at least. Notable for being Cardi B's former place of employment. **3/5 bodega cats**

**Mama Sushi** Totally forgot this was mentioned on the podcast. Very chill Dominican fusion sushi spot in Dyckman. Unlike the Yakubian spots where you’ll find bankers doing sake bombs and trying to fuck the Fashion PR interns, you’re more likely to see 6 people to a hookah hose. Food is bomb, atmosphere is dope, you can come here without the rattie. Recommend the tuna tartare with platanitos. **5/5 bodega cats**

**\*Pizza Zoo**

Pizza Zoo is not really a spot, it's like a (bi)monthlyish party that comes thru and it's exactly what it sounds like. Just a massive pizza party, somewhat rave-like but hood dudes do come through. There's a bit of a younger crowd, lot of NYU sorority girls and summer interns but it's very lit. I used to go a lot last summer, they have them at La Marina these days. Definitely hit one up if you're in the city, I just found out they have them in Miami and some other places too.  **4/5 bodega cats**

Feel free to drop any below that I missed and avoid most of these if you can lmao"
8v07b3,13,2018-06-30,How I Imagine Riot Came Up with the God King Skins,brysonmcbizzle,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8v07b3/how_i_imagine_riot_came_up_with_the_god_king_skins/,"Preface: No flame to any Rioters, I just spent way too much time making a dumb story about a sad Riot Games intern named Kevin.

5 or 6 guys wearing vintage graphic tees sit around a long table in a room with a blanked projector. The man standing at the end of the table announces to the room, ""So, HR said they want an event to get people back to playing League. They want something cool, but simple. So let's start with Garen, what do we got? James?""

James, sitting closest to Bossman looks up from his doodle pad covered in dickbutts, says, ""Uhhh... what about God Garen?""

""God Garen? Really?""

""I mean, yeah... you got some alliteration, and it sounds pretty awesome...""

...

""James, that is the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard. Did your dad drop you on your head and sell your brain on the dark web for RP?""

James slouches in his spinny chair and sways back and forth with furrowed brows and pursed lips.

""What else we got? Micheal,"" says Bossman.

Micheal, who was busy playing Fortnite on his laptop, looks up and says, ""Huh? Oh, yeah... uhhh... what about King Garen? Cause he's like the king of Demacia, or something.""

Bossman says, ""Oh yeah... yeah, that's a great idea... that someone already fucking had, you baboon. You think HR wants us selling a 520 RP event skin from a 5 year old line? GOD, you're so fucking dumb.""

Micheal, already engulfed in the game play of an actually good game, mumbles, ""Oooohh... okay yeah...""

Bossman holds his fingers to his forehead in frustration knowing of the failure that any further pitches are going to be. In the very back of the room, an eager intern named Kevin raises his hand. Bossman scoffs, and gestures to Kevin.

Kevin says, ""So, what if... God... King Garen?""

....

Bossman says, ""God King Garen?""

""... Yeah.""

Bossman stares at Kevin for a moment, considering all the things he could possibly say or do to explain to Kevin how much of a fucking idiot he is. Eventually, Bossman decides to throw his chair across the room over Kevin's head! Kevin ducks in terror.

""Oh my God, Kevin. You are such a fucking- Just get the fuck out- GET THE FUCK OUT!""

Kevin get's out of his chair, crying as he walks towards the meeting room door for the final time as an intern at Riot Games. Kevin can hardly navigate the cramped room with the tears welling up in his eyes. Kevin leaves the Riot Games offices and hops on his bike.

Kevin had only just been hired by Riot, and he was still moving in to the area. He hadn't even found an apartment yet. He checked out his hotel that morning and he misplaced his wallet while he was trying to find his way around the office. Kevin was lost.

Eventually, Kevin decided to do the only thing he could do: bike back home to Wisconsin. The first day was hard. He didn't have anything to eat, and he was biking all day long. Sadly, Kevin was a pretty slow bicyclist. He only made it about 20 miles out of Los Angeles before he popped his front tire.

Kevin walked to the nearest phone booth which was approximately 47.6 meters away. He searched his pockets for loose change that he might use to call his mommy. Predictably, he had no such change. Kevin sat on the curb in the Petsmart parking lot, and he began to cry again.

As Kevin considered all the times he went wrong in his life, he ruled that coming to California to work at Riot was his worst decision. The second was buying a ticket to go to TanaCon. So there Kevin sat, crying uncontrollably. No money to spend on food; he spent it all on his ticket to TanaCon. At this rate, Kevin would dehydrate from the tears.

As Kevin sat there watering the concrete of the parking lot, a black hyundai pulled up and rolled down its window.

""Kevin, what are ya doin?"" asks Bossman from inside the car.

Kevin, sniffling his sadness away, looks up surprised by Bossman.

Bossman says, ""Hey, great news! I pitched your God King Garen idea to HR. They loved it! You're a hit! They liked it so much, they're gonna make a God King Darius skin too!""

""What? But...""

""Come on, you can stay at my place for the night. We need you to come in at 9 tomorrow to start leading the design on the skins.""

Kevin looks down at the stain his tears have left on the concrete. Just moments later, those tears will evaporate into what would seem like nothingness. In this moment, Kevin realizes his mortality. One day, he will evaporate and cease to exist. He understands the futility of life. But in this same moment, Kevin realizes that just as his tears evaporate and disappear, they also join the cycle of rain. Evaporating, condensating, and percipitating. As he evaporates, he decomposes and joins the cycle of life beyond his own. Kevin thinks for a moment on this, and looks up at Bossman to ask a question.

""Am I getting paid""

Bossman says, ""You. Will never get paid. You fucking monkey. Get in the car.""

Kevin smiles. He is happy.

The End"
8v12ic,12,2018-06-30,[L][23][F] Just need to vent - I feel like I'm decaying,PublicDisk,KindVoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/comments/8v12ic/l23f_just_need_to_vent_i_feel_like_im_decaying/,"***TL;DR at the bottom because this is some FAT wall of text !!***

I live at home with my parents and they've both left to go to work now, and my emotions are very intense today. In fact, they're intense everyday for a period until i manage to pull myself out of it, usually that involves wasting my whole day though until I feel better, so I'm just going to write out everything I feel at this very moment because I realise I never talk about it to anyone anymore.

I'm not lonely, I have friends, but it's something I wouldn't want to bother them with, I don't want them to feel bad for me or think I'm being over-dramatic, which I often feel I am. I don't necesarily need anyone right now even, i just need to write and maybe see if anyone can relate, and I would like to speak without fear of judgement.

A quick background: It's just over a year since I graduated from University - i got a first class degree in a ""useless"" subject, (I'm from the UK) but one that I'm extremely passionate about and I loved every second of it, but for society I suppose its pretty useless. Still I'm proud of myself and I don't regret it. But since then, I've been a mess, unemployed, and this past year I have been able to quantify just how much I'm hindering myself by my low confidence, my low self-esteem and how easy it is for me to fall into an emotional pit and fucking stay there.

There are a few things that press down on me, but I'm an aspiring artist and that's the main thing so I'll start there, and thats what I studied. If anyone out there is an artist they'll know the struggles and the low confidence that come with it so I won't need to go too much into that but basically I just don't feel good enough where I am to take it into a career, even though thats what I so desperately want and is what I studied for.

My spiraling mood has really held me back, the circle of low self-esteem causes me to do ANY activity which gives me some instant gratification but I stop myself from working on my bigger goals probably out of fear and perfectionism.

Sometimes I feel like I can’t face anyone. I see people around me, my friends, peers I graduated with in employment, living their best lives, stable jobs (some are in fucking great jobs), dating, going out, having fun, getting some fucking life experience and I can’t help but feel I’ve messed up somewhere along the way because I’m sitting at home wilting. Through my teen years I never made the most of my summers, I wasted them away watching anime and drawing, I never thought to find a job or work experience because I didn’t think of the future, I just wanted to watch Naruto and spend my afternoons on Gaia Online lol. I had a few close friends and kept to myself really so I never spent my teenage years on fast mode trying to have every experience possible. So now out of uni, I have a pathetically weak CV, very little life experience and my skin is still a mess, hahahha.

My parents are wonderful, they’ve always been 100&amp;#37; supportive in every way, perhaps too much sometimes! I don’t have much financial independence, and Ive never earnt enough money to support myself, and it feels awful not earning your own money especially at my age. I’m not accepting financial help from them at the moment, they’ve supported me a lot in the past.

As for my love life / dating, I’m very behind in that as well although I don’t actually care much. My main anxieties stem from my career goals, my self esteem and my independence and I think my dating life will follow after I get all that going. I’ve never been on a date or kissed anyone, but I look forward to doing that some day! Thankfully, I don’t feel unattractive (when I have make up on ha) I’m fairly okay looking and there’s not a lack of male attention, it’s just I’ve never really been attracted to anyone or actually wanted to date, and I don’t really like the idea of dating. This is the first time admitting this but I do often daydream of that perfect guy…. J I will say though, in the past few years my attitude towards my appearance has improved massively! So this isn’t such a big issue for me but I felt like writing it out anyway.

Right now, at 23 I feel like a teenager whos just trying to get started, in fact I resent my age. But my life WAS magical for 6 weeks recently. I got a surprise paid internship with an amazing studio in London, really, they were such an astoundingly wonderful studio who treated me so well – it was a dream. I was doing work I LOVED in a studio I LOVED in a city I FELL IN LOVE WITH. I was completely, fully, 100&amp;#37; happy in every way, I hadn’t felt that happy since graduation and it was perfect. I cried a lot because I couldn’t believe my luck, I couldn’t believe I was so happy, I crave the independence again, I crave the feeling of my life moving forward, I crave the feeling of being useful in the field that I love and being part of that industry, I crave spending my 20s in London and living my best life there. Unfortunately the field is hard to get into, and there are little jobs in it and most of them are in London – so I need to work on my art a LOT to be able to promote myself and get it out there.

I’m back at home now (not London) I’m working on my art a little more. My plan is to get some work for the summer, I’m applying to summer temp jobs and hoping they won’t mind my little work experience and give me a chance but it’s so hard to get jobs, I have an interview on Tuesday I’m feeling pretty nervous about. It’s especially difficult when your friends are in ‘’proper’ jobs, but I’m trying not to think about that. I’m going to be taking my driving test at the end of July and hopefully getting my license, and if I manage to get a summer job I’ll be saving money towards a move to London. Everything always feels so far away, unachievable, permanently out of reach. Ive felt like that for as long as I remember, and I think that’s why I’ve barely achieved anything of note because I need constant support and encouragement, Ive never really believed in myself.

**TL;DR / Summary:**

So basically, I just feel extremely behind in life in every aspect. I feel like I’ll always be catching up, but right now since nothing is really going anywhere I just feel like time is slipping by so fast and im decaying. Ever since I turned 23 I’ve been painfully aware of my own mortality, the feeling of endless youth is gone, and ive barely experienced it. Everyday I feel some degree of pain, I think all my problems really stem from terrible confidence, and while I’ve thankfully never been depressed I really wonder how depressed people even manage day to day.

**If you made it this far, or just chose to read the summary, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for just choosing to take the time to read, I’ve vented my socks off and I’m ready to get on with my day now.  You needn’t reply or say anything, reading is more than what I could ask for. Thank you.**"

8v1apa,91,2018-06-30,2018 Ultimate College Football Road Trip,rm_a,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/8v1apa/2018_ultimate_college_football_road_trip/,"#2018 Ultimate College Football Road Trip

As a big fan of both college football and road trips, I set out to create a road trip that would allow one to attend as many college football games as possible in 2018.  

##Guidelines

The goal is simple: attend as many college football games in 2018 as possible.  I aimed *mainly* for Division 1 teams, with a slight preference to G5 teams because I like them.  Some D2/D3 conferences don't seem to have a schedule released, though this should have a minimal impact as the vast majority of D2/D3 games are on Saturdays.  As we'll see later, there are a bunch of games that have TBD times that we'll need to work with.  The assumption is each game lasts 3 and a half hours.  All times are in Eastern Time to make time zones easier to deal with.  Travel times and distrances are calculated on Google Maps, with the ability to make up a little time on the road if necessary.

For the purpose of this post, the games were chosen based on ability to travel by car (with one exception) or other ground methods of transportation.  Leave your frequent flier card at home, we're putting the miles on your car.  Since cars require maintenance, we also need to factor in oil changes, and routine maintenance at specific milestones.  

Starting out, you will need a buddy to share driving with, a pillow (you aren't staying at hotels most nights, sorry), your passport, ample food, and ~~a few~~ many Red Bulls.

###Game 1: Wednesday, August 22 6:00PM [Muskingum](#f/muskingum-sheet3-row22-col07) Muskingum Fighting Muskies at [Wittenberg](#f/wittenberg-sheet3-row17-col09) Wittenberg Tigers (Scrimmage)

In all my research, it appears that this is the first college football game in 2018 between two different colleges in the US.  We're starting out our adventures in Springfield, Ohio, midway between Dayton and Columbus, with a scrimmage between two D3 teams.  A nice matchup before we get to full-fledged action.

###Game 2: Saturday, August 26 Time TBD [Duquesne](#f/duquesne) Duquesne Dukes at [UMass](#f/umass) UMass Minutemen

*Travel: 751 miles, 11 hrs 19 min*

There's a number of games on the Saturday of ""Week 0"" but this will be the only time we see UMass play, and it's at home so we get to see the UMass Marching Band.  They're better than the football team.

Time is TBD, however largely irrelevant.  Other Saturdays this will not be the case.

###Game 3: Thursday, August 30 6PM [Ouachita Baptist](#f/ouachitabaptist-sheet2-row04-col08) Ouachita Baptist Tigers at [Northwestern (OK)](#f/northwestoklahomastate-sheet2-row04-col06) Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers

*Travel: 1,679 miles, 24 hrs*

We're watching some midweek GACtion, despite many other schools starting games up.  Ouachita Baptist made the D2 playoffs last year, so this could be a good game.  A couple hours away Oklahoma State is playing Missouri State, but we're taking this game instead because there won't be any untimed downs.

###Game 4: Friday, August 31 9:30PM [Colorado](#f/colorado) Colorado Buffaloes vs [Colorado State](#f/coloradostate) Colorado State Rams (Denver, CO)

*Travel: 522 miles, 7 hrs 51 min*

Rocky Mountain Showdown under the lights.  Get ready for our first double header in just a few hours.

###Game 5: Saturday, September 1 12PM [FAU](#f/fau) Florida Atlantic Owls at [Oklahoma](#f/oklahoma) Oklahoma Sooners

*Travel: 697 miles, 9 hrs 57 min*

Last night's game ended at 1AM (11PM local).  This game kicks off at 12PM (11AM local), so we have time to get some gas in Kansas and try to find some food, but there's minimal time we're off the road.  Lane Kiffin looks to extend his winning streak in one of the more exciting matchups of the weekend.

###Game 6: Saturday, September 1 7PM [Central Arkansas](#f/centralarkansas) Central Arkansas Bears at [Tulsa](#f/tulsa) Tulsa Golden Hurricane

*Travel: 127 miles, 2 hrs*

While Joey Freshwater is hitting the bars, we're hitting the road.  We have three and a half hours to make it to Tulsa.  Central Arkansas was 10-2 last year and Tulsa was 2-10, so we could witness an FCS upset.

###Game 7: Sunday, September 2 7:30PM [Miami](#f/miami) Miami Hurricanes vs [LSU](#f/lsu) LSU Tigers (Arlington, TX)

*Travel: 276 miles, 4 hrs 19 min*

Opening weekend means bonus football.  This is a primetime game so we have travel time to spare.

*Travel: 858 miles, 12 hrs 53 min*

*Travel: 818 miles, 13 hrs 11 min*

FCS Missouri State takes on D2 Lincoln in this weeknight matchup.  We're coming up on 6,000 miles and it isn't even the second Saturday of the season, so it's time for a tire rotation and oil change in Missouri.

###Game 10: Friday, September 7 8PM [TCU](#f/tcu) TCU Horned Frogs at [SMU](#f/smu) SMU Mustangs

*Travel: 414 miles, 6 hrs 37 min*

*Travel: 494 miles, 7 hrs 24 min*

Once again, we're driving on a Friday night.  This week the trip is a bit shorter, only to Manhattan, Kansas for a SEC-Big 12 matchup.  It just means more.

###Game 12: Saturday, September 8 7PM [Wyoming](#f/wyoming) Wyoming Cowboys at [Missouri](#f/missouri) Missouri Tigers

*Travel: 249 miles, 3 hrs 49 min*

We're keeping the SEC theme for our doubleheader, and we're also hauling ass.  We need to make up 20 minutes on I-70 to make kickoff, but it'll be doable.  We'll see how Wyoming does without Josh Allen, and how Drew Lock looks in his senior season.

###Game 13: Thursday, September 13 7:30PM [Boston College](#f/bostoncollege) Boston College Eagles at [Wake Forest](#f/wakeforest) Wake Forest Demon Deacons

*Travel: 843 miles, 12 hrs 29 min*

*Travel: 682 miles, 10 hrs*

By this time we're used to traveling on Friday nights.  This week we're going to a packed Glass Bowl in Toledo.  How could we pass up a (likely) ranked P5 team visiting a G5 team?

###Game 16: Saturday, Setember 15 4PM [Eastern Kentucky](#f/easternkentucky) Eastern Kentucky Colonels at [Bowling Green](#f/bowlinggreen) Bowling Green Falcons

*Travel: 25 miles, 28 min*

One of the advantages of having your rival a half hour away is an intense rivalry game.  In our case, it helps us complete our doubleheader.  Toledo's cross division rival, Bowling Green, takes on FCS Eastern Kentucky as we arrive minutes before kickoff.

Penn State night games are nice, except this one is in Champaign so there's no whiteout.  Lovie Smith looks for his first big win for the Illini.

###Game 19: Saturday, September 22 12PM [Shepherd](#f/shepherd-sheet2-row10-col06) Shepherd Rams at [West Virginia State](#f/westvirginiastate-sheet2-row10-col10) West Virginia State Yellow Jackets

*Travel: 428 miles, 6 hrs 42 min*

We're off to West Virginia for some noon D2 football.  It's that time of the year where times are still TBD, so we're seeing games where times have already been announced – mostly lower division.  Another possible doubleheader (depending on game times) is: [Michigan State](#f/michiganstate) Michigan State Spartans at [Indiana](#f/indiana) Indiana Hoosiers, [WKU](#f/wku) Western Kentucky Hilltoppers at [Ball State](#f/ballstate) Ball State Cardinals, [Boston College](#f/bostoncollege) Boston College Eagles at [Purdue](#f/purdue) Purdue Boilermakers (noon)

###Game 20: Saturday, September 22 7PM [NC State](#f/ncstate) NC State Wolfpack at [Marshall](#f/marshall) Marshall Thundering Herd

*Travel: 41 miles, 46 min*

It's the third week in a road where we're watching a P5 travel to a G5.  I could get used to this.  We Are!

###Game 21\*: Sunday, September 23 4:30PM [Fort Valley State](#f/fortvalleystate-sheet2-row16-col05) Fort Valley State Wildcats at [Benedict](#f/benedict-sheet2-row16-col02) Benedict College

*Travel: 403 miles, 6 hrs 23 min*

This game intrigues me.  While searching D2 schedules, I came across this game scheduled for a Sunday.  It's the only Sunday game I have seen besides Miami vs LSU on Labor Day weekend.  [ESPN](http://insider.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=401040081) has this game listed on their site for Sunday, as do the two colleges.  Benedict's [press release](https://benedicttigers.com/news/2018/3/8/benedict-announces-10-game-football-schedule-for-2018.aspx?path=football) lists the game on Saturday, Fort Valley State does not have a press release for the schedule.  Did an intern transpose the date incorrectly?  Do we actually have Sunday football?  Regardless, we're heading to Columbia, SC in search of Sunday college football.

###Game 22: Thursday, September 27 8PM [North Carolina](#f/northcarolina) North Carolina Tarheels at [Miami](#f/miami) Miami Hurricanes

*Travel: 627 miles, 8 hrs 41 min*

Our third time watching Miami play, but first time we see them at home.  Another tire rotation and oil change are in order before we head to Friday's game.

###Game 23: Friday, September 28 8PM [Memphis](#f/memphis) Memphis Tigers at [Tulane](#f/tulane) Tulane Golden Wave

*Travel: 852 miles, 11 hrs 38 min*

The only other D1 games this Friday at in the northeast or Colorado.  Tulane is the closest, so we're off to the Big Easy.

###Game 24: Saturday, September 29 1PM [Morehead State](#f/moreheadstate) Morehead State Eagles at [Butler](#f/butler) Butler Bulldogs

*Travel: 827 miles, 11 hrs 38 min*

It's the second day in a row of a nearly 12 hour drive, but a schedule full of TBD times has us watching some non-scholarship football in Indianapolis.  

Another possible doubleheader is a bunch of home games in North Carolina.  Two of these games are bound to have kickoff times that allow a doubleheader: [South Alabama](#f/southalabama) South Alabama Jaguars at [Appalachian State](#f/appalachianstate) Appalachian State Mountaineers, [Rice](#f/rice) Rice Owls at [Wake Forest](#f/wakeforest) Wake Forest Demon Deacons, [Virginia Tech](#f/virginiatech) Virginia Tech Hokies at [Duke](#f/duke) Duke Blue Devils, [Virginia](#f/virginia) Virginia Cavaliers at [NC State](#f/ncstate) NC State Wolfpack, [Old Dominion](#f/olddominion) Old Dominion Monarchs at [ECU](#f/eastcarolina) East Carolina Pirates.

###Game 26: Thursday, October 4 8PM [Tulsa](#f/tulsa) Tulsa Golden Hurricane at [Houston](#f/houston) Houston Cougars

*Travel: 1,147 miles, 17 hrs 24 min*

I originally had this day as [Georgia State](#f/georgiastate) Georgia State at [Troy](#f/troy) Troy, but Houston has a semi-new stadium that is worth checking out.  Fear not, Troy fans, we'll see the Trojans in a few weeks.

###Game 27: Friday, October 5 7PM [Georgia Tech](#f/georgiatech) Georgie Tech Yellow Jackets at [Louisville](#f/louisville) Louisville Cardinals

*Travel: 955 miles, 14 hrs 32 min*

We're headed back north for a Friday night ACC matchup.

###Game 28: Saturday, October 6 12PM [McMurry](#f/mcmurry-sheet3-row02-col07) McMurry Warhawks at [Belhaven](#f/belhaven-sheet3-row02-col01) Belhaven Blazers

*Travel: 588 miles, 8 hrs 23 min*

And we're going *back* down south for a noon kickoff in Jackson, MS between D3 schools.

###Game 29: Saturday, October 7 7PM [UAB](#f/uab) UAB Blazers at [Louisiana Tech](#f/louisianatech) Louisiana Tech Bulldogs

*Travel: 155 miles, 2 hrs 14 min*

There's a number of D1 games within a couple hours of Jackson on October 7, but only this one has a kickoff time.  Any of the following games would work with a 7PM kickoff or later: [Connecticut](#f/connecticut) UConn at [Memphis](#f/memphis) Memphis, [ULM](#f/ulm) ULM at [Ole Miss](#f/olemiss) Ole Miss, [Auburn](#f/auburn) Auburn at [Mississippi State](#f/mississippistate) Mississippi State.

###Game 30: Tuesday, October 9 8PM [Appalachian State](#f/appalachianstate) Appalachian State Mountaineers at [Arkansas State](#f/arkansasstate) Arkansas State Red Wolves

*Travel: 301 miles, 4 hrs 58 min*

It's the thirtieth game of the trip and finally a Tuesday game - we've seen a game on every day of the week!  After the long drives to the previous games, a 5 hour drive is nothing.

###Game 31: Thursday, October 11 7:30PM [Georgia Southern](#f/georgiasouthern) Georgia Southern Eagles at [Texas State](#f/texasstate) Texas State Bobcats

*Travel: 672 miles, 9 hrs 54 min*

Our Sun Belt drought was snapped last game, and now we're watching a second Sun Belt game in three days.

###Game 32: Friday, October 12 7PM [USF](#f/usf) USF Bulls at [Tulsa](#f/tulsa) Tulsa Golden Hurricane

*Travel: 483 miles, 7 hrs 23 min*

We're at around 18,000 miles less than two months in, so before the game the car's getting another oil change, tire rotation, and whatever else it needs.  It's our fourth time seeing Tulsa, and second time at Chapman Stadium.  The Tulsa football team is getting a little creeped out.  

###Game 33: Saturday, October 13 1PM [UAB](#f/uab) UAB Blazers at [Rice](#f/rice) Rice Owls

*Travel: 505 miles, 7 hrs 31 min*

We're seeing UAB in back to back weekends as they take on Rice in Houston.

###Game 34: Saturday, October 13 7PM [Louisiana Tech](#f/louisianatech) Louisiana Tech Bulldogs at [UTSA](#f/utsa) UTSA Roadrunners

*Travel: 197 miles, 2 hrs 47 min*

We're also seeing Louisiana Tech in back to back weekends as well.  The 7PM kickoff means that we need to make up 17 minutes on I-10.

###Game 35: Thursday, October 18 9PM [Stanford](#f/stanford) Stanford Cardinal at [Arizona State](#f/arizonastate) Arizona State Sun Devils

*Travel: 982 miles, 14 hrs 9 min*

Finally.  We've been traveling across the eastern half of the United States and finally we have made it out west.  My original plan was home games at [Arkansas State](#f/arkansasstate) Arkansas State, [Pennsylvania](#f/pennsylvania) Penn, [Bucknell](#f/bucknell) Bucknell, and [Morgan State](#f/morganstate) Morgan State (shoutout to the Magnificent Marching Machine), but game times were updated since I originally planned it out so we're headed west.  We're watching some real \#Pac12AfterDark.

###Game 36: Friday, October 19 9PM [Colorado State](#f/coloradostate) Colorado State Rams at [Boise State](#f/boisestate) Boise State Broncos

*Travel: 928 miles, 14 hrs 32 min*

There's a Friday night game in Las Vegas, [Air Force](#f/airforce) Air Force at [UNLV](#f/unlv) UNLV, however my experience with the residents of Boise makes the extra 10 hour drive through nothingness in Nevada absolutely worth it.  After the game, we won't have time to go to the bars with the Boise locals because we have a long drive to make

###Game 37: Saturday, October 20 4PM [Claremont-Mudd-Scripps](#f/claremontmuddscripps-sheet3-row26-col03) Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags at [Occidental](#f/occidental-sheet3-row26-col05) Occidental Tigers

*Travel: 842 miles, 13 hrs 57 min*

We're taking the long overnight drive from Boise to watch a D3 matchup in the oldest college football stadium in Los Angeles.  No time for sleeping after the game - we have another game to catch.

###Game 38: Saturday, October 20 10:30PM [San José State](#f/sanjosestate) San Jose State Spartans at [San Diego State](#f/sandiegostate) San Diego State Aztecs

*Travel: 125 miles, 2 hrs 9 min*

To my surprise the drive from LA to San Diego leaves nearly an hour to account for traffic, time to park the car, and a graceful walk to the stadium for a \#MWCAfterMidnight game.

###Game 39: Tuesday, October 23 8PM [Troy](#f/troy) Troy Trojans at [South Alabama](#f/southalabama) South Alabama Jaguars

*Travel: 1,930 miles, 28 hrs*

It's a good thing there's no Monday games.

###Game 40: Thursday, October 25 7PM [Baylor](#f/baylor) Baylor Bears at [West Virginia](#f/westvirginia) West Virginia Mountaineers

*Travel: 937 miles, 14 hrs 13 min*

We've almost hit the halfway mark in our journey, and what better way to celebrate it than with *Country Roads* and couch burning.  I love Morgantown.

###Game 41: Friday, October 26 8PM [Indiana](#f/indiana) Indiana Hoosiers at [Minnesota](#f/minnesota) Minnesota Golden Gophers

*Travel: 934 miles, 14 hrs 31 min*

We'll get another oil change and tire rotation before this Big Ten matchup.  We've put another 6,500 miles on the car in exactly 2 weeks.

###Game 42: Saturday, October 27 12PM [Charleston (WV)](#f/charleston-sheet2-row10-col01) Charleston Golden Eagles at [Notre Dame (OH)](#f/notredameoh-sheet2-row10-col05) Notre Dame Falcons

*Travel: 763 miles, 11 hrs 43 min*

Not that Notre Dame.  This Notre Dame is located outside Cleveland, Ohio.

###Game 43: Saturday, October 27 7PM [Walsh](#f/walsh-sheet2-row03-col08) Walsh Cavaliers at [Findlay](#f/findlay-sheet2-row03-col04) Findlay Oilers

*Travel: 158 miles, 2 hrs 23 min*

This game was originally [Navy](#f/navy) Navy at [Notre Dame](#f/notredame) Notre Dame, but /u/duffman13jws corrected me that the game was actually in San Diego.  We can't get across the country that fast.

###Game 44: Tuesday, October 30 8PM [Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh) Miami Redhawks at [Buffalo](#f/buffalo) Buffalo Bulls

*Travel: 326 miles, 5 hrs 4 min*

Put your passport away, we're going through Ohio and Pennsylvania to get to Buffalo.  But keep it handy, we'll need it later.

###Game 45: Wednesday, October 31 7:30PM [Ball State](#f/ballstate) Ball State Cardinals at 	[Toledo](#f/toledo) Toledo Rockets

*Travel: 318 miles, 5 hrs 4 min*

5 hours back the way we just came.  And there was a Tuesday night game only half an hour away at Bowling Green State University, but we decided to drive to Buffalo.  Isn't this fun?

###Game 46: Thursday, November 1 7PM [Ohio](#f/ohio) Ohio Bobcats at [Western Michigan](#f/westernmichigan) Western Michigan Broncos

*Travel: 155 miles, 2 hrs 27 min*

It's our third MAC game in a row, but we aren't complaining because our other option was to drive down to see the National Champion [UCF](#f/ucf) UCF Knights all the way in Orlando.

###Game 47: Friday, November 2 7:30PM [Pittsburgh](#f/pittsburgh) Pittsburgh Panthers at [Virginia](#f/virginia) Virginia Cavaliers 

*Travel: 678 miles, 10 hrs 53 min*

We can make all the jokes in the world about the quality of this football game, but Virginia's basketball team was bowl eligible last year and their basketball team had the \#1 seed in the men's basketball tournament.  We'll celebrate their successes by visiting Charlottesville. 

###Game 48: Saturday, November 3 12PM [Air Force](#f/airforce) Air Force Falcons at [Army](#f/army) Army Black Nights

*Travel: 389 miles, 6 hrs 31 min*

No college football bucket list is complete without a visit to West Point for game day.  We even left time to check out Highland Falls and to tailgate on Buffalo Soldier Field.

###Game 49: Saturday, November 3 5PM [Framingham State](#f/framinghamstate-sheet3-row11-col03) Framingham State Rams at [Western Connecticut](#f/westernconnecticutstate-sheet3-row11-col07) Western Connecticut Colonials

*Travel: 54 miles, 1 hr 6 min*

A jump across the Hudson, and we're at the second game of our doubleheader for this weekend - a D3 matchup in the Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference.

###Game 50: Tuesday, November 6 7:30PM [Kent State](#f/kentstate) Kent State Golden Flashes at [Buffalo](#f/buffalo) Buffalo Bulls

*Travel: 391 miles, 6 hrs 13 min*

Back to the track stadium to watch some Tuesday night MACtion.

###Game 51: Wednesday, November 7 TBD [Ohio](#f/ohio) Ohio Bobcats at [Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh) Miami Redhawks

Battle of the Bricks on a Wednesday night.

###Game 52: Thursday, November 8 7:30PM [Wake Forest](#f/wakeforest) Wake Forest Demon Deacons at 	[NC State](#f/ncstate) NC State Wolfpack

*Travel: 538 miles, 8 hrs 49 min*

It's November which means a game a day except for Sundays and Mondays, thanks to the NFL.  Luckily all the games are at night or else we'd be pulling doubleheaders.

###Game 53: Friday, November 9 7PM [Louisville](#f/louisville) Louisville Cardinals at [Syracuse](#f/syracuse) Syracuse Orange

*Travel: 649 miles, 10 hrs 2 min*

You won't need your passport to get into the Cuse Nation for this trap game.  Syracuse has won 6 of their last 7 Friday home games, including two against ranked opponents.

###Game 54: Saturday, November 10 2PM [Centre](#f/centre-sheet3-row25-col04) Centre Colonels at [Birmingham-Southern](#f/birminghamsouthern-sheet3-row25-col03) Birmingham Southern Panthers

*Travel: 1,043 miles, 15 hrs 45 min*

It's a long trip, but it's going to be slightly shorter since we need to make up 15 minutes on the road.  Our next game is slightly less of a drive.

###Game 55: Saturday, November 10 7:30PM [Southern Miss](#f/southernmiss) Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles at [UAB](#f/uab) UAB Blazers

*Travel 1 mile, 5 min*

Yes, you could walk it.  No, you won't want to walk it.  We're driving.  Our overnight drive to Alabama has us at around 7,000 miles since our last trip to the shop, so we're back for an oil change, tire rotation, and a 30,000 mile service.  In three months we've more than doubled the miles the average American drives in a year.

###Game 56: Tuesday, November 13 6PM [Western Michigan](#f/westernmichigan) Western Michigan Broncos at [Ball State](#f/ballstate) Ball State Cardinals

*Travel: 538 miles, 8 hrs 5 min*

We're off to see some Tuesday night MACtion.  We'll stay at Garry Gergich's timeshare in Muncie after the game.  Or was his name Jerry?  Larry, maybe?

###Game 57: Wednesday, November 14 TBD [Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh) Miami Redhawks at [Northern Illinois](#f/northernillinois) Northern Illinois Huskies

*Travel: 290 miles, 4 hrs 39 min*

More MACtion - this time in DeKalb.  We've experienced MACtion in all five states.

###Game 58: Thursday, November 15 9:30PM [FAU](#f/fau) Florida Atlantic Owls at [North Texas](#f/northtexas) North Texas Mean Green

*Travel: 938 miles, 13 hrs 55 min*

We haven't come to the faU this road trip, and we won't, but we'll catch another Owls road game.

###Game 59: Friday, November 16 9PM [Boise State](#f/boisestate) Boise State Broncos at 	[New Mexico](#f/newmexico) New Mexico Lobos

*Travel: 611 miles, 9 hrs 9 min*

Yep, we're headed out west again.  This time, we're seeing a game in New Mexico.

###Game 60: Saturday, November 17 4PM [Sacramento State](#f/sacramentostate) Sacramento State Hornets at [UC Davis](#f/ucdavis) UC Davis Aggies

*Travel: 1,098 miles, 16 hrs 38 min*

Ok, I know this is a huge stretch.  We need to make this drive in 15 hrs 30 minutes.  The speed limit on I-40 is 75mph, so I guess we're going 85.

###Game 61: Saturday, November 17 10:30PM [San Diego State](#f/sandiegostate) San Diego State Aztecs at [Fresno State](#f/fresnostate) Fresno State Bulldogs

*Travel: 187 miles, 2 hrs 55 min*

It's a hell of a day, I know.  This \#MWCAfterMidnight game kicks off 3 hours after the Aggies game ends.

###Game 62: Tuesday, November 20 7PM [Ball State](#f/ballstate) Ball State Cardinals at [Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh) Miami Redhawks 

*Travel: 2,301 miles, 34 hrs*

We're headed back to Oxford for our fourth Miami game.  We got an oil change and tire rotation a week ago, but a trip to California put another 6,000 miles on the car so we get that taken care of here.

###Game 63: Thursday, November 22 3:30PM [Colorado State](#f/coloradostate) Colorado State Rams at [Air Force](#f/airforce) Air Force Falcons

*Travel: 1,172 miles, 17 hrs 38 min*

We're skipping the [Egg Bowl](#f/eggbowl-sheetl-row18-col05) Egg Bowl to see another game at a service academy.  Happy Thanksgiving!

###Game 64: Friday, November 23 12PM [Texas](#f/texas) Texas Longhorns at [Kansas](#f/kansas) Kansas Jayhawks

*Travel: 551 miles, 8 hrs 10 min*

So Black Friday has a few games that could allow for double headers, mostly in the Ohio region.  But we don't have game times yet, so we have to pick a game.  Texas hasn't lost to Kansas since....2016.

###Game 65: Saturday, November 24 1PM [Old Dominion](#f/olddominion) Old Dominion Monarchs at 	[Rice](#f/rice) Rice Owls

*Travel: 764 miles, 11 hrs 30 min*

It's the last day of the regular season for the vast majority of teams, and we're headed to Texas.

###Game 66: Saturday, November 24 7PM [North Texas](#f/northtexas) North Texas Mean Green at [UTSA](#f/utsa) UTSA Roadrunners

*Travel: 197 miles, 2 hrs 57 min*

Out of all of our times that we need to make up time on the road, this could be the hardest.  We need to cut off half an hour of a three hour drive.  It means going 80mph down I-10.  Yikes.

###Game 67: Friday, November 30 7PM [MAC](#l/mac) MAC Championship (Detroit, MI)

*Travel: 1,457 miles, 21 hrs 40 min*

It's conference championship time and we aren't done watching MACtion.  Too bad it isn't on a Tuesday night.  The MAC is the only G5 conference to have a neutral site for the championship.

###Game 68: Saturday, December 1 8PM [Big Ten](#l/bigten) Big Ten Championship (Indianapolis, IN)

*Travel: 301 miles, 4 hrs 38 min*

These drives are getting better, after the November we had.

###Game 69: Saturday, December 8 3PM [Army](#f/army) Army Black Knights vs [Navy](#f/navy) Navy Midshipmen (Philadelphia, PA)

*Travel: 650 miles, 10 hrs 17 min*

There's D2 and D3 playoffs going on, but times and locations are TBD.  It's time to watch America's Game.

###Game 70: Saturday, December 15 12PM [Celebration Bowl](#f/celebration-sheetl-row13-col16) Celebration Bowl ([MEAC](#l/meac) MEAC vs [SWAC](#l/swac) SWAC - Atlanta, GA)

*Travel: 794 miles, 12 hrs 22 min*

The Celebration Bowl is the de facto National Championship for FCS HBCU schools, and the beginning of our first double header in nearly a month.

###Game 71: Saturday, December 15 5:30PM [Camellia Bowl](#l/camellia) Camellia Bowl ([Sun Belt](#l/sunbelt) Sun Belt vs [MAC](#l/mac) MAC - Montgomery, AL)

*Travel: 162 miles, 2 hrs 19 min*

Our first FBS Bowl of the season and we are flying down I-85 to make it to Montgomery in time.  Another 6,000 miles has elapsed - we get the oil change and tire rotation after the game.

###Game 72: Tuesday, December 18 7PM [Boca Raton Bowl](#l/bocaraton) Boca Raton Bowl ([American](#l/aac) American vs [Conference USA](#l/cusa) C-USA - Boca Raton, FL)

*Travel: 645 miles, 9 hrs 46 min*

Ok, I lied above.  I guess technically we are coming to the faU, but unless the Owls get a second home bowl game in a row, we won't see Mr. Freshwater.

###Game 73: Wednesday, December 19 8PM [Frisco Bowl](#l/frisco) Frisco Bowl ([American](#l/aac) American vs At Large - Frisco, TX)

*Travel: 1,325 miles, 18 hrs 41 min*

We're stuck with the long drive since there's only one bowl game.  The Frisco Bowl is only a year old, and is held in a soccer stadium.

###Game 74: Thursday, December 20 8PM [Gasparilla Bowl](#l/stpetersburg) Gasparilla Bowl ([American](#l/aac) American vs [ACC](#l/acc) ACC/[Conference USA](#l/cusa) C-USA - Tampa, FL)

*Travel: 1,130 miles, 16 hrs 36 min*

Back to Florida for the Bad Boy Mowers Gasparilla Bowl.  At least this year it's in a football stadium.

###Game 75: Friday, December 21 12:30PM [Bahamas Bowl](#l/bahamas) Bahamas Bowl ([MAC](#l/mac) MAC vs [Conference USA](#l/cusa) C-USA - Nassau, Bahamas)

*Travel: 22 miles, 40 min*

Here's the biggest stretch of them all.  There's two bowl games on this day - in Boise and the Bahamas. There is not a snowball's chance in hell we can go from Tampa to Boise in 16 hours - we'd have to be going over double the speed limit.  Rather than take a day off we're going to the Bahamas.  We'll drive to Tampa International Airport, conveniently located right next to the Gasparilla Bowl.  Our passport is finally being used! 

Our flight is Delta 1872, leaving TPA at 6:30AM on Saturday morning.  With a 38 minute layover in ATL, we land at NAS at 10:45AM.  After getting a rental and making the 14 km (9 mile) drive to Thomas A. Robinson National Stadium, we're ready to watch the game.

With a 12:30 kickoff, we expect to have the game end at 4pm.  Add in our 16 min drive back to the airport, it's 4:16pm.  The last flight that gets us back to TPA in time for us to make our next game is Jet Blue flight B6 2394, leaving NAS at 7:05pm.  Most websites that I see suggest arriving at NAS about 3 hrs prior to an international flight, so we're cutting it close but can still make the flight.  After a 2 hour layover in FLL, Spirit flight NK 574 gets us back to Tampa at 11:20pm.  If somebody tells you the Bahamas is not a day trip, we just proved them wrong.

###Game 76: Saturday, December 22 12PM [Birmingham Bowl](#l/birminghambowl) Birmingham Bowl ([American](#l/aac) American vs [SEC](#l/sec) SEC - Birmingham, AL)

*Travel: 569 miles, 8 hrs, 55 min*

Spirit Airlines is well known for delayed flights, so luckily we have a ~3 and a half hour cushion between our expected arrival at TPA to when we need to leave to drive to Birmingham.

###Game 77: Saturday, December 22 7PM [Dollar General Mobile Bowl](#l/mobile) Mobile Bowl ([Sun Belt](#l/sunbelt) Sun Belt vs [MAC](#l/mac) MAC - Mobile, AL)

*Travel: 260 miles, 3 hrs 44 min*

We've had little rest in the last week - nearly everything has been back to back and this bowl game is no different.  We need to make up 14 minutes on the road, but by now we're pros at speeding.  Unfortunately, it's our last Saturday double header.

###Game 78: Wednesday, December 26 1:30PM [Heart of Dallas Bowl](#l/dallas) Heart of Dallas Bowl ([Big Ten](#l/bigten) Big Ten vs [ACC](#l/acc) ACC/[Conference USA](#l/cusa) C-USA - Dallas, TX)

*Travel: 584 miles, 9 hrs*

We get a few days off, but we're back on the road for our final stretch.

###Game 79: Thursday, December 27 1:30PM [Independence Bowl](#l/independence) Independence Bowl ([SEC](#l/sec) SEC vs [ACC](#l/acc) ACC/[Notre Dame](#f/notredame) Notre Dame - Shreveport, LA)

*Travel: 182 miles, 2 hrs 37 min*

It's the shortest travel we've had between games in nearly two weeks.

###Game 80: Thursday, December 27 9PM [Texas Bowl](#l/texasbowl) Texas Bowl ([SEC](#l/sec) SEC vs [Big 12](#l/big12) Big 12 - Houston, TX)

*Travel: 239 miles, 4 hrs 2 min*

Are you kidding me?  A double header on a Thursday with no time to spare between games?

###Game 81: Friday, December 28 9PM [Alamo Bowl](#l/alamo) Alamo Bowl ([Big 12](#l/big12) Big 12 vs [Pac-12](#l/pac12) Pac 12 - San Antonio, TX)

*Travel: 199 miles, 2 hrs 58 min*

Coming off a double header, I tried to find a way to make a double double header with the three games being played, but unfortunately we can't make either of the other games.

###Game 82: Saturday, December 29 1PM [Arizona Bowl](#l/arizonabowl) Arizona Bowl ([Mountain West](#l/mwc) Mountain West vs [Sun Belt](#l/sunbelt) Sun Belt - Tuscon, AZ)

*Travel: 870 miles, 12 hrs 8 min*

Just when you thought the long drives were over, we’re driving to Tuscon.  We've seen every other G5 conference play in a bowl game besides the Mountain West, so we’re skipping the playoff games.  We get our last oil change and tire rotation of our journey, and a 50,000 mile service.  We haven't driven 50,000 miles yet though, we're only at 49,564.

###Game 83: Monday, December 31 3PM [Foster Farms San Francisco Bowl](#l/sfbowl) San Francisco Bowl ([Big Ten](#l/bigten) Big Ten vs [Pac-12](#l/pac12) Pac 12 - Santa Clara, CA)

*Travel: 832 miles, 12 hrs 24 min*

Knowing that we neglected the Pac 12 a lot during the regular season, we’re hitting up all of the bowl games now.  We’ll see a total of 3 Pac 12 teams in 5 days.

###Game 84: Tuesday, January 1 5PM [Rose Bowl](#l/rose) Rose Bowl ([Big Ten](#l/bigten) Big Ten vs [Pac-12](#l/pac12) Pac 12 - Pasadena, CA)

*Travel: 346 miles, 5 hrs 7 min*

5 hours later we’re in Pasadena. We've now seen as many games as ~~Rutgers~~ Kansas plays in seven seasons, but we're not done yet.  There's one game left.

###Game 85: Monday, January 7 8PM [College Football Playoff](#l/cfp) CFP National Championship (Santa Clara, CA)

*Travel: 347 miles, 5 hrs 7 min*

Hooray! We’re made it. We turn around and head back to Santa Clara for the last game of our long season.  Despite what the Nevada Dental Association says about UCF, this National Championship goes in the record books.

##Statistics

We watched 85 games.  1 was a scrimmage, 66 were regular season games, 4 were Championships (including the Celebration Bowl), and 14 were bowl games.

Excluding bowl games, we have seen 74 different FBS teams.  The conference we saw the least was the SEC, where was saw three teams once.  We saw teams from the MAC the most - 18 times, but the ACC had the most number of unique teams - 12.

We saw a double header 16 times, and despite my best efforts I could not find a single triple header, though I am convinced one exists.  **If you find one, I am very interested in knowing when/where.**

##The Route

We drove 50,868 miles in 31 days, 22 hours, and 50 minutes according to the GPS, excluding any time we made up.  Over a month was spent purely driving.  At 35 mpg on the highway and $2.85 a gallon for gas, we spent over $4,000 just on gas.  We also changed the oil a number of times, got some other maintenance, and rented a car in the Bahamas. 

We traveled through all but 14 states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii.

Of the states that we visited, Oregon, Wisconsin, Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware we did not see a game in.  If the Sunday game at Benedict College is actually an error, South Carolina is added to this list.

You can access the map [here](https://gebweb.net/optimap/index.php?id=NhLTBLUk).  Some locations I used the campus rather than the football stadium for, and the mileage is ~100 miles different than the individual destination to destination totals that I used Google Maps for.  It also does not include our trip to the Bahamas. But it gives a general sense as to what our route was.

We saw a football game in every FBS stadium in New York, West Virginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Idaho, and Arizona (though we never saw the Wildcats, they host a bowl game).

OptiMap does not show the distribution by state, but we saw the most games in Texas.

The fastest trip was [Birmingham-Southern](#f/birminghamsouthern-sheet3-row25-col03) Birmingham Southern to [UAB](#f/uab) UAB Blazers - 1 mile

The longest trip was [Fresno State](#f/fresnostate) Fresno State to [Miami (OH)](#f/miamioh) Miami - 2,301 miles

8v1nrd,0,2018-06-30,Seeking advice for a future in Korea!,NotMisterKim,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/8v1nrd/seeking_advice_for_a_future_in_korea/,"Hi all,

This is my first Reddit post, and I hope you can help me to figure things out.

Let me first begin with my story. In August, I moved one semester to Korea to study as an exchange student. I had a great time, but then I had to come back because I had to do my internship in a television production house. Right now, I’m graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Visual Communication and a bachelor’s degree in Journalism. The production house offered me a job until the end of September. I said yes so I could save some money, but I think my near future isn’t in Belgium.

I’m figuring out if I could go back to Korea for at least one year. Asia is the future, and Korea is the most interesting place of all the countries to live in. (In my opinion)

I think I have 3 options, which one would be the most interesting one?

1. Apply for jobs in Korea while I’m still in Belgium and hope they would arrange my work visa. (I guess that is almost impossible, because I lack work experience?) I’m also looking for Belgian companies with a branch in Korea and I try to meet people here with connections.

2. Apply for a working holiday visa and look for a paid internship combined with Korean language classes.

3. Apply for a working holiday visa and follow Korean language classes. Doing part-time jobs in my free time while expanding my network to find a decent job.

I would like to have a job in a media production house or an advertising company, but what are the possibilities if I don’t speak Korean? Who had the same experience, or who has some tips?

I still have a valid alien card until the middle of September, but I don’t think I can change my D-2 visa in a D-10? That would be great!

Thank you in advance!"

This is a VERY LONG POST SO GRAB A SEAT AND BUCKLE UP. TLDR BELOW

Last night after helping nmom with some errands (being a hostage for 6 hours). We came home, I went straight to bed as I was tired while my mother began drinking and the more she drinks the more angry she becomes. 

Every time my mother drinks she's gets confrontational and very loud, she's usually pretty mean when sober but becomes an different beast entirely when she's intoxicated.

Now when she's drunk she gets louder and mean and goes for HOURS , HOURS. I don't say 1 word to her.
She'll  usually start her rants from the time I enter the door at 6:30PM from work to 4AM in the next morning. 

She'll yell through my door and sometimes open it to yell in my face and try to fight with me, i don’t fight as she’ll call the cops on me, and say they’ll kill me as I’m a black man.

I was just trying to sleep and kept screaming and screaming, I tried putting in earbuds but that didn’t work. Then she enters my room and place a spider it. Apparently she’s not too afraid of bugs despite having daily rants about bedbugs, fleas, ants, roaches and rats ( All of which we don’t have).

I’ll know she’ll just yell about the spider in the morning so I got a fumigation canister and fumigated my room. 

I went for the couch not saying a word to her and she sits in a chair across from and yells at me all now long as she drinks vodka straight up with weed. 

This is in part why I started recording when she starts ranting, it landed her a felony after cutting my sister with a knife. She’s safe now and I’m so proud of her, she’s currently NC with my mother so she’s safe. 

I'm only living here for the summer break before I go back to college.I failed to get a job before summer break so I had to move back in.

I'm currently working at a IT internship making $10 hour for 32 hours a week on Mon-Thursday. After taxes, medical and SERS I’m down to about $285 per week. 

Before I went to college she used to receive disability and child support off me. But now as I’m 22 and working and going for a ME degree I don’t get those things anymore. 

I'm currently looking for another job because I'm not making enough and I trying save money for a apartment before I return to college.

I also didn't get my deposit back from old landlord and it will be coming later in July.

So I basically had no money and it's the end of the month and she's FURIOUS. She wants ""Her"" money and wants it NOW. I offered her $120 a month and some repairs and house work because “You’re a Engineer!!” (which means fixing people’s broken shit to the illiterate) and She doesn't appreciate whatever you do for her, I’ve bought her a laptop , FireBox (Amazon) and many other. She broke the laptop in no less than 5 months of me buying it. I agree to fix it no less, including to pay for materials. 



**TLDR- Alcoholic Mother gets extremely verbally abusive. Yelled at me for the ENTIRE  NIGHT.  No where else to go for the summer. History of abuse. Details up above**

I just want my independence, I don’t want to bother nobody and nobody to bother me. Please help me. Thank you for reading this.

I am 6'2, 185 pounds, I am a runner who also does weightlifting. You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"

5 year older  than sibling my parents treat me kindly now but I am so butt hurt how they have treated me in high school and college and now they are helping my younger sister  with  private college and It makes me want to die.

* parents didnt let me have friends, didnt buy me anything extra, take credit for me paying for myself to go to engineering school and stalked me whenever I went out at night basically till i was a late sopmore in college and I ran away for 3 days because I couldnt stand it anymore. 
* Worked since I was 16 and hustled before than because parents screamed at me for 20 min+ if i asked for money to see a movie.
* Bought me $500 car with a hole in the pistons and a welded timing gap, the tires were bald -- It died avg 2-3 times on the way to school.
* Moved out when I had enough $ in october. Graduated this month still trying to  be the daughter/ sister i am supposed to be and love them.

Younger sibling

* Loves all her friends and boyfriends  and has their numbers and invites them to do things
* Helping her pay for fancy private college and to live on campus
* Gives her like 50 bucks a week plus more if she needed it to do things with her friends
* Bought her all room furnishings and car that was Used but safe and reliable and paid for her gas
* She got a job at starbucks after graduating high school.

**The long:**

I am 5 years older than my sister.  I just graduated college with a Mechanical engineering degree, I have worked my ass off to put myself through college, I was getting massively depressed at home and when I couldnt take the suicidal thoughts and hurting myself anymore I took the risk/ finally had the opportunity to move out in October. ( much better since have stopped all hurting myself )

My parents despised my boyfriends and all my friends throughout High school and  beginning College, They straight up stalked me when I was out using and would harass me calling me every 10-20 min friends or boyfriends. They would ground me for a week every minute I was late home. I started dating Shitty guys because they were the only ones who wouldnt run away from my stalking non stop calling family.  My family is v proud of themselves for running some of them off. I had non friends because I had no money, and wasnt allowed to go out. It took min. week of planning to attend an event or hang out at the mall with people. 

\-- This sucked because I was a really good kid, I was In honors, Played basket ball, didnt drink or do drugs and the people i tried to be friends with were the same.

I started working all summer as much as I could since I was 16, ( i was not allowed to work other times), I hit 18 and worked 2-4 jobs while going to college. My parents bragged to my extended family that they were putting me through college-- (by letting me live with them only I couldnt even afford my books at that point!!!) 

I met good friends got an engineering internship, made some money and am finally free and they treat me kindly now but I am so butt hurt how they have treated me sister in high school than me and now they are helping her pay for college and I want to die.

VERSUS my younger sister (5 years younger)

She never worked in High school and she got an allowance and I did not while still living with them.

Her bedroom was well furnished, New desk, Dresser, Bed. My grandparents really kindly found me a desk and dresser at an estate sale.

They are paying for her to go to a private college and live on campus -- this fucking kills me I would have done anything to move out freshman year of college and attend a FANCY PRIVATE COLLEGE.

They love all of her boyfriends and friends and dont care if she parties or who she hang outs with even if they do drugs or drink or have sex with ""all the boys"".

They have her boyfriends phone number and invite him to do things and ask him about his job and compliment him even though frankly I think he is not the brighest bulb in the bunch and my sister is way to smart for him. I have dated mine for 3 years hes kind to everyone, Wicked smart, ect.

Bought her a used subaru and  they pay for maintenance and gas.. -- their lot gave me a flat when I came over and I had to pay for the new tire.

and the one that kills me the most. I worked so hard for my engineering degree, I am not the smartest, the hardest worker and Im perpetually depressed, it almost made me kill myself but I fucking did it!!!!!! I AM A ENGINEER!

and they are way more proud of my sister graduating high school and starting college in some major but she's not sure yet."

Have your own F4F prompt that you'd like to pitch to me? Please do! Spot anything in my post history that we could amend to an F4F scenario? Let me know!***

-------------------------

Hi!

So, here's my first ever F4F prompt, and it's going to be a bit bumbling at first, but hopefully it makes sense by the end!

If you've read any of my past prompts, this one will very much take the same sort of shape - no specific, pre-written prompt, but instead a discussion of certain themes or elements I'd like to explore, to better facilitate a sort of.. brainstorming session, to come up with something better suited to both of us.

So! Without further ado, here's what I'm feeling today.

-----------------------------------------

***Lost, damaged, troubled girls.***

I just love some drama, inner-conflict, and some grittier themes. What I'm really looking for today is for one of us to play a girl that's lost in life, a bit damaged from previous experiences, or has troubled habits. 

* You know the type. Those lost girls that are in college or just out of it and have no idea what to do, who can't speak for themselves with any shred of confidence, who haven't quite grown up into confident, self-sufficient adults (but still legal adults!).

* Or those damaged girls, reeling from past experiences. Not growing up with a mother and having a bevy of mommy-issues, or terrible romantic or sexual experiences (I can't get any deeper than this without trigger warnings, which I don't want to issue in a prompt. Interested in this point, ask about it in PM). 

* And lastly, even those troubled girls - the ones that party way too much, that abuse drugs or alcohol, that shoplift or commit other petty crime, that can't hold onto any sort of stability in their lives.

***And the uniting theme here? They're going to be played opposite of a successful, confident, stable woman who is going to guide them along the right path, you could say. Of course, plenty of sexual care goes into that, too.***

------------------------------

***What're my preferences here?***

Ideally, ***I would prefer to play the older, successful, guiding, more dominant woman.*** I could play the other role, but this is indeed my preference. I'll write the rest of the prompt with that sort of assumption, that I'll be playing that character and that you, lovely potential partner, will be playing the lost, damaged, or troubled girl.

Other preferences? Age gaps! Secondary characters! World-building! Realistic pacing and development! Surprising twists and turns! Triumph and tragedy!

-------------------------------

***Possible scenarios?***

There are some that are immediately obvious, of course. 

* Perhaps this troubled girl has managed to land an entry-level job or internship at some sort of marketing or law firm. Things start off decent enough in the first week or so, but her issues deep down are starting to surface - work quality is suffering, other little behavioral hints. My character would be a far more established partner or member who takes a professional mentoring role towards the girl, and then eventually notices her odd behavior, and becomes the strict influence the girl needs in her life. 

* Similar kind of setup fundamentally, but with a different surface - a coach and her college athlete. Or a professor and her college student. I'm far more interested in the development of their taboo, secret relationship than I am in just random kinky sex (although, there can be plenty of that, but I want development with it, too).

* Incest? I'm into it, and it could work under certain circumstances. Perhaps a young girl who was given up for adoption as a baby searches for her biological mother as an adult - she finds her, reaches her, and attempts to reconnect. And, naturally, the girl has had a difficult life. 

* Another incest possibility would be between sisters with a bit of an age gap. Perhaps the younger one was still living with their parents and their parents died in a tragic accident, leaving the young adult (18-21) more or less on her own, and so her older sister takes her in for a while.

* Lastly, any of your ideas or suggestions! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling here and I'm really, really receptive to any and all of your own ideas, thoughts and suggestions! I want this to be a team effort.

***So, really, I'm looking for a cute, likely romantic tale between a younger, troubled/lost/damaged girl and an older woman with a spark missing in her life. There'll be struggles, difficulties, some life-coaching, rules, and plenty of D/s themed kinky sex.***

----------------------------------------

***Lastly, let's talk about kinks.***

* **Kinks:** I am a switch, with more dominant tendencies. I'm into things like roughness, hair pulling, light choking, spanking, light bondage, collars, gags, blindfolds, anal play (fingering, eating ass, toys, strap-ons, giving and receiving), orgasm control (forcing, edging, denying), toys, oral both ways, fingering, dry-humping/outercourse, age gaps, incest, sweat/musk (a big favorite), casual sex, informality, semi-public/risky, spontaneous sex, mutual masturbation, romance, affection, face sitting, dirty talk, sweet pet names, and so many more!

*Of course, none of those are required at all.*

* **Limits:** Scat, vomit, blood, extreme pain, bestiality, lactation, death.

8v3nbb,2,2018-06-30,Why can't I VPN/RDP to this PC?,OswaldoLN,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/8v3nbb/why_cant_i_vpnrdp_to_this_pc/,"Hello,

Okay, so I only have a few months here at this new site. This cubical has like 3 computers and two users. One day, I was trying to setup a new intern on this unoccupied desktop and I couldn't sign in with my credentials. I figured that this PC had a bad network configuration and so I called someone that new the credentials to the local admin account.

The computer was in fact on a separate VLAN(.30) than everyone else(.10). However, we didn't know why since it shouldn't have been. We have all the PCs going to Cisco switches to a Cisco ASA. After simply turning the NIC off and on, it got on the right VLAN.

I don't have the credentials to the switch. This PC I am currently having issues with is in that cubical and in the wrong VLAN and we cannot RDP to it when we use the VPN. I can VPN, RDP to a different PC and RDP to that PC.

It's kind of strange, I don't see why I can't RDP to this PC. I can assume that it's a firewall issue but what configuration is doing this? "

Jeg har satt Energi og miljø som førstevalg, men tenker nå at jeg heller har lyst til å studere KomTek eller DataTek (som jeg ikke søkte pga. for få poeng). Etter å ha sett på studienes oppbygning så ser det ut til at det bare er et par emner som er felles, men spiller det noen rolle?

edit: ønsker egentlig info generelt om bytte osv."
8v5h3m,8,2018-06-30,Some questions about FSU's online BS Computer Science in 2018,CheapAdvantage,fsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fsu/comments/8v5h3m/some_questions_about_fsus_online_bs_computer/,"Hi, all...I'm giving serious consideration to starting FSU's online BS in Computer Science this coming fall. I've searched reddit and elsewhere to find out anything I can about the program, but there are a couple of questions I couldn't find the answers to, and I was wondering if ya'll could help me out.

1. I see that the program is managed by FSU-PC, and that's where the program page links for the application. Is this an FSU degree or an FSU-PC degree?
2. For anyone who finished it or is finishing it, what's the internship and job outlook?
3. I saw in some posts here from a couple of years ago some complaints about the quality of the program, especially the lack of interaction with the instructors and TAs...could a current student or recent grad tell me if this is still the case? For earlier grads, was this in your opinion ever the case? One thing I'd like to get out of my experience is to cultivate a relationship with a couple of professors for possible letters of recommendation for grad school; I've heard this is absolutely doable in online degree situations, but I find the reports of little-to-no communication with teaching staff disconcerting.

I really appreciate any answers in advance, and any other advice about the program (pre-application and post-) would be greatly appreciated!"
8v60bn,1,2018-06-30,Federal Non-business Foreign Tax Credit and Reporting Income from W-2,tnintern,cantax,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/8v60bn/federal_nonbusiness_foreign_tax_credit_and/,"Hi, I'm a Canadian citizen/resident who was an intern on a TN visa at a US company in 2016.  I have a few questions about filing my Canadian tax return.  I'm using UFile and wanted to confirm some things below

1. Do I convert the USD amount on my W-2 (under ""Wages, tips, other comp."") into CAD with the annual exchange rate for 2016 and simply enter this number on line 104 of my Canadian tax return under ""Other employment income?""  

2. On form T2209, it seems that my foreign tax credit is limited by the percentage of my total income that was made in the US.  For example, if 90% of my total income was made in the US, and 10% in Canada, and I owe $X in federal Canadian taxes, it seems like the most foreign tax credit I can get is 90% of $X.  I've actually paid much more US taxes than 90% of $X though, but am I only able to claim 90% of $X as a Federal non-business foreign tax credit?  

3. It seems that the amount of federal tax I owe is calculated from my total income (90% US, 10% Canada) if I enter my US earnings on line 104 as I mentioned above.  Is this how it should be?

4. If I have tuition credits, can I use the Federal non-business foreign tax credits I calculated above?  Or do I have to use my tuition credits before I use the foreign tax credit?

Thanks"
