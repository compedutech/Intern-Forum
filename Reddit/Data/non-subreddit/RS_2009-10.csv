9qlkw,0,2009-10-03,The health care debate.,mei9ji,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9qlkw/the_health_care_debate/,"Wow. Everyone has an opinion. How nice. How many people here are in health care professions? How many have actually looked at the bills and seen what they fund and how they work? I can't say I've done either but I can also say I don't try and spout a totally uninformed opinion based on what little I randomly hear and conviction I'm unsure of where they come from. I have taken some time to look at what is going on but I am far from an expert. 

It would be lovely if we could live in a society where people contributed and didn't need the incentive of money or other reward to keep them doing things. Unfortunately in such a society there would most likely be precious few janitors, trashmen, and other menial laborers to care for the necessities of continued society. While some say that means we should return to a ""simpler"" time, I disagree. We have an imperfect system, and as such we should take this into account when we propose fixes to this system. We already have socialized health care. Hospitals cannot refuse patients, however within a hospital any service outside of Medicine can refuse a patient. This means that many patients get funneled through a stressed system to be taken care of by a host of overworked staff. And these patients cost us thousands upon thousands of dollars because instead of being treated by a primary care physician, for say strep throat. They are now in the hospital taking up an unnecessary bed because they did not have access or take advantage of prior care. Now that it has gone untreated the patient now how Endocarditis, probably dying but might possibly be saved with extremely expensive care rather than a 10 day prescription of Penicillin. On the other side of the coin. We expect doctors to treat patients that they see, for what rate? Do you believe that the government will pay similar rates if they take over the health care system? Now many will argue that doctors are overpaid and who cares if they get a pay cut? What happens when there is little draw into medicine because it takes 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 3+ years of residency ranging up to and probably even passing 10 years for some specialties. Now, until residency most students will be paying anywhere from about 10k a year at an instate school to about 25k+ at a private school. Times 4. Now these students will apply to medical school. Another thousand or more into the system. Next these students will spend according to the AMA ""Annual tuition and fees at state medical schools in 2008â€“2009 averaged $23,581 for state residents and $43,587 for non-residents. At private schools, tuition and fees averaged $41,225 for residents and $42,519 for non-resident students. These figures do not include housing or living expenses. "" Again times 4. Now these lucky doctors will walk out and go into an internship making tons of money to pay off anywhere from about 150k to over 300k of debt. The average salary of the first year(specializing in Medicine) again according to the AMA ""Average resident/fellow compensation  	$45,788"". Now to some of you this may seem like a lot of money. Factor in living expenses taxes etc. it is mediocre at best, and you still have the mountain of debt you are carrying around. Now you are rewarded with a six figure salary once you do all this, but and here is a big one. IF YOU SCREW UP, OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T PEOPLE WILL SUE YOU. If someone is unhappy with their treatment and thinks you did something wrong, whether you did or not they can sue you. It will probably happen in your career. This means that the insurance you pay on it will go up. Looking at a particularly nasty(in terms of malpractice) specialty, University of Michigan's website ""Malpractice insurance premiums vary widely from state to state. Florida is the highest-premium state, with an average 2004 premium of more than $195,000, followed by Nevada, Michigan, the District of Columbia, Ohio, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Connecticut, Illinois and New York.

The 10 lowest-premium states are Oklahoma, at about $17,000 on average, and Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Indiana, Idaho, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Arkansas and South Carolina.

Many areas of the country, especially around major metropolitan areas, are experiencing large increases in the average costs of premiums. Between 2003 and 2004, Dade County in Florida, which includes the city of Miami, went from $249,000 to $277,000, an increase of about 11 percent.

In that same period, Cook County in Illinois, which includes Chicago , jumped about 67 percent from $138,000 to more than $230,000. Wayne County in Michigan , which includes Detroit, went up 18 percent, from almost $164,000 to nearly $194,000.""

Now continue with these numbers but let the government step in and decide to pay these doctors half of what they were before. Or not even as drastic, 10% less. What will it take to actually fund general health care, what will the government be able to pay for and how much will they pay? Will you have to ask your congressman for an expensive procedure? Will people want to go into medicine with all the constraints? Do you want the people that really want to help the sick? Or do you want the best and the brightest brought out by the idea of making money? Will medical schools lower their standards if fewer people want to go into medicine? 

One thing many people are looking at is a dual system. Have government health insurance that covers what it can. And private health insurance for faster, or more expensive, etc. health coverage. There are ideas out there requiring doctors to spend some time in a free or government sponsored clinic, maybe a day or so a week. 

Many plans have merit, but we must understand the system and what the changes we are proposing are going to do to that system before we start perturbing it. Otherwise it will be like driving a car blind making turns we feel are right rather than looking at the road and what pitfalls surround us.

I can't say I know any good answers to any of these questions but before you just spout off its good or its bad start to think about what we are really talking about."
9te5i,54,2009-10-12,You guys love Rep. Grayson. So do I. Last week he asked to borrow my computer while I was browsing Reddit at work. Thought you'd enjoy this random story.,CommitteeIntern,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9te5i/you_guys_love_rep_grayson_so_do_i_last_week_he/,"I have especially enjoyed the recent Alan Grayson love-fest because I happen to be both a Reddit enthusiast and a full-time intern for a House committee on which Mr. Grayson sits. Last week, during a *long* full-committee markup, the Chairman adjourned for lunch/votes so I grabbed a sandwich and returned to my desk. My delicious BLT unwrapped, I had just begun clicking through a fresh day's Reddit headlines when I heard a voice from just behind me say: ""Excuse me, son. Would you mind if I hopped on your computer for just a minute?""

Now, I've only been on the Hill for a few months, but the politician-as-celebrity awe fades rather quickly as you see and interact with various Members on a daily basis. Still, I admit to being rather dumbstruck as I turned from my mindless lunchtime Redditing to see Alan Grayson standing there hoping to use my machine. As I closed my browser window, I'm sure he could have seen a headline or three praising his testicular fortitude. I hopped up and stammered something to the effect of: ""Um, absolutely, sir. Please, take it. Take your time."" You know, just in case he needed reassurance that I wouldn't return in two minutes saying ""Listen, dude. Time's up. You *happen* to be keeping me from an especially scintillating pun-thread. So scram, would ya?"" Yes, I left him at my intern desk and brought my delicious sandwich outside to ponder whether I'd share this nugget of randomness with Reddit. And now I have.


EDIT: I can try answering some questions if you're interested in the experiences of a committee intern on the Hill. Needless to say, my responsibilities are not terribly weighty, but I love being in the thick of things and am hoping to land a permanent position in the near future. 

Also: networking! PM me if you can help an enthusiastic progressive Redditor make any Hill/DC connections. Thanks friends."
9u4nm,8,2009-10-14,"Reddit: I'm in my second year of my Computer Science MS program and am doing awful.  I really need some advice, please help.",ZeppelinJ0,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9u4nm/reddit_im_in_my_second_year_of_my_computer/,"Just a bit of background: I graduated in 2004 with a BA in Psychology, and took a few year to work, one job was what got me in to computers.  In 2008 I got accepted to RIT for a MS in Computer Science.

I did alright the first few quarters, got A's in my ""Bridge"" courses and got by Discrete Math with an OK grade.  However I'm really struggling now.  I've gotten a D in my algorithms class, and just barely pulling C's in the core theory classes.  My GPA is dipping below 2.0.  I'm terrible at math and math theory which really sets me behind in the theory courses.

And the frustrating thing is through all this theory is that I've never designed an created a formal application, other than simple command line programs that output a correct solution for an algorithm or something like that, which means that my actual coding skills are very very week.

Because of this I'm unable to get co-ops and internships due to my lack of coding skills and dismal GPA and lack of overall experience

It's not from lack of effort, I'm in the lab 12 - 18 hours every single day busting my ass trying to complete my assignments on time.  I also spend a lot of time in the Tutoring Lab, but sometimes struggle getting it to sink in.

What I need to know here is if I'm completely fucked.  I'm sinking a ton of money in to this masters program and I don't want to just drop out of school, I really want a Masters degree. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this?  Would I have to start all over if I switched to an Information Technology degree?

[EDIT] just to make it clear, yeah I kind of realize I picked the wrong major.  What I really need is advice on recovering and continuing on with a masters degree"

Code/documentation could be kept on the site and publicly viewable.

Employers could recruit from the site if they wanted to.  Kinda like an internship for people who can't find a good one.

Maybe a way to break into the industry if you're not a student too."

9vz3l,2,2009-10-20,IT Companies in the Boston Area,rb2k,jobpostings,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobpostings/comments/9vz3l/it_companies_in_the_boston_area/,"**Long story**:  
I'm from Germany (Stuttgart) and in my last year of my master's degree in a study that's called ""Computer Science and Media"" (software engineering, with a little bit of web+cellphone development, mobile networks, ...).  I will have to start writing my thesis in March/April 2010.
Usually, students in a ""University of Applied Sciences"" in Germany write their thesis at a company, researching a given problem and implementing a solution. The Thesis is, most of the time, a documentation of this process with some background information.

Seeing as my University doesn't have any problems with students going abroad during that time, I'd like to do my thesis in the US (Boston for personal reasons).
Seeing as the concept is pretty uncommon in the US, I'd be probably best of looking for matching internship to earn some money and hopefully combine my thesis with the topics of the internship.

It seems kinda hard to find a structured list of IT companies in the Boston area (or matching internships). I worked in large IT companies ever since my freshmen year and I'd also be interested in working for a smaller company.  
My two biggest interests at the moment are: Software scalability and the Ruby programming language, but I'm always open to new topics.  
Some random buzzwords of stuff I've worked with so it's easier to recommend companies:  
ruby, java, security, scalability, linux, infrastructure (dns, ip, apache, nginx, vmware, switches, wlan, active directory, ...), webscraping, ... (for more stuff, see my homepage).  
My current job involves virtualizing the build process for a smalltalk tool that generates embedded c code.

Any recommendations?
Thanks!

9yd8m,2,2009-10-27,What You Can Do To Influence Congress About HC Reform and Beyond- Tips From the Inside.,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9yd8m/what_you_can_do_to_influence_congress_about_hc/,"There's been a lot of posts recently asking people to ""Contact X about Health Care.""  I thought I'd give some tips.  Since I worked in a Congressional office for a while, I know how stuff gets handled.
    
1)  **Only write/call your own representatives.**  Elected officials only care about their constituents, and no one else's.  Under the Constitutions, you're represented by 1 person in the House, and 2 in the Senate.  Everyone is represented equally in this regard (except for people in DC).  Therefore, ALL Members of Congress ignore you if you're not from their district.
    
2) **Be Brief.**  You're call/letter will be taken by either a low level staffer or by an intern.  Members of Congress don't have the time or interest to read or listen to you.  They employ others to do it for them.  You're comments will be summarized as ""X person is for against Y issue.""  Do briefly explain why you take your stance, Any further elaboration is a waste of your time and the time of a low-level worker in the office, who has no impact on policy/voting decisions.
    
3) **Tell them your name and where you live**  This lets the office know if you're from their district or not.  Many offices send you an official response.  Don't worry about junk mail.  Every office is limited by law as to how much crap they can send you by mail.
    
4) **Calling and writing DOES make a difference**  Everyone in Congress wants to get reelected.  It is their job to represent their district too.  Although MoCs don't read their mail, they DO pay close attention to tallies of people for and against a certain piece of legislation.  So, you gotta clearly state your stance on the issue.
    
5) **Call or Write about stuff that is actually being debated/voted on**  MoCs don't care about your opinion if there's nothing being done on the issue.  If you call today about ""marijuana legalization,"" no one will give a crap because there's no legislation on it.
    
6) **If you want to personally contact someone you have two ways**  Campaign and Congressional events are your best bet as an individual.  No one will personally meet 1-on-1 with you are with some sort of organization.  Therefore, you should go to events on your own.  If you like the person- VOLUNTEER for them on some level.  You'll eventually get to know that person.
    
7)  **If you have a question, Google/research it first**  Offices are not good at answering questions, especially if they're detailed.  They'll mail you an official response of a MoC's stance on an issue.  If you want to know more- figure it out on your own.  You'll save some time and get a better answer.
    
8) **If you want to talk about multiple issues, call/write about them separately**  This makes sure that all your stances are recorded individually.
    
9)  **Still state your support on issues to people you DO like.**  99% of everything that a MoC gets is against something.  This summer, Congressmen (on both sides) were told 99% percent of the time that either a. ""I'm against HC reform"" or b. ""I'm against you for your stance on HC reform.""  *Guess what happened- HC reform stalled.*  Very few people in support of something or someone actually contact their MoCs, so MoCs only hear the opposition to things.  As a result- Congress gets little encouragement or positive reinforcement to do anything that have support, and instead are pressured to not do unpopular things.  
    
10) **If this isn't good enough for you, get someone else elected.**  Don't like your MoC, then work to get someone else elected who shares your views.  Voting is important, but volunteering and donating to other candidates can do much more.  You get one vote for yourself.  For every person you get to vote for your candidate, you take away 2 votes for the one you don't like.  1% drop in support for one and a 1% increase in support for another is a net gain of 2%.
    
11) **If you don't say or do anything, then nothing's gonna happen**  What you do has to be effective.  Barney Frank in the Reddit interview explained this well for Q#10 regarding Gay Rights marches.  Basically, MoCs want to get reelected.  Their district's support for something ultimately decides their vote, and this trumps special interest groups and campaign donors.  **The wants of donors/lobbyists/party/friends don't mean shit if there's obvious massive opposition in their district.  Simple as that.**"
