Thanks

Some background: I'm currently a second year computer engineering student. Me and my family will be in HK for at least half of the summer(If I get an internship i'll likely be there the entire summer) so I would ideally like to work in HK rather than like 2 months in Vancouver and 2 months in HK which is rather difficult to find.

The rest of my family is in the medicine/healthcare field, and mostly live in Vancouver so I really have no idea what to look for or where to look for an internship in Hong Kong. Once again, Thanks so much"

2qzz0n,7,2015-01-01,I could use some advice from bros who work in software development.,WildlifeAnalysis,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2qzz0n/i_could_use_some_advice_from_bros_who_work_in/,"Hi, so I got an internship at a big computer company recently. I haven't started yet but I'm looking forward to it. But I am a little worried that I might not be what the company wants. I'm a little worried that I'm not what any computer company wants.

It's mostly because I had a bad experience at my last job. I worked for three months at a small startup company and it was terrible. All my coworkers were Apple fanboy brogrammers who dedicated their lives to the company, and I couldn't relate to them at all. I ended up getting fired because I wasn't working hard enough, even though that was their fault for not giving me enough shit to work on. But that's another issue.

Anyway, my problem is that I almost have a CS degree and I'm getting into programming as a profession, but I don't actually care about computers at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm good with computers and I think programming is fun, but that's as far as my interest goes.

I don't care about industry news. I don't care about Apple conferences. And I definitely don't care at all about experimenting with Linux distributions. That stuff just doesn't interest me.

Is there room in the industry for people like me? I just want to do my job and that's it. But I'm worried that people will look down on me for not being ""passionate"" about computers, since that's what happened at my last job. Of course, my last job was a shitty hipster startup, which I'm sure is much different than real companies like the one I'm going to start working for.

What do you guys think? For those of you in software development, have you ever worked with someone who didn't care about the computer industry? Is that considered okay?

Apparently I'm going to be the only intern in my group, and I'll be the only one who doesn't have a master's degree. That makes me worried that it will be like my last job and I won't be able to relate to anyone."
2r0xos,3,2015-01-01,I want to talk about my flight home...,[deleted],MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/2r0xos/i_want_to_talk_about_my_flight_home/,"Beautiful...

I think they were really meaningful to me. I tried using emotes on this but... they just can't describe the emotions I felt. **THEY SIMPLY CANT!**

Let me just give you the spill about this all. I flew on American Airlines back home from Guatemala with a stop in Miami. It was the only available option. I wish we flew through Dallas but that couldn't happen because it aint cheap.

I ended the crazy year filled with sadness and happiness on a sweet note... 

[](/sp)[](/sp)[](/sp)I got a chance to relive the moment that made me want to go to space.[](/sp)[](/sp)[](/sp)

I slept through a chunk of the first flight, but I got to see the landing. As we flew through the clouds at over 400mph as we landed. I always wanted to play this one song as we cut through those clouds and I got the chance to. I just felt amazing like I could fly. I just had that thought cross my mind that I should hop on a fighter jet and fly on. That was awesome! What was more amazing was seeing fireworks as we landed in Guatemala! :D

But my last flight of 2014... I actually cried thinking about it.

I got aboard the Boeing 737-800. This one had a [new livery](http://i.imgur.com/V74jTSn.jpg) and [Boeing Sky Interior](http://i.imgur.com/icgDjpJ.jpg), which is amazing. I managed to fit my [carry-on bag](http://i.imgur.com/9lklJMM.jpg) easily on this flight! We took off and saw the [Miami area](http://i.imgur.com/sgaqYpW.jpg), and the [left turn](http://i.imgur.com/Ut89eCF.jpg) taking us home to Jersey. We flew at an altitude of 38,000 ft. I saw a lot of places. A lot of the east coast (best coast) was visible. I saw most of the cities where I wanted to go to college: [DC](http://i.imgur.com/kGtSK2r.jpg); [Baltimore](http://i.imgur.com/1d1GwS8.jpg); [Newark, DE](http://i.imgur.com/YxbZ1lf.jpg); and here in NJ. I saw the stars up high. It was different because of some light from inside, but still amazing. I saw two of the 3 NASA centers I visited: Kennedy and Goddard. Everything I dreamed of was in that 3 hour flight. I had a song play by a English pop artist called Foxes called ""Glorious"" and she described it perfectly in an interview where it just talked about how much one of us would work on with something.

I thought about all of you. I thought about everything. The worst of 2014 and the best of 2014. I thought the times where I just wanted to give up on everything and destroy my dreams. I thought the times where I felt amazing and invincible. I though about the times where I tried so hard to make things work when they failed. 

What made things better was that we landed from the north. I saw the [manhattan skyline](http://i.imgur.com/5Cv1GOs.jpg). That was just the cherry on a sundae. Everything just clicked... There was something in me that said ""LOOK AT THAT! GET IT! YOU CAN DO THIS!"" I just wanted to get out of the plane and somehow fly to the moon or something ;D

My mind was like no other. I know that it was quite a rarity to relive that moment. I think I should take more night flights now. I know that it might seem like an average flight to someone, but to me, Flying is as close as I can get to space. That moment was like a look back at my life. The people that built me to who I am now, the moments of accomplishment and failure. I guess it made me realize that no matter where I go, I might end up where I love.

Before I leave earth, and that is if I end up doing it, I want to see a rocket launch from 40,000 ft. I don't know why, but I want to live that moment. Heck, I might get that chance if I get an internship at NASA! If I get this one job, I might get to help build something that will go to space. That will just make me crazy!

But yeah. 2014 had to be one crappy year, but NASA, my flights, and you all here on PLounge have made it a lot better.

Thanks for making last year meaningful.

&lt;3

Jon.

2r188x,2,2015-01-01,F4M --- Roleplay based off TV/Movies. Ideas inside.,Television-RP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2r188x/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, thick ass opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot! I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love but aren't necessary; anal, ass worship, rimming(giving/recieving), rough sex and dirty talk. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"

Thanks for all the help!**

Hey Cleveland! I am a college student studying mechanical engineering at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. I am an Asian-American male, 20 years old, meticulously clean, very responsible, friendly, super easy to get along with, and quiet. I am a non-smoker, non-drinker, and am 100% clean of all substances. Born in the USA and thus am a citizen and am fluent in American culture and English (just to assure anyone of no possibly communication/culture problems). More than happy to provide information for background checks and personal references if desired. Long story short, I'm an awesome roommate because I'm super easy to comfortably coexist with and will always pull at least my weight.

I will be holding an engineering co-op (similar to an internship) with Lincoln Electric in Mentor, Ohio this upcoming year from January 12th to early May. The co-op lasts for approximately 16 weeks which is the amount of time I will be requiring housing. 

My budget is around $400 a month, the less expensive the better though! I will have consistent  income and would like to assure rentors that it will never be a problem for me to meet rent and utilities. My parameters for a place is that I will have sufficient room to have a small cot and desk for a PC. I'd also need the housing to have a kitchen I'm permitted to use as I rarely eat anything but my own cooking. I also will need a parking spot as I will have a vehicle for transportation to and from my job. I'm about 90% sure I'm mildly allergic to dogs and cats, so I'd prefer against a home with dogs or cats, but if need be I can find a way to coexist! 

Please feel free to PM me if you think you've got a place for me! Thanks a bunch!

2r1yfk,3,2015-01-01,I [21 M] am being increasingly dissatisfied in my 1+ year relationship with my [21 F] girlfriend who seems very happy with the relationship and I don't know how to get out,relationshipsrfun,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2r1yfk/i_21_m_am_being_increasingly_dissatisfied_in_my_1/,"**Early stages:**

May 2013 -- We met

June 2013 -- I went away for a summer internship

August 2013 -- She came to visit me

September 2013 -- We officially got together (my first real relationship)

December 2013 -- Our first Christmas. I remember it pretty positively.

March 2014 -- Our first “real” trip anywhere together. I also remember this pretty positively.

**Our break up:**

April 2014 -- I had a very demanding course load this quarter. I began to tire of her inquiries, “do you know when you’ll be done”. I see this is as a turning point where I started to become annoyed with her, because she was constantly asking me to hang out at inopportune times.

June 2014 -- I went away for a summer internship. This summer was arguably the most enjoyable period of my life. 

July 2014 -- Her complaining about when we could see each other only increased. I finally capitulated and bought her a plane ticket to come see me.

August 2014 -- She came to see me and we had an action packed, fun weekend!

September 2014 -- But, the complaining wouldn’t end. In fact, it only got worse until it reached a boiling point. She asked me to drive 8 - 9 hours to come see her; I didn’t want to drive that far (especially in my old ass car). She asked me to fly; I refused since I already purchased one round trip ticket (that struck me as unfair). I insisted that she come see me again; she couldn’t because she didn’t have the funds (which is understandable for a college student). That being the case, I was perfectly content with us not seeing each other. She, of course, wasn’t. Finally, she asked me to come home the Saturday after my internship ended while I wanted to spend that Saturday with some of the friends I made. I chose my friends. Some choice words were exchanged between us and she broke up with me. If I had to do it over again, I would choose my friends. 100 times over. I guess that’s telling.

**Our reunion (or The beginning of my dissatisfaction):**

September 2014 -- She kept trying to call me while I was at a bar the Friday night my internship ended. I didn’t answer. Later I found that she was experiencing serious anxiety and just wanted to talk to me and some other stuff I don’t remember. Anyways, we subsequently made plans to see each other once I got back so that we could talk it out. And we did. I don’t remember the contents of the discussion, but we both made promises to be more like how we wanted each other to be that we soon enough broke.

October 2014 -- She wanted me to go to some concert with her. From the beginning I didn’t want to go and kind of resented it, because I felt like I never really had a choice in the matter. That is, either go with her or incur the wrath of her nagging. I don’t know if that’s selfish or not.  In any case, I never go to mainstream concerts so I didn’t anticipate that there would be a line out the door to get a spot. There was, and we showed up late because I insisted on finishing my dinner before we went. She got pretty pissed and just started acting really cold towards me. I acted like an asshole in return. I remember feeling so frustrated that I was being given the cold shoulder at a concert that I didn’t even want to fucking be at! We finally got inside and, unsurprisingly, we found a spot nearer to the back than the front. I suggested that she make her way to the front. Since she’s short she wouldn’t be in any ones way. She refused. I tried to encourage her to enjoy the vibe of the concert (more than just seeing the artist). She again refused. Finally, she wanted to leave before the artist that she wanted to see would play. Her reasoning is that she didn’t want to have a bad memory of seeing one of her favorite artists. I still think the whole thing is dumb.

October 2014 -- So, one of my big issues in this relationship is that I feel like we spend too much time doing couple-y things. For a word of explanation, I had a nice tight knit group of friends at the beginning of college then some shit happened and my number of friends decreased dramatically. Then, I met my girlfriend. So I guess at the time she filled the void and that was okay. But then, over summer, I found a new group of friends and it reminded me just how much fun that could be. More fun, in fact, than I was having with my girlfriend. 

So, in that spirit, I decided to round up all my friends back at school (two people) and spend a night out. Now, I thought, wouldn’t it be neat if my girlfriend could come along and hang out? Maybe if she has fun then we won’t have to only spend time as a couple. Now, I’m a dumbass and I don’t know what I was expecting. My girlfriend has never liked any of my friends. But, I thought, maybe this will be different. It wasn’t. A night that started out at the bar quickly switched to a liquor store and 40s. My girlfriend chose not to drink. So, eventually she got annoyed for some reason or another and she called her friend to pick her up. I think it was something like, I wasn’t walking with her and she felt left behind. It’s irrelevant now. 

I’m not proud of what followed. I just kinda went on a tirade, in front of her friends, about how she was trying to limit me and keep me from having fun. In my drunkenness, I made an absolute mess of the real point I was trying to make, of the real frustration that I was feeling. Anyways, she agreed to go back to my place to talk it out. I don’t totally remember what happened, but somehow we sorted it out. It may have been that night, or the one I mentioned previously, but I do remember her walking out of my house and going to her car. She just left upset and I didn’t bother to follow her. Somehow, though, we still resolved things. I think she came back or something. I thought that, too, was very telling.

October/November/December 2014 -- All quiet on the western front. We had a pretty fun halloween night together. November/December we stayed in a lot and made stews and tea and stuff. The usual complaints about not seeing her enough (or wanting to) were there, but in reduced numbers. We’ve had a couple good dates despite being extremely busy. She’s already talking about plans for the next new years eve. So, outwardly everything is good. 

But, I know something is wrong. I feel like hanging out with her is a chore. Something that I have to do. I feel trapped. Part of me feels like I can’t break up with her, because she’ll just find some way for us to get back together. Another part of me worries how she would react to a breakup (it would be really messy). Deep inside I really wish that she would break up with me. I’m worried that after we graduate (which is soon) she’ll follow me when I move for work. I’m worried that she won’t let the relationship go, so I need to do something. I just don’t know what it is.





---   
**tl;dr**: I'm becoming increasingly unhappy in a relationship that my girlfriend is actively fighting to protect. I want to break up, but I don't want to break her heart. What can I do?"
2r1z51,3,2015-01-01,"Buying my first car, starting the search",Lancealot590,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2r1z51/buying_my_first_car_starting_the_search/,"Hey /r/cars, I think you can provide me some very helpful advice.

I am a 21 year old college student who is graduating next May (2016) and have some money saved up (about $6,000) and have a paid internship and will be getting another paid internship this summer. My current vehicle is a 2000 Buick LeSabre with 184,500 miles on it. I commute frequently from college to home (300 mile round trip), putting good miles on her. She is on her last leg and my drive from Illinois (where I live) to New Orleans (my summer internship) is too much of a feat for my car. I have decided it is time to upgrade and get a more reliable vehicle before I leave in May. I need help on starting where to look as far as brand/model of car as I am very out-of-the-loop with my options.  

&amp;nbsp;

**What I am looking for:** This vehicle is going to be my main source of transportation for the next 3-6 years at least, enough to carry me into my first real job and get my worth out of it. I am looking for a sedan or SUV for the space (helps with moving) and to handle the Illinois winter road conditions well. I would like it between 60,000 – 85,000 miles, four cylinder engine (economic reasons), automatic transmission (stick could be done, but not preferred), 4WD would be nice for the icy roads. I am not concerned with the year of the vehicle and not too caught up with style (the Buick LeSabre is my testament to style).  


Reliability is huge as I will not have much spare cash or time to make frequent stops at a mechanic. I am fine with running it into the ground, so holding its value isn’t a major factor.  

&amp;nbsp;

Finances are a large part of this as I am planning on starting to build my credit with the loan. I am planning at $6,000 for the car, a $4,500 loan with a 3.5% rate for 3 years leaves me with $221.78/month. I may extend it to a 5 year loan and make larger payments without the pressure of the higher monthly payments.  

&amp;nbsp;

So what models seem to fit my parameters well? I appreciate all the recommendations!

2r26n1,804,2015-01-01,Blown away today by Apple,ElectrifiedPop,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2r26n1/blown_away_today_by_apple/,"For the past month my computer has been in and out of repairs. Its been a pain because Im trying to finish incomplete's from last spring semester, and also been doing a lot of internship work as well. 

I first sent it in, and it came back, and it crashed. So I went to the Apple Store in the Galleria in Saint Louis, MO. 5 days later, I got it back again, and sadly crashed once more. Last week I dropped it off the day after Christmas, and today I got it back once more. This was the 3rd time and they basically replaced everything. I got home and started to restore my back up, when once again it crashed. 

I was so annoyed, upset but mostly frustrated at the fact this kept happening. I called the store and spoke with the Apple Tech head guy and he told me to bring everything in, and we would go from there. 

I got to the store with an hour left before they closed, and when he came out with a new computer I was shocked. The new computer is the more advanced of the Macbook family, and it will come in handy with my photography company. The whole time the Store Manager, Apple Genius guys, and floor people checked up on me as my brand new computer restored. They even let my Dad and I stay after they closed to finish everything. They answered all of my questions, and my parents and they were so sweet and understanding. 

I just wanted to say there is a reason why Apple has such loyal fanbase, its because they treat the customer with such respect and understanding. Apple is truly a wonderful company, and the people who work for them is amazing as well. "
2r2ayo,2,2015-01-01,I [17F] don't want to spend time with my mom [56F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2r2ayo/i_17f_dont_want_to_spend_time_with_my_mom_56f/,"My parents are divorced, and I was raised by my mom. My mom is a good person in a lot of ways, she's very smart and driven. She’s the VP of marketing for a massive company, so she works a lot. She usually gets home around 8ish because of her commute. She's not a bad person, she’s just never really been the mom that baked cookies and fixed boo-boos. It's just not her thing.

She’s always pushed me academically and I’m a very good student. I have one of the highest GPAs in our grade, and I do a ton of extracurriculars as well. Weekdays I have 6am practice, 8am-1pm school, and then an internship from 1pm-7pm on Monday and Wednesday. And that’s not to mention college applications, SAT prep, and the fact that 4/5 of my classes are APs. There's always a few different extracurricular events on weekends, and weekends are generally kind of a mess scheduling-wise.

Like I said, she gets home at 8pm but I have to go to bed at 9:30 if I want 8 hours of sleep. And that's one of my big things, I think it's really important and helpful to get enough sleep at night so I try really hard to get at least 6 hours a night.

Like I said, she pushes me pretty hard academically, so it's not my fault I don't have much free time. I like being busy, but it does mean my schedule is really tight.

We’ve gone through phases where we’ve tried to carve out more time together but I feel like something always gets in the way. I would try to get her to spend more time with me when I was younger and sometimes it would work for a short time, but sometimes she gets kind of sensitive and will go off about how her job is the reason I have a phone and nice clothes. And I get that, but I don't think it's ungrateful to want to spend more time with her. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year, and I’m good friends with his parents and his sisters. I pretty much always go over to their house on the afternoons I don't have my internship. There's one afternoon, Thursday, where I literally have nothing going on after 2:40pm. Normally I work on homework at their house but Thursday I pretend like homework doesn't exist. I basically just relax for the whole afternoon. Thursdays are literally my favorite part of the whole week. I call them lazy Thursdays but he gets fake-offended and calls them productive Thursdays haha.

My mom is going through a phase where she really wants to spend more time with me. I think it’s because she realizes I’m going off to college soon. She doesn't work weekends, but she'll ""work remotely"" all the time. But sometimes she'll just like appear at my door and want to spend time with me. If I say I have too much to do she normally lets it go but lately she will point out that I could have done it Thursday if I hadn't gone to my BF's house and that I need to learn to ""use my time wisely.""

Obviously I'm apologetic/regretful when I turn her down, the truth is that given the choice between: a) spend Thursday afternoon watching TV with my boyfriend and decorating cookies with his mom and Sunday afternoon working on homework and b) spend Thursday afternoon working on homework and Sunday afternoon getting my nails done while my mom sits in the next chair and spends the entire time responding to email on her phone, I’m kind of going to choose Option A.

I keep expecting her to ban me from going to his house during the week. Just the thought stresses me out, but I keep telling myself that I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

This going to sound harsh, but to be honest I’m pretty busy and I don’t have time to make my mom feel less guilty by doing feel-good mommy-daughter stuff. And maybe I resent her a little for thinking she can just show up and I will suddenly shift my whole weekend around so that I can spend time with her.

TL;DR: I don’t get very much free time due to school pressures and extracurriculars. I would rather spend my small amount of free time at my boyfriend’s than with my mom."

She knew she had to leave now. Ashley didn't pack much, she packed all the hats she could find around camp, ""Borrowing"" hats from people she didn't know very well, she didn't care at this point. Ashley headed back to her cabin to grab Oscar and say good bye to Li. Ashley couldn't say goodbye to Li. She was sleeping so peaceful, so she just kissed her forehead and mumbled a ""I love you Li"" before she grabbed Oscar and heading to the Hermes cabin, Martin made her promise to say goodbye, she also had to say goodbye to Cy, he was paying for her operation and she couldn't thank him enough. After saying good bye, Ashley headed to the van waiting for her, she got in and Augur started the engine and drove to the best hospital in New York. It was an awfully quiet ride as the started their journey. When they arrived Ashley got out and waved goodbye as she walked into the hospital, she told them who she was and what she needed. They got her a room, a private room. Ashley laid down in her bed, in the ugly hospital gown, looking out the window. Then the Neurosurgeon came in, Doctor Sheppard. The best in the country and very good looking too. He explain the operation, step by step and even the after math of it. He said there will be very little scarring. When he left he sent an intern in and she shaved Ashley's head for her, when she left, Ashley cried because the thing she treasured was gone.. Her beautiful hair was gone and she thought she was ugly. So she quickly grabbed a hat and put it on. Ashley laid back down and waited until the operation. Doctor Sheppard explained that it will be close to five hours to complete.  Ashley fell asleep waiting until an intern came in to prep Ashley for her operation. They took her for a cat scan to see where the rumour was located along with blood tests and the basic routines. They did prep her and Ashley was scared, she'd never been so scared. Ashley laid down on the table, they moved her head so it was in a weird position, then they put her to sleep and the operation began.* 

*Ashley was dreaming, she was dreaming of her life with Elliot, they were happily married and had two kids. Ashley was very happy along with Elliot, Gary and Adamina where there too and you can't forget Li, Cy and Martin. Oh and Silus, can't forget him. They were all happy, laughing and smiling then the pictures became blurry and da, everyone was dying.* 

*Meanwhile, Ashley's operation was going great, or it seemed so at first, the located the tumour and removed it successfully, they were almost done when Ashley went into cardio vascular shock. Ashley was dying, her heart rate was dropping fast, the doctors/Surgeons worked quickly, charging the shock things to revive people, the shocked Ashley three times, they had given up, until her heart started to beat again, it remanded steady, they had closed up Ashley's head, with nice stitches that would go away, due to Ashley requesting that they don't use staples.* 

*Ashleys dreams became happy once again as the people she loved and cherished surrounded her, meanwhile the doctors wheeled Ashley back into her room, Ashley laid there peacefully, a white bandage was wrapped around her head along with her beginning hooked up to IV. Ashley slowly woke up, everything was blurry at first, she'd hope that Elliot would be there along with Cy and Li. But she knew they wouldn't be there. So Ashley laid down on her back, looking up at the ceiling as Doctor Sheppard came in and told her what had happened during the surgery and what they had found and they said Ashley would make a full recovery but would have to come back for check ups.* 

OOC: sorry for any typos, I'm typing on mobile and yeah. You can RP your character coming to visit Ashley if you want or either saying good bye. "

I value creativity, passion, and intelligence. I consider myself to be fairly well-rounded. I love playing volleyball, drawing, making and playing music, exploring Los Angeles, and enriching my life. I keep an open mind and an open heart. I consider myself a part of the creative bunch, and love everything about music. I'm part of the brainy bunch as well. I love science and history besides just drawing and composing/playing music. I've been playing piano for 10 years, trumpet for 3, and composing for 2. I also enjoy first person shooters and would love to game with that someone. I'm currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in music composition. I hope to eventually earn a Master's. I don't know if I want a PhD though. Eventually I want to score for films and video games like Hans Zimmer and John Williams. It's my dream to earn an Oscar for Best Original Score. I had an internship with a Lifetime Channel t.v. movie composer which was an awesome experience. To me, music has been more than just a hobby, its become a passion of mine. I've gone through many instruments in my lifetime, but I've stuck with piano and trumpet. I not too recently took up composing as well and haven't stopped. I've been called the human encyclopedia of useless information by my friends as well. Every so often I'll quip in a random bit of information that is somewhat related to the topic at hand but not needed. You might get some TIL from me. I have a pretty good memory, so I remember a bunch of them. Ooh, puns and movie quotes/references. I can do those too! If you meet me, you'll probably notice my glasses and hopefully my smile. Some of my favorite stuff:

I'm looking for someone who is within 5 years of my age, of slender-average build. Hair color doesn't really matter, let's just not go crazy with something like neon blue. (I already see enough of that with my tatted, pierced twin sister) Blonde, Brunette, Black hair, all that 's fine! I would prefer someone who is caucasian or asian, not to say someone of a different race could come along, just putting that out there. If: You love music and the arts.
You love binge watching netflix or playing video games.
You're funny, kind, passionate, and smart.
You love food and exploring new places.
You want a fun, quirky, caring, guy.
You are like looking for a genuine relationship.

Then please, message me. This is one of my first posts on the dating community of reddit. I have an OkCupid, a POF all to no avail. So let's see if anything can come from this.

She has no SW background and requested an intern to help her with grant writing to get her organization off the ground. I talked with her for like a half hour on the phone and she seems really nice, we had a nice chat, and I think I understand what's expected of me. I'm just worried that I've agreed to a placement that may not be the best, that it may be lacking in some areas. I see the value of gaining experience with grant writing, but I also see the disadvantage of being on my own working away from any professional social workers. I'm feeling a little bummed about it all tonight. 

What do you see as the real pros and cons of this placement I've agreed to? I have a knack for seeing the worst, I'm hoping someone out there can help me refocus on the positives of this situation. "
2r35ia,78,2015-01-02,Summary of December 14 Transcript,MeowChimp,serialpodcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2r35ia/summary_of_december_14_transcript/,"Here is a summary of
[December 14 - Transcript of 1st Trial](http://www.splitthemoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dec14redact.pdf). Extra page number references were placed for Jay for convenience.

**Hope Schab** (pg 6) was Hae’s French teacher for four years. Hae was Hope’s intern on first period every day from 7:45am to 9:15am. Hae confided in her and told Hope about her job, her friends, and what she’d do over the weekend. She called herself the liaison. She talked to teachers and students at the request of Detective O’Shae to get some answers because many of them were not getting back to him in a timely manner.  She had to ask the track coach about Adnan one day, and Adnan found out about it. He went to her classroom and said, “Are you asking questions about me, because, you know, my parents don’t know everything that goes on in my life, and I would appreciate it if you could, you know, not ask questions about me.” She said in response, “Well, everyone is being questioned at this point.”

**Margarita Korell** (pg 21) worked the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Her duties were to determine the cause of death in homicides, suicides, accidents, and unattended deaths. She performed the autopsy on Hae. Her opinion is that the cause of death is strangulation because the autopsy showed petechiac hemorrhages (areas of bleeding in the eyeballs), bleeding into the strap muscles, and there was a fractured hyoid bone. She concluded that the manner of death is homicide. Homicide in the medical field in forensic pathology is used as the death of one human being at the hands of another human being. Her opinion regarding the time of Ms. Lee’s death is, “An opinion. I can only say she was dead for quite a while.” 

No cuts, lacerations, or open wounds were observed on the victim. She observed that the strangulation was more likely to be manual, and the bruises in the right occipital and right temporalis muscle (in the temple area) can only occur when the heart is still pumping. Ms. Korell said she could only estimate—not pinpoint – the time of death, and she estimated the time of death to be several weeks. Any day that is within a couple of weeks from February 9th (when her body was discovered) would be consistent with the estimated time of death. While it takes as little as 15 seconds to cause death by strangulation, death is not a process that only takes 10 or 15 seconds. Collected swabs of her mouth, vagina, and anus revealed no indication of semen. Depending on the medium, semen can stay for several days.

**Melissa Stangroom** (pg 69) was a Forensic Chemist who performed DNA testing. The DNA profiles obtained from the blood samples from the shirt matched the DNA profiles from the known blood standards of the victim. Hae cannot be excluded as a possible donor of the DNA extracted from the blood samples from the shirt. The probability of selecting an unrelated individual at random from the Caucasian and African-American populations having DNA profiles matching the blood samples from the shirt is as follows:
* The Caucasian frequency is one in 1.7 billion.
* The African-American frequency is one in 4.1 billion.
As procedure, not the entire sample was used for testing; a sample is saved for retest.

**Yasar Ali** (pg 97) was a friend of Adnan’s. He knew who Jay was by face, and that Jay was Adnan’s friend. Yasar knew that Adnan and Hae’s relationship was over because it was too much for Hae and Adnan, just like sneaking around because his parents didn’t agree with it. Yasar didn’t attend high school with Adnan. The friendship was through the community of the Mosque and also that Yaser’s and Adnan’s parents were friends. He was asked about his thoughts on his religion.

**”Cathy”** attended University of Maryland in Baltimore and is friends with Jenn. She lived with her then boyfriend at the time (January 1999). On January 13, 1999, she got home around 5:30-6. (When she spoke with Detective GacGillivary, it was recorded that she said she got home between 4:30-5) Jay and Adnan went to their house to hang out for a while. They were watching TV, and Cathy was making small conversation. She remembered Jay telling her “all these different things that just didn’t make any sense, like they were going to the video store, or they were coming from the video store, something. They were being picked up by somebody.” Adnan was “just like, slumped over”, and all of a sudden said, “How do you get rid of a high?” Cathy said, “I think you just have to wait”, and then Adnan said he had something important to do, “I have to go somewhere”. She thinks they stayed between 6, 6:30 because Judge Judy was on. 

Adnan got a phone call from his cell phone and said, “What am I going to do? They’re going to come back to me. “ Then Jenn called the house and Cathy asked Jenn if she knew what was going on (because Cathy found Jay and Adnan were both acting weird). Jenn said, “Oh, well, I’m supposed to meet up with Jay later so, you know, I’ll find out and I’ll tell you later.” They returned to watching TV, and Adnan just got up and ran out. Jay got up about a minute later and followed Adnan outside. They didn’t come back.

She saw Jay and Jenn later at around 9:30-10 and asked what was going on. Jenn said something like “Well, you know, we’re not going to talk about it,” or “We can’t talk about it”.

**Jay Wilds** (pg 182) told the jury about his plea agreement. “The agreement was just that basically a sentence cap that I can only be sentenced to the maximum sentencing for my part as long as I told the truth and nothing but the truth.” He confirms that he entered a plea to being an accessory after the fact to murder in this case. 

January 12 was his birthday and he was partying. Adnan called Jay in the evening to ask what he’d be doing the next day and what he had done that evening. Adnan asked if he would like to join him the next day, and said he would give him a lift to the mall. 

Regarding the 10:45 call (length 28 seconds) made on January 13, Adnan said “that he would be at my house in an hour to pick me up.” On their way to the mall in the car, they discussed relationships, and that Adnan “was having problems in his own relationships, that he was upset, him and his girlfriend were splitting up. He referred to her as ‘that bitch’, said he was going to kill her, but I didn’t take it in the text of the conversation for what it is.” After they left the mall, Adnan said, “If I let you hold my car, can you pick me up later?”

Jay said, “Fine.” (pg 190)

From there Adnan drove back to school, and Jay left in Adnan’s car to go to Jenn’s brother’s house. Jay said he might have called Jenn’s brother to see if he was home. Jay and Jenn’s brother played video games for about half an hour and then left to go to the mall. Then they got back and he received a phone call from Adnan, who was just wondering if he had been away or if the cell had been turned off. Then he and Jenn’s brother played video games for another hour. Then he got another call from Adnan. Adnan said he was leaving school and wanted him to pick him up in half an hour. 

After half an hour, Adnan didn’t call, so Jay left to check someone’s house who wasn’t at home, and as he left for home, Adnan called and told Jay to pick him up, that he was at Best Buy on the left-hand side of the building next to the pay phone. (pg 193) So Jay went to Best Buy to pick him up. Then Adnan opened the trunk and Hae was already in there. Adnan told Jay to follow him and got back in her car. Jay drove Adnan’s car. They drove to the Park and Ride. After the Park and Ride Jay said they went to Patrick’s house to buy marijuana, but Patrick wasn’t home. (pg 195) They left to West Forest Park, bought marijuana, rode to the gas station to (he thinks) get blunt, and rode around and smoked. Adnan began telling Jay about the incident and what happened. (pg 198) Then Jay drove Adnan to the front of the school for track practice.

After Jay picked Adnan up from track practice, they went to a house of Jay’s and Jenn’s mutual friend. At that house Adnan received a phone call from the police officer. (pg 200) Towards the end of that conversation, Adnan left the building and Jay followed him. Then they drove back to Jay’s house, where Adnan asked Jay to help him get rid of the body. Adnan grabbed two shovels from Jay’s front porch and said, “I know what you do. I know how you do it.” Jay said Adnan was referring to his past – “the sale of marijuana. I was living in my grandmother’s house. I really didn’t want to get her in any kind of trouble.”

They went to where Jay believed to be Leakin Park in the woods a little more than 50 yards. Jay helped Adnan dig. Jay placed a page to Jenn because he” was supposed to meet somebody at some place at seven o’clock, so I paged him and told him I was probably going to be late.” They received a phone call from Jenn in the middle of digging, but Adnan answered and said Jay was busy and hung up. (pg 204) Adnan left by himself for a long time and drove her car to the spot. They both buried Hae.

Adnan called a woman in some time that day and asked if Jay wanted to speak to her. Jay didn’t know who Adnan was talking to, but Jay might have said hello to her. (pg 209)

Regarding the pages to Jenn, he might have paged Jenn to pick him up from the mall. He left Adnan’s car and got in Jenn’s car there. From there, Jay and Jenn disposed of the shovels. (pg 211) 
He did not ever get into Hae’s car that night. (pg 218)

He stopped by Stephanie’s house around 8 to drop her presents off. He probably went to Stephanie’s immediately after he met up with Jenn. (pg 219)

2r38gk,2,2015-01-02,"Me [19 F] and this guy[23 M] who is leaving the country, have been seeing eachother for over a month, we get along so well, but he keeps backing off.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2r38gk/me_19_f_and_this_guy23_m_who_is_leaving_the/,"*So, I just realized I'm the worst at summarizing, this is fucking long.*

I met this guy, we instantly clicked, even though we both have different mother tongues, we flirted stupidly easily and could talk about everything. I had a crush on him but thought he had a girlfriend -*which wasn't true, my fb stalking misguided me, oh well*- so I kind of backed off a tiny bit until, one night, we went out together with some other common friends and it became obvious, he managed to be next to me most of the time.

Inhebriated, we made out, I stayed at his place but nothing happened (was a virgin and didn't really want to do anything if I wasn't sure I liked the guy).

That's when he started texting me everyday. Things went great, he planned an amazing first date for the following weekend, stayed at his place again, got a bit more intimate but still no intercourse, I told him I was a virgin and I wanted him to know in case I sucked at it and he said it didn't matter, ""he was happy just spending time with me, didn't want me doing things I wasn't ready for or didn't want to do"". Yeah.

Still kept talking, not too good at flirting through text but face-to-face time made up for it, and he was quite open when talking to me, recently I noticed he's told me things only a couple more people know. But that's when it got weird. 

He was interviewing for a huge internship opportunity abroad and he was planning on moving to that country in February. We talked about that and we initially agreed that we'd make the best out of the time he was here, though he was not completely convinced, I believe. He'd said he hadn't thought about the possibility of meeting a SO here, and was slightly confused and not so convinced about leaving, which, now that he got the internship, he brought it up again(it's been 2 weeks and he hasn't even told his flatmates yet). He stopped texting me then, we met that weekend and it was unbelievably awkward. 

At that point I was fucking clueless, I gave him a couple days and texted him asking what was wrong, we already talked about him leaving so what was his point when backing off. It's true, he was incredibly busy but c'mon, you make time if you want to. He then repeated he was leaving and didn't want to create expectations he couldn't fulfill. Ended up saying, well, let's go with the flow. 

We met that Friday with a bunch of friends for Christmas dinner, and he was constantly referring to me when chatting with the others. We had a little private chat about him being weird the past week and he said he was actually ""protecting himself"" from getting too into me and then getting hurt. We had sex that night for the(*my*) first time, twice, surprisingly it wasn't awkward at all, he was careful and we ended up having fun, said some more cheesy things, and then he left for his country two days later. 

There's about a 7 hour difference from where he is, so when I get up, he's going to bed and when I'm having dinner, he's having lunch. It's been two weeks now and he's coming back in another week, we've only texted twice and I've started the conversation both times, he kept it going, but I miss hearing from him everyday(I'd be happy with  one simple text every two days).

Now I'm debating whether to tell him straight away if he's having so much fun there that he's forgotten about me, or let him do his thing. I really believe he is into me, half of the people that know us both tell me he talks about me all the time, he's said it, and he's demonstrated it, but he thinks too rationally and has his mind set on him leaving so he probably hasn't even considered a long-distance relationship. 

EDIT: I forgot to say, even though I thought he had a girlfriend, he actually didn't. 

**TL;DR**: Guy who is leaving in a month from now, went all out first couple weeks, retreated, saying he didn't want to create expectations he couldn't fulfill, then said he was protecting himself, everything was cool again, now he's back in his country for the holidays and hasn't reached out once.

2r3dto,3,2015-01-02,Me [21F] with my bf [21M] of 3 years. I may move out with him after being worn down by my parents [50mf]. I don't know what the right decision is because moving out basically means cutting ties and I'd like to avoid that.,photobusinesshelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2r3dto/me_21f_with_my_bf_21m_of_3_years_i_may_move_out/,"So this entire year I've been trying to connect with my family. I'd like to value family, but it's out of my value system now. I don't care about blood relation anymore if im honest. I feel guilty about this and want to fix my attitude and my family but i'm conflicted. 

We went to the slavic country we are all from and it was hell for me. I put a lot on hold in order to go as far as school and internships go. It was a huge mistake. I did get to say goodbye to my grandfather who raised me while I had the chance but he wasn't very talkative. He didn't really care that I was there either. All my other family did was make me feel incredibly shitty about myself and as a person during my entire two month stay. That trip caused nothing but trouble. 


I also helped my other set of grandparents move from the US to Europe. I plan on never speaking to them ever again. I don't even want to get into this topic but want to mention that I tried to mend this relationship with no hope. 


I often feel that my family is irrational. I've been trying to mend things but honestly we both value very different things. My parents don't value memories or people. To be honest I don't even know what they value. 


I suppose my dad values discipline in an odd way. He is a PE teacher, and recently he told me he was 340lb but i think it's more than that. He is average height. All of his rules depend on his mood. 


To respect my parents I generally try to follow their rules. I also clean the house etc.  


They are getting worse as I get older. My father is trying to put me on a 10pm bedtime with door open and he confiscated my phone. This is not new behavior for him. I'm so over it. I'm a college student and I haven't been making much money. In fact, right now I only have $200 to my name. I should mention that I've never done drugs or anything crazy to warrant these rules. In fact, tonight my father decided that my curfew was 10pm without telling me, when we had established that if it's not a work weekday midnight is fine. I came home 6 minutes after midnight. Which is usually not a big deal. Tonight he decided it was, again I never received a warning and try to follow their rules. 

I do have the option of moving out to my boyfriend's parents house temporarily until my boyfriend and I can move out together. I was scheduled to graduate Winter 2015 but it doesn't look like that is going to happen if I move out. I will give my tuition money back to my parents and cut ties with them. 

I plan on getting student loans in order to finish college. 

I am scared right now because I don't have a credit card or credit score, or money and moving out would mean severed ties with my parents. 


I don't mean to be ungrateful for their efforts of paying for my college education or letting me live at home but I can't handle their rules and mixed emotions. I've spent so many nights struggling last semester to even sleep because they constantly change their rules and like to get me emotional to take our their frustrations or assert their authority. Even if i'm doing well, (getting all work and chores etc. done) at the first signs of stress due to school they pounce like I'm doing something wrong and they know how to push my buttons so I end up just getting more stressed and I know it's my problem that I can't handle my own emotions but I don't think this will be solved until I move out of this environment and get some therapy or time to reflect. Honestly I feel like I've been a pretty tough cookie. Especially given how calm I stayed in Europe and that I survived my toughest semester in a major I hate. 


 I can't communicate with my parents. They see any question or word out of my mouth as a personal attack on their authority. It's either I follow or I GTFO. 

I guess, I know what I need to do for my own well being (move out with my bf- who my parents hate) But I really don't want to cut ties with my parents. Because I do like to think that I value family and that I am not ungrateful for what they've done but I know i'll be dead to them if I take a semester off of college.  They already see me as a loser and treat me like im 6. Still and I don't know why I want contact with them, but I don't want to sever ties and I do want to keep my mental health. 


Is there anyone that has advice for this situation. All my friends tell me to not give a shit, my brother thinks im being an ungrateful bitch but he has always been a coward and has never had it as bad as I have in this house. (no curfew- spent the night with friends- he's the golden child.) He also had a computers based major where I have a business major (marketing) and plan on making a living doing photography and marketing.  (my only means of making money atm is photo and video assisting) My schooling is a bit longer than 4 years because I switched my major from photojournalism my sophomore year. 

I should mention that my boyfriend's family adores me. It was their idea but they do so much for me and I don't want to burden them. Also all the arguments that my boyfriend and I have stem from my parents but other than those our relationship is fantastic and I planned on moving in with him after graduation anyway. 


I just didn't want to stay in school as long as I have and though staying with my parents would be the fastest route to total independence and no debt starting out.  My boyfriend is not going to college, and is only at home because he is waiting on me and saving some money. He plans on opening his own retail business, he has a plan. I believe in him. He just wants more experience in what he is doing and in working first. He is very good with money and I just mostly feel bad that I have had so little coming in because i've been busy with school and the family Europe trip that was a failure. He is an amazing person and I plan on one day calling him my husband. 

Obviously my bf and my parents don't get along. My parents pull a lot out of thin air as to reasons they don't like him but their closest to legitimate reason is that he isn't interested in pursing a degree atm. (He plans on taking some classes and maybe getting his degree in the future, and he says what he means. But it isn't a priority for him.I've come to terms with this seeing that he does still do what he puts his mind to and has a plan.) My boyfriend is so fed up with how my parents treat me, and talk about/ ignore him he doesn't even step a foot into my house when they aren't home. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Parents will cut ties with me if I move out but I need to for my own mental health. I'm scared to move, but tonight may have been the final straw that wore me down. Small things escalate to a huge storm. There is no sense in talking to my parents about changing the way they treat me but I'd like to not cut all ties. I'm feeling exhausted. Is there anything I can do to help the situation? I can't put up with not knowing what I'm coming to when I get home anymore. "
2r3goy,1154,2015-01-02,I fucking earned it.,UnicornOnTheCobb,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2r3goy/i_fucking_earned_it/,"I was a precocious kid, growing up. My father is an Electrical Engineering PhD from an Ivy-League university, and he recognized from an early age that I was bored by the public educational system. He worked hard to share with me his love for science and engineering. Together we built rockets and radios, a catapult and a treehouse, and conducted science experiments too numerous to count. I loved it more than anything.

My mother, though, is another story. She isn't dumb. Not by a long shot. What she is, as I learned far too late in life, is mentally ill and abusive. Borderline personality disorder is a type of antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy) that causes the affected to lack a basic human capacity for empathy. BPD individuals are gregarious and outgoing, so long as they are getting what they want. When they aren't, the facade drops in an instant and you become their most hated enemy. They are manipulative and cruel. And worst of all, it is genetically transferable.

I have a sister, and she inherited the same illness. I won't go into too much detail, but after my parents divorce when I was 10, my life became worse and worse. My father is codependent to a fault, and would almost always acquiesce to her insane demands and placate her. Even after their divorce he continued to do this even though she was clearly out for blood. In the absence of her ex, she turned her abuse towards me, attempting to isolate me from my friends, and forcing me labour around the house. Nothing I did was ever enough for her and she took every opportunity to berate and belittle me.

It all came to a head when she and my sister corroborated to accuse my father of molesting her as a child. They wanted even more money than the already generous alimony and child support they were receiving. She claimed that she had brought back memories of being sodemized by him when she was about 8. He passed a polygraph test saying that he did not. They brought a court case against him, and even though he was never brought up on criminal charges, it was enough to destroy his reputation in the community and it tore my family apart.

I was caught in the middle of all this, and the court cases took almost two years to be resolved. In that time my world was torn apart. I became extremely depressed and almost suicidal. I couldn't focus in school and began to fail out even after being prescribed antidepressants and ADHD meds. The hardest thing I've ever had to do was convincing my father to sever ties with his ex wife and daughter in order to save what was left of his family.

I graduated high school (just barely) in 2010. That spring, I began to see a family practice doctor that managed to completely turn my life around. She was raped and abused for her entire childhood and early adult life. She had, after years of intense therapy, been able to recover and put herself through med school while in her 30's with an infant daughter from a failed marriage. She recognized that I too was suffering from PTSD (albeit to a lesser degree), and has worked with me over the last few years to get through it.

I took two years off between high school and college in order to recover from that ordeal. I had once dreamed of attending an Ivy League school like my father, but my depression had destroyed my GPA and hurt my SAT scores immensely. After a year of intensive therapy, I forced myself to reapply myself to academics and managed to improve my SAT score by 200 points. It was good, but paired with my mediocre grades still prohibited me from attending a school of my dreams. Nonetheless, I was accepted into one of the top-50 engineering schools, and two years after graduating high school I enrolled.

I figured, if I could no longer be the smartest person in the room, I could at least be the hardest working. I aced all of my courses (computer science), and worked hard to develop my skills outside of class, too. My first year I got an internship at a small animation company in LA. This year I worked at a large tech company in Seattle. And recently I was offered a job at Google. I've realized that now I not only have regained much of my intellect, but have a work ethic to boot.

I'm writing this from a little cafe in Copenhagen where I'm vacationing before moving to the Bay Area for my internship. And for the first time in many years, I am truly happy. One of the hardest things for me to stomach is people accusing me of getting where I am because I'm ""so smart"". No, motherfucker, I earned this shit. I went through hell to get here and I am never looking back.

2r3ig0,1,2015-01-02,Asking for feedback: MSc in AI - Personal Statement,[deleted],artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/2r3ig0/asking_for_feedback_msc_in_ai_personal_statement/,"I'm currently applying at a well-known University in the UK for 2015 entry for postgraduate studies. After completing my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, I want to do my Msc in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on robotics and machine learning. I'm going to graduate with the equivalent of a first class honours degree from a German University.

As part of the application, the University requires applicants to describe both their motivation as well as relevant knowledge/training skills for the desired course of study. In order to make the best possible impression, I would like to ask you for feedback.

Thank you very much in advance.

---------------------------------------------
""- Personal Statement 
This should include why you feel you are qualified to enter the programme and how you think it may affect your career prospects. If you are applying for a Masters programme and your chosen programme has more than one area of specialism or theme you should indicate here which area(s) you wish to specialise in(max 3500 chars - approx. 500 words).""
---------------------------------------------

It is the beauty of learning, what makes life endlessly fascinating to me. The observation of our minds great capability of perceiving and understanding the great complexity of our surroundings never ceases to do so. The functioning of the brain, has always been a subject of great interest to humanity. Citing Stuart Russell and Peter Norvigs Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, we call ourselves Homo sapiens - man the wise - because our intelligence is so important to us. The idea of not only understanding it, but also building a genuinely intelligent agent, teaching it how to learn itself, is even more fascinating and opens limitless potentialities. Potentialities that certainly create ambivalent feelings. Nevertheless, I am convinced that its application will help tackling a range of issues, improving the life of millions. I expect the most immediate impact from robotics. An opinion, which I have formed during during an internship at the Fraunhofer IPA in Germany, where scientists work on a service robot, designed to help the elderly in a domestic environment. This is an application I find outstandingly beneficial, given the fact that we have to deal with an ageing in many industrial countries. A former student, who suffers from blindness, once described how he takes hope from the advancement in self-driving cars during the last few years. He stressed how they would afford him a much more autonomous life. This once again, having experienced a case of eyesight impairment in my own family from my early childhood on, reaffirmed my opinion of the great advantages of progress the field. Being given the chance to study at the University of [city name], I would therefore like to choose intelligent robotics as a specialism and focus on machine learning.

Having talked about how AI offers great opportunities, I am convinced that the same applies to career prospects. Having attended the postgraduate open day, I learned how the University's graduates are sought after by companies. I am especially keen on both deepening and advancing the frontiers of knowledge by pursuing a PhD following my Master's degree. That is because I want to use my talents and knowledge to the benefit of society, which I think research will allow me. This makes the University and [city name] itself, as a city with a great history of AI exceptionally attractive to me. One of the reasons for that is the fact, that the University is home to three AAAI fellows and the largest informatics research centre in Europe, which reinforces its status as one of the best Universities in the world. All together, I think that postgraduate study at the University of [city name] will give me a great foundation for further work in the field, whether it will be in [city name] or elsewhere.

I believe that both my current studies as well as my practical experience show that I not only have a strong aptitude in computing and quickly learn new concepts, but am genuinely devoted to what I am doing. This is the reason why I started a Blog about computer science, artificial Intelligence and programming recently (http://....../).

Combining cognitive sciences, mathematics, psychology, linguistics and others, artificial intelligence is a truly interdisciplinary field that will allow me intellectual development beyond the immediate discipline. However, it is the endeavour of making machines learn, which makes this subject so incredibly interesting to me.

---------------------------------------------
""- Relevant Knowledge/Training Skills 
This may include details of required laboratory, computer programming, specialised software packages skills or voluntary work that you have undertaken pertinent to the programme.  If you have not yet finished your first degree, please tell us about the programme of study you are taking (max 3500 chars - approx. 500 words).
---------------------------------------------

My undergraduate programme, Computer Engineering (BEng), can be described as an engineering degree with a tendency towards Computer Science. This means that compulsory courses include introductions into electrical engineering, microelectronics and signal processing, as well as software engineering, algorithms and data structures and embedded systems design. I came to realise that my personal strength lays more in abstract design of software and logical programme flow rather than in IC design. Consequently, all my electives and project works consist of content that would traditionally be taught in an Computer Science degree. However, the acquired knowledge in engineering and applied mathematics, will certainly help me in my desired specialism of intelligent robotics. During my Bachelor's degree I was awarded the '... Scholarship' from ... University from 2012-2014.

Examples of work relevant for my desired postgraduate studies are:

- Evolving neural networks, a project on which I am currently working in collaboration with a graduate student on neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to teach simulated creatures how to survive in an adversarial environment.
- Introduction to robot programming, in which I used my own image processing algorithms as well as the OpenCV library to teach a Nao robot to distinguish balls of different colour.
- Formal modelling methods, a lecture teaching parts of theoretical Computer Science, such as automata theory and formal languages. I applied the knowledge by building a compiler alongside my studies.  

In addition, I am proud to look back at over four years of programming and software design experience with a wide range of applications. I have gained this experience during my studies and several voluntary internships. My work experience includes a two month training at the Fraunhofer IPA in Germany, where I developed software Plug-ins, built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS). Furthermore, I worked at Tokai University in Japan from Sep 2013 - Feb 2014 together with remote sensing researchers on the evaluation of satellite and camera data using an automated image processing system on a Unix platform. As part of a student team, I was awarded a prize by Yahoo Japan for the developed of a university course 
management software during my time there. 

I also had the opportunity to get an impression of the University of [city name] and the city during an internship in November and December, 2014, where I worked as a Software developer at Holoxica Ltd, a startup company that focuses on holographic 3D technology.

I am currently familiar with the following programming languages and software tools: C, C++, JavaScript, Python, sh/bash, Matlab, git, gdb, gprof as well as the typesetting system Latex.

Furthermore, I have started teaching myself Prolog, due to its importance in AI. 

As a preparation for my upcoming bachelor's thesis, I have started the 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence' course on Udacity and shall participate in further such online courses before the 
actual start of my postgraduate studies. 

In addition, I am currently seeking an interesting topic for aforementioned thesis, during which I wish to gain further experience in mobile robotics.

2r40nk,3,2015-01-02,"Me [20M] with my GF [19F] of 4 years, thinking (again) of breaking it off, seeking advice.",onetime-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2r40nk/me_20m_with_my_gf_19f_of_4_years_thinking_again/,"First time post and this a throwaway account. 

A little background:

We have been dating since Freshman Year of High School at the ages of 15-16. We have been through a lot together and have had amazing lives together so far. Now I am 20. In college and working 2 jobs including an internship. I am now thinking about whether or not this relationship will be right for me in the long run because of certain interests, beliefs, and activites that I have that do not line up with hers (or her families) at all. 

These things include: 

* I am an atheist.
    
 - She is a christian (Will this be a big issue for future children on how they should be raised?)

* I am a very introverted person who hangs out with the same people all the time.
    
 - She wants to go out often

* I *legally* smoke marijuana at night to help with certain health problems I have. I also won't lie to anyone and say that I don't enjoy it because I do. It helps me and I enjoy the other effects it has.
    
 - She HATES the fact that I even consider doing it. In fact, She has threatened to break up with me if i continue to use it.


From the above issues the last one concerning marijuana is the most recent and probably the most important one. I have routinely been using marijuana for both medical and personal reasons behind her back. I am completely aware of the fact that I should not hide this from her but I love her too much to chance letting her go. 

At the same time I feel it is unfair that I have to choose between something that is as harmless as marijuana which gets used responsibly and not even in her presence, and used medicinally for myself. I WANT TO TELL HER but am afraid of the response I might get. She is completely aware that I use it for things other than ""Hanging out"" with my college buddies but she doesn't seem to care about that at all. 

/r/Relationships I seek any advice on how I should approach this issue I am having because my close friends are all single and have been for a while. Their advice is not so helpful or insightful.

I am [M, 24] a recent graduate in business, been unemployed for 2.5 months after an internship and it seems to not be looking well because I can’t find an entry-level job. During that time, I had 2 interviews for big firms but I didn’t perform well. It started to make me feel a bit sad about the social pressure from friends/family to find a job. Whenever I see them, they are asking me if I did get a job by now. 


Last week, a friend of mine casually told me about an offer in another country at her enterprise, a big media company, and it would be cool if I applied. It would imply that I would move abroad, start a new life. I like the idea since travelling is a big passion for me. I have been very happy lately and looking forward for this opportunity. I got the interview with 2 directors on skype, it was perfect, good connection with them, they liked me. Best interview ever. The offer is an internship, not really well paid, but it has nice responsibilities and I will learn a lot in the industry. Also, they want to keep their interns and place them in their network. The goal is to stay and work in that country. It is a huge opportunity for me to work abroad, gain knowledge and travel. The choice was simple... I thought so, except on the day of New Year Eve. I kissed a girl and I liked it. [Katty Perry, lol]


Context: I had a relationship of 3 years that had a bad break up but now everyone has moved on. Four years from that, I am still single and I couldn’t find something serious during that time. I didn’t connect well with the girls I met. However, I have experienced so much on myself; I questioned the life I wanted to live, my passions, my friends, my values and my lifestyle. Identity/Life crisis and reality check. It has crystallised my mindset. Learn every day, explore.


Back to the girl I have kissed at NYE, I had already met her 2 years ago and I really liked my connection with her. It seems we have a lot of interests in common: sports, travels, lifestyle, and type of humor. I also feel we are at the same maturity level and stage of life. At that time, she had a boyfriend and I only saw her few times at friends gathering. We lived our lives and it was fine like that, however she splitted up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her during a student exchange. It was like 5 months ago from today. During that time, I know my friends have talked to her about me. We met back at the NYE party, we connected again and kissed. The day after, we talked and she wants to meet me again, dating. Everything seems to be so smooth with her, I like that. 


During the next 2-3 weeks, I will have to make a choice if I decide to go work abroad and take the chance to start my career over there. It seems to be a huge opportunity for me and it could open doors. I could probably meet girls over there and connect as well. Or I could stay in my country, search for a job and obviously find one in the next months. I would also date this girl and see how it goes, it could work or not. But I am interested in her. 


I would like to have some advice on people that lived the same situation. What choice have you made? What is the best? Would you change it? What is the most important thing in life? 


TL;DR recent graduate, unemployed, got offer to work abroad, started dating a girl I like, good connection. Work Abroad or Love?

I'm very confident that I will graduate on time with a degree in computer science, which had an average starting salary of $50,000 (from what I've researched so far). I plan on having an internship every summer (I already have one lined up for summer of 2015). Should I be very worried? I've contemplated joining the Air Force after college for 4 years to pay off my student loans, but I would prefer to not do that. What do you all think? Thanks for reading!"

Now I know all the Big 4 do their main hiring in October and November, so does that mean that I have less of a chance of getting the internship since I'm interviewing in January?"

We make love for the first time and I think things are fine. 

FEBRUARY '14: A Mutual friend has a party, goes out with friends (most of whom I do not know). She goes, dances with another guy because her friend ""pushed her into it"" but she says she didn't dance 'ON' him, just with him, like in front of him facing him and stuff. 

MARCH '14: I find through a mutual friend maybe a month later that she danced with this guy and I confront her. She denies it, flat out. Months of on and off fighting, nothing crazy. 

LATE APRIL '14: she hits up her friend from the past who she had a huge crush on. He didn't like her back, but she contacts him saying she wants him to come down to the city to hang out with her. 

About a week later, she's showing me something irrelevant on her phone and I scrolled through to read it.  She kind of jokingly says ""let me see your phone if you're gonna go through mine."" So I handed it to her, she already knows my password and such. I ask if I can look at hers as well, just because I'm always curious but I never ask. She lets me and I open up Facebook messenger. Boom, it was the last conversation they had and I show her and ask her. She immediately plays it off as nothing, but this was someone she had told me about multiple times that she had a crush on him and such. I'm upset, she feels I'm being unfair and it was just catching up with a friend.


Fast Forward to New Years 2015. 

She is headed to Africa for an Internship in two weeks and I'm slightly concerned about her being away for 3 months. I admit to things I may have done that may have been shady, such as flirting with a friend but never acting on it, to get her to be honest. I do this to leave everything in 2014 and create some trust between us. 

She tells me two things: 1) the guy who she messaged, she did purely for attention. She had not planned on telling me; 2) she danced with that guy at the party in February. I didn't know how to react. I was clearly upset, but I felt she was being honest. However, she was being honest that she a) danced with someone who was basically a stranger; b) did not tell me; c) lied to me when asked about it. 

So I talk to her about that and she's been extremely defensive about it, almost getting upset that I should have accepted her apology and just gotten over it. Her claim is that whenever something like this turns up, I keep explaining myself even after she's apologized. To be fair, I do but that is only to vent to her about how it made me feel and because I don't feel her apologies are genuine. 

I feel like I'm struck by the thought of breaking up with her for this because it would seem like an overreaction, to break up over something that happened months ago. We've been pretty good since then, but knowing that it happened and she hadn't told me just threw me off. We talked a bunch, I feel a little better but the idea is still in my head that she isn't always honest with me and I don't want to deal with anything of this nature again. If it did happen again, I'd immediately break up -- but what if I don't find out until much later? Then again, what if it doesn't happen again?

I have gotten on very well with Donna in particular because she is estranged from her daughter and I am in Low Contact with my own mother because she's a manipulative asshole.  As such, Donna and I have always had a pretty strong relationship and used to go shopping together, would go out for coffee, etc.

**Relevant Backstory**




Last year, my husband entered his final year of his MA and interned at the hospital where his parents also work.  This is a very good hospital in Smalltownsville where we lived, and getting an internship there was considered a really good sign to be potentially hired on after the end of the internship.  William and Donna both pushed John to rub elbows with people there, attend all the social functions, learn everyone's names, etc., as they were hoping he would be hired there.  Getting hired at this particular hospital in Smalltownsville was considered the best possible outcome, and at the time it was what both John and I wanted.




Over time, though, as John began applying for jobs there, it became clear that it wasn't going to work out.  There simply weren't jobs there that he was qualified to do, so he started searching in Big City.  He found a job in Big City and moved there in June; I stayed behind until I could also find a job in Big City.




It was in June when Donna very suddenly came over to our house, unannounced, to speak with me about how things were going.  She asked me how I was feeling about John living in Big City and his failure to secure a job in Smalltownsville.  Since she was asking for my honest opinion, I told her that I was feeling depressed about it and that it was hard to live apart.  I also told her that I didn't understand how John had worked so hard to try to get a job at the hospital in Smalltownsville, and others working there encouraged him to apply for this and that, yet he still didn't get a job.  I was disappointed that it hadn't worked out and wished he could have stayed.  I wished that his networking had paid off.




Apparently this was the WRONG answer: Donna went absolutely ballistic and started sort of yelling at me and dressed me down for about a half hour about how ungrateful we both are, Donna and William had worked so hard to get him a job, who the hell did I think I was, you don't know anything about it, how dare you, you're such a child, just wait until life actually starts getting hard, you don't know the half of it, etc. etc. for about thirty minutes.  When she finally finished, she refused to let me say anything, started talking about the weather, then got up and left.




Honestly I was in such shock that she talked to me that way, that for the first few hours I sort of didn't know how to react or even what to say.  I told John that night about what happened, and he fluctuated between getting extremely angry with his mother and then saying, ""She probably didn't mean anything by it.  She's just upset this isn't working out the way she wanted.""  I told him that I didn't want to talk to her for a while and that I needed a cooling off period; he agreed and said that he understood.




For the next month or so, Donna kept trying to meet up with me somewhere or suggesting we do something, but I just would politely tell her that I was busy or that I couldn't meet.  I was never mean about it and tried to be respectful, but one day she sort of muttered over the phone, ""Well excuse me for bugging the hell out of you..."" and then she pretended that she never said anything.




Right after that, I got the perfect job in Big City!  I was so happy and couldn't wait to move to be with John again.  When I told Donna and William?  Silence.  The biggest response I got was from Donna, who said, ""If you think that'll make you happy,"" and that was it.  I was really heartbroken, and John told me to try not to take it personally and that they were just hurt that we were leaving Smalltownsville.




After I moved to Big City with John, we found an apartment and moved in.  However, this was when something terrible happened: I found out that John was being verbally abused by his boss and coworkers, and I supported him in the decision to quit his job.  I would work while he found another job.





The second William and Donna found out about this, Donna in particular got irate and started saying that we ""can't"" do this and that this is a huge mistake, what if you had children, what if you had a house payment, this is reckless, etc. etc.  I told her repeatedly that everything would be fine with just my paycheck, and she literally acted like she hadn't heard me and just got up and walked out of the room.






After this happened, I also found out that they called John when I wasn't around and told him that he should move back to Smalltownsville to find a job, that he shouldn't stay in Big City.  John was sort of bewildered and said, ""But my wife is here, we're doing fine, I will find a job soon.""  Apparently William and Donna said that ""It doesn't matter if she's there, you don't need her and you need to come home.""  John then got pretty angry and said, ""I'm done talking, and that is an absurd suggestion, she is my wife,"" and he hung up.  His parents didn't speak to him for a couple weeks because they were angry and John was perfectly happy with that.





Shortly after that, John got a job!  It was exactly what he was looking for and we were both so happy; his coworkers are really cool and the environment is very relaxed, completely the opposite of his old job.  His parents were nonplussed and Donna said that the job wasn't ""good enough"" for him and that it would do him no real good.




Most of this happened up through September, and for a while we thought it was over and that they had finally accepted that we had left Smalltownsville.  Things seemed to get better overall until the family Christmas.




Last weekend we had the family Christmas, and I think that they purposely gave us trashy gifts as ""punishment"" for leaving.  John insists that this is not the case, but I can tell he thinks the whole thing is weird.  For one thing, we weren't told when Christmas would be for their family, and when we showed up, they acted like they didn't know we were coming, even though we had told them repeatedly.  They also said, ""Oh by the way we're opening presents in five minutes"" and refused to help us unload anything from our car, then acted sort of miffed when we asked if we could push back the presents by fifteen minutes so we could at least put the presents in order, bring our bags in, use the bathroom, etc.




When I opened my presents, all I got was an incorrectly sized pair of pajamas with the tags ripped off, a calendar from a Chinese restaurant, and a language dictionary for a language I don't study that was purchased from a thrift store (the tag was still on it from Goodwill).  My husband got a dress shirt and a box of snacks from the bottom of their kitchen drawer that were about to expire.




This might not sound that shitty but the issue is that his mother is renowned for her ability to plan out Christmas, buy things in exactly the right size (and always provide gift receipts), buy things she knows people want, and is always very attentive to people's needs.  This isn't an issue of so-and-so didn't spend enough money on me; this is an issue of them being thoughtless and I think purposefully cruel.  There was nothing I could do with my presents and I ended up donating them because I literally couldn't fit in the clothes/couldn't return them, had no use for a Chinese calendar, and the dictionary was for a language I don't study.




That night, I spoke to my husband about this, and again, he says that I'm reading too much into it.  He does admit that the dictionary is pretty weird, but just thinks that things were tight for his parents this year and that they had to do less than they wanted.  I don't think this is true, though, because his brothers and sisters all got really nice things that were clearly not bought in thrift stores, had gift receipts with them, things they wanted, etc.  John claims he didn't notice any of this and doesn't care what other people got.  I wouldn't care either except I think that this points to the fact that they were thoughtless on purpose toward us.  I think this was done in ""revenge"" for us moving.




Right before we left, Donna started saying what a ""shame"" it was that we had to leave, do we have to go, why are you leaving so early, etc., even though we told her what time we were leaving.  John just sort of ignored it and simply said, ""We have to get back in time for work, we told you when we were leaving,"" and that was that.  Donna was visibly miffed by this response, and was disinterested in saying goodbye to me and simply walked into the kitchen.




After all this, I asked John what we should do and he claims that there's nothing wrong and that there's no need to respond.  But I miss the old relationship I had with them and feel like this is just ridiculous.  I also feel like I deserve an apology for the way that Donna behaved toward me back in June, but any time I try to bring it up, she acts like it never happened and she doesn't know what I'm talking about.  John wants me to let it lie and not worry about it, but I think this problem will get worse before it gets better if we don't confront it head-on.





**Other Problems**  There have been other issues too with Donna making comments about how Big City is unsafe, and she also likes to rub it in that I live close to my own mother now.  She's always saying, ""Oh how WONDERFUL for you that you live so close to her, you must LOOOOVE that"".  To me it sounds incredibly sarcastic and rude but my husband claims I should take it as her being nice.  She also likes to ask when we're having children, then will say things like, ""But you can't have children in Big City, it isn't safe there, is it?"" and whenever I tell her that that's not true, she just changes the subject.  John says not to listen to her and that it means nothing, but I can't stand who she has become in the past six months.  She is nothing like the old Donna I used to know.




---   
**tl;dr**:  Started having problems with inlaws about six months ago, they gave us what I thought were really thoughtless and rude presents for Christmas, I feel like this is ""revenge"" for us leaving town.  Husband doesn't agree and thinks I should just let it go, I think that his parents are being rude and that he should talk to them about it.  He thinks that's unnecessary and that they aren't being rude, just stubborn about us moving.  No idea what to think, but I miss the old relationship I had with my MIL.

I'd seen her from across the room a day or so before I met her and thought she was incredibly hot but thought nothing else of it... then our paths crossed at the water cooler, I'd heard she had been rude to one of the interns so I basically told her to not do it again. At least that's what I had expected to happen, but what followed I still don't understand fully but I can only describe it as absolute electric chemistry, it was palpable. I was left speechless on my return to my desk. 

To cut a long story short we both ended our respective relationships and ended up getting together. There was a lot of heartbreak in the midst of all that but ultimately it was the most intoxicating relationship I've ever had, she had the ability to make me the happiest I've ever been and also the saddest. We were both such emotionally charged people that our arguments were impressive to say the least. What we were able to do though was at the end of it make each other laugh almost as easily as we argued. But overtime those wounds became scars. 

The one thing I could never get her to do was commit, it was always too soon after her relationship. Or I wasn't her usual type. Or whatever. She was always upfront about this and I didn't listen. I was too infatuated. 

In the end I got frustrated and decided that if I wasn't the one then there was no point carrying on. I basically told her that and we had some of the worst few weeks ever. I guess I always wanted her to tell me I was actually good enough. Anyway, it was horrible. We cried, we fought and eventually it seemed to settle and I went away for the weekend. On my return she had completely gone cold and appeared to be over what had occurred previously. She said it was the right thing to have happened and that I wasn't the one for her. Obviously I had the natural response of wanting her again. We ended up sleeping together again and having an amazing night of feeling like we were on the same page again, only for the following day for her to go cold again. That really broke me. I moved away and decided I wouldn't speak to her, just completely cut her out. 

I did pretty well for about a month or so, she would still text and call me a lot but I knew it was for the best. She opened up that I was never the right person for her and I guess that allowed me to understand it a bit more. However, I've told her that the only thing that will help me to move on is for her to stop contacting me because just seeing her name flash up on my phone or seeing her face I just immediately fall for her again. She said she understands this but she won't give up. I just can't bring myself to completely delete her from my phone. She said she wants to have an avenue for contacting me in the future if she was dying or something… 

Reading this back, I feel like I’m in the wrong. Should I just suck it up and speak to her as a friend?.

In the beginning it was hard for me to focus on things and to do any work for school which led to feelings of inadequacy and depression coupled with apathy, afterwards it was more straight out panic. When I made a plan on what exactly to do and sorted everything out, the panicky feelings went away, but where soon replaced by a fear of ageing, dying, missing out and so on. Now that I got rid of THAT I feel more socially anxious then before, like something's wrong with me so I can't behave like I naturally would around other people. Things that didn't seem like a problem to me anymore now do seem frightening again.  I'm scared of acting weird, and I'm don't know what to do to fix it. I haven't been at therapy for a few weeks because my therapist is on vacation. I feel like whenever I am able to fix whatever period I'm going through, my anxiety reveals itself again in some other form. Anyone experienced these kinds of feelings before?"

2r5fn4,1,2015-01-02,This last year.,smellyamoeba,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2r5fn4/this_last_year/,"Looking back I think that I am going to remember 2014 as being a year dominated by intense emotions. It started great - I had taken the hard decision at the start of 2013 to leave my University and change to a different course at a different institution and pursue a dream career. My overriding feeling however was that it wouldn't happen but the plan B was preferable to where things had been leading.

So anyway I have some exams in January and after struggling at my previous Uni (for reasons that are my own fault admittedly - throwing myself head first into a relationship like a puppy with a new stick being the main contributor) and taking a big confidence knock I find out that I nailed them. I was back and the dream might actually be on - fuck. Around this time though my girlfriend with whom I was still with after meeting her at my previous University returned prematurely from her year abroad studying in Sweden after struggling to settle in.

Unfortunately in my enthusiasm to help I found that, in hindsight, I brought myself down to her emotional state at the time which was verging on the depressed. I had previously struggled with depression and still do since that decision to leave my old school but I had been riding high, higher than I had done for a long time and so the fall felt all the more intense for it. The next few months were hard. I don't blame my girlfriend for feeling how she did, I know more than most how those particular emotions are something beyond your own control. That being said, when the time came for focus on exams again my attention had been apprehended else where. I failed 2 exams and was back where I had been a year ago.

The feeling of having the possibility of my dream career dangled in front of me at the start of the year to be torn away so soon after was awful. I knew I couldn't pretend that I had a grip on my depression any longer and I sought counseling. Thankfully, the University were sympathetic to my situation and allowed me to retake the failed exams before my 2nd year commenced after the summer break and gratefully I passed them though not to the standard that I had my earlier January exams.

Starting the 2nd year in September and the reason for leaving felt justified when the first tangible steps toward a post university career came. Internships were the name of the game and after the disappointment of my summer exams I still thought what the heck - I came here for a dream let's give it a go. Things were going well as I felt as though I was taking all the right steps and jumping through all the right hoops for that before then being flattened. My girlfriend had cheated on me. 

She had not done so by being physically intimate with someone (she had decided to follow her family and observe her Christian faith at the start of the year and so our own sex lives had not existed for 10 months) but by being emotionally intimate which I find on reflection more painful than the thought of the former.  I had given her support for 3 years struggling through crises of faith, anxiety and ex boyfriend issues to my own detriment. I was crushed but I am yet to let her know out of a misguided sense of not wanting to upset her further as she had expressed genuine guilt about the situation. 

The timing was the worst bit as crunch time had arrived for projects and it was fast arriving for internships as well. Naturally, standards suffered - again. Emotions dominant once more. My dream? I felt it as good as gone. Not again.

I returned home for Christmas to the warm embrace of my family that I am very lucky to have expecting a holiday season of mourning almost and recovery. But then, a phone call. I'd done it. I'd got it. The internship of my dreams at the company of my dreams. I felt elated, confused and sad. Sad that I no longer had the person with whom I shared everything with to share my ultimate triumph with.

I'm still in a somewhat similar state trying to reevaluate everything following the tumultuous year that was 2014 and attempting to come out the other side. This post has been a small part of that and I hope this year won't be quite so intense."

I entered this major because I heard it has a stable job market. I make A's in the classes but I have no side projects or anything. I'm mildly interested in it but I don't feel any passion for this or anything else really.

My winter break is almost over. I haven't done anything with friends or done anything worthwhile. I feel very behind because a lot of my friends are already ahead of the game with internships or even their careers (one even started his own business). 

I know I'm pretty young (19), but I just feel like there was no transition between high school and college. Suddenly I have to take the initiative. I guess it's my fault for not being more proactive. But I'm also scared of interviews in general because I'm not known for my speaking skills. If I feel like this now, I'm gonna feel even worse if I somehow graduate college with nothing under my belt but a degree that everyone has. And I'm not even sure if I want to program for the rest of my life.

I am a college senior who has been smoking for about 4 years, about 0.5-1.5 g per day starting with a bowl as soon as I wake up for the past 2.5. I love smoking pot and I love getting high, but looking back I see countless wasted hours and paychecks. 

Last semester, my boyfriend quit smoking and dumped me a few months later. None of my friends now smoke pot so for the past couple of months, I've found myself spending my evenings alone and just trying to get high/drunk enough to not feel lonely.

The roommates I'll have next year (I'm going on to grad school) don't smoke in the slightest so I won't be able to smoke in their house. Further, I'm looking for a summer internship which will probably require me to pass a drug test.

Although I absolutely love getting high, I've decided to go cold turkey for the New Year. I've tried to smoke moderately for the past couple of years and found that as long as I have anything smokeable, I'll find an excuse to smoke it - and as long as I have anything in my bank account, I'll buy more. Looking at the various reasons I've listed above, I think it's time for me to quit smoking.

I'm on break at the moment and staying with my parents, which makes it easier, but I worry that once I go back to school next week I'll have a lot of unchaperoned free time and be tempted to pick up. I know I have a very addictive personality but I think quitting pot is the lifestyle change that I really need at the moment.

I'm looking for any and all advice I can get on resisting the urge to pick up / smoke. I'm glad this community is available and I hope you all can help me through this challenge! "
2r6h5k,16,2015-01-03,From 18 [m]onths dry to [f]ucking with the door open on the second date... Pt. 1,Wildexpat,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2r6h5k/from_18_months_dry_to_fucking_with_the_door_open/,"Well, I guess I/we are doing something right here on this subreddit. My girlfriend loves reading your stories whenever I forward one to her, and now she's asked me to write her one from our experiences and post it. I want to do it what I hope is creative justice, so I'm splitting it into two parts. This one has no real sex, but it sets the scene. Please be gentle in the comments--I'm just a virgin lurker... 

As I hurried through the rain to the subway station, I reflected on how I had gotten to this. I was a graduate student, working on my master’s and studying in China. Seven months prior, I had gotten into a long-distance relationship…with a virgin who wanted to (mostly) stay that way until marriage. Fifteen days earlier, she had cheated on my while home in the States, blowing her ex. Within the day, I had begun a sad/angry trawl through the local Tinder lineup (“American grad student. Let me know if you’re interested!”), when I saw a girl who had some interesting travel photo backgrounds, but didn't look terrifically hot. Vivian. *Oh, well—she probably won’t talk to me anyways. I guess we’ll use this as a baseline series*. Swipe right. A few Nordic girls in a row. Swipe right. Chick with MAJOR ink and piercings. Swipe left—no point trying to convince her to go for me—I’m a good enough salesman to know that a twenty-something guy who shows his barber a picture of 1940’s movie stars for hairstyle comparisons isn’t going to score with that kind of free-spirited type, and I just wanted to get laid so badly it wasn't funny. Oh yes: I’m 6’, weighed about 190, and I was not in very good shape at all. I could do a pushup, but I was still working my way through negatives up to a chinup. I hadn’t had sex about a year and a half—not for lack of trying. After my girlfriend had cheated on me, needless to say, my self-esteem was at a low ebb, despite the well-maintained Jimmy Stewart-esque part in my medium-brown hair. 

Two days later, I see the message that would start to change all that. “I’m interested ;)”. I look, shake my head, and respond to Viv that 4 AM seems a bit early to be interested about anything. She ignores what I’m told came across as snark and keeps going. I then have to deal with ex crap for a day. Oh, well. Then things get intriguing. *Student, in town for a summer internship, looking for more than sex but not long-term, same general academic field, good sense of humor, spells AND uses punctuation?!* I was sold, despite the pictures. Day three (first real conversation day) I ask her out for Indian. Game called on account of roommate birthday (and common sense on her part), but I decide to keep texting the next day. We’re in business! Back and forth for two weeks.

Dinner on Wednesday? Indian? Yes, please! Meet in a hotel lobby nearby? OK. 

That’s when she says something weird: “Let me know if you’re going to harvest my organs and/or stand me up so I can just go home and rage about men.” The first part is a fairly common China expat joke, but the second was odd. I told her I’d never do any such thing…and meant it, although I was kind of worried about what kind of mess I was walking into, given the comment combined with those pics. Fast forward. I’m in the lobby, nose in my Kindle, when through the door walks this magnificent young brunette in a royal blue sleeveless dress that ended slightly below knee length. She was also wearing a gorgeous light green necklace and matching earrings. I literally stop breathing for a solid second, and when I reboot, two thoughts flash through my head: *I thought that was something that only happens in bad internet writing* and *Good God! If that’s not Vivian, then* someone *is getting stood up tonight*… 

She smiled confidently, walked over with this kind of bouncy grace, and suddenly 5’6” of D3 lacrosse player stood in front of me. I know this will sound crazy, but I didn’t actually look at her body much during that date, despite having been warned that she was sporting a pair of 36DDs that even distracted the owner at times. The reason was her face, with its smile, confidence, and mesmerizing green eyes that practically radiated intelligence. *Clearly, cameras are jealous of this girl and want to make her look bad*. The rest of her (I find out in part 2) was about 180lbs of muscle and good fat, a fair bit of both in the back to counterbalance those massive tits, and a curvy (but not fat) stomach that she’s going to smack me for writing about, but that I find irresistibly sexy when combined with her hips and athlete’s thighs. This girl was an adolescent dream…and I had scored a date. No sex this time—we’d established that—but I was hooked. “Hi. Wildexpat?” And we were off to the races. Things went brilliantly, except for the Indian food—they were closed for an hour yet, and we were starving, but I had a backup in mind. Backup was followed with a drink at a place she suggested. We got to near the end of the date, and something prompted me to say “Ooh! Hey, next time—I’m assuming there is going to be a next time?” Laugh, “Well, I don’t want to pressure you…” “Oh, right, like this is pressure. Next time, remind me to tell you about…” We didn’t kiss goodnight—she’s shy about strangers touching her. The text messages that night, though, were anything but shy. In fact, to this day, that’s some of the most erotic punning/double entendre I’ve ever engaged in. It was on for Friday, and sex was an ever-increasing possibility, according to the one with the body to die for.
 
Throughout our whole relationship to that point, Viv hadn’t been anything except straightforward with me. Accordingly, when she said she was tired on Friday, I understood, and I was OK with shifting to Saturday….except for one thing. It gave me another whole day to be nervous. Reddit, I want you to consider this statement: I, an early-twenties, red-blooded American male with not overly much sexual experience, had not had sex in a year and a half. I told her about my nervousness, and she said “I’ve been studying in Chinese here and in [another part of China] for seven months. I don’t like Asian guys. You do the math. Don’t be nervous—the first one is never good.” That eased things a bit. The big day came—or so I hoped, ba dum psh. I had a minor date lined up so we could talk for an hour or two first. The idea was that we would go walking through a (for China) pretty campus and look for stray kittens to force our affections upon before heading back to my single room to clean our hands and get everything else dirty. It was going to be great—kittens are a panty-peeler. I am assured of this. Naturally, it rained. And I had to walk through that rain to meet Viv at the subway…

See part two for more action! More *adventure!!* More **TITS!!!**

I'm unfamiliar with how this works, so should I contact the VP of membership and say that I'll be late for an event? I'm afraid that being late to one event because I was at another will not look good to the sisters. 

2. If I do receive a bid and decide to accept, how time consuming will sorority life be? My friends in different houses say it really depends on active you want to be. Joining a sorority is something I really want to do as I believe it'll improve my social life while allowing me to participate in philanthropy work. I'm taking 13 units, have an internship with student government, and work 8-10 hours per week. 

Thank you so much! "
2r6vo2,1,2015-01-03,"Lack of motivation in my life, just bleak outlook.",yaboi420,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2r6vo2/lack_of_motivation_in_my_life_just_bleak_outlook/,"I think I have depression and general social anxiety. I saw 2 different counselors last year, just for one session each. They could tell something was wrong. 

Lately, life isn't just the same. I have no motivation to do anything. My sleep schedule is wack, (sleep 4am-1pm). During break, I don't do anything productive. I'll play golf, fly my drone, and smoke weed. That's it. And hangout with friends. 

But now, whenever I hangout, everything seems to be a chore and I can't remember the last time being genuinely happy by just myself. The last time I felt happy was NYE, after being very drunk and my anxiety subsiding. I vividly taking MDMA at my first rave and was taken aback at how beautiful the world was. I want a natural feeling like that, once again. I miss being able to smile at the small things in life. 

I failed my first class, ever. I'm a sophomore in college and I failed a class that was crucial to my major. Because of that, I have to retake it and I feel apathetic. It doesn't matter that I have to retake it, I just don't care. I got a 2.3 GPA, that's the lowest it's ever been and my cumulative is a 2.75. 

My parents both have Ph. D's and education is taken very seriously in this household. There is so much academic pressure to do something great- but they don't expect much, only a 3.0. They're constantly on my ass about applying for internships, but honestly, I just want to travel and find out the world and drive. I want to meet people and eventually start a business. I have a business in the works, just that I don't have motivation to do some of the tasks. I just waste away my time on reddit or doing unproductive things.

I smoke a lot of weed and I know long term effects of weed are associated with depression. I want to quit, but I can't. My roommate in college smokes a fuckton, so there isn't a time when we don't have weed. The pressure is immense to smoke. 

I want to do more in life, but I don't think that I know what genuine happiness is. Life just seems so apathetic and nothing really seems to pop out. I felt really happy during NYE, but that's because I was drunk. The happiest I felt in the last 4 months was probably on MDMA while seeing Steve Aoki. 

I want to try to do things, but I'm afraid. I don't know what I'm afraid of, but I have a low self esteem and prefer to be reserved around people I don't know. My roommate hooks up with a lot more girls and I want to get out of my shell. There isn't a shortage of girls, it's just that I'm awkward. It's not that I can't talk to them, it's just I don't know how to seduce them and I don't what's wrong. I used to be so great at talking to women and just not being awkward. 

My confidence has faltered. I simply exist in the cosmos, I want something to love. It's hard for me to get out of bed. Sleep is the one thing I love in this world, just a break from the harsh realities of life. 

I have drive and motivation somewhere, I just need to access it. I don't have motivation to study and my parents threatened if I failed, they'd ship me back home to go to community college or drop out. They're paying for my lifestyle, but I feel like I'm guilty by spending money on alcohol and drugs. My parents are very comfortable and money is never an issue, but I feel bad asking for therapy. 

I feel like I can't really talk to anyone in person because they don't understand. I mentioned that I may have depression to very close friends and their advice is ""Just try to get happier! I want you to be happy."" It's not very helpful. It's hard to just ""be happy"". It's very easy to hide it, but it just is socially taxing. 

I just want to adopt a cat and just cuddle with it and not face my problems. But that's not realistic, is it? I guess I'm just under a veil of ignorance, too scared to see what reality is. "
2r6xgz,2,2015-01-03,I kinda just want to discuss my situation... it's not good or bad. My plan to pay off my student loans.,13FThrow,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2r6xgz/i_kinda_just_want_to_discuss_my_situation_its_not/,"**I sort of just want to vent/write out my thoughts. I don't have a particular question or problem. I just ask if you could read some of it and give me your thoughts.**

I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science and Global Studies with a minor in Asian American studies. I had many career routes in mind that seem to never really take off. At first I wanted to be a Naval officer. My GF didn't like the idea so I sort of trashed it, but also because the recruiting atmosphere wasn't in my favor. Another career route was graduate school for area studies. I also wanted to be a scholar on SE Asian Politics, maybe a professor, etc. But I don't have the grades for it. I have many mentors that suggest I still apply and shoot for it.

I worked at a community non-profit from Sept. 2013-June 2014 as a project manager. I made about $1500 a month with no taxes (billed as an independent contractor). All of my professional experience has been in non-profit. I interned for the Asian American version of, I guess, the NAACP in DC. I worked at the Asian American Studies program at my university during school for a bit. I've had experiences in state legislative politics (ha.. I was just an intern) and even at the national level. Basically, I am skilled in areas that pretty much make no money.

In Spring of 2014 I enlisted in the Army National Guard. I intended to go to Officer Candidate School, but because of a juvenile arrest (for shoplifting $15 pair of jewelry...) I needed a waiver. Recruiters suggested I enlist and get a waiver to go to OCS. Well, they sort of left out the part where no one hasn't gotten a waiver in over a year, but I signed up as enlisted anyways. I didn't take the loan repayment bonus because I felt like the educational benefits were a lot better (they would pay for a graduate degree if I chose to go vs. $500 a month in student loans). I read that the student loan payments were a pain to actually get and was not worth the hassle. Monthly drill pay will get me around $200 that I hoped to throw into a TSP.

I have been in training since September. I will be done with training in a few weeks. Training has brought my spending down to nearly $0 because everything has been provided for. But come mid-Feb., I will be on the job hunt. I really am aiming for something that will get me $40k or more after taxes. I live in the Midwest so this is somewhat decent for an unmarried person with a college degree. My state has the most Fortune-500 companies than any other state in the Midwest, so I feel like it would be easy to find a job in corporate, but I don't see how my skills could apply to it.

Training is ending soon and I will be on the job hunt. I am scared I won't be able to find anything decent because I have really a mis-mash of experiences. My Army training is not applicable to the real world (I am a 13F, a dude that calls in artillery rounds), and my last job-job ended back in June 2014. 

I guess... I am asking for professional career and personal advice along side an analysis of my finances? I have a lot of debt for just a BA. Graduate school is something I dream of, and should be done especially since I know I can get it paid for via the National Guard, but it seems to make more sense to work at this point in my life. Marriage is on the horizon but maybe will be pushed back because of my student loans. 

**To the finances:**

Breakdown:

* -$63,400 in student loans ($24k Private, $30k Stafford, the rest I have no clue what they're considered)
* -$800 in Credit Cards
* -$12 Netflix (I let my friends use it like mad, upgraded it this month)
* -$40 Gym
* +$1550 income
* $5200 in Bank

**Random Questions and Thoughts**

* I planned to pay $1500 a month in loan payments so I could possibly pay it off within 3 years. I want these gone quick. $24k, possibly more because interest, of these loans are private. In order for this to be done, I need a job that pays at least $40k after taxes, correct? I could get away with less.

* My GF suggested she and my parents loan me money to wipe away some of the loans so I don't suffer from the crushing interest rates. What would you make of this? Culturally, I would be embarrassed. My parents would too. 

* I have to assume and act as if I am jobless, because come next month, I will be. I could take as little as two weeks to six months to find a job. I should leave training with about $6500.

* I live free at my parents at the moment and will be moving in with my Aunt shortly. They don't ask me to help with bills because they know about my student loans. My family is here to help and I am thankful, but I feel incredibly bad. 

I guess that's it. This is kind of a mini-vent/writing out my thoughts. I had a talk with my girlfriend and family about my loans. It's a new year and I feel like I can really pay off my loans within 3-6 years if I can pinch every penny I have. Job searching will be my biggest obstacle to be honest. I could use a lot of advice on that.

I have some experience in animal care and think I can get the position, however I am a medical marijuana patient.  The university where I go to school is in a medical state and I have a medical card which allows me to legally purchase and consumer marijuana, however the place where I plan to intern is in a non-medical state where I grew up and will spend the summer.  So...

1) Do most AZA zoos/aquariums drug test interns? I imagine they drug test employees but what about summer interns?


2) If they do drug test, do you think my medical card will be an acceptable reason for me to fail a drug test and still be considered for the position if I explain I only use marijuana at night and for medicinal purposes? Or should I just stop smoking?  Weed really does help me with some medical issues I have, but I think I can be fine without it for a few months.  This is more important to me and I am willing to stop to pass the drug test but if that is what i need to do, I am just trying to gather information.  So thanks everyone!"
2r8lw9,5,2015-01-03,"Depression hit me hard in life, and I could use any amount of help.",Soycrates,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2r8lw9/depression_hit_me_hard_in_life_and_i_could_use/,"I've also posted in /r/depression, but realizing that one of my biggest roadblocks right now is finances, I thought I would also ask here for some help. In short, I'm a Canadian (in Ontario) who finished school and has a job related to the program in which I studied, but I need to pay off some student debt to get my official BA, to start on my MFA, and to apply for internships in the area - while trying to pay for my much needed antidepressants, make it to my counseling appointments, and pay for food and rent. My job, which hasn't been going well, won't help me through all of this, and I don't want to give up on food and rent to keep my job and degree, but I can't afford to lose my job and degree either. Even getting a second job has been hard, because I can't afford my antidepressants right now.

_________________________________________

I've had depression or something like it for nearly as long as I can remember. I recall being naturally melancholy even in childhood, however it never bothered me or hindered my goals and aspirations until I was about 15. That's when it started affecting my life, around the same time I was raped, developed an eating disorder (orthorexia) and body dysmorphia, got into a year-long relationship with someone who was controlling, gaslighting, and degrading me, nearly failed one of my favourite subjects in school, faced abuse and neglect from my parent (who once warned me that she'd call the cops on me if I didn't stop crying), was institutionalized at a hospital for about a month.

But I managed to get through it: I personally recovered from my ED and BD, tried harder in school, got accepted into university at my preferred school in my preferred program, met an amazing guy who I've been dating for over 4 years now, got a job, had money to move out, started publishing online.

Unfortunately, the story doesn't stop there. I wish it did. It was around exam period when my mother and sister went apartment hunting for us (I was going to room with my sister, which isn't a problem since we get along so well). I didn't have time between work and exams to help much, but I pointed out a few places I was interested in. They chose without even showing the place to me. My sister and I lived in a roach-infested, leaking, run-down hell-hole with drug deals and murders down the hall or just around the corner (to be honest, though, I've lived in neighbourhoods like that for good portions of my life, so it's not like I'm unaccustomed to it). For a year. We had to seal off all our food incessantly, I had to shake out my bed every night for bugs, and we had to clear the toxic-looking mold out of the bathroom at least once a month. I started falling behind in tuition payments, but I could still finish off that year with my BA, even though I had planned to go to graduate school.

I moved out into a new place - where I am now. I live with a landlord and occasionally have roommates every now and again. My room is extremely small, it's not the best place, and I'd like to move into somewhere better someday soon once I sort out my life. I didn't have the money to go for graduate school, and even though I completed my studies for my BA, I don't have the money to pay the final amount of tuition to officially earn that BA. I barely pay rent, and my editor at work cut off contact with me about a month ago for no reason. My old editor (who was awesome) left to have a baby, and the new one was always slow at assigning me work. Eventually I told her I needed to go on hiatus, at which point I tried to commit suicide. I ended up at the ER for the night, and then had to see my doctor soon after about getting on antidepressants. (I contacted her telling her when I finished my hiatus not too long ago, but she still hasn't contacted me.)
The antidepressants were nice. They made things feel nearly manageable, they made me less anxious, and a little more able to get out of bed and try to sort my life out. But I'm still extremely poor, and I've finished the trial of antidepressants I was on. I can't afford to continue with them, unless I get some sort of financial help, but I can't reach out for financial help if I'm too depressed to even wake up, and feeling like attempting suicide again.

There are a few silver linings. I'm still doing well in my relationship, although I wish my SO was more helpful and supportive of me while I struggled with depression. My relationship with my mother has improved greatly since I haven't lived with her for so long. I still have friends, despite getting kind of hermitty around the worst of my depression, and occasionally even have social gatherings (I run games of Dungeons and Dragons). I have my cat, my best little buddy, here with me still - he's been through nearly as much as I had, and we've been through a lot together (he's been with me for about a decade). I'm still trying to write and keep up with my personal interests (philosophy and activism, mostly).

Whenever I think of what step I need to make next to get better, I feel scared. I'm glad that I'm still here and still trying, but I need all the help I can get. I have a paypal link through [my blog](http://soycrates.tumblr.com/)."

I'm 22-years-old and currently in graduate school. This was my first semester, and I got all As in my coursework. However, because I focused far more on my classes and allowed myself to be consumed my a depressive episode (I stupidly didn't tell anyone and decided to let it take its course), I underperformed at an internship that I was hoping could provide me with a stellar reference to medical school. They politely just recommended that I just quit and find work somewhere else. It also ruined any sort of academic/professor relationship I had with the professor who recommended me for the position.

I know that this is just one bad event, but I can't get the thought of it out of my mind. I'm constantly thinking about ways that I could've performed better and how much better off I would be if I had actually been good at my position. I'm trying to not hate myself for this, but I've always had extreme difficulty dealing with any mistakes in my academic/professional aspects. I hate the fact that I can't shrug this off and be normal person and instead can't even manage to get excited about my next semester. My mind won't stop racing with negative scenarios regarding my academic and professional future and I can't help but think that I demonstrated that I might be a total failure since I couldn't function perfectly while dealing with depression, even though others seem to be able to do so. Does anyone else on this forum have past/current issues with dealing with failure? If so, any advice for me?

I am currently a junior in college. I am a year ahead in school so I am 19 years old. I graduated from a community college and transferred to a university. I am double majoring in Criminal Justice and Psychology. Initially before enrolling in college I was deciding between the military and going to college but ended up picking the college route. The military has once again sparked my interest after talking to many members while I was doing my internship at a police department. At this point I am too late to join reserve while in college because I want to go active as soon as I graduate and my reserve contract would still be going. I have talked to people and read about becoming an Officer in the Air Force after college but seem to get some varying answers. From what I understand the Air Force is the hardest branch to become an Officer in. 

So the question is what is the possibility for being selected as an Officer? I have a high GPA (3.6+), am very involved in my school and have some leadership experiences (camp counselor). I have read the degree I have is a non desired one for the Air Force. 

Can I take any other steps now to increase my odds at being chosen?

2r9nie,1,2015-01-03,My Ex [19/F] Broke Up With Me [19/M] 2 Months Ago and I'm still Not over it. Help Please!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2r9nie/my_ex_19f_broke_up_with_me_19m_2_months_ago_and/,"I really wanted to make the title longer to be more specific. I really need help with advice and just getting over my past relationships. It drives me crazy and keeps me up at night. **I really apologize if this is a bit lengthy. I need to get this off my chest.** I'll put all the questions I need help with near the bottom.

I think the best way to fully explain this is by going into some background. My ex, let's call her Amy, dated for 8 months. We have a circle of friends since first year of university and now we are in third year. People relevant in our group was a guy, my best friend since day 1 of first year. Let's call him Max. There's another guy, let's call him George. There is one more girl who isn't too relevant, let's call her Michelle.

The 5 of us formed a ""group"" from day 1 of first year because we shared so many classes together. We are all business majors and there are so many mandatory first year classes so our schedules were basically the same. We did all group projects together and everything was fine for first semester. 

A little background about me and her. I'm really not the smartest person in the program, I'm just a guy who is able to smooth talk my way into things and network to get places. Typical business personality. No knowledge, all talk right? My ex, Amy, she's shy, cute, and incredibly smart. Her GPA mind blows me everytime. She doesn't talk much outside of our social group. I had a small thing for another person in our program, I made a move but never fully committed to anything. 

So now for the story. Second semester, first year. Amy was incredible, she was so sweet, always smiling, really kind. I don't know how, but somehow she was attractive to me. So I put effort in and ask her out. All that fun stuff. Eventually she says yes. I'm going to admit that neither her or me really had 100% right intentions going into this relationship and I think this is a factor. This is about mid January 2014. Now my friend George, he lacks social awareness. Long story short, he touches Amy and makes her uncomfortable while we are dating. Both of us didn't say anything hoping he stops. He doesn't. Amy gets pissed, yells at me which she has a right to. So I grow a pair and tell George to fuck off. He does, George and I have an awkward relationship but after a few months, everything is back to normal. This would be the first of many fights in a relationship. 

So, after Valentine's Day which was about our one month anniversary, things start to get serious. My intentions from here on are true. I told her I love her. She says it back and I finally get the courage to ask her why she agreed to date me. She doesn't tell me and said she never will. I get suspicious and I have a hint why but I give her the benefit of the doubt. **My mistake #1.** Basically, like I said, I can network better than the average person. Great talker, good experience, solid resume. But my GPA makes me look 10X worse on paper. Amy had difficulties with what I excelled in so part of me felt she was ""using"" me to learn the secrets and network for internships. Even though I had this idea, a friend told me the exact same but even then it's hearsay. I'm still 99% convinced it's. That's why she wanted to go out with me in the first place. But she's my girlfriend, relationships need to build on trust. So I trusted her. 

Our relationship goes fine but when she tells me something, usually something small, I shrug it off and act like it's no big deal. **My Mistake #2**. I should have really cared about whatever she tells me and be more supportive. I hate myself so much for not realizing this and to be honest, this was a very important factor in why we broke up eventually. Most of our arguments are over the fact ""I don't care about the little things."" Other than that, our relationship is going amazing, I really start to love her and around the summer (almost 6 months), I sensed something different. **Both of us had true intentions to each other and we really loved each other. This is really important.**

Then comes **My Mistake #3.** A huge fuckup. I think. Amy makes a bad decision that was incredibly questionable (irrelevant details here). It personally didn't align with my values but I really disagreed about it and openly gave my opinion. I don't know whether I should have stuck with my values which made her extremely upset with me or should have supported her no matter what. Either way, that ""true love"" I sensed after that incident, it disappeared. **Things started to go downhill slowly I sensed but we were together again.**

Now we are in September. We are seeking for our first internship. At this point, I am amazed. Amy from amazing to I can't even find a word for her. Incredibly high GPA. Great experience, she's not as shy anymore, she does interviews incredibly well. Her professional development amazes me to this day. So me, Amy, and my best friend which I tell everything, Max are all looking for jobs. The other people in our social group are irrelevant now. So somehow, Amy gets to the top and lands the top job at the Big 4 Accounting. **My Mistake #4**. She calls me so happy and said she got it. My first reaction was jealously. She was done finding a job in late September, only applied for one job and she got it. I was jealous since job seeking is a bitch to anyone here who has experienced it. Right now, I managed to find a job in investment banking at a large financial institution and Max gets a job in accounting in another Big 4. Great job, but not as prestigious as Amy's. **This information is useful for later**

Around October, just as we pass 8 months, 2 weeks after she finds a job, she breaks up with me. It was peaceful and justified since I fucked up when we dated. She has a right to break up with me. I cry like a baby. I'll get to the point. I was a complete psychological mess. But a coincidence that once she gets a job, she breaks up with me?


Was it okay for me to be jealous that she got a job? This was my second relationship. My first one was a complete disaster and makes this one look harmless. But I was still a mess, no motivation to do anything, I was about to drop all my courses in fear of bombing my midterms worth a lot of percentage of my grade. I had suicidal thoughts but somehow, people around me were right. Breakups just take time to heal. 3 months later, I'm fine, kinda ish. 

**Now here's where things take a twist.** Remember how I said our intentions for going out with each other weren't honest and true? This is where I assume logical connections. Back in December 2013, first semester, Amy has a thing for my best friend Max and makes a move. He has no interest. It's important to keep in mind that Max has even less common sense than George did. Basically a week after our breakup, Amy and Max start dating. Here's why I can't get over it. **WHAT FRIEND WOULD DATE YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND? LIKE WHAT THE FUCK DUDE. SERIOUSLY?** I was absolutely so pissed and things took a really bad turn for me emotionally. Finally, Amy asks if we can talk. We talk and there's one thing that she said that resonated with me and why I can't hate her. ** ""If you really care about me, you want me to be happy. This makes me happy."" Should I go by this quote?** I decided to. Not the exact wording but it made sense to me. I really just want to see her smile and be happy and as much it hurts me to see Max date Amy, her happiness means more to me. I really did and still love her. I stay out of it, I cut out Max from advice of my other friends. As for Amy, I took advice somewhere on the internet saying if you want to mend things, don't talk to your ex about your relationship and just talk about things when you were friends. I do that exactly and now me and Amy's relationship is basically back to when we were friends. I'm grateful.

But it's not the end. I know I fucked up, and all my friends tell me to stay as far as possible from both of them. Especially Amy. If she does this, she's not worth you. Michelle, another friends ask me how I can be so nice to my ex. But our relationship started with wrong intentions and the reasons why she dated me seemed 99% accurate now. So why I am still stuck on her? Because, the time during the summer when our relationship was true, it was incredible. I can never hate her, and it makes me cry so much when I think about everything that factored in to this breakup. I just want a second chance. I know that Amy and Max won't last and if things don't, should I make a move and try to get her back? I know, through all the shit, I still want to get back with her. I'm weird that way. 

I realized I fucked up and I deserve all this. This motivated me to work my ass off, sky rocketed my GPA this semester, got a job. Getting back with her motivates me to do well, to show her that I deserve a second chance.

That's pretty much the story and all the questions I have. Reddit, please help me!

**Questions**


1. Should have stuck with my values which made her extremely upset with me or should have supported her no matter what.


2. I should have cared more right?


3. ""If you really care about me, you want me to be happy. This makes me happy."" Should I go by this quote?


4. Should I treat my ex nicely or does she not deserve it?


5. After all this, do you think it's possible we will ever get back together?


---   
**tl;dr** Ex and I had wrong intentions in our relationship from the start. We break up, she dates my best friend, I'm a mess."
2ra5ti,6,2015-01-04,Transfer Student,vickytemoi,SJSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SJSU/comments/2ra5ti/transfer_student/,"Hello,
i'm a computer engineering student from Fresno State, i love engineering and feel its not too hard but this sadly does not reflect in my grades. i currently have a 3.0 GPA and i am a junior. Here are my questions:

1) How is Computer Engineering there at San Jose State? I heard there are lots of internship opportunities from startups and companies is this true? 

2) If someone transfers does the GPA from the former school show up in SJSU transcript, or do you start afresh GPA wise?

3) Can you choose the classes you want to transfer to SJSU? So you can retake some classes you feel you are weak in?

4) Do you need to meet these classes in order to be eligible to transfer ? (Please check website)
   http://info.sjsu.edu/web-dbgen/artic/tpg/template-87.html


I would love to retake my terrible classes in SJSU and be more serious about life. I'm not going to put blame on my professor's here (although they are not the best, i'm a junior and still can barely code !!!!! we dont have that many coding classes), but i'm beginning understand how life is now and would just love to get a second chance."

I feel awful and like a loser. 

Why can’t I be smarter, prettier and confident, like them?

Logically, I know I’m smart, pretty and confident. 

I’m in computer science at with one more class to graduate. I work hard for my grades.

Not good enough, I’m not on the dean list, TA, google intern at a top 1% school in the world. 

I’m just barely scraping by with a 3.2 overall GPA/3.8 major GPA with no major job experience or internship. 

I work fast food instead.

I’m good looking, I like to believe. 

Not good enough, I don’t have clear skin, long sleek hair, and straight teeth. Nor, do I have a good style or extremely fit body. 

I’m just okay compare to them, 5’5” and 125 lbs. with shoulder length hair. Just average compare to them.

I thought I was confident until I compared myself to them, but my self-esteem is at an all-time low now. 

I visited the school counselor and he told me to stop comparing myself to them. I wish I can stop comparing myself but I can’t. 

I tried. But every time I see them, I do.

I wish my parents understand and stop comparing me to them. 

It makes me feel worst. I’m sorry, I’m not perfect.

I wish I was perfect but I’m not. And I’m not okay with that.

2rac0e,2,2015-01-04,I [21/m] have been in love with a girl [20/f] from high school for the past 4-5 years. I really need help guys...I've come this far (Long post),Yaki98,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2rac0e/i_21m_have_been_in_love_with_a_girl_20f_from_high/,"This all began in high school during my senior year. When I first saw her I wasn't really attracted to her at all but as time past by I started liking her a lot. But it was too late as this was my last year in high school and I was heading to university. I started noticing her during the end of the semester and didn't even get to talk to her. I left to university to a different country filled with regret and sorrow. The last thing I did before leaving the country was send her a friend request on facebook. She accepted but the fact we were so far away it seemed useless.

I stalked her countless amounts of time, almost everyday! I felt so creepy but I couldn't help it. I just couldn't forget her no matter what. I'm already such a stubborn guy (got it from my mom lol). Whenever she interacted with other dudes, my heart shattered! I felt so sad and depressed. Like days passed by and I became a really depressed man. Nothing in life mattered to me. I messaged her once but I sounded so awkward and it was messed up..

So 2 years passed by, I kept stalking her on facebook and found out she was in to this guy. I saw her grad pics and felt so depressed. She was happy with her friends and the guy she liked, and me madly in love with her who she doesn't even know exist. 

I slowly became a mess. I was failing university, I had no social life and my family was already dysfunctional who didn't support me at all besides my mom but I never told her it was because of a girl. 

3 years now passed by, I started getting my university and social life back on track kind of. She was still in mind though. As time passed on and Fall season was starting, I found out that she was in university. In the same country I was in! We were in different cities though but the fact that she was here just filled my heart with joy and hope. 

The city she was in was very far from the city I lived (like a 4 hour flight!) But then a miracle happened, I got an internship for an year and a half which was in the city she was in!!!

All the waiting and suffering I had gone through for the past 4 years I forget it all. I had a legit chance with her now. I finally landed in her city and was so excited! I got a place near the university so I could go walk around campus and bump in to her lol

I worked 8-9 hours and then go to campus just walk around. THEN it happened I walked in the library and I saw her sitting and studying. My heart was racing, I was breathing heavy and I was just dying inside of nervousness. I sat near her and kept thinking about what I should do. I was staring at her and she noticed and I quickly looked away.

It ended with her leaving and I tried talking but I failed. I was too scared and thought the moment wasnt perfect. I felt like shit.

2 months passed by and I didnt see her at all. I still had her on fb and she was going to this event at campus. So I decided to go and make it happen, this time no matter what I was going to talk to her. 

I went to the documentary screening and there she was again, after 3 hours of watching it ended. She got up to leave in a hurry and I ran behind her, She stopped throw something in the garbage and I stopped as well. I was right behind her. I was extremely nervous but I manned up and talked to her! I went up to her and started talking about how she looked familar from high school and all. She was surprised and we talked about what were doing in life and all. I kept cracking jokes and all. I twas sooo magical when this was happening like a dream!


Then before we were heading home, she GAVE ME HER NUMBER!!!! I didnt ask for it. she gave it!!! 

That was the best moment in my life. I texted her giving her my number and gave her innocent text through out.


BUT after her exams I texted her and she didnt respond at all....I think she traveled but I don't know.... Also on facebook I sent her a thumbs up on our 3 year old awkward convo by mistake( fuck me right)..... i fucked up so heavyy!


I came this far, I need advice what should I do now? If I text her I'll seem so desperate....On facebook it's so creepy a random thumb up after a 3 year old convo. Did I blow my chance??? I suffered for 4 years and got a chance from heaven and I cant blow this! I got 1 year remaining in this city she's in, in this year I need to tell her my feelings no matter what!


Please I need advice in how to approach this, sorry about my shitty story telling abilities..."

Feel free to AMA",[deleted],mashups,https://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/2radam/discussion_hey_guys_im_pennwallace_and_i_might/,"So here’s the run down on my mashes and the thoughts and stories behind them.  Feel free to ask anything else about them or anything.


**Free Throws** – I first found out about the real mashup scene through turntable.fm, I moved back to Columbus, OH for an internship.  I had made the first ~1:30 of Pussy Hunters right before I left.  While I was there I bought my mixtrack pro down there in the hopes of playing live gigs. When I got back I spent my time looking for jobs in my field and making the album. I released it on my birthday and threw a party, where I ended up hooking up with a chick I had been talking to. https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sets/free-throws


**Heat Wave** – I started the track during the time I actually started trying to hang out with that girl,  I was having a great summer getting hammered, hanging out and doing whatever I wanted. https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/heat-wave


**Slo-Jam** -  a track made for the chick I was seeing at the time.  She loved the 1D &amp; Bruno Mars song.  I honestly think this track drags on a bit longer than it should but I was still learning what a single mashup was all about.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/slo-jam


**Never Work This Out** – I had met Ricky Cervantes through TT.FM and he sent me an idea, I added a little bit here and there sent it back and forth a few times and released it.  Who would have guessed that the next year we’d be such good friends &amp; collaborators.  (Ricky is still one of my harshest critics when I sent a WIP)
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/neverworkthisout


**Kelsey’s Daydream** – At this point I had the idea to keep going with an EP of tracks using Florence &amp; the machine. (“Florence + The Machine”)  I had made more of a beat using F+tM &amp; the Temptations.  I didn’t know what else I wanted to add it so I sent it to Dr. Brixx just to see what he might do.  What he sent back was perfect, and is one of my top tracks for plays I listen to.  I’d never heard of Metro Station before.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/kelseysdaydream


**The Last of This** – A track I’m not fond of at all.  I started this track during at a severe point of depression.  I hadn’t found a job yet, and decided to go back to school.  The thing I had going with that chick fell apart when I found out that I was here side piece, &amp; that even I had been replaced by another side piece.  I snitched one night while drinking with her dude, who I had accidentally become friendly with.  (I think I did him a favor at this point)
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/the-last-of-this-florence-the


**Sunrise** – A song that meant the beginning of new things.  I was actually going to class, doing well &amp; enjoying life.   The final track on “Florence + The Machine” which ended up telling a story of the few months right after my first major release.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-sunrise


**Carried Away Touchin’** – The first track I made during my time at Cleveland State.  I made it in the bar/eatery during a break in classes.  I had never heard the 3OH!3 track but had the instrumental.   Somehow the track got pretty big and was one of my most popular.  “In case you never noticed it’s a picture of Jerry Sandusky as the cover art.” Everyone loves this track, but honestly I’m not to big on it.  It seemed really easy.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/carriedawaytouchin


**I Feel Nothing** – The second track I did with Ricky. He sent me the basic idea, I assembled the pieces and added the Isley Brothers parts, and sent it back where he fixed it up a bit.  I miss working more directly with Ricky.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-ricky-cervantes-i


**The Sun &amp; The Moon** – Probably my favorite track I’ve ever made &amp; 
another one where I had never heard some of the samples.    This was the first track I was actually proud of because it turned the tracks into one piece, &amp; it got played on some French radio show.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-the-sun-the-moon


**Here We Go**! – Around this time I was asked by Ricky if I was interested in making a track for a Mario 64 mashup for a mixtape he was putting together.  Little did I know this was the beginning of what would become of the #GLDNCollective.  I had a blast making this track, and somehow it has almost 2X more plays than the rest of the mixtape.  (probably because it was the first track on the album.)
https://soundcloud.com/gldncollective/pennwallace-here-we-go


**Three Shots Deep** – a fun track that never got the love I had hoped for.    I loved the art I made for it because it’s a shot of Woodford on my desk.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-three-shots-deep


**Addicted** – Another song that was named &amp; about my mental state at the time.  I was still going through some shit whenever I ran into that whore at the bar, or she would send me a message my heart would race.   Somehow the fact that she owed me ~$200 that I lent her always slipped my mind.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-addicted-rameses-b


**Get Hype** – How Low is my favorite Luda track of all time.  I played with that Chase &amp; Status instrumental for a few days cutting it to fit.  A fun track but not one of my best.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/get-hype-ludacris-x-chase


**Say The Word** – The most happy go lucky song I ever made.  At this 
point I had bought Mixed in Key because my sample collection was getting unruly.  These tracks happened to work and I couldn’t stop it from happening.  (as a note I’m actually super picky about how a sample works with another.  Key/Tempo is just my starting point, if I don’t feel it right off the bat I trash the idea.)
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-say-the-word


**Nice Shoes Wanna F**k?** – An awesome idea I had while going through titles in MIK that were in the same key.   My 3rd most played track and the one I had the most fun making.  I can see myself sitting between classes on my laptop trying to cut the samples to make it work. Luda X Luda was my favorite transition.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/nice-shoes-wanna-fk


**Late Night Heartbreak** – A track I made and released because I hadn’t released a track in awhile.  Nothing great, just a track.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/late-night-heartbreak-demi
THeRe’S ALWAYS MASHUPS IN THE BANANA STAND – I made this in honor of the new season of Arrested Development.  I had a great time turning the opening theme into a beat &amp; lets get serious, Limp Bizkit is always funny.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/theres-always-mashups-in-the


**Direct/Indirect** – two tracks that I thought were meant to be paired, one a girl wondering why a dude liked someone else &amp; didn’t love her back and the other a dude bearing just saying “You wanna be my girl? OK cool LOL”  I found the dichotomy pretty interesting for a more philosophical mash project.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sets/direct-indirect


**Waste Away With Me** – Another track like nice shoes wanna fuck.  The samples just fell into place for me while I was playing.  I was waiting for a class I loved but there was a 3 hour break between my classes.  This is one of the tracks I can’t help but sing along to.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/waste-away-with-me
Tik-Toook – Ke$ha’s  Tik-Tok is my #1 karaoke song believe it or not.  I wanted to make it into a mashup.  The night before I was dared to make a mashup with the TNGHT album, I sent my buddy this track the next day.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/tik-tooook


**Closer To A Good Time** – “This &amp; Waste Away With Me” I feel are joined in some way.  They both are in my borderline euphoric days of class.  I enjoyed everything I was doing, and was happy with where my life was headed.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/closer-to-a-good-time


**Harlem Oates** – So this is by far my most popular track with 150 THOUSAND plays.  (My Soundcloud has 400,000 plays over all)  This track was one of my many “bar notes”  which is the Task List I have on my phone where I put tracks to sample &amp; punny names for tracks.  This might have been my high fame point.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/harlem-oates


**Where It All Began** – I felt bad releasing this track, I felt I was encroaching on Dr. Brixx’s turf, but I loved the track and so did he.  I always wanted to make an inverse version but without a studio of 
Figure 8 It won’t happen. 
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/where-it-all-began


**Fall Breeze** – I can’t believe how many tracks I was pumping out at this point.  I was listening to alt-J’s album everyday on my drive to class.  When I got the acapella for Breezeblocks I knew I had to use it.  The 2Pac pella was exactly what I thought such a chill track needed.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/fall-breeze


**Overdose** – I really like Jenny &amp; Tyler and got some instrumentals.   I tried make a party/love Ke$ha track a bit more low key and loveable.  Nobody cared, still a nice relaxing mash to me.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/overdose


**This Isn’t Everything The Fox Says** – “This is what a fox says” or whatever was fucking huge at this point, I started this mash as a total fucking joke.  Until I realized how funny it is slowed way down.  I got a great compliment on it on SC… “This syncs like an Isosine mash”  I had just become friends with Isosine and knew the level of care and effort he put into his production, I was half proud and half sad that THIS was the track that was so good.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/this-isnt-everything-the-fox-says


**Sing It Back To Me** – Another just fun track, and another I wanted to inverse.  As  I sit here listening to it again I’m dancing in my chair.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sing-it-back-to-me
Party Til The World Ends – At this point I was releasing a track every few weeks at the minimum.  This one had been sitting dormant for a few months.  It wasn’t anything special I just enjoyed making it and never really cared if anyone wanted to hear it.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/party-til-the-world-ends


**Overcast** – This track got some press, some love but no comments.  I wish more people commented.   There are a few issues with the key in this track that I tried to fix up with Auto-tune.  It didn’t quite work but I still think this is a sweet mash.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/overcast


**Decay** – People loved this track &amp; so did I.   I used one of my buddies picture as the cover art to try to cross promote.  I wanted this track to be kind of haunting and I think I did a damn good job of it.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/decay

**One Night Stand** - I don’t know how this happened.  We started to work on GLDN Standard and this track just fell together.  It’s the happiest thing I’ve ever made and I can’t help but smile when I hear it.  The last sample I added was the Nelly Furtado, It needed a bridge and I really didn’t know what to add.  Somehow the stars aligned and this track happened.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/one-night-stand


**Everything I’m Missing** – The complete opposite of One Night Stand.  
K-Ci &amp; Jo-Jo’s track was one of my favorite songs growing up and I’m glad I could make it dark and brooding.  If I hadn’t used the title “Addicted” already I would have probably used it on this track.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/everything-im-missing


**The Night** – The cover art from this track is made from a photo I took on New Years 2013/14 during the Krewella performance in Cleveland’s Public Square.  It was a night that reaffirmed everything I cared about and was working on.  It might have been about 5 degrees but in the crowd it felt like a perfect night.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/the-night

**Mistakes** – There were talks of a GLDN Valentine’s day tape, so I made a track.  I can barely listen to this track because it brings me to the verge of tears every time.  I love Boyz II Men &amp; Bastille and when the  Silver Linings Playbook sample starts I can’t help myself anymore.  Happy Valentine’s day everyday.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/mistakes


**Orbit** – Most of my GLDN mixtape tracks are made as quick as I can because I love the pressure of a deadline but I’ll let the song speak for itself.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/orbit

**Let Her Go** – Probably one of my weaker tracks.   It wasn’t anything I was super proud of but I enjoyed driving and singing to it, so I thought it was worth a release on a GLDN tape.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/let-her-go


**Scan** – So this track was originally part of a compilation that fell through.  After the Mario 64 Mixtape we were planning on doing another video game compilation.  In the end most of the producers backed out and me and Frail Limb Purity were left, we were going to do one ourselves but that also fell apart.  9 months after I made it I gave birth to this track based off of one of my favorite video games of all time.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/scan

**Insufferable Sounds** – At the time of making this track I was balls deep into Fouled Out!   It was probably about 12 months in and my brain was fried.  The only singles I was really releasing were old things &amp; tracks for GLDN mixtapes.  I’d been listening to this Sigma track for a long time and making a mash with PaTD! Just felt right.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/insufferable-sounds-sigma-x-panic-at-the-disco

**Fouled Out!**  - My second album, it started off right where Free Throws left off &amp; I made the rule that I wouldn’t use any samples I used in Free Throws.  (I cheated a bit with a few samples) but no instrumentals or acapellas.  At this time it’s my magnum opus.  https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sets/fouledout

**Sunrise** – A song that meant the beginning of new things.  I was actually going to class, doing well &amp; enjoying life.   The final track on “Florence + The Machine” which ended up telling a story of the few months right after my first major release.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-sunrise


**Carried Away Touchin’** – The first track I made during my time at Cleveland State.  I made it in the bar/eatery during a break in classes.  I had never heard the 3OH!3 track but had the instrumental.   Somehow the track got pretty big and was one of my most popular.  “In case you never noticed it’s a picture of Jerry Sandusky as the cover art.” Everyone loves this track, but honestly I’m not to big on it.  It seemed really easy.

**I Feel Nothing** – The second track I did with Ricky. He sent me the basic idea, I assembled the pieces and added the Isley Brothers parts, and sent it back where he fixed it up a bit.  I miss working more directly with Ricky.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-ricky-cervantes-i


**The Sun &amp; The Moon** – Probably my favorite track I’ve ever made &amp; 
another one where I had never heard some of the samples.    This was the first track I was actually proud of because it turned the tracks into one piece, &amp; it got played on some French radio show.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-the-sun-the-moon


**Here We Go**! – Around this time I was asked by Ricky if I was interested in making a track for a Mario 64 mashup for a mixtape he was putting together.  Little did I know this was the beginning of what would become of the #GLDNCollective.  I had a blast making this track, and somehow it has almost 2X more plays than the rest of the mixtape.  (probably because it was the first track on the album.)
https://soundcloud.com/gldncollective/pennwallace-here-we-go


**Three Shots Deep** – a fun track that never got the love I had hoped for.    I loved the art I made for it because it’s a shot of Woodford on my desk.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-three-shots-deep


**Addicted** – Another song that was named &amp; about my mental state at the time.  I was still going through some shit whenever I ran into that whore at the bar, or she would send me a message my heart would race.   Somehow the fact that she owed me ~$200 that I lent her always slipped my mind.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-addicted-rameses-b


**Get Hype** – How Low is my favorite Luda track of all time.  I played with that Chase &amp; Status instrumental for a few days cutting it to fit.  A fun track but not one of my best.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/get-hype-ludacris-x-chase


**Say The Word** – The most happy go lucky song I ever made.  At this 
point I had bought Mixed in Key because my sample collection was getting unruly.  These tracks happened to work and I couldn’t stop it from happening.  (as a note I’m actually super picky about how a sample works with another.  Key/Tempo is just my starting point, if I don’t feel it right off the bat I trash the idea.)
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/pennwallace-say-the-word


**Nice Shoes Wanna F**k?** – An awesome idea I had while going through titles in MIK that were in the same key.   My 3rd most played track and the one I had the most fun making.  I can see myself sitting between classes on my laptop trying to cut the samples to make it work. Luda X Luda was my favorite transition.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/nice-shoes-wanna-fk


**Late Night Heartbreak** – A track I made and released because I hadn’t released a track in awhile.  Nothing great, just a track.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/late-night-heartbreak-demi
THeRe’S ALWAYS MASHUPS IN THE BANANA STAND – I made this in honor of the new season of Arrested Development.  I had a great time turning the opening theme into a beat &amp; lets get serious, Limp Bizkit is always funny.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/theres-always-mashups-in-the


**Direct/Indirect** – two tracks that I thought were meant to be paired, one a girl wondering why a dude liked someone else &amp; didn’t love her back and the other a dude bearing just saying “You wanna be my girl? OK cool LOL”  I found the dichotomy pretty interesting for a more philosophical mash project.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sets/direct-indirect


**Waste Away With Me** – Another track like nice shoes wanna fuck.  The samples just fell into place for me while I was playing.  I was waiting for a class I loved but there was a 3 hour break between my classes.  This is one of the tracks I can’t help but sing along to.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/waste-away-with-me

**Tik-Toook** – Ke$ha’s  Tik-Tok is my #1 karaoke song believe it or not.  I wanted to make it into a mashup.  The night before I was dared to make a mashup with the TNGHT album, I sent my buddy this track the next day.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/tik-tooook


**Closer To A Good Time** – “This &amp; Waste Away With Me” I feel are joined in some way.  They both are in my borderline euphoric days of class.  I enjoyed everything I was doing, and was happy with where my life was headed.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/closer-to-a-good-time


**Harlem Oates** – So this is by far my most popular track with 150 THOUSAND plays.  (My Soundcloud has 400,000 plays over all)  This track was one of my many “bar notes”  which is the Task List I have on my phone where I put tracks to sample &amp; punny names for tracks.  This might have been my high fame point.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/harlem-oates


**Where It All Began** – I felt bad releasing this track, I felt I was encroaching on Dr. Brixx’s turf, but I loved the track and so did he.  I always wanted to make an inverse version but without a studio of 
Figure 8 It won’t happen. 
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/where-it-all-began


**Fall Breeze** – I can’t believe how many tracks I was pumping out at this point.  I was listening to alt-J’s album everyday on my drive to class.  When I got the acapella for Breezeblocks I knew I had to use it.  The 2Pac pella was exactly what I thought such a chill track needed.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/fall-breeze


**Overdose** – I really like Jenny &amp; Tyler and got some instrumentals.   I tried make a party/love Ke$ha track a bit more low key and loveable.  Nobody cared, still a nice relaxing mash to me.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/overdose


**This Isn’t Everything The Fox Says** – “This is what a fox says” or whatever was fucking huge at this point, I started this mash as a total fucking joke.  Until I realized how funny it is slowed way down.  I got a great compliment on it on SC… “This syncs like an Isosine mash”  I had just become friends with Isosine and knew the level of care and effort he put into his production, I was half proud and half sad that THIS was the track that was so good.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/this-isnt-everything-the-fox-says


**Sing It Back To Me** – Another just fun track, and another I wanted to inverse.  As  I sit here listening to it again I’m dancing in my chair.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sing-it-back-to-me
Party Til The World Ends – At this point I was releasing a track every few weeks at the minimum.  This one had been sitting dormant for a few months.  It wasn’t anything special I just enjoyed making it and never really cared if anyone wanted to hear it.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/party-til-the-world-ends


**Overcast** – This track got some press, some love but no comments.  I wish more people commented.   There are a few issues with the key in this track that I tried to fix up with Auto-tune.  It didn’t quite work but I still think this is a sweet mash.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/overcast


**Decay** – People loved this track &amp; so did I.   I used one of my buddies picture as the cover art to try to cross promote.  I wanted this track to be kind of haunting and I think I did a damn good job of it.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/decay

**One Night Stand** - I don’t know how this happened.  We started to work on GLDN Standard and this track just fell together.  It’s the happiest thing I’ve ever made and I can’t help but smile when I hear it.  The last sample I added was the Nelly Furtado, It needed a bridge and I really didn’t know what to add.  Somehow the stars aligned and this track happened.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/one-night-stand


**Everything I’m Missing** – The complete opposite of One Night Stand.  
K-Ci &amp; Jo-Jo’s track was one of my favorite songs growing up and I’m glad I could make it dark and brooding.  If I hadn’t used the title “Addicted” already I would have probably used it on this track.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/everything-im-missing


**The Night** – The cover art from this track is made from a photo I took on New Years 2013/14 during the Krewella performance in Cleveland’s Public Square.  It was a night that reaffirmed everything I cared about and was working on.  It might have been about 5 degrees but in the crowd it felt like a perfect night.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/the-night

**Mistakes** – There were talks of a GLDN Valentine’s day tape, so I made a track.  I can barely listen to this track because it brings me to the verge of tears every time.  I love Boyz II Men &amp; Bastille and when the  Silver Linings Playbook sample starts I can’t help myself anymore.  Happy Valentine’s day everyday.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/mistakes


**Orbit** – Most of my GLDN mixtape tracks are made as quick as I can because I love the pressure of a deadline but I’ll let the song speak for itself.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/orbit

**Let Her Go** – Probably one of my weaker tracks.   It wasn’t anything I was super proud of but I enjoyed driving and singing to it, so I thought it was worth a release on a GLDN tape.  
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/let-her-go


**Scan** – So this track was originally part of a compilation that fell through.  After the Mario 64 Mixtape we were planning on doing another video game compilation.  In the end most of the producers backed out and me and Frail Limb Purity were left, we were going to do one ourselves but that also fell apart.  9 months after I made it I gave birth to this track based off of one of my favorite video games of all time.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/scan

**Insufferable Sounds** – At the time of making this track I was balls deep into Fouled Out!   It was probably about 12 months in and my brain was fried.  The only singles I was really releasing were old things &amp; tracks for GLDN mixtapes.  I’d been listening to this Sigma track for a long time and making a mash with PaTD! Just felt right.
https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/insufferable-sounds-sigma-x-panic-at-the-disco

**Fouled Out!**  - My second album, it started off right where Free Throws left off &amp; I made the rule that I wouldn’t use any samples I used in Free Throws.  (I cheated a bit with a few samples) but no instrumentals or acapellas.  At this time it’s my magnum opus.  https://soundcloud.com/pennwallace/sets/fouledout

2rai5y,38,2015-01-04,[NeedAdvice] Is discipline being able to muscle through when you really do not want to work and are feeling physically and mentally tired?,TopDawgEnt,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/2rai5y/needadvice_is_discipline_being_able_to_muscle/,"Let me preface this post by giving a little bit of background on my current situation.

I am currently a fourth year college student. I have often times felt inferior to my peers, felt like I did not possess a great work ethic, but at the same time have always strongly believed that all of these things are malleable and could be fixed. So the last 3 years or so, I have gradually started to work on myself. So to fix it, I read some self help books and listened to audio programs which often suggested channeling your past failures and mistakes into your present. I set myself a goal that I think would help pull me out and force me to become a stronger version of myself.

About six months ago, I set a goal to work at a specific company starting this coming summer. Everyday I woke up motivated, thinking about this one company and what it would mean for me to work here. I made sacrifices for it from my social life and even my academics because I imagined how awesome it would be for me, someone who has felt incredibly low at times in his life and has also made a ton of bad decisions that put me in my current situation.

So lets fast forward to today, six months later. I have an interview with this company a week from tomorrow. The process of getting the interview in itself was challenging. The interview is a technical interview with a banking company so it isn't going to be as simple as the basic behavioral interview questions. It is going to require me to do some prep. Its a very hard job to get, in that a lot of people fail these interviews in there first attempt.

So  the last six months of my life have pretty much looked like this- I had a summer internship, followed by the school semester, followed by the last 2 weeks where I have been prepping for these interviews. I have not had a lot of time off. Literally right after I finished finals week at school, I started prepping for these interviews.

I am trying to rationalize it to myself that sacrifice now, and you have can take  a ton of time in a week. I have also been reading the War of Art by Steven Pressfield, where he suggests approaching things like a pro in that you just have to sit down and fucking do your work. But, when I attempt to do this, I have a lot of anxiety and its impairing me from working and I get into a cycle of negative thoughts which makes me feel worse about myself.

So now, I am at the point where thinking about studying for this interview is causing great anxiety, fear of failure, and its almost as if I am telling myself that I don't care about getting it, when I know I will be sad if I don't get it. I am aware that I am probably burnt out and I need time off to rest. That being said, how does discipline play into this? Should I have the willpower to muscle through right now when I really need to? If anyone has any helpful tips, I will be more than happy to take them!

2rb3eg,13,2015-01-04,"My significant (20F) other for almost a year, switched her view of me (22M) from a romantic potential partner to a 'very very very awesome friend' and is now seeing someone else. What do I do?",JohnSnow_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rb3eg/my_significant_20f_other_for_almost_a_year/,"Hey guys, I started dating this girl at school last January and we just clicked.  We talked everyday, studied together, have a ton of inside jokes, went on dates, and had sex.  Everything went well for 4 months, it was basically a FWB situation but a bit more personal because we would tell each other 'I love you' almost on a daily basis.  

By summertime she told me that she felt we were going too fast and she wanted to dedicate time to her career since she had an internship and by August she was going to have 7 classes, that she really felt strongly for me and still wanted to go out and talk on a daily basis.  

August came by and we started it all again.  A bit more slower with the dates and all (movies, netflix binge watching, out to clubs, restaurants).  Since I wanted to show her that I respected her decision to want to dedicate herself to school/work, I gave her space, I didn't want to look like I was forcing myself upon her.  She occasionally stayed at my apartment (3-4 days a week).  Also, we still talked everyday either by Whatsapp or at college.  

By the end of this semester we started talking less.  I just assumed we were over our heads with finals.  Then, on social media pictures began to surface of her with another guy.  When I confronted her and asked her about it she told me she had started dating him and thought of me only as a friend.  I then told her I still had feelings for her and i thought I was being pretty obvious.  At this she genuinely seemed saddened (her eyes watered) and told me that she cared about me a lot would never want to lose me but thought we had left it at friends.  

So yeah guys, what should I do?  I really care for her and she's been seeing him for a little over a month.  Should I try to win her over (this is assumed because of her almost crying)?  Should I just go on my way and move on (no return from the friendzone)?  I've never been in this situation and any help would be much appreciated.

tl;dr
My significant other for almost a year, switched her view of me from a romantic potential partner to a 'very very very awesome friend' during that time lapse.  She is now seeing another guy but I'm not sure if she still has feelings for me.  How should I proceed?"

Obviously I would make sure that notifications, sounds, etc. would be turned off as to not be distracting. Also it is in a black Apple iPad case so it would appear similar to a portfolio notebook.

So my question is would it be okay, or is the benefit of it too minuscule to be worth the risk?"

Anyone else have future in laws get hung up on the proposal? I'd be happy to go into more detail, but the short version is I proposed to my then GF at a going away party for her, because she was traveling to an internship in Hawaii for 6 months. I kept it pretty hush hush; the only people who knew were her two best friends, my parents/brother/sister and of course her Dad. 

Her Mom though is still hung up on the fact that I didn't tell her until the day it was going to happen. Her Mom is the insanely gossip type, and would've invited half of her workforce to the party that didn't need to be there in the first place and would've gave it away. 

I proposed 7-28-13! Even worse, she's expressed all this to my fiance and not me once. In an effort to not cause any more stress to my bride to be I've kept my opinions to myself for now. Looking for advice/stories/thoughts about this from both groom/bride! Thanks in advance Weddit!

I've read over the subreddit rules and I'm fairly certain it's ok to ask these types of things. I'm looking for advice on where to start on preparing to become an officer, I'm an 18 year old starting college in 6-7 months and looking to go into the criminal justice feild, specifically police work. I'm planning on getting a 4 year degree, but I did have a few questions first. 

1. How dependent is a degree when applying to departments? 

I ask this mainly because I know having a degree helps secure any type of job but I'm not sure if police work is different in this aspect. 

2. I've talked to officers that I've known from my hometown as well as a few family officers, is there any other head start I can get for insight?

3. My college I will be attending has a campus PD internship program, and I'm looking to join, will this help when I graduate as far as applying goes? 

Sorry if these types of posts are not allowed or uncommon but I'm basically just trying to prepare! Thanks everyone!"
2rcrri,2,2015-01-04,"My long-standing crush [22/F] rejected me [24/M] a year ago, now admits she has been in love with me all along but is convinced we can't be together",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2rcrri/my_longstanding_crush_22f_rejected_me_24m_a_year/,"*Before I start, I want to seriously apologise for how long this got.*

I first met her four years ago, when I was starting my third year of college and she her first. There was a great chemistry between us, but I was going through a pretty harsh depression at the time and I missed a lot of chances to ask her out/tell her I love her/just kiss her because I was too busy hating myself to believe she loved me back.

Things got weird between us because of my indecisions, we grew distant, she met another guy, started dating him instead and I got to feel double awful because I botched the chance to be with the girl I loved and I botched my friendship with her too.

So two years pass, my depression is now under control and I come across her at a party. We end up sitting down and having a heart to heart. I told her I'd been in love with her two years before. She told me she had been in love with me too, but figured I just wanted to be friends because I never did anything about it. Also turns out her boyfriend went abroad three months ago and they broke up because she couldn't deal with a long-distance relationship, so she's single again.

So our relationship is patched up, we become fast friends again, we are texting all day long and hanging out all the time. A couple months after that, we're at another party together and things between us are borderline romantic. I tell her I'm still in love with her and want to give this a try. I'm holding her in my arms, her face is right next to mine...

...and she starts sobbing. She says she has feelings for me too and really wants to be with me, but she isn't over her ex yet and it wouldn't feel right to her to be with me and still thinking about him. So she asks me for some time to think and set her head straight and I say I'll wait.

We spent the next two weeks in a state of quasi-dating, full of teasing and lustful looks. And given that, when I asked her if she'd made up her mind, there was no doubt in my head that she was gonna become my girlfriend. Except she said no. She said it had all been a mistake, that she'd been confused, that she was sorry for leading me on and that I should forget her and move on. I argued and rambled that this didn't make any sense, that she had been all lovey-dovey with me mere days before, but she was set in her decision.

My heart now inexplicably broken for the second time, we parted ways. She, who'd been such a close friend and confidant for a good while, gradually talks less and less with me until we get to the point of entire months going by without a single word shared between us. We only ever saw each other when we hung out with mutual friends, but in those situations, face to face with me, I could swear things were still the same. It still genuinely felt that we were flirting.

This whole shabang was wreaking havoc on my sanity, so I eventually had a serious talk with her in which I complained of all the mixed signals she'd been sending me all this time and told her in detail how shitty it felt that she'd turned her back on me out of the blue like she did. She said I was mistaken and seeing what I wanted to see, but said she was sorry for how she'd acted in the previous months. She wanted us to try and patch things up and be friends again, but I was tired of the entire situation.

I was still hurt from her rejection and I knew that I could never be just her friend. Her ex was even coming back in a few months and I knew because of facebook that they were still talking, so that was also something I didn't need to see. I told her all that and our friendship effectively ended there. I felt like shit and, from what I know from mutual friends, so did she.

We didn't speak for 6 months, and for most of them I thought that she was back together with her ex.

So during Christmas holidays a lot of minor get-togethers between me, her and our friends happen and this leads me to invite her out for coffee the day after New Year. We're both pretty sorrowful about everything, she's on the verge of tears, and this is when I finally manage to convince her to tell me the truth about why she'd rejected me a year ago.

**""I knew back then that if I said yes we would start dating, and I knew that dating you would be very special and serious to me. But I knew that in a year I would be going to Germany for 8 months, so I couldn't start dating you because it would then break my heart to be away from you.""**

She leaves to Germany in a month, and now she also admitted that she's still in love with me.

**""Just because we're both in love with each other that doesn't mean I'll go back on my decision now. Not one month before I leave.""**

She went on to tell me that she doesn't want me to think we can be together when she returns, because these 8 months abroad might make her move on from me.

At this point we've been either in strained contact or outright not speaking for close to a year and we're both still in love with each other. A voice in the back of my head keeps telling me that she might still love me when she returns. Another that I should go ahead and kiss her now before it's too late, despite what she says.

In essence, what the fuck do I do?!

TL;DR: We can't be together because she's going away in a month for an 8-month-long internship. When she returns she might say the same because she'll be looking for a job abroad. What do?"

I am a 21 year old college student who is graduating next May (2016) and have some money saved up (about $6,000) and have some income this spring and summer. My current vehicle is a 2000 Buick LeSabre with 184,500 miles on it. I commute frequently from college to home (300 mile round trip), putting good miles on her. She is on her last leg and my drive from Illinois (where I live) to New Orleans (my summer internship) is too much of a feat for my car. I have decided it is time to upgrade and get a more reliable vehicle before I leave in May.
 
&amp;nbsp;

After a few days of looking I can’t shake the feeling that I want a Subaru. I’ve looked at the Forester, Impreza, and Outback. I love the AWD feature for winter driving and the 4-cyclinder engines for better mpg (although there are head gasket problems with the early 2000 foresters?). Because of my budget I’m looking at early-mid 2000’s for years. 

Where I need help is deciding between the three of them. What are some pros and cons of these cars that you can’t find online? What is it like owning them?

Things are, at the moment, looking bleek and I don't think I'll be able to land an internship this year. 

Background:
My grades are good, with a 90+% average in my first year, and it seems to be consistent this year. I however, have no experience. I have a few months of a cleaning job last summer and a few months retail but that is all.

I'm wondering, if I don't land an internship this year what should I do with myself next year? Should I go for graduate applications? Or should I try to do the MSci and apply for internships again? Is there anything I can do to be more competitive?"

My fellow ents, I share my life’s struggles with you, my ups and downs. Ents are the reason I am the person I am today, and without my fellow ents I don’t know what course my life would have taken.

Prelude: 

I started writing this to outline how I feel like I am a loner in my family. As a kid, life was rough, and it left some deep scars on me that affect me to this day. Daily, I think back and regret what happened. However, after writing this I have noticed how things have changed for the better. While life is constantly throwing curveballs your way, it is up to you to make a difference in your life. Look to the future, because the past will eat you right up.

I hope the below makes sense, as it was written as I thought, and it was pretty painful to read back through. You, the reader, now know as much, and possibly more, than those closest to me.

Hobey-Ho, here we go!

I (22/M) hold A LOT of resentment towards my parents inside of me. My dad made our family move to another country because he was homesick, and wanted to live near his (closer) family. My mother’s family at the time didn’t talk much, and as a result we moved. This was during a time in which this country’s citizens despised my country. I was 6 at the time. As a result, I was constantly bullied, and blame my parents for what happened in my childhood. I only had the same 2 “friends” for over 5 years, and quote it because I could not hang out with them outside of school. I was forbidden from my friends’ houses, just because I was from a certain country.  When we moved there, I first started in public school. The public school was bad enough that I was moved to a private school. There, I was the only kid in the grade/year who would not get invited to events, and everybody knew this. I feel like I was at the head master’s office every other day because of something that had happened to me.  I played on the A-team for 2 sports at the school, was a great student, but was still always on my own.

When I wasn’t at school, I was allowed 1 hour of my PS1 (that thing was awesome!), and then could only go play outside/play with toys/read. Only, I had nobody to go play outside with: my little brother (4 yrs younger) and I fought every second we were near each other. I spent my time building model planes, playing with my lego, reading, and that’s about it. Hence why I am in my Mechanical Engineering degree, and do so well.  I became a very technical person, as I didn’t really have anything else to do. 

I was always at the doctor’s office with my mom, getting more medication and more procedures done. At a young age, I had a lot of medical issues: severe asthma, seizures, migraines, and more.  I was once put on a medicine for my seizures that took me fro a straight A student to a straight F student in 6 weeks. She would be happy to take me to a doctor, but would never listen to me complain about my symptoms (my migraines weren’t discovered until I moved back, but I had already had them for a year).

My dad and I have a relationship, but I think if it more as a professional relationship. I tried to do father-son things with him when we moved back, but they never felt that way. We would referee soccer together on the weekends, every weekend. We would race gas r/c cars, and recently he took me to Montreal for the F1 Grand Prix (for him, it was a business trip). Yet, we still never fostered a proper relationship.

As a result I learned to internalize EVERYTHING that happened to me, and never really learned how to vocalize what I’m thinking, and make a discussion out of it. But hey, I’m great at not showing my true emotion! As a result of this, I dislike talking to a therapist, because I’m not used to having someone know how I feel.

5 years later, I move back to a suburban town right next to the city I left the first time. For the first 3 years, everything stays the same. I have a friend or two, and holy crap I can go to their house. The last year of high school, I finally find a friend that I can relate with, and that I genuinely feel connected to. He comes from a troubled background; I come from a well to do family. He introduces me to his group of friends, a year we are all extremely close. I finally have a group of people I genuinely enjoy spending time with, and a family. 

As I got closer with the group, I saw what went on behind the scenes. The majority of them smoked trees on a daily basis, and were stoned in class. But it didn’t bother me, I just didn’t partake: these people were the most accepting, genuine people I had ever met before, and there were always shenanigans to be had on the weekends. We were all a little screwed up in some way, and it brought us all closer. 

A year later, I decide to try it for myself. It was the most enlightening experience of my life, and I too, jumped on the trees wagon and rode it for 5 years through university, and 2 girlfriends that didn’t smoke. My friends and I would smoke, and just sit and watch tv shows like top gear, go out on adventures, and now we rave together. I end up spending almost all my time out with my friends, spending nights away from home. I had people to relate to, and felt welcomed. Don’t worry, my parents still knew where I was, just now what I was doing. Trees didn’t change my grades, and didn’t change anything negatively, but I became much more happy as a person. Give me a toke or two, and I’m a whole other person.

Trees also helped me mesh somewhat with my family. 2 years ago, my brother and I smoked together for the first time. We are now inseparable, and tell each other everything. I’m pretty sure my brother knows more about how I really feel than my mom.  Hell, he acts as a middle-man sometimes. My relationship with my mom has gotten better; we talk some, and do have a decent relationship, but she still doesn’t see inside my head. Things didn’t really get better until I had talked to my brother about how I feel with my relationship with our parents. The relationship with my dad is still all business to me, but we do talk a bit more.  

One thing that still hasn’t changed? My perception of myself.  I have had all of these things change, yet I haven’t. I still harbor all this resentment towards my parents, and keep all my emotions inside. Not once have I told my parents about my feelings, except for the two (almost suicidal) breakdowns I’ve had where my mom was the only one to talk to. I know suicide isn’t the answer, and have always told myself that. But to emotionally be to a point where I think about how I’ll do it, that’s scary looking back.  Even then, I still didn’t tell her much. I still prefer being alone over hanging with a group.

People say I am one of the happiest people they have met. When I talk about my childhood and other dark things, they point out that I always smile. That’s my defense mechanism. I feel like I take pleasure out of others’ displeasure. My entire life has been a tale of trying to fit in, and not succeeding. I have life stories upon life stories: I have traveled extensively, I have played on a US National Team for 3 years, I have done things only others can dream of. Yet, I have never felt like a normal human being.

Here I am now, single, about to stop smoking and look for an internship to get me ready for graduating. I have a few friends I can talk to, but rarely see them due to us being away for school. My friends had become my family, and I’d outcast my parents from everything, and now I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. My friends at university are just that: friends. I have no real connection to them, and look to my closest friends back home for support. I have impacted lives around the globe, yet a still look at myself as a loner. 

I have gone through the first quarter of my life in a depressed state, full of regret. But I have decades to change this. I look ahead, and see potential. I have one more year at school to make a difference, and after that I am on to the next stage of my life. When I go back this next term, I am quitting marijuana, I am exercising every day, I am eating better, and I am forcing myself to leave my dorm room and get out there and meet people. I will try to leave a positive impression on every person that I encounter. I will try to establish myself in this new city I have called my home away from home for a year and a half, and make it my home. It will be a long and hard adventure into uncharted territories, but I know that the end result will be worth it.

I really don’t know where to end, so yeah, 

THE END.

TL;DR Had a rough childhood, and I have allowed it to follow me through the rest of my life and impact me. Now I have realized how much it has impacted me, and look to drive myself forward into a brighter future.

2rdj2h,2,2015-01-05,Not sure how to/if I [20F] should tell my fairly new friend [20M*] I have feelings for him,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rdj2h/not_sure_how_toif_i_20f_should_tell_my_fairly_new/,"So way too much background, you can probably just skip down to like the last two paragraphs, but it feels good to write it all out.... I go to an all women's college, and I've had classes with this trans guy for the last few semesters, but didn't really start to get to know him until this past semester. We have basically the same schedule, are in the same major, and are interested academically in all of the same things. We started to get to be friends through studying together, then slowly talking about other things to the point that we realized we had an insane amount in common. Like, I have more in common with him than anyone else I've ever met. We were both kindove losers in high school and were nerdy growing up. I had an older brother and he played D&amp;D. (We're trying to get D&amp;D to be a thing at our college now haha). We're both a lot happier in college, and he got really popular, in part because he's a really hot trans guy in a sea of women. I should note that I'm pretty hot myself haha.


Anyways, we've gotten to be better and better friends over the course of the semester, and through this timeframe I always joked around with my best friend about how it was a thing. Like 'Ohhh I'm going to go proof-read with him again' and she would egg me on. I didn't realize how I actually felt until one day we walked downtown to the comic book store alone together and then basically just spent all day together after that. But, as friends, right? I can't tell. We're both awkward. After that I started being more and more conscientious of it. For instance, pretty frequently when we studied together his foot would end up on my foot for a minute or so. But he's just kind of like that, where if he bumps into you or walks with his arm against you for a bit he won't mention it, not just with me, so I'm not sure if the foot thing was real. Which drives me crazy, right? 


During finals period, we basically spent all day together for like three days. Having all of the same classes, we studied together all day and took our exams together (we have self-scheduled exams). On the last day when we were studying for our final test, I said something like 'it's bad when we studied together, we're too good at focusing' and he agreed that we'd probably done enough, so we went and got food and hung out for like an hour and a half before our exam. The next day, last day at school before break, we went and got coffee. We took the airport shuttle together the next day and were together from like 8 am to 11:30 just chilling in the airport. And since then I've texted him almost every day. 


I should note that I've been semi-constantly texting him basically this entire time, initially just random things about homework off and on and then more and more casually. It's usually just like short things and not long conversations, but sometimes that happens. I guess I've kindove established that I'm the initiator in the friendship. I always ask him to do things, but he always responds really positively. I've never really been able to not text him long enough to see if he'd text me first, and at this point it would be weird I think if I just didn't talk to him for awhile. At least, I've fucked up friendships before by doing that. It's weird though because he's really popular and I figure a lot of people text him all the time.


But yeah, I guess what it comes down to is that I really like him, but I don't want to ruin the friendship. We're going to be in classes together for four more semesters, and I really value him has a friend and would hate to lose him.  I honestly hate that I have feelings for him and have tried to distract myself from it, but secretly of course I really want it to work out because I know him better than I've known anyone else I've had feelings for. (Should also mention I've never been in a relationship) I worry that it will be weird for him because I imagine that a lot of his 'friends' have probably confessed feelings for him, or at least hit on him, again because he's fucking hot. I worry that he's insecure in his friendships because of that, but this is a pretty unfounded concern and I haven't really seen any evidence of it. I above all care about the friendship, but I feel like I have to say something or I won't be able to move on. 


We're on break for the rest of January, so it'll be awhile before I see him again. We've skyped once about 'summer internships' and might skype again, and again, have been texting most days. I miss him of course and have been thinking about it all way too much because I have nothing keeping me busy. BUT, my plan once we're back in school is to invite him over to smoke and try to say something like 'Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I have feelings for you' and gauge his reaction, then if he looks awkward about it go into talking about how I care about the friendship and don't want it to be weird and I hope he doesn't feel like I was acting like his friend just because I like him blah blah balh. And the part about how I wanted to say it to be able to move past it if it wasn't mutual. I'm really trying to prepare myself for a 'no' because I don't want to get my hopes up too much. Just not sure the best way to approach it in a scenario where I don't want the friendship to change too much. Also, is it selfish of me to tell him how I feel? In some ways I think that puts the burden on him and maybe that's unfair... I don't know, any advice would be appreciated :)

2rdl1b,1,2015-01-05,I [21m] was heavily depressed over girl [20f] that I liked in high school. Somehow after years I met her again and need help making something happen. Please help me guys :(,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rdl1b/i_21m_was_heavily_depressed_over_girl_20f_that_i/,"In high school I fell for a girl but never got the chance to tell her. I left to university to a different country feeling regretful and sorrow. I added her on facebook and she accepted. Naturally, one would expect that you would forget your high school crushes and move on in university but that wasn't the case with me. I just couldn't forget her. We weren't friends or anything, we spoke only once before in school and that was it. But why, I don't understand why I couldn't move on.
 

In university a lot of attractive girls wanted to start something with me but I always gave them the cold shoulder. All because of this one girl who wouldn't get out of my mind. I hesitated a lot and finally messaged her over something pretty 
ridiculous. I look back and think what an idiot I was. 


3 years passed by, I reached a stage of heavy depression. I had no support from family, friends. I was failing univeristy. Everything was against me. On facebook I would see her pictures with her friends and other guys and would feel like shit. Why am I stalking her I would question myself. I was getting hurt inside. My mind was incapable of letting her go. A girl I barely knew in high school but couldn't forget. I felt like a total creep.  Obsessed with her. My mind and body wouldn't let her go. Unless I tried my very best I just wasn't ready to give up.


I then found out she had moved to the same country as me but in a different city (4 hour flight away!) for university. I was excited because this was my chance to try my best. I worked hard and got an internship at the city she lived in! Was it coincidence? A Miracle? I don't know but it is my only chance!


In my third month there, on facebook it said she was going to some documentary screening at campus. So I went as well hoping I see her. AND I did, she was there sitting. I finally went after the screening was over and started a conversation with her. I was nervous, anxious, scared but I still did it. We talked about life, school, I cracked jokes and she gave me her number without me asking!!!


It was so incredible, I texted her and had innocent conversations with her. It was like my depression and suffering never existed. But every good thing has to come to an end. I sent her a thumbs up on facebook inbox by mistake....which brought my old awkward retarded convos with her of 3 years again.... I am dying inside! I also texted her after her exams asking her how'd they go but she didnt respond at all! Maybe she went for vacation but I dont know.


So now, I don't know what to do. I have 1 more year in this city and I have to let her know how I feel about her. But these setbacks ruined it all! 


Please guys I can't screw this up! I need advice on how to approach this situation! What can I do?! We had good text conversations and she's not the type to not reply. And my facebook blunder is making me feel like a total goof and idiot...look so creepy...I over think a lot I know...


Please any advice would help! Thanks

So. Outside looking in, my life is perfect. I have an amazing family. Wonderful relationship with my parents and siblings. I have an amazing group of friends, both at home, and at school. I go to one of the top universities in the world. If I keep up a decent effort I will get a great job at the end of my four years there and everything will be great.

I'd like to rewind a bit. I grew up wanting to be the next Quentin Tarantino. I love writing. I love creating. I had always felt called to share this love of mine in some way. So I started school as an English major. It was going great until I got scared. All of my friends were getting internships and learning real subjects like math, and business, and science--none of that English bullshit. So I sold out. I told myself that I could be a business major while keeping up my writing on the side. And now here I am. I'm doing what society tells me is the safe thing to do. But something inside me is tugging.

I'm tired of listening to the lies of optimism, that I will meet the girl who will make things better, that I will find some occupation that justifies selling out on my dreams, that my time is coming. I'm equally tired of listening to the pessimist within me that gives no credence to the world we live in. I know there's something going on down here on this earth, I just don't know what yet. 

And so I turn to the beautiful community of Reddit, on a throwaway, to ask what to do. There is something within me that tells me I must go. Not because I have to go, more like, why do I stay? I watched the Truman Show the other night. The line that really struck home was when Truman asks his friend, ""Do you ever feel like your whole life has been building towards something?"" I look at my own life. I look at the veil between my own spirit and that of what society tells me I should be. The veil has been so fucking transparent these days and yet it still holds me. I am scared shitless that I will wake up and be fifty with a perfect life, and chuckle to myself every so often: ""ha. I used to have dreams. I guess all young people do,"" knowing full well that the tugging is still there. 

Thanks for reading. "
2rdr1d,9,2015-01-05,I [20F] am still angry at my ex [21M] for what he did. I want to forgive and move on... but how? Need help please!,chlorxyne,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rdr1d/i_20f_am_still_angry_at_my_ex_21m_for_what_he_did/,"About 9 months ago, I [20F] dated this guy [21M] whom I very heavily fell for. Of course, my view of how the relationship fell apart is biased because, well, it's my side of it and I never had a chance to get his. 


So, here's the relationship from my perspective, as unbiasedly as I could describe it: 


We met each other at a party at the beginning of summer and hooked up. 
Decided to actually get to know each other. We both ended up liking each other more than expected. 


We started dating. It was going fine, maybe a bit too fast, since I was always at his place because I had a roommate and he didn't. However, he went to school 2 hours away from me (we were both in the same location for summer internships), and I was about to study abroad the semester after the summer. 


So, there was always this huge elephant in the room about distance. 


We decide to ignore it until we had to deal with it. 


However, the bigger problem was that he was not over his ex. They were in a relationship for about a year and they broke up a couple months before he met me.  


So, things broke down eventually and he broke things off with me...on my birthday. 


To make things worse, the day after my birthday, we were suppose to go on a vacation with a few other people. We still did. He spent some time flirting with another girl in front of me during the vacation. 


I confronted him about it, and he admitted that he was using her to make me jealous and to upset me. We still hooked up anyways. 


When the vacation ended, he pushed me away, again, and said that we were just friends now.


I was extremely torn and heart broken, because I really liked him. I stopped talking to him for a little bit, but couldn't help calling him and seeing how he was doing. 


He was doing absolutely fine. I broke down in a park like a dumb teenager because the break up hurt so much and I was so upset, and he sounded completely fine and was actually about to go ""paint with a group of girls"".  


I was breaking down, crying, almost obnoxiously, and he told me to ""Stop crying,"" and then I heard laughter through the phone. I think this was what stung the most out of everything. Hearing the girls he was with laughing at me in the background, and him being completely fine and telling me to move on while I was crushed and bawling like a maniac in the middle of a park...was humiliating. 


I felt embarrassed, mocked, and made a spectacle of. 


After that, I decided I needed to cut him out of my life completely. (A bit afterwards, I found out he hooked up with some girls right after he had broken things off with me. More salt on the wound, please.) 


So, to wrap things up... 


From my side of things, this guy I thought I fell for and whom I thought had fallen for me used me as rebound for his last relationship. Everything I thought ""special"" that was between us, well, wasn't. 


It's been awhile since, I've traveled a shitton (8 countries in 4 months), I haven't talked to him since (it's been ~8 months) and, well, I'm still angry and upset with what happened. Why is this? 


Why can't I find it in myself to forgive him and move on? What can I do to go about finding peace with myself about this? I contemplated about calling him, but I wasn't sure what I'd say or how the conversation would go. 


I'm just in a rut about this whole thing and I'd really like to just get over it all and move on with my life.

tl;dr: Ex used me as rebound. I was hurt. It's been some time, I'm still hurt. Someone tell me how to stop the hurt. "

Need help!",hy2255,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rdve8/me_21_m_starting_to_like_another_girl_19_f_that/,"So, I'm in college and have been dating my current girlfriend for about 1 yr, 2 months. Overall, it's been a pretty solid relationship, albeit a little stale as of late. 

Last semester, we were both really busy with her in the pre-med program and me looking for internships and doing different projects. Because of this, we didn't see each other a ton, and did not get intimate that much at all (about 3 or 4 times all semester). A lot of the times we did talk was me being there for her about the stress of school and life and whatnot, which is fine, but I'd love it if occasionally she could just de-stress. She ended up getting a 4.0 like I know she would. 

Some things to add to this is that she is a terrible texter (I'm pretty bad too) and is consistently very late to places which is a pet peeve of mine but something I have learned to handle. Coming into this semester we promised to kind of work on our relationship more instead of it just being like 'comfortable' and I really hope that occurs. 

Coming into last semester, new female neighbors moved in, one who went to the same high school as my roommate, and she knows my gf too. My house would kind of have little parties and whatnot with her house for fun and we really kind of hit it off, very innocently. A lot of teasing and ribbing occurred, nothing I would think was inappropriate. Eventually I got her number to text her about something school related, and that has lead to a mildly consistent (2-5 days a week) text conversation I've had with her about her life, my life, a lot of questions to each other, and more fun teasing and whatnot. 

I will admit it was very nice to text her at night about something innocent and fun rather than consistently dealing with heavy things with the girlfriend. I have started to realize I am developing some feelings for her, which I know is no good at all. She talked about a date she went on tonight and I felt some mild jealousy and thought to myself ""you're being a dick and a hypocrite."" 

I really don't know how to handle this situation. I love my girlfriend but have thought we started growing apart, even before meeting this other girl. Our relationship had become stagnant and while I love her, I've been her only girlfriend in her life, and I have thought that maybe we just aren't meant for each other. However, I do enjoy being with her, and maybe this last semester was just an anomaly and this semester will be much better? 

I don't know how to handle this. I see 3 options 

1. Cut/Hinder ties with the neighbor substantially 
2. Break up with girlfriend 
3. Try to keep the balance with both for now... which I know is toeing a very tight line into emotional cheating 

---------------------------------------------------------
tl;dr - Love girlfriend, but perhaps relationship dying? New neighbor more fun to text/talk to -- perhaps emotional cheating? "

i got a wonderful internship, i lived in a neighborhood of Houston that i really fucking loved, then i had to go manic, huh? i had to get myself evicted, fired twice, broke... lost all those wonderful friends (my best of them *died*)... killed my reputation, can't even take care of myself

i've been depressed since (about a year ago), will things ever be as colorful again?"
2reprl,6,2015-01-05,My mom is sightly old fashion and I (20f) want to find a way to compromise,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2reprl/my_mom_is_sightly_old_fashion_and_i_20f_want_to/,"As said in the title, my mom is old fashion, let me give a little history and examples. And I'm not going to state my mother's age out of respect for her.

My family is from a small town in Siberia (Russia) and moved to the states over 10 years ago. My mom has always stood by the idea that a man provides a house and a women makes it a home.
I grew up learning how to be ""feminine"" with skills how to cook, clean, sew, stay in shape, etc. And how to act and be a lady. All things I'm very grateful for. When it came time for college my mom didn't want me to go and instead find a young man to settle down with. I wanted to go to school and my dad agreed that it was a great opportunity to be able to study in the US, so I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. I'm studying computer science which is a male dominated field and only further irked my mother. I got an internship after my freshman year and was offered a position at a software company which I've been working at as well for the last 2 years. This put my moms and I relationship further on rocks as she is against the idea of women working.
I've been working very hard to rebuild our relationship and so has my mom. Over the last couple years she's gotten more open minded about school. I also have a boyfriend now and we live together, which makes her extremely happy. (And me, he's wonderful!) 

Over the last few months though she has begun to really push the idea that I need to have kids soon as she's terrified that I'll put my career before my family. I've tried talking to her and letting her know that I still believe in many traditional roles and that although I love programming I'll give it up when the time comes for however long that may need to be. But ""when the time comes"" isn't definite enough. I just want to finish my bachelors and have the opportunity to pursue my masters if my company is willing to help. I also don't want to have kids at such a financially unstable age, nor do I want to pressure my boyfriend although he likes the idea of having kids more than I do currently

I don't want my mom to feel that I'm disrespecting her and the way she raised me. Both my parents have given me so much and I'd love to make them both happy.

Previously when we had an unhappy relationship spending more time with her doing stereotypical girly things helped as well as learning how to better cook and sew. I want to be able to find a compromise with my mom as she's worked really hard at becoming more open minded and coming around to the whole College thing. Any ideas on what I could to maybe help ease her stress over the situation? 

Also I really want to move to Seattle one day after I finish my degree for a handful of reasons (weather - I love the rain, job opportunity, etc.) And so does my boyfriend, but I'm worried she will think a city is no place to start a family. I don't know if I should tell her my ""dream"" now so that I can have more time to mend the relationship in case it does hurt her or later so that she doesn't have one more stressful thing on her mind?

TL;DR: My mom is old fashion and wants me to start a family soon but I have different desires. How can I be respectful to her and the way she raised me while pursuing my own goals? Is there a compromise I could make?"

Theres quite a lot of information so i'll try not to go on for too long.

For a while now i've been graduated from university looking for internships, jobs and freelance work to earn money with an amber/bronze success rate. 

Earlier today I was offered a 3 month internship in Prague (flights and accommodation paid for) but I don't know wether I should take it because January is one of the best months for getting jobs. 

With very little effort I already have interviews for a part time design tutor job as well a 3D designer job at a place I would love to work. I also have a friend who moved to Dubai recently and left his job as a fabricator that paid £40 per hour, for all you Americans thats about $63 per hour!!! There's also another job my friend left which i'm eyeing up and if none of those pan out there is a 'pre accelerator' program in February for getting businesses started that I would love to be a part of. 

With so many opportunities in the UK is it worth going to Prague for a 3 month internship? Then again I don't want to not go and have wasted my opportunity. HELP!"

2rf4jp,79,2015-01-05,"The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Co-worker",vonescher,badpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/badpeoplestories/comments/2rf4jp/the_terrible_horrible_no_good_very_bad_coworker/,"My first contact with the woman who would become ""Co-worker"" was when I applied for the internship position during my senior year of college. I submitted my resume and called the firm a week later to follow-up. The hiring manager (Co-worker) was terribly terse with me regarding my inquiry and stated that she would let me know""*if* and *when*"" she was interested in setting up an interview. I figured she'd forgotten about the call by the time we met as she was all smiles and handshakes in the interview. I eventually learned that she's as phony as her bleached and veneered smile.

I was offered and accepted the position. I worked hard and got along well with everyone in the office, even Co-worker who supervised the interns at the time. I noticed that Co-worker came into the office late, often left early, and was out regularly. None of that was any of my business, but it did make me wonder about her and why my boss accepted it. We'll get back to that in a bit.

Co-worker was embarrassed of her lack of higher education and I think this was why she tried to be so high and mighty with the interns, often implementing strict rules and unnecessary policies. When it came time for my Uni graduation, she did not attend the big celebration to which she was invited, though our boss did come bearing gifts and spent a long while visiting with my extended family and friends. My boss and I get along very well and have an excellent working relationship. 

After our boss offered me a full-time position at the firm following graduation, I noticed a shift in Co-worker's attitude towards me. She constantly undermined me in proposals and meetings, refused to train me in on jobs the boss wanted me to take over, and threw a full-blown fit when the boss sent me to a learning workshop at our corporate office. When I returned, the boss had me prepare a PowerPoint presentation to share what I'd learned with the rest of the practice. Co-worker outright refused to come to the meeting. It was... a bad day at the office.

Despite her continued attempts to derail my career, I continued on with business. Co-worker - who also handled HR - had a nasty habit of telling me, ""as a friend"", private information about our boss, other employees, the firm's founder and various clients. I never wanted to know any of these things, she'd just blurt them out to me. In an effort to get between me and our boss, she ""informed"" me that our boss had had an affair which Co-worker knew all about. It's why she was able to get away with murder at the office - come in late, leave early, refuse duties, etc. - she was *blackmailing* our boss.

This all went on for four years. During this time, Co-worker went through a bevy of eligible bachelors with no relationship lasting more than a year or so. Despite being a horrid person, she was very pretty and spent a lot of time and money on looking her best (her ""best"" included an eating and exercise disorder fed by low self-esteem, for which I pitied her even though she did little to work on these personal issues). By the end of our run together, she was distraught over being cheated on and dumped by her most recent fellow. Taking several personal days and sobbing at her desk on the days when she did come in.

It all came to a head one morning when I was looking for shared cleaning supplies she tended to keep in one of her cabinets. While I did not intend to snoop on her, I saw that her email was open and pulled up on her unlocked screen including two emails which were bolded at the top of the page with subject lines to the effect of ""BF LEFT ME"" and ""LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB"". At that moment, she stepped back into her office, saw what I could see on her screen, and absolutely flipped out.

Now, let me just say that she was totally justified in being upset. I would be too if I found someone looking at my screen containing personal emails. Of course I apologized profusely just as I would if I had accidentally invaded anyone else's privacy. It was not my intent to know her personal business (or anyone else's), but there it was, and so I offered to help her if she truly wanted to look for employment elsewhere. She told me she was miserable and desperately wanted to work somewhere else, so I set her up with an interview at a relative's firm, coached her on interview questions, and generally tried to make up for my part in what had happened. I had an ulterior motive, of course, but I was genuine in my support.

A few weeks later, while on vacation, my boss called me in hushed excitement. Co-worker had submitted her resignation and the boss was absolutely ecstatic to be rid of her. The boss had big plans for the practice which we implemented the moment Co-worker was gone (including a promotion for me) and we've made drastic improvements to efficiency and earnings in her wake.

Exactly one year after Co-worker left our firm for another, she found herself unemployed and has been ever since. My boss  was ""not surprised in the least"". Btw, in this industry, if you are terminated from a firm and aren't hired by another within 90 days, all of your licenses are voided; you are effectively barred. Considering how awful my former Co-worker was, that she was blackmailing our boss, that she was constantly spilling the secrets of others and generally terrible at her job, I'd say it's just deserts. Good riddance."

Because it has been really hard to try and find an accounting job for only 3 maybe 4 months until I leave. Especially since I have no prior experience. My friend said that he could most likely get me a job working at his hospital until I leave, but it wouldn't be accounting work.

After I am done with the Internship I will either stay over there or come back and get my CPA while working to get into the B4 or another national firm.

Any help would be much appreciated!"

It wasn't going to be this way. I initially started at a university that I thought would be cheaper, but ended up leaving after a semester. The program that I was in for my major was a roughly slapped together piece of crap. Following up, I went to another school for a semester and then freaked out because of the debt I was loading on to my name. Went to community college for a year, and then went back to the school I was at previously. Found out after a semester that I'd be graduating in 2017 because of the way the classes I needed to complete wouldn't be offered in the order I needed them. Had a legitimate breakdown where I was so anxiety ridden that I left my internship, dropped out, and tried not to kill myself for a half a year or so.

Here I am now, close to a computer science degree, but so far away, working on getting IT certifications so I can get a job that won't make me kill myself, but i'm struggling to find a job in the middle of nowhere pennsylvania, looking to make enough money to move to pittsburgh and find a job doing IT as I'm currently working on my A+ and N+ certifications. By next year I'd like to be living with my girlfriend and a roommate or two outside of pittsburgh while she finishes up her two year program.

This is where the issues arise; I've been told I can apply for a 12 month income driven repayment plan for my direct stafford loan of $10,000.
On top of that my dad has graciously taken on a parent plus loan of approximately $25,000. They want $300/mo, but my dad can only pay $200/mo. I've looked into this and I can apply for an extended repayment plan that would bring payments down to $227/mo, so that's probably doable. My issue is with how much interest is going to accrue, and how in the hell I'm going to be able to pay back what I need to to both my dad and my own loan providers while putting enough away to get moved into an apartment in pittsburgh.

I've done some research on apartments and we've figured out with a roommate, plus my girlfriend and I, we'd have ~$300 in rent, plus utilities (we can be frugal polar bears with heat in the winter, and vampires when it comes to using lights, but I still feel like we're going to be cutting it close) which would be electricity, internet, water, and trash removal.

Another issue is I am currently driving a 1996 jeep cherokee. If anyone here has ever owned a jeep cherokee they know that gas mileage is so laughable that it can make your pockets empty very quickly. I want to try and get rid of it around tax return times on craigslist, because apparently in the middle of nowhere PA, people love off roaders. It's a solid car, the only real issue is the upholstry and by next winter it will need new tires.

If I can get rid of this, and use my dad's second car to get to and from a potential job, I feel like I can put a lot away, and maybe talk to him about buying his second car off of him in payments. I'm just terrible, absolutely horrible, with financial plans. I have no idea if they're going to work even if they seem smart in my head.

Any suggestions? I don't even know what I'm asking, I guess just for a little perspective?"

What do I do?,[deleted],servicedogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/servicedogs/comments/2rg5s8/dad_doesnt_support_esa_or_psd_what_do_i_do/,"Hey everyone, I was looking for some advice. I am in the process of finding a puppy to be my ESA and potentially long term PSDiT. I have done lots of research and this subreddit has been great, so thank you.

My mom, doctor, therapist, and most people I know that I have involved in this conversation think this is a good idea. I am 20 years old, a junior in college studying CS, with an internship already planned for this summer in CA. This overall has been good, but I have struggled throughout, and without getting into too much detail, I know getting a ESA, a dog, would be incredibly helpful for my mental health. My doctor agrees as well as my therapist, as previously mentioned. 

Yet my dad is adamant I should wait until I am ""settled"" and out of college, with a steady job, housing situation, etc. He also is concerned about me appearing disabled by having a service dog (in training) next to me, at work or elsewhere. He doesn't want anyone to be biased or discriminatory or think I'm ""crazy or a weirdo"". Frankly, my father has no understanding of mental illnesses, and I have tried endlessly to explain, but he truly is incapable of understanding it seems.

He pays for my college, and I have always taken my parents input to heart, but I don't agree with his decision on this. I understand the costs of a dog- and I work and have a sufficient income. Not enough to pay for school myself- but I would be able to support a dog in my life. I only see this as helpful and beneficial to my future movements with regards to getting a job and finishing college. I don't think it will ""distract me"" or anything like that, I think it will really improve my quality of life. I truly believe this. 

My question to you guys is, do you think it would be wise to wait a few years? Or unwise? I'd love to have one and I know it would improve life for me. But I don't want to disappoint my dad. That makes me feel quite awful. "

2rgavf,1,2015-01-05,Ongoing thoughts of divorce for years now,[deleted],Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/2rgavf/ongoing_thoughts_of_divorce_for_years_now/,"So I was a pretty immature person up until about 4 years ago.  Not horrible, but I could have done more for the family.  However, and perhaps because of my obliviousness, everything seemed fine between my wife and me.  She blamed me for not helping out enough, and I felt a little ashamed about it, but didn't really bother trying to change.

Then I lost my job and I had to crack down.  I got my shit together.  I did everything I could to keep the family afloat.  I worked part time doing 3 jobs, but I was just killing myself.  So I decided to finally go back to school and get a real degree (Accounting).  My first was in Japanese, so that wasn't doing anything for me.  So now I've been back in school for two and a half years and I have another year and a half to go considering I only take 6 credit hours per semester.  I work full time otherwise.

Anyway, shortly after I lost my job, the fighting began.  She continued to accuse me of being worthless, and I continued to feel ashamed about it.  It wasn't until two years of it that it occurred to me that I had been going above and beyond what a father and husband should do.  I wasn't that same guy and I didn't need to keep apologizing for my past actions.  We saw a counselor a few times, but my wife refused to continue to go.   She began to make absurd accusations of me like I am gay (I'm not) and that I have Aspergers (jury's still out on this one).  So, I withdrew and began avoiding her at all costs.  I didn't go out because we didn't have the money; I just avoided her within the home.  She began accusing me of not loving her, and I denied it fervently.  It took a while for me to finally admit to myself that I didn't love her anymore.  She had just pushed to much.  Admitting it to myself was a bit of a relief.   That was about a year ago.

Since then, things are not great, but the arguing almost never happens.  This is because we don't really talk.  Money is better now, so we can do things as a family, but I don't have any time except when there isn't any school like during Christmas. Anyway, I'm just so damn lonely, and I miss having someone care about me.  But I'm scared to death to leave.  Not because I'm trying to hold on to her anymore, but because we also have two little girls (5 and 8).  I love them so much and can't imagine them not in my life.  She's already told me that if we divorce, she's moving back to Japan where I'll never see them.  I doubt the likelihood of that, but I also fear risking it.  More so, and while I admit this is absurdly stupid, I feel I need to remain married just so someone is there for the girls until I graduate next May.  Basically a live in babysitter.  The situation is not ideal and I feel like a shit for requiring this of my kids and my wife.  However, I already have an internship lined up with an accounting firm this May, and the hire rate is around 90% following an internship.  My future is almost set, and I'm nearing the finish line of this career uncertainty that I've been in for the last 4 years.  I just want to make it and finally be able to provide for my kids without killing myself.  I also know that I'm playing with fire by continuing to subject my kids, my wife, and myself to marriage.  I'm not unaware, I'm just too much of a pussy to do anything about it.

I know this has been a huge wall of text, and thank you for bearing with me.  I know this has been hard on everyone.  My girls are aware things aren't great.  I'm happy we don't fight anymore, but the disrespect my wife shows me is obvious and my daughters have asked her if she hates me.  That makes me very sad.  I'm miserable, but I keep trucking for my girls.  They are everything to me, and as a kid whose parents divorced when he was 2, I just wanted to keep the family together.  I know the home isn't a good one though.  I'm rarely home, but I get home when they go to bed and I read to them, and I play with them for a couple of hours during the weekend when I'm not studying.  And these last 3 weeks during Christmas break have been great with the girls.  I've been a true father and did so much with them.  But now I'm going back to school tomorrow, so that's over.  Anyway I know my wife is in depression, and while I don't love her, I don't want her to be so unhappy either.  I'm not really asking you guys to convince me to pull the trigger; I know I should divorce.  But I admit I'm just too scared to do it yet.  She's turned me into a wimp, and I hate that too.  I just wanted to vent.  Thanks for reading my novella."

Baldwin Watch: Email Response Includes Consideration to Include Men's Issues on Website But No Promise,atheist4thecause,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2rgcpa/sen_baldwin_watch_email_response_includes/,"Thank you for taking the time to contact me.  I am glad to know that you have visited my website and appreciate your suggestion to include an option for ""Gender Equality"" or ""Men's Issues"" on the contact page. 

The list of issues is designed to create a more efficient process for constituents and for me to process the over 300,000 messages my office receives annually.  The specific topics shown reflect the more frequent topics that constituents contact me about, and I will keep your suggestion in mind as I continue to improve my website in the future.  In the meantime, please know that I intend to respond to all emails I receive through this page, even if the topic of the email does not directly match the topic selected from the drop-down menu.

If I can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact my office.

Sincerely,
 
Tammy Baldwin 
United States Senator

----------------------------------------

So that's what I got. It was completely void of any stance she has impacting men's issues, it was completely void of any information about legislation she voted for impacting men's issues, and the higher-up staffer I talked to effectively told me they will not send me this information and had no information about where I could find this information.

This is not what I asked for at all for the email. This is action I asked to be taken, but I wanted the email to include policies and stances on many issues I listed. All I was told was that she is for gender equality, and that I would need to give more specifics for more information.

But I never said gender equality broadly. I gave specific stats for specific issues and those were apparently ""confused"" in the process. They played a game of summarizing my position as gender equality and then asked me to give more specifics. When I did, they asked me to email it because the specifics could be lost over the phone.

When I brought up the issue of how the federal government could fix homelessness, I was laughed at. In fact, they don't seem to be willing to consider my specifics unless they are specific enough to actually answer the issue

I also mentioned that I had not seen Sen. Baldwin vote on any issues relating to men and boys, and I was told she can't vote on issues that aren't introduced. I mentioned that Sen. Baldwin could be the one to introduce the issues, and they admitted that to an extent, but then avoided by saying she's for gender equality (over and over and over).

They also told me Sen. Baldwin would not support anything specifically aimed at just males. When I brought up an example asking if she supports shutting down shelters for battered women, the staffer said no, of course not. When I asked why then Sen. Baldwin would not support shelters for battered men specifically, I was told Sen. Baldwin might but that there aren't any shelters for battered men. I said EXACTLY! The staffer came back with that is a state issue (which of course there are things that can be done on both the state and federal level).

They also basically complained that I had called over and over and been responded to many times, even given a phone call. I received no phone call as far as I can tell, but even if I did and there was no answer that would hardly count. And I had not been emailed previously. This was literally the first contact I received from her.

The staffer went on to make excuses for why I haven't been contacted. The same excuses I have heard over and over. But then why did she bring up that I had been contacted over and over? The staffer brought that up not me. And this seemed to be a higher-up staffer as the staffer was talking about how interns can mess up as one of her excuses.

Anyways, I just wanted to let everybody know about the email and my latest call to them about it. I am now going to be sending an email about the issue with stats and issues. If anybody has any information about Sen. Baldwin's voting on these issues or issues for women or girls that excludes men and boys, please post it. If anybody has specific issues they won't raised please let me know and I'll try to include it, but also try to give resources so I can look into the issues. Thanks."
2rgd69,0,2015-01-05,"noob question, overloading a single ethernet port possible?",michaelgg13,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/2rgd69/noob_question_overloading_a_single_ethernet_port/,"Firstly,

Hi everyone this is my first post in this sub, I am currently a Junior at SUNY Brockport with a major in Computer Information Systems. While this is not meant to be an introduction post, I figured I would still mention a little info about myself. 

With that being said, I have a comment and a question.

1. The Comment - Having finished most of my Core course requirements, I have found myself feeling like I have learned very little through my college career thus far, especially when I am surfing through posts in this sub. It is slightly discouraging, especially since the program I am enrolled in is the only public school that has an accredited program(ABET) in this great(sarcastic) state of New York. I am hoping that an internship will aid in my learning endeavors.

2. The question - Which is actually a networking related question in my home setup, I didn't feel confident that the home networking sub would help me answer appropriately. I currently subscribe to a local fiber ISP. They provided us with a Calix 836GE ONT. We have been having issues lately that their techs. have not been able to figure out. Only 1 of the 4 ethernet ports work for internet access, the other three are locked to IPTV AP's. So I have a switch connected to the single port for our network. On that switch(Basic 5 port cisco branded) I have our UniFi Long Range AP, and HomeServer. Both use a fair bit of bandwidth. The ONT gives out on a daily basis, killing both the IPTV connection and the Internet connection that require me to reboot the ONT. They replaced the ONT and the new one does the same thing. The Tech. tested the quality of the fiber connection and it was good to go. So I was wondering if the single ethernet port was possibly being overloaded, just too much data for the ONT to handle at once and it's essentially crashing.

Anyway,

Thank you for any input on my comment and question. Really looking forward to start a career in the networking/IT field in the very near future!"
2rgdj5,1,2015-01-05,I want to make sure I'm making a good decision regarding buying a used car.,Samwisely,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rgdj5/i_want_to_make_sure_im_making_a_good_decision/,"I'm a senior in college and looking to buy a used car.

Right now I'm debt free, and financially independent, apart from health insurance and my phone bill (which will be switching to me soon). I have $11,000 in the bank, with $7000 in subsidized student loans to pay. With one more semester left, it'll probably be closer to $10,000 to pay back overall, and I'll continue working (8.50/hour, 16 hours a week) during this semester.

A friend of mine has offered to sell me a '98 Golf with 90k miles for $450, that according to KBB should cost 2000 more than that. It's been checked out, the car's condition is fine, the only issues are purely cosmetic. The cheapest insurance quote I've been able to find would be $75/month, or $371 up front for six months. I plan on paying it all up front. This would be a huge help for me with my internship and a career job after graduating, not to mention everyday life.

Between buying a car, rent, tuition, and possibly switching to my own phone bill, I know I'm cutting it extremely close to not being in debt when I graduate. I really want to stay debt free, but I feel like having a car is starting to be a necessity for me, and I don't know if this will push me over or not.

Is this buying this car a good decision?"

Need advice.,[deleted],service_dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/2rgfl0/dad_doesnt_support_esa_or_psd_what_should_i_do/,"Hey everyone, I was looking for some advice. I am in the process of finding a puppy to be my ESA and potentially long term PSDiT. I have done lots of research and this subreddit has been great, so thank you.

My mom, doctor, therapist, and most people I know that I have involved in this conversation think this is a good idea. I am 20 years old, a junior in college studying CS, with an internship already planned for this summer in CA. This overall has been good, but I have struggled throughout, and without getting into too much detail, I know getting a ESA, a dog, would be incredibly helpful for my mental health. My doctor agrees as well as my therapist, as previously mentioned. 

Yet my dad is adamant I should wait until I am ""settled"" and out of college, with a steady job, housing situation, etc. He also is concerned about me appearing disabled by having a service dog (in training) next to me, at work or elsewhere. He doesn't want anyone to be biased or discriminatory or think I'm ""crazy or a weirdo"". Frankly, my father has no understanding of mental illnesses, and I have tried endlessly to explain, but he truly is incapable of understanding it seems.

He pays for my college, and I have always taken my parents input to heart, but I don't agree with his decision on this. I understand the costs of a dog- and I work and have a sufficient income. Not enough to pay for school myself- but I would be able to support a dog in my life. I only see this as helpful and beneficial to my future movements with regards to getting a job and finishing college. I don't think it will ""distract me"" or anything like that, I think it will really improve my quality of life. I truly believe this. 

My question to you guys is, do you think it would be wise to wait a few years? Or unwise? I'd love to have one and I know it would improve life for me. But I don't want to disappoint my dad. That makes me feel quite awful. "

2rh6pl,9,2015-01-05,"I [24 M] think my high functioning autistic brother [26 M] is being held back from becoming an adult by my parents. Am I wrong? If not, what can I do to help him?",newaccountbc-ofmygf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rh6pl/i_24_m_think_my_high_functioning_autistic_brother/,"So I have a 26 y/o high functioning autistic/Asperger brother (my parents, who are doctors, have used these terms in reference to my brothers condition). So my problem is not much of a current problem but more of a future problem. 

You see, my brother lives at home with my parents, goes to school and mostly plays video games and hangs with friends in his free time. He is currently working on getting his BS in computer science and is within two years of graduating. Just to give you an idea, he's been in college since he was 18 so he's pretty close to finishing. He doesn't do much beyond what I've described already.

I feel as though my parents aren't allowing my brother to learn, grow and become an independent individual. For instance, he doesn't actually pay rent and utilities to my parents, they take it out of his social security disability check for him and give him an 'allowance'. He has to ask for money for gas, eating out or fun things. My brother doesn't take care of his school planning as in what courses to take and when (our mother takes care of it). He also has no idea how to cook, do laundry or keep a regular schedule of basic hygiene (again our mother). In addition, my parents are adament that my brother not get a simple part time job because my brother would 'lose' his social security disability benefits. Also, they are very against him eventually moving outside of our hometown in (rural Texas) where there are very few jobs in computer science for him. Effectively, he does as he's told by our parents and doesn't have much say in his life's direction.

At the same time, as I've already alluded, my brother has disability benefits but at the same time, I perceive him to be a capable (but awkward) individual. I don't have all the details of my brothers condition but all I know is what I've referenced before and that ""he's a slow learner"" hence being in college for a really long time. Also, I do know that the one time he held a part time 'internship', his employer got mad at him for messing something up at work (at a laptop repair shop) and made him sit around doing nothing or menial tasks (he wasn't paid).

On the other hand, my parents are 'immigrants' who moved to the US from Latin America. My father was born and raised in a US territory which provided the US citizenship, but their culture more closely aligns to Latin America. This is relevant since I've recently discovered that most children live with their parents until they're married then finally move out (maybe 30+). Seems somewhat relevant to me but I'm not sure.

Ultimately, what this comes down to is that my parents aren't going to live forever. I feel as though they are stunting his growth as a person by not allowing him to experience life through little pieces. In the end, when they do pass away, I'm concerned that I will have to 'take care' of a 40-50 y/o adult who was never given the opportunities to learn to be an adult and it will be far too late to teach him at that point.

I want to talk to my parents and my brother but I am not sure what to say to convince them that something needs to change. I've talked to my parents about this before but more so out of curiosity than an actionable discussion.

Edit: I live far away in SoCal and only visit home for the holidays.

**tl;dr**: My brother is a little slow but I believe fully capable of being an independent adult, if my parents will start encouraging him instead of holding him back. I don't want him to miss out on the freedom independence brings, nor do I want to be stuck taking care of him when my parents die. What can I do?"

You may ask, why not go to skid row and wait in line at a homeless shelter? My answer is, yes, I will have to do that as a last resort. I don't know where to park my car since my car has all of my valuable belongings in it and I'm afraid of leaving it alone in skid row or in an unfamiliar neighbourhood. Also homeless shelters don't always guarantee you have a spot. I'm at a disadvantage because I have to be at my internship during intake hours as well.

2rhh7q,2,2015-01-06,Things aren't getting better,LittleTinyFailure,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2rhh7q/things_arent_getting_better/,"8 months ago, my boyfriend committed suicide. On top of that, I had already been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 8 years.

Since his death, I finally convinced my parents to let me go to therapy. They wouldn't take me when my counselor suggested it, nor when they got called because my friend had snitched on my suicide plans one day. No. It took me in a complete breakdown with a partially written suicide note to consider it.

But it's not helping. The partial program I went into only made things worst honestly. I couldn't be honest there or else I would be sent to inpatient, despite them saying it was their last resort. And they say you get discharged when you show enough improvement to safely be without it, but it's really just when the insurance stops covering it. They also refused to touch the subject of my boyfriend's death, despite it happening a month or two before that.

And now, I finally got a therapist I see weekly after being on the waitlist for months at the only place that takes my insurance. And he sucks. He's only a student intern, so he's still learning, but just... He's not helping. At all. And I just don't feel like me around him. I freeze up and go kinda numb, as opposed to how super emotional I feel most of the time. And I can barely remember any of the things I wanted to talk about. And I just come out in a worse state than before I went in.

And I dunno. I just feel like crap. Things should be better by now and they're not."

For the past few years, the College of Engineering has hosted a day-long event for female students like me studying in the STEM fields. Female engineers and scientists come in and talk about things that could apply to anyone, like where to look for internships or how to write a resume, and also more female-oriented topics like a Q&amp;A about stereotypes and sexism they've encountered in the workplace. This year, one of the last presenters was a woman who runs a local business that apparently coaches professionals on professional attire and business dinner etiquette. It was a weird change of pace, but I appreciated the handout she gave us about how to build a wardrobe of work attire on a budget (I still send my mom pictures of my interview outfits ahead of time, just to be safe, although more to make sure my top matches, not because I want to know if flip flops are appropriate). But then she gave us the handout I've included below, and it makes me uncomfortable. Some if it is true, if taken in individual cases: yes, undermining your colleagues to gain favor with the boss is probably a poor strategy, but the underlying assumption that all (and only) women engage in petty, jealousy-driven fights in the workplace really bothers me. What do you think?



**How Women Can Stop Sabotaging Themselves in Business**

Everyday in workplaces across America, women are inadvertantly *[sic]* sabotaging themselves. Why are smart, intelligent, educated women hurting their careers and holding themselves back? It is easy to blame sexism and politics, but oftentimes it is our behavior and perceptions that are keeping us from achieving success.
Here are some common ‘do’s and don’t's *[sic]* that many of us will recognize.

**Don’t** overreact to situations. Crying, yelling, pouting, or acting like the victim are perceived as out of control or weak.
**Do** respond appropriately by remaining calm and rational. Do adopt a positive and confidant *[sic]* business demeanor in order to gain the respect of colleagues.

**Don’t** personalize constructive criticism. Look for the message and learn from it. **Don’t** be a whiner to get your way at work. It showcases weakness rather than strength.
**Do** voice your opinions and give your input in a direct yet friendly manner.

**Don’t** undermine other women. Rivalry and jealousy are counterproductive and only hurt everyone in the long run.
**Do** work together to achieve goals. **Do** acknowledge the success of colleagues and make the workplace friendly and productive.

**Don’t** dress in poor taste and invite yourself to be a sex object. Wearing sexy, tight clothing is inappropriate in the workplace. It sends mixed messages and takes away from professionalism.
**Do** wear business attire at the office. It is always better to err on the conservative side. **Do** gain the respect of co‐workers by working hard and using your brain.

**Don’t** use your personal problems as an excuse. If you are constantly taking time off because of sick children or family problems, you will be perceived as unreliable and undependable.
**Do** have a back‐up plan for family crises. Seek help if necessary.

We all need to take responsibility for our own happiness by taking care of ourselves physically as well as spiritually. **Do** stop sabotaging yourself, you are worth it.


Edit: I guess I should clarify; I don't think any of it is bad advice, but it seems to me there is an underlying premise that these are specifically problems that women have, because obviously women are uncontrollably emotional, petty creatures who have to be told how to behave in public. I am not usually the type to get offended at every little thing but this presentation just really rubbed me the wrong way so I wanted to see if I was reading too much into it.

Also, yes, the event was aimed at women, but this is also available elsewhere (her business does not only cater to women) and the presentations about resumes were not titled ""How Women Can Stop Writing Bad Resumes"" with content like ""Don't use pink paper and clip-art of flowers."""
2rhq8a,2,2015-01-06,Haven't learned much in my last 5 months as a corporate financial analyst,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2rhq8a/havent_learned_much_in_my_last_5_months_as_a/,"Hello /r/Finance!

I'm 23, just graduated college with a degree in mathematics and economics. Landed a job as a ""Financial Analyst,"" several months ago after interning at my company for about 2-3 months. Currently working in San Jose, CA. I get paid decently for my level of experience, about $53000 before taxes. I also have benefits which are nice. However, things have been pretty rocky for me and the company over the last 5 months.  

The company I work for is going through restructuring right now with lots of layoffs and having people fill the holes left over. There was also some collateral damage as people quit after others were laid off.

I started in August as a finance intern. Identifying market segments for the marketing department, essentially looking at our end customers and labeling the respective industries that they each fell into. Then I started helping prepare forecast templates and other spreadsheets for finance, but I never really had someone explain how exactly the forecasting process worked. It was okay though, my job was pretty basic and I could get by on my own. I did this for about 2 months.

However, I eventually started reconciling accounts and posting journal entries to Oracle for cost accounting about 2 months into my internship.  The company laid off a cost accountant among a lot of other people (this was in November, the company had been planning on hiring another cost accountant within a month or two, and it just did). A woman who had a different role as a process analyst picked up a large portion of the now empty position and I helped her reconcile accounts and do some journal entries. She had some experience with cost accounting but she didn't know in detail what to do since that has never been her job. She never really trained me properly, or at all in my opinion, because of this. I essentially was given spreadsheets and figured the majority of the process out on my own, but just enough to complete tasks. I don't know accounting much more than I did when I started this specific aspect of my job 3 months ago and I have yet to be trained. I am simply good at puzzles and hammer my way through account reconciliation spreadsheets and journal entries until I think it's good enough for my boss TO CHECK my work. But, they finally hired a new cost accountant immediately after the process analyst  quit as she couldn't deal with doing almost two jobs after 5 weeks. At least I won't feel like a clueless idiot anymore with a cost accountant at work now.

A sales analyst left after layoffs too, so I started helping out with that about 3 months into my job as well. It's more straightforward than the accounting, but the head of sales operations still hasn't had time to train me properly because she is also helping to fill the gap left by the sales analyst. I do understand what I need to do to a needle point though, but I certainly don't understand what's going on underneath all of the data aside from ""these people buy our stuff in this amount for this price and it is distributed through this channel."" I just organize spreadsheets for the sales reps to look at really. A new sales analyst is supposedly going to be hired soon, but I'm not sure how soon.

I've talked to head financial analyst (right below CFO) who hired me, he wants me to do some inventory auditing at our proper branch and travel to two other places to do some inventory audits. He also assured me that he would have more for me to do in Financial Planning and Analysis since we just finished merging/acquiring another company and that I would be very valuable there.

Despite this, I'm discouraged that everyday I go to work and I really have no idea what I'm doing, I just know how to complete account reconciliation spreadsheets and sales ops spreadsheets without actually understanding what I'm working on.

I also have taken a graduate course in computer science and I've done very well in it. Definitely enjoy it more than finance. But, maybe job will get better though? It's also hard to turn down a salaried job right out of college. Maybe the company will become more stable too. 

Does anyone have advice or experience they could share with me based on what I've talked about?

Thank you for your time.

**TL;DR** I've been working at my company for 5 months and have not been properly trained to do any of the tasks that I'm doing. Boss assures me it will get better.

[At first, she stated that Adam took the high road, and had no choice](https://twitter.com/LynetteCarolla/status/552365376127127552)

[Then, she hints that all was not as it seemed on the air](https://twitter.com/LynetteCarolla/status/552367423249477632)

[Finally, she claims that Adam needed to fire Alison for ""co. moral""](https://twitter.com/LynetteCarolla/status/552372928818712578)

The confusing part is that she then later stated that Adam has a [strong moral compass](https://twitter.com/LynetteCarolla/status/552376050819559424) which further confuses whether or not Adam fired Alison for company *morale* or company **morals**.

If Alison had done something amoral, the tweets about everything being not as it seems on the air would make zero sense, so likely the ""co. moral"" was actually a reference to ""morale"".

When it comes to morale, that doesn't really pass the smell test, because Adam is the guy who openly berates Gary ""half-tard"" on air, and tells everyone to suck it up and stop complaining.  Now, if Alison were someone who was complaining and was the one who needed to suck it up, was she bringing down the company, or just Adam?

I know that many Carolla defenders will point to Adam's story about Ellen not dancing at a wedding, which ties in to Ellen being a rotten bitch off the air (the happier you seem on air, the worse you are off-air - it's the Ellen/Rosie corollary, pardon the homonym.) But, Alison never pretended to be a super-flowery person on the air - just a month or so ago, she complained about her mother's snide asides ( The ""THEN WHY DID YOU JUST SAY THAT; UGH!"" drop.) She talks openly about struggling to achieve some semblance of happy, or, failing that, a feeling of contentedness.

If she were really bad for morale, would Chris, Matt, and Gary (potentially Caelan) be joining her this Thursday? Obviously, those guys are the producers/assistants, and the ones whose ""morale"" Adam was concerned about. If it were a temp or intern, those are the ones Adam brags about not learning their names (and also claims to be his true self, turned up to 11 on the show) and calling them ""glorified goompers.""

Additionally, if Adam were really worried about morale, then why wouldn't he give Alison fair warning that her behavior was affecting the morale of the company, and allow her a chance to rectify it? I don't think she would claim to be surprised by her firing if she had even the slightest inkling that there was unrest.  After all, they *did* post a post-show selfie that she posted to facebook/instagram, and called it the last post-show selfie of 2014: https://www.facebook.com/TheAlisonRosen/photos/a.389180925373.360228.118889260373/10154982903255374/?type=1&amp;theater

[Additionally, Adam claims that the decision was because he wanted a change](https://twitter.com/adamcarolla/status/552301559003238400)

This, of course, contradicts the earlier tweet about ""co. moral"" in which Lynette states that it was NOT about a change.

I don't blame Lynette for standing by her man, but it really seems like this was fucking bungled badly.  I don't think Adam knew what kind of support Alison had (or, maybe that's why the change...) but it really seems like absolutely no reason put forth just yet passes the smell test. If she really was a leading lady, wouldn't he want to keep her podcast in house and reap some of those benefits?"

Can't find my way around, taking awhile to do simple tasks as I figure out my way in the place. A fish out of water in its purist form.*

*Currently sitting at my computer, doing menial and repetitive data entry while shuffling through paperwork in my boring corner of the room with no view. Stuck in a cubical forest.*

*You're making your rounds and have heard about my hiring, and decide to come over and introduce yourself...*

This is a simple setup to get started, many details can be worked out before starting or as it goes. 

The main thing I am looking for is a woman who is in charge, in the position of power and maybe even a bit of non-consensual until I warm up to it. 

I have a preference towards an older woman or MILF being the seducer. My age is flexible, I can be a very young intern getting school credit or I can just be a new hire, this choice I will leave to you. I generally play a 6'2"" white skinned, black hair and brown-eyed guy of average build but this is flexible as well.

Hit me up with a PM if you are interested and lets have some fun together.


* I am looking for a long term, with a nice build up but quickies are welcome too.
* I will try to keep replies long and well thought out and will match your efforts.
* I hop in and out throughout the day, so there may be delays at times.
* Turn-ons include being bossed around (light domination?), breast play, MILFs and much more.
* Turn-offs include heavy domination, scat/piss, blood, gore, death, beastiality &amp; humiliation.
* Will gladly work in any kinks you have.
* Feel free to check my prior posts for alternative starting points.

2ril67,1,2015-01-06,Post-TRP shock and how to progress,gran_helvetia,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2ril67/posttrp_shock_and_how_to_progress/,"**TL;DR - Skinny dude was fucking beta during his 4-year relationship, from 15yo until 19yo. A few months after turning 20, swallowed TRP and went into monk mode because of circumstances. Still insecure about how to proceed on the journey of self-improvement and, specially, plate spinning.**

I swallowed the RedPill in early December. It was hard to digest, and I think I’m still a bit plugged in. I did it shortly after making some crucial mistakes with a promising to-be plate, a girl that is in some classes with me. We hooked up at an university field trip and at a club some other day, both occasions the two of us were drunk. She was into me but my text “game” (if I can call it that) was lame, I presented my self as needy and over-available. She quickly lost interest. Whatever. 

So, my background. 

I just turned 20 a couple months ago. I am 5 foot 9 with an average face (not ugly at all but not stunning either), but I have always been a skinny fuck, with thin arms and small shoulders. At the moment I weigh ~136 pounds, hoping to increase that and stop my ribs from showing haha. I’ve always been a popular, outgoing guy, but I never had much success with women. I had my first gf when I was 14, we lost our virginity with one another (painful, laborious event) and shortly after I’d done the dirty work she left me for some older dude. RP slap to the face, boys. I was crushed. Anyway, after that, when I was 15, I joined a LTR (I was her fist) and we stayed together until halfway last year, yes, 4 years of LTR right in the teens. During the whole of our relationship, I was beta in so many ways, I’ve let guys disrespect and harass us or her without doing anything, I’ve been needy and cried many times, most of the times we fucked I couldn’t make her come, and I couldn’t lead her into getting more kinky in bed. Anyway, after 4 years, both of us then went overseas for 1 year college exchange, and on opposite parts of the world. She went a couple of months before, quickly adapted, made friends, and was happy. I went to a really cool city, but I didn’t make good good friends and didn’t really get along with my housemates. I was really sad for a while, I remember skyping her and telling her how I missed her and how I regretted our decision to have an open relationship while we were apart (wtf). Even as I could sense her indifference and that “I’d rather be doing something else right now” face, I still went out there and bought her a FUCKING BIRTHDAY PRESENT, mailed it to her, expecting I don’t know what. I was being a shameful, textbook beta, opening myself emotionally while she didn’t give a fuck and was probably fucking some other dude. We eventually stopped talking (Broke up). It’s in the past now.

A few months into my exchange, things changed, I made some friends and hooked up with a couple of girls, one is the same from the beginning of the post. After screwing up the possibility of having two nice plates on my table (due to BP/BB behaviour) and discovering TRP, I realised I could make good use of the fact that I have just moved to a VERY remote location to do a summer internship and have decided to enter monk mode. I still wanted to chase girls, but the fact that I’m living 60 kms from the nearest small town makes it kinda hard. Also, I am out of weed (my main vice) with no hook-up. Best thing I can do is eat well, exercise everyday and read as much as I can. Sadly I don’t have access to a gym so I’m sticking to yoga (I have been doing it for a couple of years) and jogging. Cold shower in the morning, exercise. Go to internship, work hard from 8 to 4. Get home, exercise, dinner, sleep early. No weed, no videogames, no bullshit. Leave the comfort zone. 

I’m obviously having a hard time. My difficulty is not from sustaining the “self-improvement routine”, but not breaking down to the combination of lack of marijuana, not getting laid, and constantly thinking about my ex and the sex we used to have. I know that when the internship ends and I get back to the big city I need to have my shit together, get a fucking grip and approach as much as I can. I know that eating some good pussy will fix my state of my mind and raise me to a state of happiness and fulfilment, but how do I boost that confidence while I’m still feeling shitty and insecure? I mean, I have potential, if I put on some weight (muscle) and get more tanned, I’ll get a really nice figure, I surf, dive, play a few music instruments, am a smart guy with interesting stuff to talk about, but I feel like my insecurity and social awkwardness always fuck me up around the women I’m interested in, and I don’t know what to do. Obviously get in shape and act more RP, but do you have any more advice more specific than that?

Sorry for the long whiney post guys, also if there are any mistakes, english is not my native language, but I’m not apologising for shit because I know I’m not that bad haha, all the best in 2015 for y’all, and let’s keep this community going!"

I'm working on a project to produce some continuing education podcasts with various physicians from my local healthcare system.

I was wondering if some people on here might have some questions that they would like to have answered in a podcast format.

Initially we are starting with 4 podcasts, each with a different topic and an associated physician who is a current practitioner in that topic. 

The first four topics are...
-Pre hospital pain management
-Interventional Neurology (think brain caths in acute CVA)
-Pre hospital and early management of sepsis
-Post cardiac arrest ROSC care

In the name of full disclosure, this is an internship and part of my responsibility is coming up with good questions for the physicians. I've gotten a good start on all of the topics, but I wanted to turn to some other people and see what turned up."

Since things tend to be a bit slow at the office in the immediate days following the turning of the clock, I figured I would try my best at curating a video timeline of ""behind the scenes"" content at Giant Bomb. These videos cover the guys' divergent paths since the site's creation in 2008, from the original Sausalito office to Alex and Vinny's (second) home in New York. I also tried to gather as many ""How to"" videos as I could, detailing the process behind such staples as UPF, TNT, Quick Looks, and building PCs.

Vinny's exodus back to the land of his fathers has lead to him combining forces with Alex and establishing the first *official* branch of the site, Giant Bomb East.

And I think that wraps it up. There's no doubt in my mind that I missed some great behind-the-scenes content, so if you have a suggestion then drop my a message and I will throw it in.

2rjgbz,164,2015-01-06,I staged at a 2 michelin star restaurant with zero professional experience. Heres my story for those that are interested.,KimcheeBreath,food,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2rjgbz/i_staged_at_a_2_michelin_star_restaurant_with/,"I did a 10 day stage (unpaid internship) at a fancy shmancy restaurant.  Apparently in San Francisco they will take anyone willing to work.  Its free labor for them.  I reached out to three restaurants all michelin starred and all three said to come in. 

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to keep a log of my experience for my friends and family.  There wasnt enough time in the day and I was so beat that I only updated a few times.  Still I think it provided a small glimpse into the world of someone trying to become a chef.  Being 40 I couldnt keep up with the 20 year old chefs making minimum wage working 14 hour days while a waiter might might make upward of $500 dollars a night in tips... something is wrong with this system.

&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately I decided not to pursue becoming a chef and left cooking a hobby that I much adore.  I think it was the wise choice for me.  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;



update 1:

&amp;nbsp;

While I have a free moment...


First day was tough. Not going to lie it kicked my ass. Half way through I kept thinking how am I going to do this for 2 weeks?? I don't know if all kitchens are like this but it is certainly not what I was expecting. Its eye opening just how regimented and well oiled the kitchen is.

&amp;nbsp;

Everyone scrubs. Everyone cleans. Everyone works their asses off. The difference is they all do it twice as fast as you. You start to feel inadequate and wonder if you are helping or just in the way. You wonder if you will get used to this line of work. You question your life. Sounds dramatic but how in the world are these people ok with such intense work and scrutiny while making shit pay? Will I be okay with that?

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of the first night, finger nails grey from all the cleaning, chefs coat sweaty, I am asked ""are you planning on coming back tomorrow?""


I say ""yes chef if you want me back""


Chef says ""yeah that's fine most people don't come back. Some people leave midway through their first day""

&amp;nbsp;

If i can't do this for two weeks how can i expect to do something food related for the rest of my life?
Who knows maybe by the end of two weeks i won't feel like I'm in the way. Maybe I'll feel somewhat at ease. Maybe i will start to crave the discipline and order. How often do you get yo train at a 2 Michelin star restaurant under such a well known chef?

&amp;nbsp;

And with scattered sleep and dreams i was still in the kitchen i am getting ready for day two. And with the same game plan that got me through the first day... Lets see how i feel at the end of the night.... Just make it to then.


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Update 2:


So what exactly am I doing? I'm doing an unpaid internship (called a stage in French) at Atelier Crenn.

&amp;nbsp;

The chef de cuisine is from Benu and Alinea both of which have executive chefs from the French Laundry. At Atelier Crenn he is the executive chefs right hand man and he controls the kitchen. I have a feeling his leadership style comes from his experience at these previous kitchens and it wouldn't surprise me if they share the same military-esque methods of discipline.

&amp;nbsp;

I am given a list of things to prep before service starts. Most of it is just tiring monkey work like juicing corn, seeding cumquats, and prepping herbs. All things they tell me should only take 2.5 hours... But this is a lie. From the moment you walk in you are working at a frantic pace. Not having yet built the muscle memory to perform most of these tasks I know my pace is slower than it could be but really how much slower? Apparently a lot because I am reminded throughout the day how I need to pick up the pace. If the herbs start to wilt I need to work inside the walk in fridge, if the corn splatters while juicing I need to mop the entire kitchen, if I am not finished with the cumquats everyone stays until they are done. You ever cut a cumquat perfectly in half pluck the stem and ensure every seed is removed? You ever do it for 2 hours straight and still only finish 2/3rds a case? Maybe I am just slow but seriously we are talking a huge box of tiny cumquats and enough plucking of the stems that my index fingernail starts to separate and bleed. And since I decided to take a few minutes to stop and wash the stinging citrus acid and stare at my finger I must have nothing to do so I am told to do all the dishes in front of me...again.

&amp;nbsp;

We clean a lot. So much so that all my fingernails are grey. We scrub every pot and pan until its silver. Baking pans are the worst. You ever try to scrub one that's got cooked on crap on it and it just won't go away? You have to make it go away or you get thrown two more. You are a human sander scrubbing so hard that you could scratch the paint off the car down to bare metal and the grey under your nails that isn't dirt, the kitchens spotless, its the grey stainless steel you are sanding off trapped under and permanently staining your nails.
I know I am clean at home when I'm cooking but I'm also careful and not working at a million miles an hour. As hard as I try I can't believe how much stuff falls to the floor while prepping. Most of it appears to be lint from my towels but it doesn't matter. I am a slob and need to vacuum and sweep the kitchen throughout the day all the way up until the restaurant opens.

&amp;nbsp;

And its about to open and I haven't finished my prep list. That means I haven't prepared all the items each chef needs for the night. Once the restaurant opens we are no longer in prep mode. All knives are put downstairs and its now just a matter of assembling dishes as they get ordered. and since I haven't finished its my fault if the other chefs are held behind.

&amp;nbsp;

When you start staging you receive zero training. You are expected to learn through osmosis and observation. All the nuances and code start to make sense but I have zero restaurant experience and this slows me down. Working in the kitchen isn't about knowing how to cook. Its about speed and discipline. As I am plating dozens of dishes with 12 components each at a frenzied pace I wonder if this is all worth it. I step back and look at the plate I just finished making. It looks good. Hope the person eating it thinks so too.

&amp;nbsp;

Second day was just as intense and eye opening. Still hanging in there.
Okay gotta get ready

For what it's worth, my current GPA is 3.67.

I'm seeking a summer internship in software development.  At the moment, I am most proficient with C++, and have some recent experience in Java.  I have learned and implemented several data structures and most of the popular search/sort algorithms.  I also have some experience in relational databases using MySQL and PHP.

In addition, I have several years of IT experience, which includes server setup and maintenance, firewalls, backup systems, etc.  While this does not directly relate to programming, it has helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, and provided me with experience in corporate environments.

If there are any questions, please feel free to PM me.

Thanks for reading."
2rjhcw,2,2015-01-06,Graduated last year; parents pressuring me to take on more loans. Advice?,inochiishtal,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/2rjhcw/graduated_last_year_parents_pressuring_me_to_take/,"Hi all. Apologies in advance for the long post. I am a first generation college student who went to a state school and graduated in 4.5 years. It wasn't my first choice school, but I was told not to apply to the schools I wanted to attend out-of-state, and I felt pressured into going to college in the first place (I was already coding and making websites by high school, and wanted to go into something like that). I didn’t qualify for financial aid based on the FAFSA, so we took out PLUS and unsubsidized loans. My parents didn’t pay for anything out of pocket to the school—it was all loans. They had $5000 or so in savings bonds for college collected since I was little, but most of those were cashed out with penalty for a week-long family vacation once I graduated. 

Two years into an art/robotics degree, I was pressured to change my major to business while I was in the middle of an art academy internship in another state right before my junior year. My parents basically called me up and said they weren’t taking out any more loans and may need to leave school (which ended up not being true). At the time, I liked my major and I felt crushed. Since my sophomore year, I had been working at least 2-3 jobs on campus (who only let me work 30 hrs/week max) and maxed out my credit hours, taking 20-22 credits on the quarter system and a full 18 every semester. I was stressed out, with a 3.4 gpa, but paying most, if not all, my living expenses with $100 or so every two weeks from my parents for food and gas money to visit home. By graduation, I had already called my mother several times to tell her I was miserable, that I wasn’t doing what I wanted to do and wanted to drop out. She encouraged me to stay in, find a counselor (didn’t do it, couldn’t afford it), and told me that all the money they were “paying” for my college couldn’t be wasted now.
 
Two and a half years after switching degrees, I have a boring business/operations degree I rarely use now (I’m in technology consulting) and a side business making jewelry on Etsy. As of right now, I make $68k/year and I am overpaying $1000/month between federal unsubsidized loans and a credit union loan I took out to study abroad (probably the best and most worthwhile part of my college education---it's the only reason I have the job and mentor I have now). I owe about $50,000 more on my loans before they are paid off, and I’m overpaying because I want to be debt free by the time I’m 30. My parents have $61,000 in PLUS loans to their name, and have paid interest-only and minimum payments since. They have not even touched the principal on the loan yet---all their payments have gone towards interest only. I’m already paying the principal on my loans since, so far, I’ve paid $7,000 for my loans compared to the ~$5,000 they’ve paid over several years.

I don’t love my job, but it has opened some opportunities and I’ve won a few awards in the year that I’ve worked there. After my signing bonus contract ends, I really want to take a paycut and work for a startup, start my own business, or get back into coding. I participate in Startup Weekends whenever I can and started the jewelry sideproject as a way to maintain my sanity. I just want to end the “delayed life plan” as soon as possible.

My parents currently only pay for my car insurance aside from student loans, but I'm planning on taking that over in February with the car title and everything (I'm 24, and have been driving a fully paid '93 Buick since high school; it may last me another 50k miles). Since I’m still under 25, I may have to reduce the amount of money I put towards loans to afford the ridiculous insurance payments since I was in an at-fault accident just before I graduated (which my dad paid $700 to fix himself, although I offered to pay). I recently felt pressured to rush into buying a phone plan with my boyfriend and terminating Verizon, paying my parents the termination fees (almost $200). 

In addition, I recently applied to pre-qualify for a $100k mortgage after moving every year the past 6 years, but was denied because I didn’t have enough assets and my debt-to-income ratio was high. My credit score is over 700 and I’ve paid all my bills on time, if that tells you anything. I’m worried that taking on more debt means I’ll never have a mortgage… and while my dad insists I should be responsible for their loans, he also constantly reminds me how much I’m wasting on $600-800 monthly rent payments, and suggests I should live at home “rent free” (fuck that, they’d make me pay eventually). I feel stuck, guilty, and crippled, and I’m sure I’m not the only one here.

I’m comfortable with my loan amount now and the plan I have to pay it off. I could even stomach taking on the car insurance and title costs. However, I’m adamant about not paying the $61,000 in PLUS loans under my parents’ name, and this has caused a lot of heartache, slammed doors, and yelling between us. At my lowest, I told my dad to sue me to get me to pay. I’m now strongly considering paying for a financial counselor for them, but I’m worried they’ll get upset and offended and refuse the assistance.

Reddit, do you have any advice for myself and/or my parents in this situation? There’s too much emotion behind this situation for me to make a rational decision any more, and I need some help on moving forward.

----

TLDR; I'm 24, graduated a year ago, and feel pressured to pay for the $61k of loans my parents took out for a degree I didn't really want or liked. I already overpay on my current $50k worth of loans every month, and after I take over car insurance and title next month, those student loans will be the only thing they pay for me. There's been a lot of emotionally charged arguing over who should pay my parent's $61k bill, and I need advice."

I've been accepted in the first cohort at [GoCode](http://www.gocodenow.com/), an 8 week python/django software engineering bootcamp held on a beach resort in Costa Rica.

I'm hoping the Reddit Python community could take a quick look at their [curriculum](http://www.gocodenow.com/curriculum) and let me know your thoughts.

I'm a self-taught programmer with a background in Electrical Engineering (BSc) and I'm looking to get a job as a software engineer full time. I've programmed in JavaScript and Java, but I'm attracted to the readability of Python as well as it's applications in data science.

The value I see in this bootcamp is that the focus in on software engineering fundamentals and the class size is only 12 with 3 instructors which should mean a lot of 1-on-1 mentor-ship and a faster learning curve.

My goal would be to work as a junior software engineer or intern at after the bootcamp and after building a good project portfolio/Git code base.

Do you think this is worth it and is a good route to take to get to my goal? Or maybe Reddit can share other ideas with me?!"

2rk5dz,1,2015-01-06,Lost in Career/Life. Any Advice Appreciated,HersheySquirtly,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rk5dz/lost_in_careerlife_any_advice_appreciated/,"Hey All!
Long time reader, first time poster. Let me first give you some background info:

Graduated with a bachelors in Finance in 2013. Just turned 26. Right after I graduated, I bought a house, got married, had a son (well my wife had a son...you know what I mean), and got a dog all within one year. Wife is still currently in school studying for teaching (she has about 2 years left).

I am currently a portfolio analyst for a local firm. I was an intern while I was in school and they liked me enough and hired me full-time right before I graduated. I was really motivated at the time but since you need to pass the series 65 (Investment Adviser Law Exam) to move up in this business things changed quickly. My colleagues all passed it on their first try with only studying days before the exam date. Let's just say I recently took this exam for the third time and have failed with a 66% (I'm terrible with tests to begin with plus for those that are familiar with the layout of those state qualified exams there can be two answers that seem right but all it takes is for them to add one word to make the answer wrong which is where I fail miserably). Even after spending countless hours/months (again) and sleeping in the second bedroom for a month to get adequate sleep/study time still was not sufficient enough for me to pass all for it to leave me completely embarrassed and ashamed. My job still loves the work I do but the big outlier here is that I am still making $17/hr (about the same as when I started) and with monthly expenses of ~$2,700 and I'm a failure (my view on life is less than par at the moment).

Luckily my wife started work again after being a stay at home mother for 11 months (which is great and all but we were/are $400 short every month prior). She got a job making around $8/hr at a local gym's daycare. Hopefully this will be enough for us to scrape on by.

My main concern is that I am simply lost and unhappy with my job/career all because of this test. Now that I have been here for a couple of years I have some experience under my belt but the big downside here is that I don't know what other jobs I would be even qualified for as a kid fresh out of college. The way I see it is that there are two sides to Finance; you have the investing side and you have the corporate side. In order for me to even be considered for a corporate job I would have to work at a bank as a commercial credit analyst for a couple of years making ~$12/hr to get some experience. I understand that I am most likely going to have to take a hit in my pay if I were to change jobs but are there any other options here?

Should I just tough it out and take this exam for the fourth time or should I just start looking for another job. I never knew being an adult would be so difficult...Anyways I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks for your time and have a wonderful day."
2rkczk,1,2015-01-06,[18F] Medical Bills. I think I made a huge mistake.,moneythrowawayabc,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rkczk/18f_medical_bills_i_think_i_made_a_huge_mistake/,"I've made very poor decisions, and I think its time I confess what happened and hope that it's not too late. 

This past summer (2014), I got a really nice internship on the other side of the country and I moved out to Ohio for the summer. A month or so in, a few other coworkers (all under 21) and I decided to go to Indiana for a concert.  It's a midday concert, and we started drinking early in the morning. The concert went on, and we kept drinking and then....well that's all I remember.

I woke up at the hospital a three hours later. I started freaking out. I don't remember anything. I have no idea how I got there. I talked to the nurse and they said that I was sent via ambulance. I had a BAC of .14 and they way they described it, I may have suffered a heat stroke, but I was admitted for alcohol poisoning.

It a series of bad decisions, I got the hell out of there. I called my coworkers, who were freaking out, told them to come pick me up. I told the doctor who was in charge of me to discharge me ASAP and got out, fast. I was in the ER for a total of 3 hours. 

A couple weeks later, the bill came. It's thousands of dollars. I...(please don't hate me)....ignored it. Another one came, I ignored it. So here is the thing, they have my old temporary address, my name, my phone number and that's it. They don't have my SSN. 

There was no forwarding address setup at that apartment in Ohio. If they have been sending me letters, it's been going to a null mailbox and probably being discarded( it wasn't in a good apartment housing). I haven't heard from them at all since I moved out.

I never told my parents. I have insurance, but it's through their work. I come from a very strict, religious, no alcohol family and telling them that I was in the hospital for alcohol intoxication is going to get me kicked out of the house. Like, it's almost a no option for me :(

Is there a way that I use that insurance without them knowing? Can I still do that since it's so long ago? Have I destroyed by credit score at 18? Can I go to jail? Would they still be able to trace it back to me? Any recommendations?"

2rkjlq,0,2015-01-06,"I think I goof'd and I'm not sure what to do (long post, sorry not sorry)",fratgadz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rkjlq/i_think_i_goofd_and_im_not_sure_what_to_do_long/,"I've been working in a field almost wholly unrelated to my degrees (working IT at a high school, BA, 2/3 of MFA in English Ed.) for the last two years. My principal (ie, my boss) seems resistant to offer me another position, as keeping people worth their salt in my position is difficult (before me, the position was salaried at triple what I make).  


I currently am the sole IT for a school of 4500 users, 2500+ computers, and everything that plugs in to a wall is seemingly my domain. I am also the makeshift testing coordinator (which I've received no training for, nor technically supposed to do because of said lack of training), as well as quartermaster for everything on the site (approx. $8m worth of equipment, ranging from computers to farm equipment to the footballs used during games).  The cherry on top?  I make $11 an hour, albeit full time with benefits - after all the time off (3 months during the summer, spring break, etc) I make $18k a year.  I would like to note that the previous person in this position made $60k a year plus a supplement for maintaining the inventory.  The county 'eliminated' that position and brought in low wage workers in its place.  Most of my peers sit on reddit all day (hence the throw away account here, sorry again, not sorry again) and are only bothered when a tech request comes up.  


I stuck with it, because I've been working since I was 12 (30 now), and the promise of getting in to the education field based on my hard work seemed very satisfying.  But the promises have all but stopped and my admins seem happy to keep me where I am.  (I'm an idiot.)


But as stated, I am not.  I scheduled a meeting with my P and it went as expected, ""Oh, if something comes up...""  


Fast forward to the second week of December.  I schedule a meeting with the top of the food chain of my division (not necessarily over my P's head, there's no authority in one domain or the other) someone who has given me accolades for the work I'd done in the last two years at the site,  and presented them with an ultimatum:  Get me in to another school (in the same role) or I would be seeking employment elsewhere. 


I further explained to them my situation at my site, and how peers at other sites don't have nearly the same level of expectations that I have.  The level of unprofessionalism they came back at me with floored me. 


It's all quite a blur what was actually said, but suffice to say it was along the lines of ""better you than me,"" and ""[school] will still be there, even if you're not,"" and finally they offered to help me get in to another site provided I stayed throughout the rest of the school year (about 6 months time).  


I left the meeting feeling uneasy and perplexed on what to do.  If I leave now, I will most definitely get burned in the county (meaning, no IT job or otherwise), but truth be told I'm not entirely sure I want to continue into education anymore after what I've seen in the last couple of years. 


On the other hand, if I stick it out for the six months (the harder months of the job, audit and testing seasons), I fear I will not be renewed at my current site, let alone elsewhere, because of the meeting with the big boss. 


All in all, I just feel like I'm being used and there's not much I can do besides quit.  I've been looking for other employment for the last few months, but I've come up short.  I live in an urban area with high unemployment rates, and the only advice I've received from people I trust has been ""it's a job, you should be happy you have one at all.""  


I'm paying the bills and that's about it.  My savings aren't depleting, but they're not growing anymore.  And I haven't touched the principal on my student loans ($40k, mostly my grad coursework)


My first outlook on the job was a paid internship.  I've soaked up as many skills as I can over the last two years.  But I'm hitting a roadblock in my job search - even the lowest positions, understandably seem to want various certifications or degrees.  Even further, most are part time, or have extreme qualification standards (one gig I actually interviewed for turned out to be 15 hours a week at $12 an hour, that required 4-5 years IT experience).  


I have enrolled back in school to pursue these desired credentials, but that is by no means a short term solution.  I should note that my first semester is paid for by savings, but the following will likely be financed.  


If you've stuck with me this far, thank you.  And if you skipped to the tldr, thanks to you, too.  



**tl;dr:  I've quit better jobs than what I am doing now, and yet I can't really find another position because I'm not certifiably certified to do IT in the private sector, and what I am certified for, my current job is the only place I can get employed in my area. I presented my boss with an ultimatum and they basically told me to get bent.**

What do I do?  I'd rather not go back to waiting tables or managing fast food... but I'm not sure what more to do.  "
2rkjuc,0,2015-01-06,Don't really know how to budget -- starting grad school in the fall,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rkjuc/dont_really_know_how_to_budget_starting_grad/,"22F here learning how to adult! TL;DR hopefully attending graduate school in the fall, how can I do it as smartly as possible so I'm not buried in debt?

Thanks to my parents, I attended an awesome college and graduated June 2014 with a BS. They paid around $250,000 and the only debt I am in is $3,500 in a Perkins loan. I worked an intern last summer making mediocre money but also had to drive across the country to do it, and basically barely broke even with the money they gave me. I also bought a new car (sounds ridiculous, but I needed a reliable vehicle to drive round trip Colorado to Maine and then you basically have to have a car to live in CO, so it is what it is.) That payment is $400 a month ($360 for vehicle, plus my dad talked me into an additional $40 for bumper-to-bumper maintenance plan). My dad is currently paying my insurance for me, and I'm covered under their health insurance too.

My dad cosigned the loan and agreed to help me out with payments if shit got rough enough.) Since then, I moved home and was unemployed for 2 months, effectively burned through the rest of my (small) savings from undergrad working money that my parents let me keep. I got a job that I'm at currently making $17.50 an hour, full time. My commute is about a 25 min drive. I have only been working about 2.5 months at this job as well, so I haven't been able to save any money.

The professor I'm working for has pushed me to pursue a Masters degree, and he just happens to be one of the chairs, I'm thinking my chance of admission is good enough though my GRE scores are shit, so *I am assuming admission for Fall 2015*. Since I am still technically a resident, I will get in-state tuition, thankfully.

So, onto my question. I currently have about $1,700 in the bank. I also have a $22,000 car loan + the Perkins loan, making my net worth a whopping -$23,800. My dad is willing to pay my car payments while I am in school, however/thankjesus.

FROM JANUARY 2015-AUGUST 2015

I am making approximately $2,200 a month. I have my $400 car payment, $450 in rent. I spend about $300 a month on food. Maybe $100-$125 on gas. Since it's only been 2.5 months at this job, my extra money has been going to xmas presents, fun, and furnishings. In other words, I can't say for sure where the other cash has really gone. My concern is trying to save as much money as possible before August. I've negotiated a rent drop to $350 (paid to my boyfriend, who owns his house). 

AUGUST 2015-MAY 2017

The school website estimates my tuition will be around $11,000 a year, plus $700 for books and supplies, plus $4,000 of ""other educational costs (da fuq?). I will be taking out student loans to cover these costs. I cannot keep working full time obviously, but my professor has said that he will most likely be able to keep me on as a student hourly worker. I have no idea what he could pay me, but let's say for argument it's $10 an hour, 20 hours a week, so bringing in around $800 a month before taxes. 

I'm guessing getting another part time job is advisable here, if so, how much money should I be attempting to make a month? Is it only possible to take out student loans for tuition? Should I expect to graduate completely broke? Others who have attended graduate school, what do you recommend for budgeting and saving? How much is recommended to have saved before beginning graduate school?

I'm completely aware of the veil that I've been living behind up until now, so I'm really hoping someone can give me a little perspective and tell me how to budget for the next two years. I have a high quality of living currently, and while I'm willing to sacrifice things, I'm not even sure in what areas and how to go about it. Thanks for any advice!

But he doesn't think anything more of it.  He rushes out to the nearest sporting store and purchases a bucket and fills it up with green golf balls.  He hurries back to the hospital where he places the bucket next to his son's bed.  The next day the boy is alive and well, then shortly released and goes back to college.  He works very hard during his time there and decides to go into Law.  He is now working as an intern at a prestigous law office in downtown Chicago,  His parents come to visit him one weekend where he shows them the great work he is doing and how close he is to becoming a lawyer.  After all this his parents set him down and explain to him how they have been living all these years in misery and how they must get this divorce.  The son says he understands and they go back to his apartment.  The next day the boy is very sick and he is rushed to the hospital.  The doctor is reviewing his charts and the new tests and said to the parents, ""I'm afraid there is nothing we can do for you son, he is going to die.""  The father goes in and asks his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son's responese, ""I want I wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.""  The father rushes out and gets for his son this wheelbarrow full of green golf balls.  He rolls up next to the bed and the next day the son is alive and well.  He goes home and continues his work as an attorney.  During this time he meets a beautiful young woman who he decides that he will marry.  On the night of the rehearsal dinner everything is perfect. His parents come up to him and father says, ""I see how much you love your fiance and those words mean so much to your mother and me. However, we no longer feel that way towards one another and we are going to get divorced."" The son tells his parents that he understands and they go back to the hotel rooms.  Overnight the son becomes very sick.  They rush him to the hospital where the doctor comes up to the family and expresses his opinion and sorrow for their son's condition.  He tells them he doesn't feel he will make it this time.  The father goes into the room and asks his son, ""What can I get you befor you pass away?""  The son says to his father, ""I want one truckload of green golf balls."" The father asks his friend to borrow his pick up truck and rushes out and fills it to the brim with green golf balls.  He parks outside the window where his son can see the truck and its load of green golf balls.  The son looks out his window and lays back down.  The next day the son is well and alive and the wedding goes on.  Years have passed, the son has children, and the parents are in their twilight years.  They come to visit their son and grandchildren.  While on the porch the father says to the son, ""You have a wonderful life with your own family and career now.  Your mother and I aren't going to be around much longer and we don't want to live our lives in misery. We MUST get divorced so we can be happy in these remaining years.""  The son says he understands and they all go in and head to bed.  The next day the son is very ill.  He is rushed to the hospital.  The doctor reviews all his records from the first incident to the last and says to the family, ""I'm sorry but he isn't going to make it.  I don't care how many green golf balls this man gets.""  So, the father goes and says to his son, ""What can I get you before you pass away?""  The son responds with, ""I want two truck loads of  green golf balls.""  The father rushes out and rents to huge semis and fills them both with green golf balls from the tri-state area.  He brings the trucks back to the hospital where he parks them for the son to see.  He raises his head and lays back down. The next day the son is no better.  Everyone is crying and the father goes and asks his son, ""Before you go I need to know why all these years did you want green golf balls?""  The son raises his head and says to his father,""Because, because, because....."" and then he dies.  --- You have now read the green golf ball joke and your time doing so belongs to me!! "
2rkt6l,2,2015-01-06,[M4F] A mockery,lookbehindyou7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2rkt6l/m4f_a_mockery/,"""This is not going to go well"" he thought as he sighed and pulled on his little blue speedo. It had been 10 months since Jack finished college and despite multiple internships and high grades he hadn't been able to land one job. Maybe it was that he wasn't the best interviewee? He often got nervous talking to people, particularly those with authority, and no matter how many times he practiced typical responses in the mirror, or dreamt up ""witty"" replies, he always stumbled when it came down to it. 

His parents had given him notice no more searching for office jobs, he needed something and he needed it now or he would have to hope that his friends were charitable and had open couches. So over the past week he had scoured his beachside home city looking for work. He had applied to multiple restaurants including the little taco shack down on Sepulveda that had so many health code violations over the years the owner must have been giving gold bullion to any inspectors that came around. He hit up a few car dealerships even though he knew that he couldn't bring himself to be greasy enough to pull of that job even if he did have the people skills, a vacant janitorial position at his old middle school, a variety of retail shops, and the Post Office even though it seem liked USPS was jettisoning employees rather than hiring them. 

Last Saturday a friend texted him with a tip saying The Lexington, a hotel in the area was hiring for some pool related position. Jack, was intrigued, getting paid to hang out by a pool seemed like a dream position, and it was March so he'd have months of work before tourist season ended! He hopped in his old hand me down Corolla, and sped to the hotel, hoping that making an inquiry in person would be more impressive than a call or an e-mail from some faceless person.

He found out there was indeed a position available, and the hiring manager was willing to hire him on the spot. To his slight chagrin he wasn't going to be able to just lounge around all day behind an outside desk, or occasionally clean the pools. He would be for routine pool sanitation, and keep the pool area neat and tidy, but his main occupation was as the bar waiter and go-for for the hotel guests at the pool. Any reasonable request he could carry out he was to obey. Overall, Jack was just happy to be employed, that was until he saw the uniform.

Jack had an embarrassing secret, he let his friends he trusted know, and they assured him that he was just blowing the issue out of proportion. He wanted to find comfort in his words, but there wasn't any there to relieve the anxiety that had caused him to torpedo a number of chances he had had with attractive women in college. Jack's penis was smaller than average, and the knowledge plagued him daily. 

Now, here he was on his first day about to go out, and expose the secret he had tried to keep to the few women unfortunate enough to sleep with him and his friends. ""Well, at least they're just tourists, and you'll probably never see them again"" as he pushed open the door of the poolhouse employee bathroom and walked outside"".

--------------------------------------------------

**What Happens Next?**

I'm open to varying scenarios, I'm looking for penis humiliation, it can actually be tiny, it can actually be average sized and I'm so far inside my head that reality is irrelevant. Perhaps the pool area is pretty empty and there is a young bratty woman or an older demanding woman who is never satisfied with service or a group of either. Maybe the woman/en first find Jack appealing and tease him to see if he'll become aroused, and then when he does they are are disappointed, or just want to break him down and the laughter, mind fuck, and toying begins.

Another possible scenario is Jack is packing up the pool area, as it has closed, and finds some bikini bottoms left behind for some odd reason and decides to keep them or sniffs them and is caught and called out by the owner.

*Kinks*: Femdom, humiliation (not to an extreme), facesitting, body worship, teasing, edging, denial (to a point), handjobs, jerk instruction, anal (giving), non-con (both ways), women that love cum, panty sniffing/licking.

*Not into*: Incest, scat, blood, no minors  

*Other Stuff*: I'd like some build up but I'm not looking for a multi-day RP. I can be a switch and be dominant if you'd like, I kind of like rough sex, choking, and humiliation. If there is something you are into that I didn't mention ask, I like to think I'm open minded. If you want to play a celebrity I'm for it, one actress that I really like and recently discovered is Lorenza Izzo, oy. I'm not the fastest typer, and I'm new to RPing.

I hope this sparks some interest, or at least some fun fantasies! It's never too late to reply.

General Disclaimer: If you are interested in responding please know I'm not interested in RPing/chatting with people that are in a relationship where their partner is unaware of their extra activities. Also I understand some people sometimes like to pretend to be the opposite sex, I totally respect that but as silly as it may sound I only prefer to play/chat with females. I'm not asking for proof of any sort. Also I don't wish to play with anyone under the actual age of 18. None of this is meant to offend in any way and I hope it doesn't, these are just things I'd prefer to avoid."
2rkxqm,1,2015-01-06,Meaningless [1109],[deleted],ShortStoriesCritique,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStoriesCritique/comments/2rkxqm/meaningless_1109/,"The sharp tones of his alarm clock pierced the curtain of his sleep. Just like every morning, they cut his dreams short – the dreams, the closest thing to happiness he ever felt. He got out of bed, his body slightly shocked by the cold. He walked to the bathroom, each step waking him up more and more – and dragging him further and further from his dreams, from comfort. 
As he slipped his contacts onto his eyes, he contemplated, for the thousandth time, how meaningless it was. How meaningless it all was. He skipped shaving that day, and got dressed. He tied his meaningless tie, and drove to the bank, sipping meaningless coffee. 
He parked his car in his ‘special’ employee’s parking spot. He remembered days, long ago, when he was merely an intern. There were days where he would sit in is car for several minutes, in a hopeless kind of coma, just wondering why he had to be the way he was. He would sit there and contemplate life and find nothing. 
But today he went right in. He still felt as though he was in an emotional coma, but he tried not to waste time thinking about it. Every day was the same now. He would wake up, go to work, and return home. He filled his car with gas on Tuesdays and Fridays and he would go grocery shopping Wednesday and again on Sunday.
It was a routine. He should have found it appealing, a constant same-ness all throughout life. There was nothing to worry about since there was no change, no movement, no friction. He should have been happy.
But as he walked into his office, he knew he was nothing but happy. This was not a new revelation, he had known it for years. He couldn’t grasp the meaninglessness of life. He gazed into his computer screen. No emails. He compiled some graphs. Input some numbers. Meaningless work. He ate lunch in his cubicle. At 5:00, just like every day, he shut off his computer and faced the door, still in his chair.
He always waited fifteen minutes to leave the office. He hated talking to his fellow employees, so he just waited for them to leave. He used to call these people his ‘friends’. They had a passion for basketball, and when he was younger they would often invite him to play. He would always refuse, knowing he would just make a fool out of himself. He would still eat lunch with them, though, and would sometimes talk with them at the coffee machine. But he was never a part of anything they did outside of work. They called him a buzzkill. They said he brought the mood down. They said he was difficult to talk to. 
So he started eating lunch alone. He did all in his power to avoid these people. A small part of him wanted to go out and talk to them, to socialize. But what would be the point of that? It would serve no purpose. There was no logical point in socializing. 
That was something he had realized when he broke off from his ‘friends’. There is no logical point. He used it to justify anything. Why didn’t he want to go play basketball? There was no point. Why didn’t he even try to get a girlfriend? He knew he was going to fail, so why bother trying? There was no point. It was a sensible argument that couldn’t really be refuted.
But there was one fact he just couldn’t grasp. Life. Why live if life was so meaningless? There was an answer. He knew there was an answer and for many years he wouldn’t say it, wouldn’t even think it, until finally, as he was lying in bed one hopeless night, he said it. 
“There is no point in living.”
He didn’t feel any better after saying it. It didn’t inspire him to do anything. It didn’t give his life meaning. He felt worse. His life was even less meaningful. But at least he had accepted the truth. 
Many days, he would lie in bed awake and think of the pistol in his closet. He knew that at any moment he could dig it out, cock it and end his life. There was no reason to live. There was no reason not to kill himself. He didn’t do it and he had no idea why. He was just too cowardly. 
He stopped for gas on the way home. A beautiful woman was pumping gas across from him. A younger version of himself would have wanted to talk to her. He now knew there was no point. The younger version would have been too scared anyway. 
When he was 15, he desperately wanted a girlfriend. He never had one. He was homeschooled and then went to an all-male high school. He had no opportunity to meet girls. Eventually he gave up on that hope. He would have settled for just a girl just to be friends with. He didn’t even get that. He struggled with it for months, then he realized: there was no point.
He knew he would never get a girlfriend. Therefore, there was no point in hoping for one or trying to find one. He realized this and accepted it. But there was still a lingering desire he could never rid himself of. He knew it was just stupid lust but could never quite shake it off.
As he pulled into the driveway, he noticed a large amount of cars in the neighbor’s driveway, and loud music coming from the inside. He didn’t understand why people had parties. Part of it was because he had never been to one. When he was a teenager he was never invited to a party, and he knew there was no point anyway. 
But from what he knew about parties, was that most of the people that went to them had one thing he could never find: happiness. He did not remember any point in his life when he had been happy. He feigned it when he was with other people. But happiness always eluded him. 
He opened the door. As it shut, he made a decision. He knew that it was finally time to change things for the better. He walked to his closet and took a shoebox off the top shelf. There was a small pistol in it. He knew it was loaded, he checked it almost every day. 
But today he didn’t check. He cocked it, turned off the safety, put it to his head and pulled the trigger.
And he felt no more pain.

Anyway I'll cut to the chase. I'm a Junior and plan on applying next year to the Engineering School to get a BS in software engineering/computer science. I currently have a 4.319 Gpa (But I'm ranked 22 in my class of ~300). Counting this year I have taken five APs, next year I will take another five bringing my total when I apply to ten. I'm working on my SAT scores but my goal is a 2000 (which doesn't seem unreasonable to me at the moment). I'm in four clubs (president of one), and two honor societies. I have my 140+ volunteer hours and this year if I'm lucky I'll be doing an engineering internship. To top it all off my two siblings were accepted and graduated in '10 and '11. I'm worried though because it seems I'll finish with a B in my 3 APs (Calculus, US History, and English). 

Of course nothing is certain but based on your experience and your credentials when you applied do you think I'll make it? Be honest. "

2rld1g,10,2015-01-06,[Support Only] I feel like a total failure and it gets worse with each passing day. I feel so empty.,ScaredofFailing_,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2rld1g/support_only_i_feel_like_a_total_failure_and_it/,"[Light]: 

I'm about to start my last semester of law school. I don't want to risk anyone figuring out who I am somehow by the content of the post or the school, but it's in the Northeast US. The area is very competitive for law, generally, which adds to my stress level but I knew that going in and accept that as ""part of the profession."" More generally, I just feel like a failure. I sort of ended up in law school by accident but academically, I've done relatively well. By the looks of things, I'll be graduating in the top 10% of my class or at worst, in the 11th. I've made numerous close friends and met some great people, both on the school's staff and outside it in the professional sense. While I didn't do much extra-curricular wise, I dipped my toes in a few hands-on experiences (internships and the like) and legal professionals I regularly speak to insist I have a ""bright future and will be just fine."" All of my friends and family are so proud of me; at least they say they are. It's so impressive to them that I went to law school and do well. They insist I'm smart and will be so successful.

I agree with absolutely none of this. I don't think I'm stupid but I don't think I'm smarter than most, either. I don't like to put myself above other people like that. It makes me feel like a jerk. I don't feel successful. I feel like a loser. 4 years of college, some time off just working, and now nearly 3 years of law school and for what? I'm financially destroyed from school, I don't have a job lined up, I don't have any sensible achievements to show for my 26 years of life other than school. And school means nothing, in my opinion, unless it secures a future for me. As of right now, my future looks like staying at home with my parents and being broke. So many of my friends (who I am absolutely thrilled for, really) are getting married, buying homes, and have amazing jobs. Two in particular, one of whom is constantly touting about with their achievements and successes. I am happy for my friends. But it's really hard to have that thrown in your face all the time. And I've mentioned on numerous occasions how difficult things are for me financially and how I feel, but the behavior continues. I know it isn't on purpose. But it just makes me feel even worse to be around that. So much success (on college alone, as it were; no professional school). And here I am with nothing, nearly finished with 3 additional years of school. I feel like such a disappointment to myself and my family. I can't help but think many of the people showing me support are only doing so to be nice. In the back of their minds, maybe they feel the same way about me as I do. Being in this situation kills me inside and I feel like it's my own doing and my own fault. Especially the financial aspect. Not being able to buy gifts for birthdays and holidays, or having to do so to a substantially lesser extent. It legitimately makes me feel like crying because I feel so inadequate as a person when I can't do something as small as getting someone a gift I want to get them. Or taking a friend out for an occasion. I'm 26. Fucking 26 and I can't even do small things like that. Members of my immediate family are always sending me money randomly or paying for expenses I incur outside of school costs. I know they want to help and I appreciate it. But I feel terrible taking it. I try to put it aside and not spend it on anything. Sometimes I have to. But I hate it. I hate taking what feels like handouts. I hate that I can't do things for myself. I hate that my family feels bad enough to help like that. I don't want to be a burden like that. I should be doing things for them. 

I never thought I'd be the depressed person in the group faking a smile or pretending to be happy. Things have always been tough for me internally. I'm not an optimistic person and I prefer the ""realist"" route in most situations. But smiles used to be genuine. Happy sentiments, when expressed, used to be genuine. None of it is anymore. I've found myself faking happiness and excitement so often that I've nearly convinced myself of it half the time, only to realize shortly after that it's a gigantic lie. I find myself doing more and more nice things for strangers both out of desire to do so ""just because"" (I've always been like that, even before feeling this way) and what I believe is an internal attempt to make others happy because I cannot seem to do it for myself.

I am not suicidal, in case anyone reading this is concerned. It's never crossed my mind. I am just so, so sad about everything. I really appreciate any advice or stories any of you would like to share if you went through something similar or simply have a suggestion on how to deal with feeling like this. At the very least, thank you for reading. "

I love her a lot, but things were just not right with us for now. I hope someday that we can be together but we know it cannot be now.

Basically she lives in a big city and her dad is big in the financial industry there. I studied finance in college and have talked to him about my interests in moving to their city to get a job and be with her. He helped me out a TON. He basically handed me a great internship and introduced me to many of his friends that are very respected there. They let me live in there house for a few weeks, and had me over for dinner all the time. I loved her family and appreciate everything that they did for me. 

After graduation, I ended up not being able to get a full time job in my gas city, so I took a job in my smaller hometown. We ended up fighting a lot and seemed like we both had personal issues that were effecting our relationship severely (we were both way to depended on each other for happiness). Our break up was the hardest thing I have ever gone through, but after 8 weeks or so I think its best for now. 

I just want her dad and family to know that I loved her so much and I wish it could have worked better with us, and that I appreciate everything that they did so much. She was pretty sad and depressed towards the end of our relationship (as was I), and I am sure her family noticed. I don't want them to think i used her for her dads connections or anything like that. I have thought about calling her dad and basically telling him I wish it could have worked but I want you to know that I appreciate everything you did for me. Would that be okay? What else could i do?

2rlo8k,5,2015-01-07,It's been 48 days since I quit Facebook.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2rlo8k/its_been_48_days_since_i_quit_facebook/,"*It's been 48 days since I quit Facebook. I don't know when I'll go back.*

People look at me as if I'm crazy when they ask if they can add me on Facebook, and I respond that I don't have one... that I went inactive from Facebook about a month and a half ago. 48 days ago, to be exact.

It's kind of crazy. Before this, I lasted only a week at most before I would sign in again, reactivating my account. Sometimes, I would block Facebook in an attempt to be productive, but always, unless I had my account inactivated, I would be back scrolling through my newfeed within a couple of hours. I tried leaving my account up and just not checking in as often, but that didn't work. I'd still find myself peeking at my feed inbetween classes, or even first thing in the morning. Inactivation and quitting cold turkey were the only things that worked.

If someone asks why I stopped using Facebook, I'll likely lie. 

""It's too distracting.""

In reality... It became too difficult, too painful to see other people happy. I know people only post their happiest moments on Facebook, but somehow, that fact never really consoled me. Hell, at least they had happy things to post about in the first place. I would spend valuable moments of time, just endlessly scrolling through my newsfeed, watching others' seemingly perfect lives behind a digital screen, feeling shittier and shittier about my own life in the process.

This person got an internship. That person got hired at a big company. This person got into a prestigious graduate program. That person got a 4.0 this semester. It felt like everyone was getting somewhere. Everyone was accomplishing things and becoming successful. Everyone had a purpose in life. They had found meaning in living, in waking up each day.

Everyone except for me.

I should be happy for others, right? Except I'm not. I'm just bitter, depressed, and seeing other people's lives going so well only serves to make me feel worse about my own. 

I know I *should* get back on Facebook soon because of the connections. But I honestly think for me, quitting Facebook has improved my mental health, if only just a little.

*It's been 48 days since I quit Facebook. I don't know ~~when~~ IF I'll go back.*

Instead of moping around my parents house for another two months, I am going to the board to get my license sorted out, I'll walk if I have to (10 hour drive).
Instead of obsessing and getting depressed, I wrote off the girl. (Her loss) I am not angry, in fact I should be thanking her. She is the reason I started no fap. There are other women out there and I set up a date to get a drink with another girl I used to work with.
As for regret, I am still having ruminations but now I focus on the future and in a few years I will be who I want to be. (Motorcycle trip around the US this summer, world travel, martial arts and bass guitar playing to come, complete with tattoos!)
I have found a decent paying intern position in my field that will hire me if I don't get my license and will give me a chance to live on my own for a while.
Every symptom and setback I meet makes me take a colder shower than yesterday, run longer than last week, lift one more rep than the last set, talk to the girls even though I don't know what to say and it comes out unsure and stuttered.
The last ten years of PMO have done nothing but place stumbling blocks and walls in my life.
My spirit is a drill."

Just started my intern and I have not touched android development before. Boss has requested me to build a news app with the flipping effect like in Flipboard.

Just asking, how long does it take to build an app like that? I have some experience in coding in Java but none in Android.

Oh and, any tips on how to get the effect? Also is it recommended to use Eclipse w/ ADT or Android Studio?"
2rm5lc,0,2015-01-07,"Caught between a gym and a billing agency, keep getting palmed off (AU)",_____---_--_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2rm5lc/caught_between_a_gym_and_a_billing_agency_keep/,"In mid-late September I left my part-time job to do an poorly paid internship for three months at my University. If it helps I am a 20 year old male.

With the lack of funds I decided to cancel my month-to-month gym membership. I spoke to a girl at the reception and she took my gym card and name down, and told me she'd speak to her manager who would call me.

No call came and no bill came the next month, so I figured it was done and dusted. Two months later however, I received a call from the billing agency who were very polite about it all. They told me I had an outstanding balance of two months and to contact the gym if I wanted it reversed.

So I spoke to a guy who works at the gym over the phone, and he told me I would need to pay the bill before they could reverse it. I was already in the car for a Christmas camping trip that lasted a week. When I came home I had accrued a total of $70 in late fees (totalling to $180~ with the bills for the two months). Then Christmas came and my younger sister had a stroke, she's stable now but it really threw me out of whack. So my family and I have been a bit frantic lately too.

At this stage, I've run out of the food/rent/bills money and I had to borrow money from my Mother the other week just to make ends meet, and I have another three weeks before I go back to my part-time job. The billing agency is telling me to talk to the gym and the manager of the gym is telling me to ""pay it so they can reverse it"". I'm not sure they will be able to reverse the late fees either?

On top of the family problem, I feel like this is going to be a much longer January than I had hoped for. /r/personalfinance, what can I do?"
2rm7uo,13,2015-01-07,How to prepare for when parents disown me?,theyoungonee,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2rm7uo/how_to_prepare_for_when_parents_disown_me/,"To start things off, 19 here, living with bio-dad and stepmom, back and forth with bio-mom too (bio-dad and stepmom hate bio-mom an vice versa). Also in the closet.

Whole family is horrendously emotionally abusive, massively homophobic (support jailing and euthanizing gays). Stepmom destroys my property (in a gas lighting way), bio-mom steals money (guilts me into continuing to give her more, also stole my identity and committed fraud which I cleaned up from my reports thankfully), bio-dad on a daily basis argues with me and just drains me of all my energy.

It's been a very very difficult ride to say the least on trying to make something of myself. Even the basic things a lot of young adults have as milestones, took a huge amount of hard work for me to achieve. Currently at community college, and have a 4.0. Recently drained my savings for dental work I pay out of pocket, hopefully will slowly recoup this with some of my (very thankful for) financial aid money, as well as part-time paid internship I got. Bio-mom has no intentions of paying me back (in the tune of almost $3000), but has access to one of my checking accounts that she regularly overdraws from and guilts me into not closing the account (I have a private one for paychecks and stuff though).

The things I'm most afraid of is just how long I can keep this up. I really need to move out eventually, but I don't know if I'm mentally prepared enough to keep up my grades in school, keep going to work (which I have to dress professionally for, very difficult to do when your stepmom bleaches your clothes, and throws the rest away to spite you, and no I can't lock my room or complain or my dad will hound me), and just keep myself motivated. I feel my depression (which I try hard to stabilize) just keeps creeping back up. I can't exactly afford consistent therapy right now either.

My dad does pay for my car and insurance though, the lease is on both our names. To what extent am I liable if he decides to stop paying? In that scenario can I call the company and ask them to use my payment info instead so I can at least continue to make payments without my father interfering (stop paying, or removing my payment info to intentionally cause missed payments) and causing the missed payments to affect my credit? What about insurance payments, and any other misc costs associated? 

Also how would I go about changing my addresses to a friends address or PO box without raising a bunch of red flags with credit card companies and whatnot that all require various verification methods that I would not be able to provide (like utility statements). I tried to do this one time with the USPS but it sent a confirmation letter to my dads address which fucked everything up because it made him suspicious tipping him off, since he likes to open my mail (and hide it for long periods of time). Also my phone is paid by my dad, how could I make sure I can transfer my number/contract into a new service account under my own name so he doesn't disconnect it.

I just want to be happy. I see other kids my age living their lives stress free and I just look at myself in the mirror and the list of issues feels like it just piles up. I've been there where the weight of it all got too much and I crashed and I let my life go to shit, I've been on a better road now even though things got harder, and it just feels exhausting. Even if I do get good grades, and then transfer, there is no guarantee I will be able to keep that up when the requirements get harder and harder. And those kids with better access to resources will excel, compared to someone like me who barely graduated high school, rejected by every school I applied to a year ago.

Also started a relationship with a very special guy recently. We like each other very much, and I try my best to be as mature and stable as possible with communicating and not mimicking the patterns I've seen within my family, but as things move forward it becomes much harder to maneuver through these dynamics because I'm not used to having something stable in my life really. I don't want to mess things up, I want to know how I can benefit from it as well as contribute to it the same way, without taking too much from it, so I can maintain some autonomy. He's out 100% though, and his family who I haven't met yet, seem like very pleasant people, much sweeter than my family. I'l cross that bridge if I get to it, but is it reasonable to view a SO's family as my own at some point? I try hard not to let my past and abusive family's toxicity leak in my life, but still.

So speaking of the inevitable, I cannot stay in the closet forever. When I do come out, I want to cut off contact with my parents completely, but make sure they have no possibly way of ruining me financially/emotionally, and that my academic and work life is unaffected by their response. It wouldn't be a surprise to see them find a way to get me kicked out of school or harass my employer/coworkers, so if it makes when I say, I can't slowly prepare for something like this. I need to know how it is going to be done and when, so that it's quick and painless. So I can disappear from their lives and still have a stable roof over my head with those other aspects in place. While still being able to maintain my romantic and social life.

Ok sorry if that's too much to swallow. I just needed to vent a bit and get my thoughts out some way. I appreciate you guys reading this, and the input I can get from anyone who might have some word of advice to offer. Thank you."
2rm8tp,10,2015-01-07,What's the situation with Java development on Linux? I need some help.,[deleted],java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2rm8tp/whats_the_situation_with_java_development_on/,"Hi there, im a junior java developer(im 20) with a new job where i made my internship.

Now i was offered/or given a dedicated development machine (i was using a windows vm before) where i am the administrator.
I can choose to install Windows or use Linux. Some use Linux (Mint or Ubuntu) but most use Windows.

Back when i was fiddling around with Java development in Linux it was a bit off a mess. (This was about 2 years ago)

I've read that Oracle made OpenJDK the reference implementation for JDK7 so i guess things got better.

What i will be using:

* Netbeans or IntelliJ
* Maven 3
* JDK7 and JDK6
* JBoss 7(mostly) and Tomcat with EE6 Support
* SVN (anyone knows a good one? i was using TortoiseSVN on Windows)
* MySQL (i used xampp for that so far)

Apart from the JDK im not bound to versions so i would prefer using the latest ones. That means i won't be using the distro-repos, since the application versions are too old.

My procedure would be downloading all the applications i need and put them in /opt.

What about the environments-vars? Do i need to set them as i do in Windows?

Should i stay with OracleJDK or is OpenJDK good enough?

How do i easily switch JDKs systemwide? Will this mess up programs that use OpenJDK? (IIRC Libreoffice got messed up when i tried to use the Oracle JDK instead of OpenJDK)

Any help is greatly appreciated!! I would love to use Linux, since its also a plus point for any upcoming job interview.

I was not sure if i should post here or at some Linux related sub, but since not everyone in those subs are devs or even Java devs i guess it would be a good choice to post here. Sorry if im wrong here.

**edit:** Thank you all for your great answers and support!"

I've got a good internship with a startup tech company in Seattle and am most likely moving out there when I've graduated. I will have accrued about 21k in Federal Perkins loans through Sallie Mae by graduation, about 70% subsidized and the rest unsubsidized. I expect my starting salary to be anywhere from 40-60k a year depending on my stock options, how well the company does etc.

I watched my mom deal with student loans for the majority of her life and make her absolutely miserable, I want at all costs not only to avoid that, but to achieve financial independence of some sort. I know I have 6 months after graduation grace period, and plan on paying off as much of my loans as quickly as possible before starting to save for retirement more seriously. What's the best plan for me to take on so I can eliminate these loans quickly and without accruing too much interest? I assume that I would direct all my extra payments towards the larger loan/largest interest rate (avalanche strategy) . But can I perhaps pay during my grace period? Should I concentrate on killing off subsidized loans first during the grace period in order to stop them from accruing interest? Or just direct everything towards the largest loan?"
2rnq30,22,2015-01-07,I (20F) am with family for the winter break and am constantly being turned into bad guy by older sibling (21F) acting like a baby while being unable to raise one herself.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rnq30/i_20f_am_with_family_for_the_winter_break_and_am/,"Some backstory: My sister and I have always been very close in age and therefore we fought a lot growing up, but I always looked up to her in a way. We had our fair share of good and bad times but around our early teenage years my sister would consistently try to cut me down by making me emotional and eventually cry with whatever hateful phrase she can muster, and it definitely used to work. It screwed up the way I deal with confrontation and I still see vestiges of it in my relationships today. 

Skip to present. My sister has moved back home from college and taken a break to have a baby with her bf who she'd been dating a month prior to finding out she was pregnant, admittedly this wasn't my family's favorite decision but we all still love and support her no matter what. My sister always had big dreams and now she's been reduced to living under my parents roof and rules again now with her bf and baby in tow. 

   I am currently the only one still going to school and I'm extremely proud of how much I've been able to really grow up in the past year in particular. Jobs and internships are opening up to me and I see that I actually could have a successful future in my field. I'm working on being less emotionally driven and try to stay logical on most accounts. All in all I'm working on it, I'm not perfect but I'm content with my track in life. For some reason though, I really don't think my sister is as happy for me. 

    I've been staying with family since school doesn't get back in for another week or so and things have been great, that is, until this morning. My sister has always had a hard time taking no for an answer and early this morning barging into my room to borrow my art supplies was her first prerogative of the day. Art has been apart of my life for as long as I can remember and is the field I'm pursuing now, yet my sister has no qualms in just taking my supplies whenever she feels like ""getting creative"". I'm happy to oblige normally because I can replace them and it's not hard to share, just not early in the morning when I stayed up until four working on a project the night before. 

    My sister is loud and in your face and never wrong in her eyes, so when I confusedly asked what she was looking for she demanded I give her the watercolor paints that I took from downstairs. Admittedly yes, I took the watercolor paints from downstairs, but only because I was retrieving them from the last time she took them without permission. As I'm still trying to make sense of everything that was happening, my sister gets angrier and angrier in the process and proceeds to call me a selfish bitch repeatedly. I admit I got annoyed at her tactic/ being woken up and tell her she cannot have the paints this way and she decides to yell at me louder. Finally when I tell her bullying isn't going to work, she slams my door and walks away throwing expletives out left and right. 

A temper tantrum is normal, the more time I spend away from my family do I realize just how prone my family is to them, but whatever, family right? Obviously not being able to go back to sleep, I compose myself for a few minutes then tried to head downstairs to have a normal adult conversation about what just happened. I intended to just let her know that I would give her the paints then and there if she had not just tried to bully me like we were six years old. What I didn't realize was that my sister had not taken time to calm down but rather to work herself up more. I round the corner only to receive a barrage of insults ranging from ""you're such a bitch"" to ""I hate who you are"" to my personal favorite ""it's no wonder everyone doesn't like you"" all while she holds her two month old baby in her arms. My sister has always known about my social anxiety and has always used this as the lowest blow, and those sorts of comments used to eat away at me endlessly, especially coming from my older sister who I only really ever wanted to emulate. Thankfully I've done enough growing up to realize that she's just trying to get to me the best way she knows how. It's vindictive and cruel and it hurts that my childhood idol still treats me this way because she thinks she can. I also think it's so unjustified in this case to go so far. 

I told her to refrain from talking to me for the rest of the trip, I just want the drama to be done. Unfortunately I know the cycle, I know she's going to eventually try to make amends and make herself seem like the bigger person. The past year and a half I haven't conceded to these empty half apologies because I know how insincere she is being. She realizes her bad behavior then tries to curry favor by acting like she's bigger than it all. It's infuriating because when I do not accept her apology she makes it out like I'm evil and only want to argue all the time. Everyone else seems to accept her bad behavior towards me because I'm only ever here for a short amount of time. I'm trying to get out of the house for a few days but don't know what else to do. She won't speak to me like a civil human being and I'm honestly scared of someone who flips a switch like that, someone who has no reservations about trying to cut me down in such a psychological way. Should I feel bad that she's in this situation with the baby and just let it go? I know I can't not talk to her forever, but honestly her episodes have just gotten more vile over the years. Is she angry that I'm growing as a person and she's stuck?   

Tl;dr: Older sister treats me like a doormat. Told me everyone hates me and that I should go die because I didn't give her some primary paints? Try to be mature, only to sad face when I realize my sister is just a tantrum thrower."

Pt. I

This year will mark the second anniversary spent with what amounts to the most amazing person I’ve ever had the pleasure to call my “SO.” Upcoming this year my SO will graduate University, start a well-paid internship, and attend a graduate program.

I am the “loser”; a person to which good grades and long-term success seem almost impossible. Long-term tangible goals are nonexistent. When we met I had not yet attended a four-year college. But, I had very real goals of doing so to attain my degree of choice. Since this time, I have done nothing but waste the thousands invested. I will be attending school again this coming term. This is, more or less, my final opportunity to do well in school.

Beginning more or less a year and a half ago, the sexual relationship with my SO ejected from our flight. What remains is but a tiny fraction. We average full-on intercourse about twice a month with BJs twice a year. It’s gotten to the point where I am almost never the person to engage. I’ve also noticed myself outright missing cues from my SO after-the-fact. It is a pit that reeks of desperation and near-hopelessness.

Our sexual incompatibility seems to go much deeper than meets the eye: I have come to the shaky conclusion that the sex is bad because of myself, and in turn, partially SO. At this point can I honestly call myself a future long-term prospect? No. Where will the money come from? Would I make a good life partner? I think whether conscious or otherwise this is the root of the issue.

I come to you not on advice over sex, but something far more delicate. The lease of our absolutely delightful flat comes to an end later this year. I’ve come to the realization that if something drastic is to take place, it will need to take place during that period. On the flip side, it has occurred to me that if I earn my success this term, the relationship problems may disperse like morning fog. Can Reddit comment?

Pt. II

I’ve always liked to consider myself a bit of a modern adventurer. My current aspirations outside of school and career include hiking the AT, going on long motorcycle adventures, and traveling foreign continents as much as possible. When addressing these goals.. my SO seems to find them neat or… cool. But doesn’t seem to react positively when I get serious about them. When I asked her if she’d like to join me on the six to nine-month trip up Appalachia, she replied, “When would I find the time?!” For those serious about this trip, that is not a real question.

During the handful of trips I’ve taken without SO, the sort of communication I get is initially positive, but degrades into SO “missing” me in a somewhat unproductive way. However, ironically, when we are apart, SO seems to get more productive in other ways… Like making an effort to hang out with friends and working out. Can anyone explain this to me?

Again, I ask for Reddits advice on this difficult situation I find myself in. I enjoy so much of the time we spend together. We get along so very, very well. Then I find myself in a short depression over sex. Maybe later I think of myself in 20 years; do I want to have the memory of epic trips or not? Do I want to grow up another soul who let go of dreams to settle? Even though he never said it, I know my Grandpa did this. I do not want to end up like that. Can you offer insight?

2rob7w,0,2015-01-07,[Rant] Slowly becoming willing to face that I may have an anxiety problem.,SparkmasterFlex,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2rob7w/rant_slowly_becoming_willing_to_face_that_i_may/,"So I'm currently a senior studying engineering at a somewhat prestigious university. I've only got one semester left, and I am somewhat excited but mostly terrified to be near the end of my undergraduate career. I'll talk about this later, but first is a discussion of my plans for this semester.

I'll start by saying that I know I'm doing too much. I know that this is a source of my anxiety, feeling overwhelmed and helpless at times as well. I'm taking 19 credits, working three jobs, and am also running the chapter of the civil engineering honor society at my university. I tell myself how great it would feel to quit some of those things, only take the bare essentials, and enjoy a free mind. But for some reason, in my head, I would rather suffer and complete things than ease my anxiety and ""quit"" things. 

These 19 credits are required to graduate. I could put graduation off for a few semesters, but I have already applied to graduate schools and have filled out a few job applications on the idea that I would be done after this semester.

One of my jobs is to be Resident Advisor on campus. This job is pretty laid back, and doesn't require more than about 10 hours per week, but there are events that you are required to plan (on a monthly, weekly, and semester level) that I've always got on my mind and other various decorations that require updating throughout the semester. By itself, this job is no problem. But having this in the back of my mind at all times keeps me up at night and I feel anxious about it constantly.

My second job is working as a private tutor for high school students. Again, alone, this job is a piece of cake. I tutor subjects that I know backwards and forwards, and get to know some students and build fun relationships. However, it is something that comes home with me also whenever I am finished. ""How can I help this student? I know he hasn't been turning in his homework. I've e-mailed his teacher, but he also seems somewhat unwilling to work with me. Meanwhile his Mom is panicking because she hates when her son fails classes. I hope that he is getting things from our tutoring sessions. I don't want him to hate my tutoring methods. My boss is upset with me about something, I hope that she doesn't think poorly of me.""

My third job is that as a research assistant in a lab on campus. I'm just starting this semester, and am excited because this was something that I really needed on my applications to graduate school. At the same time, the pressure in this environment (that I'm putting on myself) is pretty high. I want to perform better than any other undergraduate research assistant my advisor has had. I want her to be so impressed with me that she would invite me to work with her in the future. I want her to brag about me to other faculty members. I can not make a single mistake, I must be perfect. The hours on this one are about 10 per week. Again, something that I can handle on its own, but piling up it is starting to get to me.

My last main responsibility is to run the honor society for my major at school. This involves preparing meeting agendas, communicating to members about upcoming events, planning events, overseeing our funds, communicating with national headquarters about our new initiates, booking event centers for our programs, and other things as well. This is something that looks good on a resume, but I'm struggling with it and it is again one of those things that is always on my mind... ""have I covered everything for this upcoming meeting? The faculty advisor wants to plan more events, what can we do as an honor society? Nobody showed up to our pizza party, are people thinking that my leadership skills are poor?"" I have fellow officers in this society with me (VP, secretary, treasurer etc) that I can assign things to, but for some reason I dislike doing that and heap the workload on myself. I don't know why.

I've been anxious for a couple years, but recently I was driving to tutor somebody and I just began feeling what felt like a panic attack. I don't know what they feel like for most people, but the weight on my chest (which has been here for a few months) just got heavier and heavier and I started getting actually scared. It felt like I was frozen, I didn't want to move or anything.

I fear that I'm going to fail something. I set standards too high for myself. Even as I'm typing this, I want to justify it by saying that I am setting standards too high for anybody, like if I am failing this then everybody is failing this. It is such an unhealthy way to look at things, I don't want to admit that somebody else could do a better job but in reality I kind of just want to sit in my room all day every day and just quit school (but I'm trying to stifle that reality and convince myself that I'm not failing anything).

On top of this, graduation is around the corner... I worry every day abotu making money and what I'm going to do with my life and whether I'll make it into any of the schools I've applied for and whether I'll get any of the jobs I applied for. I had an internship in the field over the summer, but I did not enjoy it and did not get much out of it. 

I think a source of my desire to do everything right and be ""perfect"" is my family. Several members of my family have (and used to have) depression. I've never been diagnosed with it, but I've certainly felt depressed and have sort of just stifled it and kept going with my life. I've seen how it has crippled the members of my family, and I refused to go anywhere even near where they are/were.

I guess I'm just putting so much pressure on myself, and it is starting to affect me mentally. It is tough for me to enjoy things any more. My   #1 priority in life is to be successful. I also don't talk to anybody about this. I don't have that type of relationship with my family, and I do not have a SO or any friends that I would be willing to share this with.

I'm starting to accept/admit to myself that I may have a problem. It is difficult for me to do so because I have that complex where I must be perfect and not have anything wrong with me and can not take any breaks. Everybody assumes that I am fine because I am a fairly quiet person who is attractive, never brags about anything, keeps to himself, and smiles a lot. But I just feel so different and nervous and freaked out about everything.

Well, I guess that's it. I was just kind of looking for a place to rant about what I'm feeling. I'm sorry if this sort of stuff isn't really talked about or this type of post isn't usually published on this subreddit, I admit I didn't really look around too closely at what other people have been saying. But regardless, typing this all out has helped me. If anybody made it this far, then thanks for taking the time to do so."

(M)22 (f)42",62Silvertone,CougarsAndCubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CougarsAndCubs/comments/2robjt/story_of_my_first_cougar_its_long_but_i_think/,"So, I stumbled across this sub and thought that my first cougar experience might be appreciated here. 

 When I was in college, 21 at the time, I had a friend who started dating a girl that was in her late 20s at the time. One of the first times we hung out, I met a friend of hers that was a stunningly beautiful Italian woman in her early 40s. The first time we met we were smoking pot under the stairs at a bar downtown. 

 I had maybe met her a couple times at this point, but I didn't think much about her. I could tell she had a youthful spirit. Well, one night while drinking around a bond fire, my friend joking said to his girlfriend ""we should hook David up with Stacey."" I played it off, but the idea of it drove my mind wild. From then on, I couldn't get her off my mind. 
 
As time went on, I would see her around, or at my friends girlfriends house, she always had on a very low cut dress with fuck me boots. She had huge breasts. I'm not even sure the cup size, but  I'm sure larger than DD, and she always gave me huge... And my mind went wild.
I always remained composed, but I would often masturbate thinking of her and all the things we could do together. Now, keep in mind, I have no clue of this woman's marital status, but I eventually figure out she's recently divorced. And this is also taking place over the course of about 1.5 years. 
 
Eventually, my friend moves to Atlanta for an internship and his GF moves shortly after him. Before she left, she told me to make sure Stacy could get pot and to go over to her place and smoke with her. This was what I had been waiting on. So, I go over there a few times and mostly just sit at the kitchen table and smoke and talk, but one night I got the courage to ask her if she wanted to hang out. She did. 
  
I go over to her house on a Friday night. We have some drinks, smoke some pot. We're having a good time. She's wearing a sexy dress with her breasts hanging out. At some point, we decide to go to the gas station and get some beers. We get in the car and I shit you not, Ms. Robinson by Simon and Garfunkel is playing on the radio, and we both have a laugh about it. 
We get back to her place and decide to watch a movie. The lights are off. We are sitting on the couch. I move closer to her. My stomach is in knots. I put my arm around her. Then I just come out and tell her that I've had a crush on her for over a year... Silence. Deafening silence. After what seemed like an eternity, she says ""well, I guess we should make out"".  We make out for what seems like only a few seconds, then she grabs my hand and leads me to her room. 
  
She goes into the bathroom, and comes out in a nighty. She gets in bed and I immediately take out her breasts and start sucking them. They are so big and just everything I imagined. I then slowly work my mouth down her body until I'm eating her out. She taste delicious. I then move up and start to slide my dick inside her. I fucked her in missionary for about two minutes. I could tell she was really getting into it, then all of the sudden, I'm completely soaked. With no warning, she squirted all over me. Not only a milf, but a squirter! I was in college boy heaven. We fucked and sucked in all sorts of different positions for about four hours that night. Due to a combination of alcohol and nerves, I was rock hard but hadn't cum all night. As we were getting dressed, I grabbed her head and pulled it down to my cock and began to fuck her mouth until I eventually exploded all over her mouth and face and I'm pretty sure some even got on my shoes.

 We fucked on and off over the next year or so until I graduated and moved. We are still in touch today and she's a beautiful person who I love very much. I have many more stories about her and many other cougars. I also have a story about how I ended up fucking my friends gf who introduced to the cougar for a few months... While she lived with the cougar. Sorry for any typos and grammatical errors. I'd love to answer and questions! "
2roj5i,2,2015-01-07,"Hey Everyone, I really need some major advice 22/M broke up with 29/F after being emotionally abused for 2+ years, but still cant fully let her go.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2roj5i/hey_everyone_i_really_need_some_major_advice_22m/,"LONG READ AHEAD BUT ITS NOT A RANT AND I DID END IT WITH A TLDR:
I have created this off account to not reveal any personal information about me or my Ex.
 So, to start things off I have recently ended a 2+ year relationship with who I thought to be the love of my life. I want to explain to you all exactly what made me finally end things, but ultimately I need advice on why I am still feeling this way about this person and what I should do next. 
I was 19 about to be 20 when I was working at a store with a manager of mine who I had a huge crush on. She was older than me (26 about to be 27), had an abusive boyfriend, and a 2 year old daughter. Her and I would occasionally text each other and play Xbox when she had the time. She was so bubbly, cute, and nice to me that I really could not help but want her. I knew it was basically impossible with her being my manager, with her being older than me, having a kid, and a bf. However, as some time went by she finally was fed up with him and they broke up. Her and I started to hit it off through more texting and eventually found ourselves on a date. I was quitting the job soon anyway to return to focusing more on studying for my college courses. We hit off instantly, especially after being pretty good friends for a while. She became my girlfriend and just a little over a month into the relationship she told me she loved me. With no hesitation I told her I loved her too, before as a friend and now as an amazing girlfriend. Almost an entire year went by with us being in complete ecstasy. So very much in love. We only had on hiccup and at the time she was hitting it rough with her ex being a complete psycho towards her (he literally kidnapped his own daughter outside of a court restraining order) and she would tell me for some reason she wasn't over him, but she needed to be. She got really bitter and mean towards me and it was the first time I ever seen her act this way. She cursed me out for over 15 minutes because I locked her car door over night instead of leaving it unlocked because her neighborhood was nice enough that no one would steal it and it was stupid of me to waste her time by locking it. She told me she needed space from me and didn't want to see me as much, but then within like 3 weeks she was back to normal. I took it as a bump in the road of a great relationship. I just wanted to be there for her, and we went back to being happy all over again. Her daughter loved me and looked up to me and was honestly the cutest little girl ever and I love her with all my heart. I got along great with her family as she did with mine.

Speed up to a year is when everything started to fall apart:
Exactly one year into our relationship I told her that we should find a babysitter for the baby and I wanted to take her out somewhere really nice. I planned on taking her to a nice restaurant, coming home to rent a movie, and staying up late drinking wine, cuddling and having lovey sexy time ( i know sounds so mushy but when you're really in love its the best idea). I told her exactly what I wanted to do and she got really weird on me. She never found a baby sitter and returned to my house with this bitter look on her face. We had to cancel plans and go out to a random Chili's because the baby wasn't going to be able to be in a fancy restaurant and be calm. The whole day she barley talked to me and yelled at the baby for literally being a baby. We finally got back home and she was bitter towards me in front of my mom and she finally told me what was wrong when we went upstairs. It was that she thought i was going to propose to her and I didn't have plans to do so. I told her that it was only 1 year into a relationship, i didn't have the money whatsoever, and I wasn't even thinking about that at the time, let alone we weren't even living together. This set her off for months and months of her being the way she was when she wasn't over her ex towards me. She would barely talk to me: i would text her ""good morning beautiful"" like i did every morning and i would get back a ""morning."" or when she was over my place she just looked at me in disgust and everything ticked her off into wanting to argue and curse at me. After a while of her being like this I told her that although it really affects my grades I was going to go back to working and save money to get a place with her and i knew it would make her happy. I went back to work for a little while but it really had such an impact on my grades and the time i got to spend with her we both agreed i should quit again. This meant that we wouldn't be moving in together until at least when i graduated in a couple years, but it really wasn't a problem since i was either sleeping at her house or she was sleeping at mine almost all the time. We had our personal time and space but if i ever asked to just have a day to myself or a day to just relax and play games she would snap on me.
Things with us sort of got back to normal, but by sort of i mean what ever mood she was in that's how the day/week would go. We would have weeks of just utter happiness and be totally in love with each other, but once one small thing happened like one of her friends getting married, or seeing one of those bridezilla shows on tv, or in some cases me wanting to play Xbox with my friends when i was bored for a little instead of cuddling with her she would snap and it would onset a really bitter attitude towards me for days..even weeks. 

Things got slightly better after we stuck through it and i continuously tried to talk to her and work things out and understand her. I always told her she wasn't wrong for wanting those things at her age and where she was at in life, just how she went about not getting it immediately was the problem. 
She sort of gave up on the whole when are you going to propose to me thing on a constant basis and limited it to once or twice a month. however, this brought a different problem to the table. She started to become extremely jealous. i can not stress how extremely jealous i really mean. If I told her about a professor in school that was really helpful the response was ""what do you want to fuck her?"", if i had a random lab partner that was female it was ""why don't you marry her"", my mom once commented on how pretty Olivia Wilde's eyes are and i agreed by saying her eyes are amazing: she then was mad at me the entire night and cursed up a storm when we went out to get pizza that i should go be with Olivia Wilde, and one time landed a very important internship which i worked alongside a city councilman at city hall and there were 3 guys and 3 girls in the internship along with me out of like 100 applicants. I was very excited to go and she was really happy for me. I even start suffering panic attacks because it was a lot of responsibility, but she was there for me and drove me almost every day so i felt less anxiety about going. However, all she did was worry that i was going to leave her for one of these females that i had no interest in. My boss had us all make a LinkedIn account to contact other business people around the city in order to connect with them and what i noticed is that i got an email everyday telling me that she(my gf) was viewing my profile. At first i thought it was cute because it was just a ""her"" thing to do, but i noticed she was stalking my profile to see if i made any connections with literally any ""females"". she told me it was my ""secret social networking site to cheat on her"". It even got so bad to the point when she would want to hang out, but i already had plans playing xbox with my friends she would tell me to ""fuck and marry my xbox."" (btw i don't go out at all really i go to school and then play xbox with my friends online if I'm not studying my butt off).

Now i want to add in here that along with all these ""problems"" that she had, she was a really great girl. She truely loved me, knew how to comfort me when i needed it, often cooked for me, helped me with money when i fell behind on some things, and just loved the hell out of me. I did all these things for her as well. Also, We had really REALLY great sexual chemistry. Without those major problems we really truely loved one another, and i loved her daughter like she was my own.

When the relationship finally needed to be ended was when I found out my dad was leaving my mom for some lady from the internet. I was stuck with a hard choice because my mom wouldn't be able to afford a 3 bedroom place, even with some help from me, for herself, me and my sister. My dad, however told me i'm in school and he would support me if i went with him. I told her this because i needed someone to vent to and her first response was ""does this lady have a daughter..like a daughter your age you'd be living with?"" and i said no..she then said i should stop playing stupid fucking video games and work and stop making school seem so hard and time consuming and grow up and that its life and life is hard... the next day I started an internship in which i would be tutoring someone for a Psychology class. I texted her that i was excited to finally start and her response was that ""i hope the girl you are tutoring is the girl of your dreams"". I was so angry and fed up with everything that i ended it right there. 

She assumed I was bluffing but when she realized i was serious she called me crying, called my mom crying for several nights straight, and told me she couldn't take it and wanted to die. She couldn't be without me and she cant believe im doing this to her. That im the worst person for doing this to her.
I felt terrible. I wanted to be back with her because i couldn't see someone that i love so much feel like that. But with support from my friends insisting that i should because of how abusive she was i stuck through it and didn't get back with her. About 3 months into our break up now and here is why i need advice:
I still love her. I kind of still want to be with her. I told her this and she pretty much resents me and blames me for making her feel pain she has never felt from a break up. I feel like im in her shoes now constantly texting her to see if she is with someone ( i am never like this..ever). I'm trying to contact her and get back with her on a daily basis now and she just will not answer me...but this makes me feel extremely stupid because why would i want to be back with this person? have any of you been in this situation? It makes me really question myself.. and a large part of me feeling this way is because i cant stand the thought of her being with another guy and another guy having sex with her, but also because i still love her..a lot. I need some major advice..sorry for the long read. 

TL;DR (22/M) in a 2+ relationship with a girl that was 7 years older than me. It became emotionally abusive and she tore me down with her own insecurities. I finally left her and her abusive ways but I cant help but still love her and want her back and i really dont know how to stop feeling this way."

I have been growing out my pixie for over a year now and it cannot be tamed. The damage has been cut off during regular trims, even the fresh hair at the roots is coarse (I haven't dyed it) and I'm graying decently noticeably. 

[These](http://imgur.com/a/NpKBh) are two pictures, one of how my hair looked at it's best long, and how my hair looked at it's best as a pixie.
**EDIT: I just realized these pictures were taken literally a year and a day apart, so that's a perfect progress picture**

I do my best not to flat iron it. I do blow dry it, but even when I let it dry free it is coarse.

I think I want to cut it off again, but it's so thick that it starts to look bad pretty fast. I was thinking of getting the sides and back cut very very short with a trimmer, and leaving the top fairly longer but thinned out.

Do you guys have suggestions for hairstyles that would suit me? I am looking for a professional internship, so I need to keep that in mind as well."
2rosq4,3,2015-01-07,Here we go...,GdaBus,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2rosq4/here_we_go/,"*Apologies for the long post but this is just my mind spilling everything out for the first time*

I am sitting here at my laptop just before I go to bed contemplating the decision I made earlier this afternoon. This decision was that as of tomorrow, I will never smoke trees again. I am high from my last J I smoked about 20 minutes, so I apologise for any typing errors/lack of coherence.

A little back story first:
I am 21 years old, currently at university, and I have been smoking since I was 17. I know it's not that long compared to some but I have well and truly taken it to new personal levels very quickly over the last few years.

I have come to realise that I have no true passions in life at the moment, the course I study can be interesting but it doesn't thrill me by any means. I have noticed that instead of trying to find something that does interest me I will just get high and watch tv, or a movie or perhaps play xbox, none of which is a useful way to spend your time, especially when there are other things that you need to be doing.

I failed one module (out of 9) in my first year at university, which meant I had to repeat a year doing just that module instead of progress into the second year with all my peers, which was very disappointing. I found this out during an internship I was doing with a rather large consultancy firm, which resulted in me calling in sick for three days because I was so down, ultimately leading to a bad impression being left.

I failed that module because I was getting high all the time and being too lazy. The following year when I was just repeating this one module, I did absolutely nothing but get high in my room and stare at my computer all day long, some days I didn't get dressed at all. I never diagnosed myself or talked to anyone about it, but I would say I felt depressed, I'm not certain but I was very sad all the time and paranoia was quite frequent, as well as anxiety. I feel better now but the same feelings are still there whenever I am high on my own, it's ok when I am around friends.

Most of my good friends now, both at home and at university, are all people that I smoked trees with and that I feel is going to make it very hard for me. Although one of my house mates quit in the Summer and he is still going strong, so I can take inspiration from him.

Another thing that I have lacked in my life is any meaningful relationship of any kind with a girl. I have always been overweight, but recently I have been losing some, mainly due to smoking trees all day and losing my appetite. I have realised recently that I need to turn this unhealthy way of losing weight into a healthy way, so I am going to start hitting the gym to try and take my mind off of smoking. I think that once I get into a good routine with the gym I will be much more confident about myself, and hopefully find a nice girl, as well as become healthier in the process ofcourse.

So back to the present:

I currently live with my friends at university who I mostly smoke trees with, one of which sorts me the herbs. This has made it very hard for me to even consider quitting before because it is so readily available, but as I said earlier, one of my house mates has managed to do it, so why can't I?

It is just before exam period, I have 5 exams, I am not well prepared, changes have to be made. When I wake up I am going to get rid of all my smoking stuff and then go straight to the library and revise all day. I will not smoke trees again. I have said this before, but I have a stronger feeling than ever before about it this time.

I want to say thank you to r/leaves, you guys have really been the thing that pushed me over the line with making this decision! 

Wish me luck everyone!

2rp8xz,1,2015-01-07,My [23F] ex [22M] ended it after Christmas break but I still want to be friends.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rp8xz/my_23f_ex_22m_ended_it_after_christmas_break_but/,"Here's a little background before the story. I met a wonderful boy my freshman year of college. From day one, he has always been way, way out of my league. He is smart, good-looking, ambitious...basically every great quality you can think of to describe someone. A couple years go by, I run into him once in a while, but every time I see him he has a new girlfriend.

During my last couple months of school, his roommate told me he was recently single. We talked and hung out more frequently. One night, we went out for dinner with a group of friends and he asked for my number. I didn't stop smiling the rest of the night. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, we go on a few dates (instigated by a Game of Thrones marathon...swoon), get along incredibly well, and are inseparable before school ends. As we are laying in my bed one evening, I asked him ""Where have you been?"" He tells me ""I've been here all along, I liked you since I first saw you in my dorm room freshman year."" Gentlemen, take note because 60% of the time, this works every time. 

He leaves town for an internship and almost immediately sends me an apology for being too forward with me. He keeps saying he didn't want to be ""that guy"" that pushed me too far out of my comfort zone. I accept his apology easily and we continue to talk fairly regularly. I begrudgingly accept this is where the relationship ends and expect it to fizzle out in a few weeks. We never officially end things, but then again, I guess we never officially started things either.

A few weeks after summer begins, I accepted a job and moved over 12 hours away. It just so happens that he was fairly close for his summer internship. He offers to help me move in, but at the last minute backs out because he was busy with friends. I was upset for a while but eventually forgave him and have all but forgotten about it. 

I travelled home a few times since I started my new job, and every time he would make an effort to see me. For example, over Christmas break I travelled through my old college town to get home. Both times I passed through, he drove over three hours to come see me. We hung out and talked more frequently over the break. 
 
After I get back from the break, he apologizes yet again for being ""that guy"" and pushing me too far. I don't really know how to respond because I don't think of it like that. We have a long conversation and I finally asked him to clarify exactly what was going on between us.

He said since he wants to move abroad that nothing relationship-wise could ever happen between us in the future. I didn't disagree, but it was difficult to hear. As a closet romantic, I want to believe everything works out in the end but being rational, I know he is telling the truth and nothing will happen. When he told me, I was incredibly short to end the conversation. We haven't talked since. 

Past the romantic relationship, we always have great conversations and can talk to each other about anything. Topics ranging from current events, to what constitutes a great sandwich, and even the new lightsaber design in Star Wars have all been brought up. After thinking about it for quite a few days, I have (tentatively) come to the conclusion that I don't want to give up a friend that I can nerd out with just because I know we won't have a romantic relationship. 

So reddit, how do I stay friends with him? Is it even worth it to stay friends with him? And if so, how do I ask him to still be friends with me?

I will be a career changing MAcc student this fall and here are some of the questions/answers I’ve taken away.  These are just my impressions so please correct if I’m off base!

**Should I get a CPA?**

Yes.  It’s possible to work as an accountant without one, but the opportunities with a CPA (especially for a career changer) seem to be far greater.

**Should I do a Masters or just take the necessary credits to sit for the CPA?**

Go with a Masters program if your previous degree is very different from accounting and if you have aspirations of being recruited by Big 4 and other firms in your area.  Otherwise, taking classes online or at a community college could be a cheaper route to getting the same license.

Most Masters programs don’t require an undergrad degree in accounting.  They are typically 2 years.  UNC has a 1 year program designed for non-accounting majors.

**Should I get an accounting certificate?**

From what I’ve read, not many seem to hold much water in getting a job.

**Are online Masters programs considered lesser than?**

No, more and more schools are rolling out online accounting degrees.  UMass Amhearst and UConn have well-rated online programs.  As far as I know, they don’t offer recruitment (one of the main benefits of a Masters program) and can be more expensive than your in-state school.  UNC is launching an online Masters that includes a 3-month internship and in-person recruiting period with employers.

**Does it matter which Masters program I graduate from?**

Brand name or accreditation doesn’t seem to matter.  Of course stay away from for-profit schools.  Therefore, I would choose the most cost-effective school that’s recruited by the firms you’re interested in and located in the area/state you want to live in.

**Does age matter (at Big 4)?**

It doesn’t seem to.  If you are competent technically and socially, no one will care about your age.  I think the reason there aren’t more “older” first years at Big 4 is because they were unable to participate in the internships or didn’t want to work with people younger or didn't like the work-life balance of first years.

I take [this]( http://goingconcern.com/post/definitive-guide-accounting-second-career/section/0/3) Going Concern post with a grain of salt.  But I do believe there is some truth to Big 4 preferring fresh college grads they can more easily “mold”.

I'm looking to line up an internship (probably at a local dentist's office or something similar) and I'm not really sure how to go about it. I contacted my college's career and development office and they were not helpful in helping me line up an internship. Are there any dentists with advice? 

My main questions:
1) How should I approach the office/the dentist about a possible internship? For example, what should I say?
2) If you're a dentist and you had an intern at your office, what kinds of things would you have them do? 
3) How many hours should I put in for an internship?

If any other dental internship advice crosses your mind and you would be willing to share, that would be VERY helpful. 

Thank you so much in advance!"

She just felt differently now, and although I was very hurt, and am still hurt, I knew that there was no point to trying to continue the relationship and was very polite (in my opinion at least!) and haven't texted her at all in the last few weeks. 

I was looking through one of my drawers today and noticed she had left behind some study stuff, and papers relating to internships for her major. Since she lives about 7-8 minutes away walking distance on my college campus, I thought I'd give it back to her instead of throwing it away since it seemed important. 

So I decided to text her apartment mate (who I knew pretty well and had gone to high school with me), asking if I could return the stuff to her instead of my ex, since my ex had said we needed some space and I understood and felt the same way. However, after returning the binder and paper to her apartment mate, who had been very nice and joked around with me, my ex texted me saying I had forgotten to return a gift she had given me over a year ago. 

I know I shouldn't be upset about it, but it definitely felt like she did it on purpose to upset me since she knew how much I liked the gift. My question is, did I do something wrong by doing this? I didn't expect her to be nasty at all or anything since she was the one who broke up with me and had said she didn't hate me or anything and wouldn't mind being friends eventually.

---   

TL;DR: Returned some of my ex's stuff to her apartment mate to give back to her, and she sent me a text to try and upset me even though the breakup was not a bad one.

Sorry for the wall of text. Just annoyingly upset by it.

2rqfz1,112,2015-01-08,Going to court in China II,crodriguezai,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/2rqfz1/going_to_court_in_china_ii/,"This is a follow up post about this story:

http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/2mvj7s/going_to_court_in_china/

More background:

http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/2kk7n9/labor_conflicts_in_china_regarding_privacy/

Summing up, I worked in a Chinese translation company until November 2014. The company tried to fire me because I refused to give my portrait and personal information to be published in Chinese corporate websites. I went through all the process and the sentence came out last week; I have won the case at the arbitration court but the company has applied for middle court.

After being forbidden to enter the company where I used to work, I went to the local arbitration center to find a solution. In this center the officers tried to speak with my company but they refused to negotiate. I was told then to go to the main arbitration center in Xincun Road and hand in there the application for arbitration court. For the application I just needed the application form presenting my case, the evidences supporting my story and the labor contract.
A week later I received a summons to go to the arbitration center at the end of November. After seeking for some advice from friends, family and reddit I decided to hire a lawyer.

The first stage of the arbitration process is a negotiation. I went to the center with a friend to help me with the translation. My lawyer came with a friend, a translator and an intern. From the company only came the HR Manager. This stage was quite friendly, we were all around a table and we presented our point of view and the evidences supporting our story. According to the company, they needed to publish my image and personal information because some time ago two guys from the Ministry of Information and Security came to the office and asked them to do it (they did not provide any evidence to support this claim).

After the presentation we abandoned the room in turns to speak alone with the officer. In our turn the officer suggested asking the company for the salary from October and half of the severance payment, which I agreed. When we were all together again the HR Manager agreed with the terms but demanded to take my residence permit in addition. The officer said that was not her competence (it is the Entry &amp; Exit Administration´s) so we all got a little mad and did not reach an agreement.

The second stage is a trial in the arbitration court. I was summoned two weeks later. In the meanwhile my lawyer tried to negotiate with the company to let me keep the residence permit but the company asked for my severance payment as compensation to give up my visa. The trial was more or less the same as the negotiation, although more formal and tense. We repeated our stories in the courtroom in front of an illustrious judge. At the end, the judge gave us a last chance to negotiate, we proposed the same terms to the company and the company refused.

The sentence came out two weeks later. I won the case; I would receive the full severance payment and the salary from October. This result has been appealed to middle court so the process is still ongoing.

Work permit &amp; Residence permit

Throughout the process I was afraid that the company would cancel my work permit and residence permit. From what the company said in the trial, they tried to cancel my work permit but they could not do it. As it turned out, in Shanghai, the company needs the signature of the worker in order to cancel the work permit. As for the residence permit, it is not possible to cancel it if the work permit is still valid.

In order to transfer the work and residence permit to another company the process is relatively easy. You need to apply within ten days (in Shanghai) from the date you left your previous position (in this case, from the date I received the result from the arbitration), hand in the new contract, new company information and more or less all the documents you gave when you issued the first Z visa.

At the end, after winning the case and knowing that the process is still ongoing (the date of the trial is at the end of January) I would strongly suggest not getting involved with a bad company in a foreign country. If you have any doubts about a company try to get more information, if still have doubts, do not work for them. If still you get in a situation like this, always be aware of your rights, no matter in which country you are in, do not get emotional and, paraphrasing Johnny Cash (who was quoting himself Tom Petty), do not back down.

2rquv7,3,2015-01-08,Maybe it's not our time yet [M/18],aussie_gecko1892,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2rquv7/maybe_its_not_our_time_yet_m18/,"Let me start this off by saying two things. Firstly, the story which I am about to tell was never a relationship. We never classified it as such and I don't want there to be confusion. Second, I am not entirely sure what I am going to write, what I am hoping for out or it, or for it's purpose at all. All I know is that I am doing it and it will be long. Apologies in advance for much of the tangents that will probably occur. 

I met this girl named Fiona in August 2010 (My name is Rhys by the way) as we shared two classes together. At the time I wasn't looking for a relationship, the main reason being that I knew by January, I would be flying back to Australia where I currently reside. In the 5 months I knew her, it took till the last 2 for me to admit I had feelings but ones I never thought would go this far. I'll note, we talked very little and never outside of class. I left Kentucky, USA and returned home to South Australia with my family. She message me soon after for the first time. 

Nothing notable for this discussion came out of the first talk, but I know it was a big step for her. It wasn't until over a year later, March 29th 2012, that we really started to talk. the total messages over that first year probably doesn't reach 200, but from here on.... we never stopped. There was no specific date I can pinpoint as to where she never stopped leaving my head but it soon became a message everyday. 

Over the course of the next 2 and a half years of non-stop conversation we developed so many things that made the conversation unique. We started talking in CAPS because we agreed it was the childish thing to do and that we ourselves fit the idea of being childish perfectly. We hated trying to end of a conversation and so we used the ""pusheen facebook paw"" as a sign that we had to leave. It didn't matter what the reason was, whether it was sleep or school or something completely different, it just meant that we were leaving. Saying goodbye was always painful to do and usually took an extra half an hour to do so this fit perfectly. We Skype'd on only a handful of occasions, but they were typically for serious conversations or special occasions. We Skype'd on the ""anniversary"" of us talking for a year (and two) and celebrated by eating Apple and Rhubarb Pie because it is overly underrated. 

Things were never serious, as much as we knew we liked each other. Fiona wrote two poems about me, one which established her feelings simplistically but effectively (if anything, the day I read this was the day my conscious feeling were reinvigorated). We both thought it highly unrealistic to be thinking in relationship terms. We both agree that as much as we talk we don't know the other person. We know who they are when the wall that is the internet is there, but know them know them? 

Due to this, we were free to see other people. This.... potentially marks the begin of the spiral for me. A year and a half into messaging my friend introduced me to a girl of whom I started to like. Now, I had plans back then to go back to America to do college there. I had a few reasons for this, one of them being closer to Fiona but that currently wasn't the initial reason even if it was the biggest by the end. After meeting this girl I quickly established two things. 1. That my time in AUS was limited, I would be moving to the USA in what was 9 months. 2. That I had feelings for Fiona. 

Complicated as it may have been I made sure that before I went on my first date with this girl I told Fiona about her. It was difficult and painful for the both of us but I felt I owed her that knowledge. The most memorable line from that talk started by her saying she wanted me to be happy but in the end ""maybe it's not our time yet"". It hurt... but I was understandable and a phenomenal way of putting it. I went on a date with this girl, we kissed before it promptly fell apart. Out of respect for her I shall not say much but essentially she phased me out instead of telling me she wasn't interested.

Fiona and I continued talking (I never stopped, Fiona is always a friend first) and it was almost as if nothing had changed. We got to our second ""anniversary"" and it was around this time when she was deciding on a college. This is important because the one she ended up going to has a Field Work Term which is essentially a school enforced internship for 7 weeks which  Fiona decided would be amazing to have in South Australia so she could see me (and live with). I was ecstatic, we started sorting it all out, complicated and difficult as it was with passports and finding an employer who would be willing to have an intern for 7 weeks in her field of study. We finally started to make real progress with it then..... nothing. 2 days without response is weird for us but this stretched out for 7 weeks. I went through multiple emotional changes, many thinking that me being worried and always having her on my mind was creepy at a minimum. I saw she liked someones facebook status about 2 weeks in but never messaged and it hurt. There was no explicit warning, she was just gone. It wasn't until about 3 days after I had a long ranting ""Eureka"" moment that I was finally about to be ok with her absence. Then she returned... Because I can never fully understand what it is she is going through I don't like to summarize it for fear of misrepresenting and so I will quote a few things from her which explain the absence.

*""So basically I stopped messaging you because I was afraid. I haven't really told you this, I've hinted at it but I don't think I've mentioned it directly. I've been struggling with depression and confidence issues pretty much all year. And I like to doubt things. And I started to doubt you. I was worried I wasn't getting the full picture, I was worried the internet thing was making things weird, but mostly I was worried that I was forcing myself to invent feelings I didn't have... 

...I want you to really understand this next part: feeling my unconfident for me also feels wrong. Like physically it feels gross and I hate cowering and I never want to be unsure. And the way my feelings about you were swirling around and getting all confused... It felt wrong...

...So I made the choice that was needed to take control. And the easiest way for me to do that was to get away from you for a while. It's starting to work. And I think I'll be okay...

...Today I spent 16 hours in a car driving back home. And in the last hour and a half I put on some old music I hadn't listened to in a long time. AND it felt really..  freeing? I hadn't listened to anything like it in some long and it was like I was finally breaking free of all this internal categorization and crap I told myself that wasn't true and that I was so precious and could do whatever I wanted and have whatever I wanted and that I deserved to feel sure. And I really did feel a shift inside myself and I sort of knew all summer that it's been coming but I wasn't sure what it was. And I want sure what this change would mean for you...

...Your last one in particular. And especially the end. The truth is, I felt when I stopped messaging you that I DID owe you something. And that's what lead to the whole internal grossness thing. And I was worried that whatever this was, you felt like you had the power and that I wouldn't be able to take it for myself. It scared me. And I get back and here you are and without having me say a word you've figured it all out and at least somewhat calmed my fears. I still need to work on saying what I want to and all that, but I just.... Feel so much better now....""*

In the end, it felt like things might be able to go back to normal although it was now official that she wouldn't be coming down to Australia for 7 weeks. We messaged back and forth for a few weeks but things never felt exactly the same (for good reason). As much as she had made progress with herself, her thinking and whenever else might be included in the mix, she never truly figured it out. How could she? Part of the problem was (incoming understanding that might be poorly worded and hasn't been discussed thus probably fully understood) that she liked me. She was idolizing me to some degree that she thought I must have a flaw that she was missing. That this was all too good to be true. Was I the main problem? I can't say for sure but I don't think I was. She would never really be able to figure it out though... not with the distance between us. With college starting and the stress that came from that along with all the other things she had on her mind, she said she wanted space to figure things out. A random marker of mid-October (2 months down the track) was asked for and I happily obliged. 

I came to my own decision in this time that my already postponed move to do College in the USA was ultimately cancelled. All the reasons I had initially I realized I could do just fine in AUS without paying nearly the cost it would to fly and live alone in America. Besides, Fiona and I had already made the decision that we wouldn't base our decisions off the other person. I waited until mid-October to tell her and got a response a few weeks later. We have talk on maybe three occasions since then. 

I use to think of her constantly, but she is slowly leaving my head. Not permanently, just off of the daily basis she use to be in there for. It was never a relationship to begin with and so far we are further apart then we ever have been. But I wish her all the happiness in the world. I still like her and her conversations always made me smile. I don't know what the future hold let alone what is going on with her... But I am not going to stop trying to find my own happiness. I have become more content with being alone than I ever was. I have transformed myself on multiple occasions throughout the past 3 years, many of which have been because I didn't want to look bad in her eyes. If she finds happiness is someone else then who am I to say no to that? And I am not going to stop looking for happiness myself. I still like her, far more than I possibly thought. Love her? If things were different I might but there in no certain way i could say that right now. We are both young still have a lot of time left in our lives. 

and who knows.... maybe it's just not our time yet."

So, about two years ago, I stopped playing college athletics (football) to start an internship and further my career opportunities.  After not playing/exercising/working out much for two years, i put on a few lbs.  I have always been a bigger guy as I have played Tight End and Linebacker in HS, and Linebacker in college.  (6'1"", and 225 during season), however after 2 years of not working out as much, and mainly keeping the same eating habits, I noticed myself getting larger and I was around 245ish lbs.   

I am not new to working out or running or anything.  But my goals are different.  Instead of trying to get bigger/stronger/faster and bulk up for athletics.  My goal now is to cut weight and thin/lean myself out.  However, I still want to keep/maintain the muscle that I have worked for that is underneath this body fat.  

Normally when bulking/building the general consensus is to eat extra calories and protein to feed the muscles and body.  If I were to cut my caloric intake to say around 1500-1700 calories/day and workout...   

I would obviously be below my required calories and lose weight.  But would I lose muscle?  Should I just lower my calorie intake, and do large amounts of cardio...cut down to like 200 lbs in a few months.  Then work on bulking/building?  

Tl:DR  

Whats the best way to cut/slim/lean out from say ~250 lbs --&gt; 200 Lbs without losing too much muscle?

2rr4el,41,2015-01-08,SO and I (both 26) have been working towards FI for 4.5 years now. Thoughts on using some of our savings and supplemental income for jumpstarting an income property portfolio vs. paying off student loan debt?,TomLongdong,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2rr4el/so_and_i_both_26_have_been_working_towards_fi_for/,"Hello All!


I recently discovered /r/financialindependence through /r/personalfinance and I think my questions and overall goals fit better here.


My girlfriend (soon to be fiance hopefully) and I hope to achieve  financial independence before we’re 50.  One of the great things that has helped us so far is me being a graduate student for the past 4.5 years my income has been lower and less secure than my peers, which initially put me in a savings-focused mindset once I graduated college.  She also did not have a very high-paying job starting out from college, so we’ve both become accustomed to a pretty low-cost lifestyle.  When we get extra cash from promotions / sideline business / etc, it’s just extra cash for saving / investing.  Here’s a quick summary of what we’ve been able to save so far in the past 4.5 years:


We keep separate accounts, but here’s the combined totals:


Cash Savings:  $33,000

Roth IRA:  $34,000

401(k):  $11,000

Cash in Checking:  $5000  (not really savings, but included as cash-on-hand)

**Total:  $83,000**


We’re both 26.  I make about $27,000 after taxes (graduate fellowship) and she makes about $29,000 after taxes.  Since I’m paid by a fellowship and I expect to make more in retirement than I do now, and I want the extra flexibility of being able to withdraw my contributions, I choose to make my entire $5500/year contribution to a Roth IRA.  Since she works for a company she gets 401(k) matching that she maxes out.


We also have combined about $72,000 in student loan debt from undergrad that has hindered our ability to save as much as we could.  We have been on income-based repayment so it’s $500/month.  I’ll talk about this in more detail when I get to my question.


One of the reasons we have been able to save up so much on our salaries is because I have had 3 engineering internships while in grad school.  This supplemented my fellowship income.  Each internship is only 12-15 weeks, but pays $30-$35 an hour, so I walk away with about $10,000 from each one after taxes and expenses associated with relocating for the internship.  I’m also very fortunate to have an SO who is very supportive of me being absent for several months to make money on the side like this.  I also earn some sideline income helping people with writing resumes / cover letters / other professional documents.  We also rent out the spare bedroom in our townhome for some extra income.


We use a shared google docs spreadsheet to track every income / expense.  A typical month of income / expenses is:

**Income After Taxes**


My Fellowship:  $2250

Her Job:  $2400

Rental Income:  $400

Internships / Sidelines:  $900  (average per month, often realized over 3-4 months)

**Total Monthly Income After Taxes:  $5950**


**Expenses**

Mortgage:  $900

Utilities:  $150

Transportation:  $250

Cell Phones:  $135

Groceries &amp; Household:  $360

Entertainment:  $300

Student Loans:  $500

Miscellaneous:  $200  (one-off stuff like ordering transcripts or something)

**Total Monthly Expenses:  $2795**






Anyways, in addition to just saving and investing, we’re hoping to build a portfolio of income properties.  We plan to slowly purchase condos / small homes in American college towns where the economy has stable growth and there's usually a high demand for rental housing.



While we're working, the rent payments will go towards paying off the property, maintenance, etc., and slowly build equity for us.  One of the things we're counting on is being able to raise rent about 3-4% per year; since the mortgage payment will remain the same this will allow us to pay off the properties well before the end of the mortgage.  Unless we have A LOT of extra cash sitting around we don't intend to put much of our own cash into the properties, unless the interest rate is significantly higher than what we can get now; instead we'll just let the tenant's cash go towards paying the mortgage on the property, while we use our own cash to invest.  While this does mean we'll get less cash out of the property from rent, It will keep us more liquid and able to invest in other things that come along.


Another side note is that as the properties get paid off we can use one or two of them as our “cash cows” that we can mortgage to get cash for other investments if the interest rate is reasonable enough.



Anyways....we kicked off our plan last year with the purchase of our current townhome (2BD/2.5B 1200SF) in a growing college town where I am currently finishing out my PhD in electrical engineering and she works full time.  We currently live in our townhome and rent out the second room.  The plan is to keep this property and rent it out when I graduate and we move.


I'm slowly getting to my question, just hang in there!



In addition to my fellowship and internships, I recently got some additional contract work that will net me about $50,000 after taxes over the next 18 months.  We have been considering using about $20k-$30k of this to make down payments on a couple other properties around town before we leave since we feel this is a really stable growth area.  Since these would not be primary residences, the lender would probably want to see 20% down on each, so we could either go for one $100k unit or maybe 2 x $75k-$80k units.


However, we also have that $72,000 student loan debt from undergrad.  This is spread over about 15 loans with principle amounts from $1000 - $12,000 or so.  Interest is around 4-5% on all loans.


**So, what we are trying to decide right now is should we use this extra $50,000 of income to jump start our rental property portfolio, or take a huge chunk out of the student debt?**  If we put all the $50k into the debt we could wipe out the rest using cash from our savings and be debt-free except for the mortgage on our townhome.  Wiping out that debt puts at least $500/month back in our pockets to save….it’s really a question of balancing higher total return in the long run versus short-term liquidity, but I think there are also considerations of what kind of interest rate I can get on mortgage loans now vs. several years from now, and if the growth in equity and rental income from the property will outweigh interest paid to the student loans over the long term….


Another thing to consider is we may not be able to get another mortgage loan until we pay off the student loan debt as we would be too highly leveraged…..


Anyways, if anyone has experience in this area some guidance would be much appreciated!


Thanks!!"

I just began an internship and am tasked with creating a restoration plan for a prairie on a parcel of land. The prairie was a forest as late as 2009, however an airport was built across the road and the forest was cleared. The prairie was planted in 2010 and managed until 2012. The previous owners of the land abandoned it, and the current owners took it over in 2013. No monitoring was conducted, nor were benchmarks for success set. I have a list of what was re-planted two years ago, but cannot take a survey until the snow is gone. I want to get started as soon as possible, but I don't really know what I can do until winter starts abating. We don't have a burn permit, nor can anyone presently apply any herbicide. I first visited the site in late fall (well after blooms died off), but could see that common invasives are reed canary grass, and plenty of bluegrass. The only shrub I could see out there was red raspberry. 

The entire parcel is roughly rectangular and about six acres in area. 

Do you have anything I could read over for winter management techniques in an early prairie restoration?

Thanks!"
2rrm7y,0,2015-01-08,The mixing of real time and turn based and its failures.,[deleted],Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2rrm7y/the_mixing_of_real_time_and_turn_based_and_its/,"During the recent steam sale I purchased the game Valkyria Chronicles, a port of a ps3 japanese turn based strategy game. I so far find it pretty good in most regards yet one aspect of the gameplay annoys me. You see the game is turnbased except for in one aspect. The enemy soldiers will shoot at you during your own turn. This would be fine if it was handled in a dnd-esque attack of opportunity kind of deal where they attack you when you move from cover, but instead they attack you constantly whenever your are in range, and in real time. This adds the annoying element of forcing you to immediately end your turn after you complete your action or risk having a soldier be killed. This is also combined with the fact that the enemies don't do this during their own turn. To be fair your allies do it too, but this is still unfair as the computers will end their turn instantly and with perfect precision. This could have been handled much better with an attack of opportunity system where the enemy will attack you any time you try to move and only with a full clip perhaps. 

This whole story has brought me to notice many other times that real time elements were included in turn based gameplay to great detriment.

**Example 1:** In bravely default when one of your party members performs one of the games super attacks (the actual name escapes) everyone on your team gets a stat boost and a triumphant song plays. How long does the stat boost last? Till the end of the turn, two turns, a set number of actions? No, the stats last until the *music stops.* I find this annoying as it unnecessarily forces the player to act quickly in a game that otherwise has no rush in gameplay. This undermines one of turn based gameplay's main ideas of well planned out strategy. Additionally it also makes it beneficial to speed up the animation in the menu. Some poor intern spent hours of unpaid labor animating those little flourishes and I am incentivised to fast forward through them.

**Example 2** Final Fantasy's ATB system. I get what it was going for, allowing someones speed to account for more than just turn order and even allow someone to have more actions overall due to moving quicker in a relatively subdued manner, but I feel it could be done so much better. It causes many instances of the players just sitting there waiting for the bar to fill up even though they've probably formulated their strategy a while ago, or forces the player to act quickly lest they be interrupted if they and an enemy are both near full, additionally it unfairly favors the computer who will always act instantly. The best example of a fix I've seen is in Radiant Historia, it used a sort of initiative tracking system which precalculated who would go and when and displayed it at the top of the screen and kept everything in turn based format while keeping all of the benefits of the ATB in Final Fantasy systems.


From these examples I have come to be very frustrated with attempts to bridge real time and turn based gameplay. I really don't like to make absolute statement but I kinda think real time and turn based shouldn't be mixed. Do you guys have any counterexamples of real time elements being used in turn based system without compromising the gameplay or further examples of mucking it up?"

2rs1h1,1,2015-01-08,Bidding adieu to my former self.,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2rs1h1/bidding_adieu_to_my_former_self/,"A little about me:

I am a 20 year old male who has been masturbating at the least once a day, to porn of course, for almost the entire extent of my sexually mature life.  

I was an ugly child, small, not terribly short but damn skinny indeed.  I got pushed around and excommunicated so often that I found it hard to feel confident in anything that i did and the vicious circle of self doubt and failure only increased the anxiety.  The only redeeming qualities I seemed to have was musical talent my grades.  Masturbation was a way to conquer the imaginary version of the world that rejected me so coldly in all other regards.

So that continued up until now.  I have had so many awkward porn-induced ED moments with women that I can never feel confident hooking up because I know I probably will have to cut it short before she grabs hold of my flaccid phallus and leaves in disgust.  I have had normal sexual experiences with long term girlfriends once I have become comfortable, but it was never really magical.  Not to mention that the sex always mimicked porn...I had so many expectations of how to perform and I even fantasized about porn during sex to help stay engaged...ironic isn't it?   

So here I stand today...life looks great!....on paper that is.  I am 20 years old and puberty has shined on me like a ray of golden sunshine.   I go to a top university in the US, I have a great physique (added 25lbs!), I get attention from alot of girls (thank you puberty and jawline definition), I exercise 3-4 days a week, play small gigs and coffeeshops with a few other musician friends of mine, party like a normal college kid, work a paid internship, and have aspirations of medical school.  EVERYTHING IS FUCKING CANDY AND SUNSHINE AND FUCKING RAINBOWS!....except for one thing....masturbation...

It has literally sapped the pleasure out of everything...I don't feel excitement, love, or much deep connection...I am always anxious now that I have become aware of my problem.  I tense up in social situations, this old neurotic eye/blinking twitch has returned, I can't enjoy or pursue relationships with women, and I feel like everything I have built is going to waste...it's like I can't enjoy it.  I know, despite what I might read, that all of this anxiety, depression, and soulless-ness in my life is because of the chemical and mental imbalance this is putting on my life.   I have fail HUNDREDS of times despite breakdowns and self punishment...I can't win. 

Here is where that all changes.  I am posting this today, January 8th 2015.  I am three days clean of PMO, but I have been a coward, I have squandered so much for those moments of pleasure that I will never get back, and I am terrified I can't win.  

I am posting here and engaging with the members of this board who share my struggle in the hopes that I may finally put this to rest.  I dont care who reads this...if anything it will be a motivator for me to read it.  If you have read this, I thank you dearly for your time.

Wish me luck...I will keep you updated

2rsgjs,11,2015-01-08,Hooking up with the ex - Part 4 (bj in the woods),[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2rsgjs/hooking_up_with_the_ex_part_4_bj_in_the_woods/,"This is a series of stories about hooking back up with Jess, my first HS girlfriend, after two years with someone else. Here goes, names changed to protect the innocent. Check out parts 1, 2, and 3, and my ""First Handjobs"" series for more from the same girl.

The summer went on, and through my internship turning into a new job, things at work requiring crazy hours, and Jess's own work stuff, we saw each other less and less. I think we both knew that we weren't going to do this for much longer. Still, when we had free time we always checked what the other one was doing. One nice warm day, a day that was still humid and wet from thunderstorms the night before; she said I needed to come over so she could show me something. I don't know what I thought she had to show me, my thoughts went to some sort of damage from the storms the night before. I don't know what she wanted me to do, and her parents were rich so surely they'd call someone to fix whatever it was, but I went over anyways. She said that she just wanted to talk, so we went for a walk around her neighborhood. Her neighborhood was a long road that branched off of a two-lane county road. This long road ended at a cul-de-sac where her house was. Lining the entire length of the road were large houses; an island of upper-middle and upper class suburbia in an otherwise rural area. While a younger me, a slim shady wannabe always felt out of place here; the new, mature, career oriented me took the chance to look around. Maybe I'd buy a house in a place like this someday. Naw, too many busybody neighbors getting all up in your shit. I daydreamed randomly while she talked until one question broke my distraction.

""Do you like my pedicure?"" she asked me.

What a crappy foot guy I was, I looked down and saw that her feet were absolutely perfect. This wasn't a cheap job, she went to a pro. They looked so smooth and clean, with blue and white toes. I just wanted to ravage them right there. She was also wearing brand new blue flip-flops, the cheap kind with the plastic top that formed a triangle between the first two toes and each side of her foot. Somehow I didn't even notice until she mentioned it. Am I really not horny at all? No way. I told her of course I did. We walked to the edge of her neighborhood and crossed the county road that separated her neighborhood from the more rural area. Across the county road was a smaller two lane road, which we followed for a while. We were pretty far from the houses in her neighborhood at this point, and the road we were on went to a wooded area. We continued talking as we walked up a big hill, but really I was distracted by her feet, which now had red marks on the top from walking the long distance in hard plastic flip flops. I could kiss those red marks better, I kept thinking. And lick the rest of her feet better just to make sure. When we got to the top, she asked if I remembered where we were. A flood of memories came back to me that I had otherwise forgotten about. When we dated in high school, if it was above like 30 degrees, we would go for walks to get away from her parents. One time when walking up here, we stopped; and she opened my pants, pulled out my cock, and jerked me off. This was another one of my first handjobs, but wasn't exciting enough to stand out in my mind until being here brought it back. I remembered what the cold air felt like on it until she got her warm hands around it. I remembered that we didn't have lube and didn't think of using her spit, so it felt rough until some precum wetted things up a bit. I remembered her turning with her back towards me, her hands still on my cock, to hide what we were doing when a car came past. But she didn't stop stroking. We probably looked like a couple of dorks to whoever drove past, her standing there and me practically crawling up her ass trying to hide my nudity. And I remembered her moving so I didn't get cum on her clothes as she jerked me to completion, leaving a little puddle on the side of the road. After I finished, we turned around and walked back to her house. Her parents only saw us go out for a walk and come back less than 20 minutes later. It was the perfect crime. I miss being young, I thought to myself.

""Do you want to do it again?"" she asked, ""for old times sake?"" It was as though she knew exactly what I was thinking about. She was playing her game, knowing exactly what I was going to want before I did.

""Sure,"" I responded, and without hesitation she unzipped my pants and pulled my cock out. She gave a few tugs before bending at the waist and taking the tip into her mouth. This was way better than the first time. She bobbed her head up and down like this a few times, teasing just my head, before saying ""We need somewhere more private, let's go into the woods!""

We walked back to the bottom of the hill, where the trees were a little thinner so we could get in. I followed her into the woods. She, wearing a hooded sweatshirt, loose capri workout pants that stopped just a little bit above her ankles, and flip flops, was struggling a little bit to work her way through the branches. Her nice clean pedicure and pristine flip flops got dirty as we walked in, blazing our own trail through the muddy woods. I'm usually not much of a dirty feet guy, but seeing it as it happened was quite a turn on. Still distracted by her feet, I had fantasies of this playing out to be another awesome foot fetish session. I pictured her taking off her flip flops and continuing barefoot. I imagined watching her continue through the muddy sections, the mud oozing between her toes with every step. She knows how turned on feet make me, so I know that if I'd ask that she'd have no problem stopping and playing with the mud with her feet a little bit before stroking my cock and taking a load of my cum all over her muddy feet. Maybe we'd find some berries or something and I could watch her crush them for me. Licking unknown berries off of her feet probably isn't a good idea, but seeing her mix the berry remnants with my cum would be so hot. My fantasy is short lived, though, I have to snap back into the real world to concentrate on pushing through the branches without getting caught up or hitting myself in the face with them. Branch scratches suck. Soon, we got far enough away from the road that we decided we were safe. She pulled my pants and boxers completely down so that they rested at my ankles. I pulled my shirt up to about the middle of my chest, which she responded to by gently kissing down my belly and to my shaved mound at the base of my cock. I put my hands behind my back to hold my shirt up and stood there, exposing myself to her. Her kisses continued to the base of my cock, and then up my shaft, before ending with long lick that went the length of my shaft and up to my head. My cock jolted, and I shuddered a little bit from the excitement. She knelt down, her knees on the wet forest floor, and started sucking me off. No thoughts, that I could detect, worrying about getting her pants dirty or how wet and cold it was where she was kneeling. Just 100% focus on giving me pleasure with her mouth. She started with no hands, and then added her hands and stopped occasionally to stroke me off while telling me how badly she wanted to see my cum squirt. Her light grip, combined with the wetness from her spit, made her stroking feel almost as good as her mouth did.

It felt sort of surreal to me, standing outside with my pants and boxers around my ankles, her mouth bouncing up and down my dick. Like I was completely exposed, anybody who really tried could probably see what we were doing from the road. I willed this away in my mind. I couldn't think of a reason why I'd stop on the road and stare into the woods, so why would anybody else? At the time, I didn't cum very quickly from oral, and she wasn't absolutely mind-blowing at what she was doing. This was probably nerves from the new surroundings, because she had given me blowjobs before and they weren't bad by any means. I just had to make sure not to cum in her mouth, which was easy for me. I took this as a rare chance during to look down and really enjoy the show. What she lacked in skill she made up for in enthusiasm and showmanship, and she didn't seem bothered at all that I wanted to watch her work. She would occasionally look up and make eye contact before going back to concentrating on what she was doing. She would move very slowly, letting me watch her lips conforming to my cock as it moved into and out of her mouth. She would pull her head back until just the very tip of my cock was on her lips, circle her tongue around the head a few times, and then slowly work my cock back into her mouth. The wind was blowing pretty good, even through the trees that surrounded us, so she would occasionally have to stop and move her hair away from my cock and her mouth. She let out a playful giggle every time she had to do this, like fighting the hair blowing in front of her face was a fun game. It was very hard to resist just grabbing her head and going to town, but I wanted her to enjoy this as much as I was. Overall it was a very sexy experience, and eventually the feelings built up to where I was close to finishing.

I hadn't noticed as she did it, but somewhere along the line, she sped up. She was moving her mouth pretty fast up and down most of the length of my cock now, rocking back and forth on her knees as she did it. I could feel her circling her tongue around my shaft, and my head pushing her lips open a little bit as she pulled me almost all the way back out of her mouth before taking me back in again. I told her I was about to cum, giving her a few seconds of warning before it actually happened. She made some sort of sound, acknowledging that she had heard me, and kept on going. The humming from whatever sound she made vibrated along my dick, pushing me closer to climax. I know that she doesn't want me to cum in her mouth, she has never been a big fan; but I just couldn't make myself stop her from making me ""accidentally"" do it. She'll pull me out of her mouth in time, she always has before. As I approached the point of no return, I gave her a more urgent warning. She again ignored my warning. I tensed up, clenching my muscles in that region with all of my might to try to avoid filling her mouth with cum. I just couldn't make myself pull out, I needed her to keep doing this even if she wasn't going to like the consequences. And this one will be a mouthful, there is no way it couldn't be. I'm so turned on and filled with lust. She's been awesome, I don't want to mess this up and ruin any future chance of blowjobs. Despite my internal struggle, her mouth gets the best of me and I get off. I can feel the spasms starting as I start to pump out cum. The first ""pump"" goes, and she doesn't react. My cock throbs in her mouth. There is no way she didn't feel it, what is she doing? Maybe nothing came out, the first one doesn't always produce liquid. She'll pull her mouth off now that she felt it, for sure. The next ""pump"" came and I felt a big squirt of cum leave my tip and go into her mouth.

The inside of her mouth now felt very slimy and more wet than before. There was no denying it now, my cum was in her mouth. I just came into her mouth, something I know she doesn't want me to do. About halfway in between the 2nd and 3rd ""squirt,"" she took her mouth off of my cock. ""This is where she gets pissed,"" I thought to myself, ""Why didn't I just pull it out myself?"" She still didn't seem to mind what had happened, though. There was no gagging sound, no sudden outburst of anger, not much of a response at all. She aimed my cock away from her and continued stroking me while the next few shots squirted and the rest oozed out and fell onto the forest floor. I looked down and saw her hand covered with cum, with a few streams running down her hand. Some of them were building up to where they were just about to drip off of her. Another one made its way up her sleeve and kept running down her arm. I must have had a look of disbelief or shock on my face, like I didn't know what do do or say. She broke the silence by sticking her tongue out and then flirtatiously saying ""See, I swallowed some of it."" In that moment, she was really proud of herself for that. All I could think was wow, she learned a new trick! She said she never was able to do it without gagging before. Wanting to reward her for her awesome accomplishment, I gave her a kiss on the lips, which turned into making out with my pants still down. I could taste myself on her lips. She really needs to be careful, she's going to brush my cock along the front of her shirt and get a tell-tale wet spot. She thought it was so awesome that I would kiss her after she swallowed my cum, but honestly I just couldn't think of any reason why it should be a big deal. We fought our way out of the woods and walked back to her parents house. Her dirty pedicure and slightly damp knees on her pants had to be a giveaway to what happened, or at least where we were.

This was the last time I hung out with Jess, and we only talked like one or two times after it. As I mentioned at the beginning, our schedules (and in a way, our lives) were drifting back apart. While our sexual chemistry was awesome, I didn't feel like she was ""growing up"" or developing independence from her parents despite being 21 years old. It was like she was still 17, which was fun for my dick, but frustrating when she would let herself be controlled by curfews or her parents taking away her car if she ""misbehaved."" I just didn't have it in me to try to keep us from going our separate ways. I think the feeling was mutual, because she didn't really text me back either. My last call to her was when I told her I was going to start dating someone. I don't know why I felt I needed to tell her, we both agreed to this from the beginning, but it felt like a good way to close out what we were doing. A few years later when I saw her and said ""Hi,"" she was with a boyfriend and showing me her engagement ring. Good for her, but she had let herself go to the point where I couldn't imagine being interested anymore.

While Jess was fun and I'm sure there are more stories that I will remember, the awesome stories from this crazy summer don't end here for me. I soon started dating a goth girl who was a nymphomaniac, was a fiend for cum, and had a heel fetish (a perfect trifecta). From a pure sexual lust standpoint, she's the ""one that got away."" Look for stories about her soon."
2rsky9,2,2015-01-08,Is there a situation where a Christian label should drop one of their highest grossing artists?,FirmBelieverMN,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2rsky9/is_there_a_situation_where_a_christian_label/,"I'm asking in part because I am indirectly part of a situation currently that involves one of the Christian Music's biggest names right now.


This artist, has been psychologically evaluated as an extreme narcissist who uses fear and manipulation to control those closest to him. Currently, he is in the midst of a divorce that he served as and act of love but has been backpedaling about it ever since. He continues to blame all of his problems either on those around him or on his childhood upbringing in an effort to shirk any current responsibility he may have. 


Examples of his corrupt moral character include abandoning his marriage to have affairs young adults from a summer camp where he serves as youth pastor (Counselors), affairs with fans while on tour, and even interns that work for his record label. He has also abandoned his children, with the excuse that he needs to pursue his talent so he can pursue his ministry in music. 


Are these the people we should be worshiping with? Do we put them on some pedestal that somehow blinds us from the realities of sin? If a record label knows anything about any of this, is it their job to offer help? What sort of justice is there for this family?


I know how scandalous this appears, hence why I have not named any names including my own. I can only explain my involvement in an effort to bring some validity to such claims. I became a family friend after attending and working as a counselor for this specific camp and while reconnecting during the winter less than a year ago, many of these details were brought to my attention by the wife, children, and mutual friends of ours. 


The extreme vulgar behavior caught me well off guard and was hard to believe until I received a my own harassing phone call from him. Since that time, relationships have developed and the extreme nature of his character has been revealed to me. Much of it more graphic than I care to share. This has been heavy on my heart as I support the family and see the toll his kind of behavior has had on everyone. Yet, he uses his narcissistic charm to develop lies and hide the truth from his fans, friends, and record label.

**TLDR; An artist uses his religious authority, fandom, and charm to commit heinous acts of moral injustice and abandoned his own family in pursuit of his so called ministry. What is his consequence, because as far as the label goes its like nothing has happened and in his own mind, he is the victim.**"
2rslaa,0,2015-01-08,My Girlfriend is Wife Material,TheAlphaboz,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2rslaa/my_girlfriend_is_wife_material/,"As the title suggests my post will be detailing why my girlfriend is wife material. No, to the disappointment of many, there is not a picture of a scantily clad Ahri cos-play. Nor is it about the physical attractiveness of my girlfriend. As my friend Keith aptly describes if you would wife that, it simply means that you would tap that several times all your life. We are talking about a different meaning of wife material. This instead is about the enabling of a young mans dream. This post will be long winded, many of my jokes will flop, few will hit, but I invite you to stay with me and allow me to express my joy to the community. 

In order to understand why I am so excited, allow me to provide some background. My girlfriend and I have been happily dating for over four years. We were high school sweethearts and are currently in our final semester at Washington University in St. Louis. We have never been on a Spring Break trip (individually or together) and were both making individual plans to go. I was going with my fraternity brothers in a type of bonding trip to Puerto Rico and she was to go with her friends to mexico or Hawaii. Both of our trips fell through. Admittedly it was exciting to me because my finances were dwindling. I dont work during the school year and had an unpaid internship this summer so the funds are definitely low. My gf and I did however come together and decide that we should do something together. It was the last college spring break chance, and I had some income coming in from coaching water polo. 

We decided to look around, mexico and florida to go to a beachy place. We are both from St. Louis and were excited to go to a warmer environment. I had seen expensive prices and decided that maybe cali was another location to look into. Having previously applied to Riot, I knew damn well that Santa Monica was a place I wanted to visit. I noticed the prices were lower than florida and much lower than mexico and so I threw my idea to her. Her response was full of excitement.

Here comes the drop of the bomb. I asked her to humor me and proposed going to the LCS games that weekend and visit the Riot HQ (which I think is a possible thing, idk). Keep in mind that this is the girl that knows league only through me. She has bought me a C9 hoodie, rammus hat, and CLG shirt. She has enough knowledge to know who Meteos is, mostly because he is in my personal rankings of top 5 men I would be romantically involved with (no homo), who doublelift is (complete with the Korean pronunciation of the one video), and that I want to work for Riot in the future. She also enjoys the occasional cos-plays and some champions in particular. Mostly she loves shyvana and elise. This stems from a dragon lady being a ""BAMF"" in her own words and that elise had cool lore. She has never played past the tutorial and hates playing online games with others because she says ""They always yell at me for being bad so I will just be bad by myself"".  

She replied that would be cool and agreed to both. Mouth dropped, knew she was awesome but that was super cool because it essentially amounts to losing a day of vacation time out of the 6 that we had taken. She also fronted the full amount because my pay is essentially monthly and I need one more to cover it fully. 

Finally [I give you our conversation about the LCS schedule](http://imgur.com/lKpAbnY). [Here is a pic of me with another eSports legend sporting the hoodie and shirt](http://imgur.com/XcAcYbC) Both C9 and CLG had teams at the Halo event in St. Louis.

TL/DR I have a dope ass girlfriend who is clueless about league but is willing to sit with me at the event for the whole day."

Quick background before I get to the question itself.

I'm currently an ACF certified sous chef with an associates degree in culinary arts, as well as dietary manager certification. I've done a year long internship at a well respected local hospital with their RDs and CDMs, and have 5+ years in the culinary industry in a variety of positions (including management) and kitchens (hospital, school and restaurant).

Lately I'm starting to get burned out on the kitchen scene and am realizing that working the late dinner shift just isn't going to work with my changing lifestyle. I'm looking to get into the dietary field, but with my experience and credentials, I'm not sure where to start looking. 

I'm highly interested in early life/adolescent nutrition, nutritional education, and sports nutrition. I'm unopposed to elder care/ltc facilities, but would rather work in a senior community than a hospital. With all of that, can any of you make recommendations for types of positions I should be looking for?

I currently feel like I am being suffocated. I live at home with my folks and my father has had a history of being abusive... verbally and physically abusive to my mother. My sister and I have offered and told her multiple times to leave, but she hasn't. The latest was 1.5 year ago when my dad tried hitting her and I got infront of her to stop him. My father hasn't hit my mom since I was about 17 since I have jumped infront each time, but I have tried over and over again to get my mother out...but she won't leave. 

This relationship with my mother has caused me to go to an in-state college instead of an out-of-state college. I haven't left even though I've had plenty of opportunity to because I'm afraid of what reciprocation my mother would go through. A part of me wants to focus on me because it seems that my mother is genuinely happy with my father and I can't do anything to help her. 

Recently my father has been more and more controlling with me since I've got a paid internship at a Fortune 50 company as a software developer. I've given him money, but he figured out that I was using money to invest into business ideas I had...now he's monitoring my banking activity and even got the password and login for my savings account... I have no idea how. Yes I was foolish handling my money, but it was my hard earned money, so I feel like I am justified in spending it how I want to since my parents haven't paid for my college or any big expenses. In addition, I've given my family money every other month, so I really don't feel guilty. 

I want to get out ASAP because I feel like its about to get worse...but I don't know when/how would be best. I've got my passport, and legal papers, so I can leave anytime.

 I'm too emotional to look at it objectively and I would like your recommendations. 

- Join the Army: I've got all my papers in. I just need to take the ASVAB and the Physical and I'll be ready to ship.This would purely be for escaping. I wouldn't starve to death. 

- Keep working at the Fortune 50 company, finish my last semester in college,  and stay with my parents until I have enough to leave. I don't like this one at all because of the abusive environment. I  honestly feel like shit all the time. More and more these days. 

- Travel to Thailand/Nepal. Any Asian country and do an apprenticeship to make a little money on the side and work on my business with my laptop. I've got a little money saved up, but it would be significantly depleted with an airplane ticket. 

- Raise Funding for my Startup and leave my home to an apartment with my co-founders. I'm raising funding for the business that I've labored so hard on and it's gaining traction. I love the work, but currently constantly worrying about my dad and my issues has been emotionally draining me. This would enrich me. This would be more on a techy apprenticeship in the U.S....I just don't know where to start and its scary.

How would you approach this? What are your recommendations? 

I've realized that I constantly slump because I'm constantly worried and on edge. I'm so scared and worried all the time that all I have left is self-doubt and fear. 

I know I am capable because I taught myself how to code. I got an internship at an amazing company. I worked my butt off to pay my way through college so far. I just...I am SO TIRED... I feel like I need someone to pick up and say, ""We got this.""

What would you do if you were in my situation? Where would you go?

Thanks for taking time to read through all that.

**UPDATE**: I'm looking for a place to crash in Atlanta. Things have gotten pretty bad and I'm looking for a place to stay till Monday. If anyone can offer a couch, I am grateful. "

Are there any temporary lodging for Vets? I've applied to an internship in ND in the Oil Industry, but if that doesn't go through I have no idea what to do.

* I'm a college student studying the sciences, so my budget, time, and artistic ability to create the costume are all incredibly limited; a lot of the elements would have to either be common wardrobe items, cheap, and/or able to be worn after the con.
* I'm also trying to find an internship for over the summer, so, depending on where/when the internship is, I may not be able to go to the con.  I don't want to drop a lot of money on a cosplay I may not be able to wear.

Throwaway of course. This is pretty complex, but I'll do my best to be completely honest, unbiased, and thorough (without including identifying details, as both men in this story are frequent Redditors). It goes without saying (or maybe it doesn't) that I am absolutely racked with guilt about all of the events that have conspired in the past few months but I believe that my boyfriend and I are finally in a healthy relationship and headed in the right direction for the future. Additionally, this is still really hard for me to talk about, and other than me and him no one knows the full story. Wall of text.
    
  For context, I am a college student in a degree with a pretty hefty study-abroad requirement (2 years). Just before I left to spend my first year in a foreign country I met Aspen, a friend of a friend I had never seen before. Unfortunately, he was attending school on the other side of the country, but after spending three intense months together over the summer we both decided it would be too difficult to break up and pursued a long-distance relationship.  

  For the first few months the LDR went well. We made the time difference work, our sex life was healthy, and while I had some minor complaints in general everything seemed to be going smoothly.  

  I'm not someone who makes friends very easily, but during my time at university I had met three people with whom I spent the majority of my time, Marie, Rose, and Karen (a guy). Although I was close with all of them, Karen and I quickly became best friends with him spending the majority of the evenings in my apartment. We connected in a very natural way, having similar senses of humor and interests.   

  As the months passed on Karen and I often teased each other, pretty innocently at first. We're both relatively flirty people and it started off as being strictly platonic, but as Aspen and I got a bit distant towards the end of the semester Karen and I got closer, eventually leading to an evening spent cuddled in my bed where we fell asleep together. Nothing happened, but the episode made me realize that I had stronger feelings for Karen than I had previously realized and I was extremely nervous to go home and see Aspen.  
 
  Miraculously, winter break in my home state went extremely well. Aspen and I went to Disneyland, and Karen and I didn't talk for essentially a month while we were apart. Much to my surprise, Aspen and I agreed to continue the next semester dating and he mentioned he would try to get a ticket to come visit me abroad. I left again teary-eyed but a bit anxious to see Karen again because in his words, ""our relationship isn't just going to go back to square one.""  

  So, I get back to my apartment and have a couple of days before Karen returns, which I spend with my friend Rose. I should mention that almost everyone at my program (&lt;300 people) thought Karen and I were dating because of how close we were, and Rose and Marie frequently teased us about it. ""It's weird to see you without Karen here,"" she commented when I showed up at her room.  

  Two days later, Karen returns and we start hanging out again. I've been talking to Aspen this entire time, who, god forgive me, suspects absolutely nothing and trusts me 100%. Karen and I are rather strained with each other for a couple days but the façade collapses when we drunkenly make out on a chilly February evening. We look at each other the next morning and promise that ""this isn't going to be an everyday kind of thing."" But of course, he stays the next night, the night after, and the night after that. It quickly becomes clear that we're both intensely attracted to each other and two weeks later we have sex.  

  I'm going to take a brief second here because hindsight is 20/20. Should I have just told Aspen immediately as soon as something happened? Absolutely. Should I have avoided doing anything with Karen until I broke up with Aspen? Absolutely. This entire situation was completely my fault and I have wished so many times that I had been considerate and brave enough to just've broken it off at the beginning.  

  Aspen and I are still talking every day, albeit not for as long as before. I start to get confused about my feelings for Karen. Am I just sexually frustrated? Do I actually care about this person? I, unfairly, start to notice that Karen fills in a lot of the faults I have with Aspen. For his birthday, I made Aspen a beautiful care package with an expensive wallet inside, purchased him a thoughtful Christmas present, and decorated a Valentine's Card that I spent hours to get perfect. Other than a ""Happy Birthday"" message, I didn't receive anything, and while I know it's petty to be hurt over something like presents my family takes gift-giving very seriously and I felt crushed when he barely acknowledged the things I had spent considerable time and effort picking out. Karen, on the other hand, woke me up at 9am on my birthday with flowers, two different kinds of cake, and a smile. I was drawn to the warmth and affection I felt was not being reciprocated by Aspen and received instead from Karen. He said ""I love you,"" sitting by the river on my birthday night.  

  Obviously I'm in deep at this point. I want to break up with Aspen, but he's purchased a ticket to come and see me. I don't know what to do. Aspen arrives and for two weeks Karen cries in his room at night after seeing us together. Aspen notices that something's up with Karen, but I swear up and down that he doesn't have feelings for me while Karen and I snuck off to be together, leaving school early or ditching a concert to hide in a garden. Again, this is obviously not fair to Aspen, and I recognize that I handled the entire situation very immaturely and quite cruelly.  

  Aspen at last leaves, and much to Karen's surprise I am sitting in my chair visibly upset after Aspen's departure. Karen gets frustrated with me for having conflicting feelings, and we end up sobbing on my bed for hours as I try to sort out what I'm feeling for each person. This is the beginning of April.  

  Karen and I plan a long trip out of the country for spring break, and I decided I would break up with Aspen before we left. I text him but as he starts to get upset I chicken out and ask for ""a break."" Before we leave, Karen introduces me to some friends that he knew in high school that were in town for a couple of days. One of them was flirting almost nonstop with me, but I chickened out of turning him down and he came back to my apartment with me. Thank god, Karen cornered me in the hallway, saying ""don't sleep with him, don't sleep with him,"" and I agree. The friend and I make out in the morning, which hurts Karen quite a bit, but we leave for the spring break trip without anything else happening.  

  While on break I don't talk to Aspen much at all. It's clear to me that after making out with Karen's friend I:  

  1. Need to break up with Aspen  

  2. Have to do some profound apologizing to Karen for the entire mess  

  3. Really care about Karen despite being a general fuckwad and see myself being with him in the future.   

  When we get back from our break, there's only two weeks left in the semester. I make the poor decision to tell Rose and Marie about Karen and I's relationship. Marie is relatively indifferent, but Rose is furious that I ""lied"" to her and of course upset that I was doing something to hurt such a nice guy. Rose and I's friendship is essentially ruined. After a few more days, Karen and I separate after a long night of holding each other close and crying until our eyes hurt, and I return to my home state.  

The day after Aspen and I's one-year anniversary, I end it with him. Karen and I begin Skyping every night, talking about how excited we are for the future and counting down the days until we end up in the same place. Aspen and I, who broke up amicably, continue hanging out. One evening, I invite him over for a drink. When he arrives, I'm making my bed. At the time, I had two twin beds that formed an L in a corner of the room, sleeping on one and piling other stuff on the other. On the ""stuff"" bed was a notebook Karen and I shared, writing notes to and from each other while in class to keep ourselves entertained. ""What's that?"" asked Aspen casually. ""Oh? That's a notebook I brought home from school,"" I said. ""Here, let's go downstairs and you can open the whiskey."" Both of us headed downstairs and as I started to get out glasses, Aspen says he forgot something upstairs and is going to go get it. After about thirty seconds I get suspicious and sprint up the stairs.  

  You guessed it, Aspen was reading the notebook. Aspen is incurably nosy (some people just are) and tried to say he knocked it over and then ""saw the inside"" while picking it up, but the upshot is that he got really, really upset. Understandably. ""So, you're in love with Karen,"" he said flatly. The rest of the evening we both spent crying and I apologized over and over again to him while trying to explain that I felt horribly and never meant to hurt him. I'm not proud of this, but I did deny that Karen and I had began a sexual relationship. Why? I guess I didn't want to hurt him more.  

  I tell Karen all about the incident, and he feels horrible, but we both see it as a chance to finally be more open about our relationship and become ""mutually exclusive."" This means what you think it means -- not officially dating but not sleeping with anyone else. I accepted a job to go down and work at a university with a company I belonged to in high school and we Skyped nearly every night.  
  
  Unfortunately, I don't know how to take what I have and be grateful for it. Aspen visited me while I was working and we ended up sleeping together. Afterwards, I kind of shut down and very evenly told Karen that I had fucked Aspen, which he was understandably upset by. Karen told me that his parents had finally agreed to accept my family's offer of paying for him to take a trip to see me.  

  Only a few days later, Karen came to visit. We had a lot to talk about with regards to Aspen, but because he's a wonderful, completely unselfish person he forgave me and only asked that it not happen again. We spent a blissful week and a half together vacationing with my mom and sister and meeting up with my friends. It was perfect.   

  Alas, Karen had to leave. I wish he didn't, but he did. One month left until the two of us were to return to school. As usual, lots of crying at the airport and whispered promises of things to come upon our reunification.   

  A few days later, I meet up with some friends to get my mind off of how much I miss Karen. One of them, Dani, brings a guy I had never met before to hang out. I immediately notice that he's cute, trying to stay calm and collected, but I still feel extremely flattered when Dani texts me the next day that he wants my number and to hang out again. Strangely enough, Aspen, a different friend named Em, this guy (who we'll call Pretzel because I can't pronounce his first name), and I go to a diner and hang out. I make the dangerous and irresponsible decision to invite them back to my house for drinks, but Em pulls out and now it's me, this random dude, and an ex-boyfriend drinking too much. Aspen gets a bit creepy (not creepy, but inappropriate maybe) and starts making comments about my ass that Pretzel backs up, and I get uncomfortable and go to bed. Apparently while I'm out Pretzel keeps Aspen from coming into my room while I'm sleeping, not as a protective thing, but as a jealousy thing. 
 
  The next morning, Pretzel says we ""really need to talk."" I'm confused, but I agree to drive him home. He tells me that he's really into me and I say I have a boyfriend. He says he doesn't care. I kind of go uhhhh and bail pretty quickly. I'm sure you can see where this is going. Dani texts me and is like ""Hey Pretzel really likes you, maybe you should put your relationship with Karen on hold while you figure out if you like him too."" I ask Karen for a break. A week later I'm dating Pretzel.  

  What? Yea, I know. Any disgust you felt reading that last paragraph is completely justified. I am horribly disgusted with myself for going along with it. As any cheater knows, agreeing to be with a guy is a hell of a lot easier than saying no, like moving with the current down a stream. This is not me excusing my actions, but I will say that I felt taken advantage of and pressured into saying yes. I tell Pretzel that under no conditions will I sleep with him, but a week later he drunk pressures me into that too.   

  Karen is distraught. He calls me every night upset, looking for answers, which I don't have to give. I'm upset too, but I have a horrible ability to block things out and I just focus on the three more weeks I have in my home state. Pretzel wants me to date long-distance too, and I don't want to, so I tell him I'll think about it when I get back. Karen tells me that his heart is broken in two.   

  I'm sorry, forgive me if this section gets rather abrupt and Lana del Rey-y. This part is still very difficult for me to talk about and it brings up a lot of negative memories for myself.   

  I finally end up back at university and guess what? Karen is my roommate. I didn't mention this earlier, but we agreed to room together back in April or May, so there's literally nowhere I have to get some space. Pretzel and I are Skyping for hours and hours each day while Karen and I try to avoid each other. I write Karen a note saying that we should move on from each other, and we both start crying and hold each other literally laying on our floor. I think I have this complex where I convince myself that the more difficult solution must be the correct choice, which happens here. Pretzel buys a ticket to come see me.   

  One week later, Karen and I start talking again and make out on our floor. I finally pull my head out of my ass and realize that I'm making things incredibly difficult for no fucking reason, as I don't want to be dating Pretzel, never really wanted to be dating him in the first place, and honestly don't see myself moving on from Karen. But of course, Pretzel has a ticket.   

  Pretzel shows up, the week and a half he's here is just as horrible as expected. Essentially I try to fake being in a meaningful relationship with him while he's here, but both Karen and I forget that I'm faking and the trip culminates in an evening where all three of us are falling-down drunk, in tears, and in a terrible mood. Karen doesn't talk to me without crying until Karen leaves three days later. Two days after he leaves, I break up with him, and Karen and I are finally both single at the same time. I go with him to visit his family a couple states over and we thank god have a good time.   

  It's been about three months since everything with Pretzel ended. Aspen and I are amicable but not close. I do not feel any temptation to pursue other men, and I honestly believe I am making progress on being a loving, faithful girlfriend to Karen. He is truly and honestly a saint on the earth for putting up with me and all the baggage I bring. I am not someone who shows emotions easily, but I believe that at the age of twenty I am completely in love with this man. We have similar life goals, career aspirations, interests, and both of us care for each other deeply. I truly hope that I am not using hyperbole when I describe him as the man of my dreams.   

 Recently, and understandably, Karen has been having moments where at night he'll suddenly sink into depression. I'll ask him what's up and he'll say that he's thinking about the things that happened this summer and how much they hurt him. I respond with love and affection, listen, and eventually we drift off to sleep together. I don't know if it's helping, but I'm trying to be here for him because, after all, this is a situation I caused and bear full responsibility for. 
  
  So, Reddit, here is my question. How do I take meaningful, constructive steps at moving forward when I've fucked up so monumentally? I really, really care about this guy despite the way I've taken advantage of and used him, and I don't know why he wants to be with me but I have never wanted to love and care for someone more. I understand that I come off like a heartless skank, but please at least believe that I am trying every day to apologize for all of the things that I have done to Karen and feel incredibly guilty. I've deleted everything that reminds me of Pretzel, thrown out all his stuff, even deleted photos of us together (which I've never done for any breakup).   

  But of course, there's more. Here are a list of some of the other things going on in our relationship:  

  1. Karen originally told me he was a virgin, but later revealed to me that his junior and senior year of high school were spent in a drug foggy haze with lots of random women and breaking the law. I honestly don't care that he broke the law, and we know that he is free of STDs, but I am incredibly sensitive about him mentioning the other women that he has slept with, to the point of walking out of class while he presented on the subject (autobiography class at a touchy-feely university). I'm still trying to work out for myself why I am so upset about the entire thing, but I get sensitive over even minor allusions to other women. That's probably really immature of me.   

  2. I was in a relationship with a man who consistently emotionally tested me towards the end of my senior year. He used me for emotional support then told me we were together but ""no longer official"" so that he could mess around with another girl, whom he paraded in front of me. At his birthday party she showed up to give him his present and he didn't even care that he upset me. I'd never had my bound violated in that way before and two years later it still weighs heavily on me. I know I have taken out some of these feelings of insecurity on Karen.   

  3. I feel like I take two steps forward and one step back. Recently I staffed an OKCupid event at my previous internship where a guy chatted me up and invited me to a concert with him. Unthinkingly I gave him my name and he added me on Facebook not even hours later. Karen became super uncomfortable so I agreed not to go with him, and yesterday I blocked him on Facebook rather than continually have Karen worry over him. But then, yesterday I freaked out when Karen said he was going with some friends to a strip club.  

  Alright guys, I've poured out my entire life story. I know I've done horrible things. I know I've used Karen, hurt Aspen and probably Pretzel too, and done selfish, cowardly things so that I didn't have to confront my problems. But here I am now. Karen and I, as of three or four weeks ago, are officially dating. I went to my home state over Christmas and was not tempted to do anything with anyone else. I refused to get into contact with Pretzel and had one short and strictly platonic meetup with Aspen. How do I help Karen heal from the emotional wounds I've inflicted on him and stop being so insecure with him? I don't deserve him, but I'm grateful every day that he's still around and I want to move in a positive direction in the future. I expect a flood of PMs calling me a slut, but please, I'm very lost at what to do next and greatly in need of advice. I'm sorry if this has gotten a bit gargled. Thank you so much.

**tl;dr**: I'm a cheating whore but I actually fell in love. How can I stop being so insecure and take positive, meaningful steps towards a future with him?"

I've asked friends and family about what to do and everyone seems to have a different approach; I'd love to hear some refreshing ideas from other people.

She is a bit crazy and has had a terrible past history of boyfriends abusing, cheating, abandoning, and even raping her. Although slightly crazy (mainly attachment, general distrust and self confidence issues) she is all around an awesome girl; she's sweet, loving, attractive, and has changed a ton about her to accommodate my lifestyles. Since I am the first legitimately nice boyfriend she's had, she has latched on to me very tightly. That's fine by me, but sometimes I enjoy a little guy time to hang out with friends and family. That's not my only issue though, over time I've become a push over and if I don't act how she wants me (hanging out with her over friends, doing a romantic gesture on facebook, wanting to want to do something she wants to do) she'll essentially scold me and I'll simply apologize. I still retained a bit of a backbone when it came to career based decisions and took a summer internship 6 hours away from her. This was my way of testing the waters of our relationship, to see if we could handle a little distance. She was pissed off. I had to call her at least 3 hours every night, not socialize with other interns and we had to see each other every weekend. We got into fights every other night and it was terrible. I feel like a fool for not ending it then. 

For a little background, my girlfriend and I go to college, I will be graduating in May 2015 (B.Sc) but she finishes in May 2016 (M.S). 

Month 9: I am almost at the point of wanting to end the relationship. I still feel for her a lot and her happiness is something that means a lot to me. I was currently in a dual B.S. and M.S program for Mech. Eng. and am looking for an excuse to make things not work out between us. 
Month 10: I interviewed with a company far from where we live. This is an issue with her. She has to live right next to her family back in her hometown, or at least within 2 hours of home. I kinda hate the area and want to move out west (we're on the east). Unfortunately, this was her ""one"" main wish. I am ready to use this job as an excuse to bolt at this point. Any offer would be good. I get an incredible offer (insanely good) and I decided not to tell her for fear that she might convince me not to take my dream job. I decide to wait until finals are over to tell her and try to break up at that point. 

Breakup #1: Tell her she's amazing but I can't continue, etc. etc. She freaks out punches the fridge, the wall, cries a ton and tells me I was her last hope and that she'll never be happy and she'll go straight to an abusive person. She also used to tell me that when she caught her ex cheating on her she cut herself and almost jumped in front of moving cars to make him feel bad. I freak out and apologize, because I do care about her. Now she can't get over how I chose a career over her and made me tell her family over christmas that I chose money over love. Which is not the case at all. We've lasted a couple weeks since then, but I feel like things are getting worse between us and I just want some suggestions on how to break up. Last time I thought it would be a good idea to pack my stuff up out of her apartment so I could quickly get out and not leave my crap laying there for her to see. That turned into her believing I was just going to up and leave without saying anything. 

I just want to know what you guys think I should do. I'm currently back home, away from her, for two days. Should I tell her as soon as I get back and quickly grab all my junk? Should I wait it out for a while until I move far away for my job while she finishes her masters (my great uncle called that a UD, unacceptable distance)? Should I slowly adjust myself until she wants to break up with me? 

I'm leaning to the first option since I care about her and don't want to be a dick. Any suggestions are welcome.

tl;dr
Girlfriend has separation, attachment, and confidence issues. She may hurt herself if I break up with her and I wouldn't like that since I do care about her. I tried breaking up with her before, but she threatened to hurt to herself and I couldn't bear that. I want to let her down easy, but she always twists my words into something bad. I just want it to be over with no harm done to either of us. Sorry about writing a book, it's late and I'm stressed out."
2rtv8j,177,2015-01-09,Gf (f24) wants me (m31) to end relationship with (17f) - what to do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rtv8j/gf_f24_wants_me_m31_to_end_relationship_with_17f/,"So, the title sounds entirely more salacious than what I'm actually about to type, I guess. I probably should have said ""friendship"" instead of ""relationship."" I can't change the title, though...


I'm in a relationship that's been going on for over two years with a girl who is, in general, very nice and caring; I love her quite a bit. However, her behavior is worrying me, especially her behavior in regard to a certain friend of mine - the 17 year old.


I know this 17-year-old through my girlfriend: she asked me to help her in a program she was running to help underprivileged high school aged youth prepare to apply for college. I was popular with everyone there, and this one girl, who has become a friend, asked for my contact information for more help. I obliged.



I talked with her about a number of different things around her college applications, and met up with her to talk about her essay. At the same time, we began to talk about other things: her family, her childhood, etc. Her parents were in a terrible divorce when she was a child; she misses her father. Her older brother has gotten into crime and such things. She confided things to me, and I encouraged her to continue to talk about these things. In the process, we became friends: I started seeing her sort of as a younger sister, sort of paternally, and she is happy to have an adult figure in her life who listens to her and gives her advice. We talk a lot. I give her advice. She was having some trouble with her boyfriend, and I gave her advice that she use and, in turn, improved her relationship with him (communicate more, I told her - don't just assume he knows why you're mad and become more enraged when he's not sure how to respond. She told him, he responded, they became happier together. I felt like a decent person.)



Meanwhile, the insular community in which my girlfriend and my young friend live (big city, but small ethnic enclave) has been abuzz with rumors: the white guy is spending a lot of time talking to this girl, they say. Something must be going on! My girlfriend heard these rumors and became incensed. She began to take offense at things I did with this girl. I gave her a ride a couple of weeks ago, for example, to the community program we both volunteer at.



In defense of my gf, she's upset because she thinks I ignore her for my young friend. My girlfriend had her wisdom teeth pulled, and I took the day off of work to spend with her. The next day, she told me, her family was going to take care of her, so I shouldn't come. I didn't, went to the young friend's soccer game - and then the gf called saying that her family hadn't shown up. I said I was at the soccer game, but I'd come straight away, which I did. Still, my girlfriend accused me of putting the young friend over her.


Now she is always mad at me about this girl, and says I must stop talking to her. Two problems with this: first, it seems to me that it's wrong to demand a significant other end a friendship. Also, my young friend has had a lot of people walk out of her life on her: her father, her brother, another of her friends is about to move to California. It really bothers me to have built a bond of friendship with her, and then to just also walk out on her. I wouldn't put her over my girlfriend per se, but it hurts me to hurt another person in such a way.


On the other hand, my gf does have a point about the age difference seeming strange - and she is right that the neighbors are buzzing and gossiping about our friendship.


What should I do?


EDIT: I appreciate all of your comments, even the ones that are a bit harsh. The ones that are just slander - well, whatever. But a number of you have suggested that I should hang out with the friend and my girlfriend together. This is what I want! But my girlfriend says she doesn't have time, that she doesn't like the family, that she's mad that someone is spreading rumors.

Also, it's very sad to me that so many of you just assume that any relationship between an older man and a younger woman is automatically sexual, or leading to sex, or something else along those lines. I think the problem for many young people today is that hey don't have *enough* interaction with adults: they spend all their time with each other. What about people from broken homes, in communities that are troubled and full of bad behavior?

Her parents aren't being very helpful to her at all. I'm the one who's been trying to get her to spend time on her college applications, who's been helping her strategize about internships, and how to interact with people in a better way than before. What do I get out of it? Doesn't anyone of you who automatically thinks ""SEX"" ever have the feeling of happiness at helping a person you've come to care about - platonically! - achieve?

I'm really hoping this girl leaves here for college. There are all sorts of negative influences, and I, as her friend/mentor/whatever, want her to go and have a good college experience. I want her to not be stuck in her county, at a third-rate community college. I see potential in her; this is why I began talking to her more in-depth at this program (which wrapped up). The friendship/mentorship/paternal feeling just happened along the way.

I'm sorry for the rant, but it just pains me that there is such a rush to judgment. I mean, it doesn't hurt me, but what about other well meaning people who really want to make a difference in some particular person's life? All this talk of ""impropriety"" will set them off. I'm glad I had older people to guide me when I was younger, and I hope that, as much as possible, every young person does.

Again, sorry for the rant in this long edit.

EDIT 2: For those of you who called me a ""jerk"" or something else along those lines for not spending the day after my gf had her tooth pulled with her: I wanted to! She told me that it would not be possible, as her family would be there (there has been some friction between me and her family over cultural matters). As far as I knew, I was not welcome. As soon as I was welcomed/found out she needed me, I told my friend that I had to get going to help our my gf, and rushed over, speeding like a madman.


**tl;dr My girlfriend is upset about a legitimately platonic friendship with a younger girl and wants me to call that off. I understand her fears, but also don't feel that it's right to betray a friend in such a way.**"
2rtz75,0,2015-01-09,I wasted 5 years of my life on a girl and sacrificed everything only to lose it all...My life has ended at the age of 21,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2rtz75/i_wasted_5_years_of_my_life_on_a_girl_and/,"In high school I fell for a girl but never got the chance to tell her. I left to university to a different country feeling regretful and sorrow. I added her on facebook and she accepted. Naturally, one would expect that you would forget your high school crushes and move on in university but that wasn't the case with me. I just couldn't forget her. We weren't friends or anything, we spoke only once before in school and that was it. But why, I don't understand why I couldn't move on.


I stalked her on facebook almost everyday ( I know it's creepy) I felt like I was obsessed with her. I saw pictures of her with other guys and felt so hurt inside. I fell in to heavy depression. I couldn't feel happiness anymore. My mental and physical health suffered greatly. 


My grades in university dropped and I was failing badly. I was a grade A student in high school but in university I stopped trying at all. I couldn;t overcome the depression I felt because of her. 


Soon after I realized she moved to the same country as me but in a different city. My only chance was to move their and give it a shot. I did things which were not right to land an internship there in the same city as her...


I hopelessly went to her campus hoping to bump in to her and one day on facebook I realized she was going to an event and I decided to go. I saw her there and afterwards I spoke with her. It went well and she offered me her number! I never felt this happy in my life! It was like my suffering and depression didn't exist. We texted and stuff aand was going well. I though I finally had a chance with her.

But now my demise began...We had an old fb convo and it was very awkward and messed up from my part and I sent her a thumbs up by mistake. Realizing how big of an error this was as she realized that  that weird fb me was the one she met...


Also, I texted her after her exams asking how it went and she didnt reply. I though she went to holidays but I was skeptical...


Reality hit me up later. At work, I got an email questioning my legitimacy for my internship. I fell in to depression thinking about losing this job that I had in the same city as her. But things got worst, the very next day I was at campus and I saw her there...with another guy. There body language seemed they were closer than friends and she walked right past me ( and saw me obviously) as I pretended to talk to my friends. I saw them and the guy kept rubbing her back multiple times as they walked with each other. I fell in to an emotional mess, I started punching the walls at campus and couldn't control myself.


And now I have lost my internship, university, the girl and everything. The depression I feel now is so great that I wish my suffering would end. I was a joke. The girl I pictured wouldn't let random guys touch her like that. I felt so hurt...I spent years for her and it all went to nothing. She didn't even care about me. She never even knew how I really felt about her. I risked my career, life, friends, family over her and I lost it all. 


All this time I was living a lie, the lie of living.

I've played with computers all my life, but I've only done very small things. I've only recently declared my major as computer science, but I'm much more interested in servers(like setting them up, keeping them up and running, maintaining them, and keeping them secure) so I switched it to Computer and Information Systems, but I have no idea what to start learning. I know there are a lot of areas that need to be covered(like DHCP, DNS, SMTP) and I was wondering if anyone could give me a quick run down of what people usually start off learning. And maybe show me some good videos or some books I can read. I'm more interested in the books because I travel a lot on the weekends and I would love to read up on things I need to learn while traveling. 

Another question I have is: what is a good starting job for someone like me? I do have personal experience building and repairing my PC as well as friends too, but no professional experience. I've been looking at an internship at blizzard (system administrator network operations) but that is being very hopeful because I will need to learn the basics of networking principles and shell scripting before February.

Anyway, any advice is helpful, thanks!"

2ruex5,1,2015-01-09,Not ready to be an adult...[bit of a rant],[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2ruex5/not_ready_to_be_an_adultbit_of_a_rant/,"Before you just label me as a spoiled brat, I want to lay out that I was adopted. As a child, I grew up in complete poverty and was often homeless while living with my abusive mother...I think that coupled with my parents' endless love for me have made me unfit for adult life, which is approaching soon after graduation.  
  
I want to live on my own, find a job, all that, but I'm having a lot of difficulty being independent. I rely on my parents 100% financially and have codependency issues that I think are a product of the lack of love in my childhood and the overabundance of it after I was adopted.  
  
I do not know where to start and it's frightening.  
  
I've had three jobs in the past few years. My last one lasted a month. I didn't like working with ""trashy"" people in food service. So I quit.  
  
Last year I worked as a computer lab technician and just didn't like going into work and would be late or just call in ""sick."" I didn't like sitting around all day and my boss didn't know English very well so communicating with her was difficult.  
  
My first job lasted 2 years. I did PR for a multicultural center. I was really good at it, but had to leave because I was institutionalized for trying to kill myself (morbid, but stating it because I think it's a legitimate reason lol.  
  
My parents have expressed their worries that I'll have trouble being independent after school. They will ways be there for me, but once I graduate I want to try to be completely independent. I don't know where to begin.  
  
I'm taking a gap year before law school (professional work is something I like doing and am comfortable doing...I don't think I'm ""above"" retail or food service, but I don't think I'm the right person for it). I was thinking about getting a job and an apartment on my own for that year instead of living with my parents because I think I need a wake up call.  
  
I know I need to grow up, but it's tough.  
  
I think...I really relied on the excuse about my terrible childhood. Homelessness, poverty, prostitution...those aren't things a child should go through. But I think my parents tried to make up for it too much and it has actually hurt me a bit (though obviously not as dramatically).  
  
I told my parents about getting a job and my own apartment for a year and they told me they would rather have me stay at home. I'm 21!!! I feel like I need to become independent so I can grow up a bit.  
  
I'm also scared though. My parents pay for everything. School, my car, clothes, everything. They told me I have to finance law school and living expenses on my own...and I'll be in either NYC, Boston, or LA for this. That is scary!!! So I feel like I should get practice experience for my gap year so I can adapt to independence before being thrown into the city.  
  
I know I'm immature and underdeveloped and a bit spoiled. But I don't want to be. I want to grow.  
  
Here are some goals that I want in life:  
  
I want to run charities and group homes for homeless LGBT youth like I once was.  
  
I want to be a lawyer.  
  
I want children.  
  
I want either a condo or a town home.  
  
I want to be able to give back to my parents for all they've done for me. I want to make sure their elderly lives are comfortable.  
  
I want to support my god son, the son of my foster care sister, because my sister is poor and she needs all the help she can get. I want to help her and my godson out with college and everything.  
  
  
I always get what I want some way or another when I put my mind to something, so I know I can be successful at whatever I do. I have the talent and intelligence to reach my goals.  
  
HOWEVER. Despite the talent and the intelligence, I don't have the work ethic! I have many dreams, but don't do the necessary steps for them. The reason I'm taking a gap year to begin with is because ... I didn't study for the LSATs so I didn't take them in time for this upcoming year. I'm so lazy and have no discipline. I can start something and have a brilliant idea, but I NEVER see it through.  
  
I do have depression and take meds for it, but I'm starting to wonder if it's more than depression.  
  
Besides this rant...what I'm trying to ask is how do I kick myself in the ass and get the motor running? How do I grow up and grab life by the balls and take what I want? How do I make life my bitch?  
  
Help. I'm graduating in three months and I am not ready for the real world. Please don't judge too harshly. I'm being dramatic and am ranting with no filter, but trust me. The fear is real and I need help.  
  
The unknown is scary, y'all.  
  
Another issue is my mental health affecting me. Lots of things run in my family...bipolar, schizophrenia. I have depression according to my psychiatrist now it's certainly been a road block for me, but I just feel like it's been holding me back from getting internships and reaching some of my potential before graduation. I look at some of my friends who worked for tv stations and business over the summers when my depression was at its worst, and I just think...DAMN. I fucked myself over. My depression fucked me over. No one is gonna take me seriously when I don't have an internship on my résumé. I just...UGH."
2rv061,2,2015-01-09,IamA 16 year old male with narcolepsy. a very interesting sleep disorder. AMA!,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rv061/iama_16_year_old_male_with_narcolepsy_a_very/,"First post! New to Reddit. 

Okay, so I'm 16 years old and have been diagnosed for about a year. 
My first symptom was EDS (excessive daytime sleepiness) and I started noticing this in the 7th grade. I would be pretty tired throughout the day, finding myself with my head on my desk at any given moment. I countered this with coffee, and it worked like a charm. Didn't think much of it. Figured I was a growing kid and needed a lot of rest.

During the first quarter of freshman year is when I experienced my first sleep paralysis episode. It was pretty weird. I was lying in bed about to fall asleep, then I started hearing this vibrating, humming sound. I could hear my dog barking outside too. I tried getting up to let him outside, but found myself unable to move. I found this kind of terrifying, and the hypnagogic hallucinations kicked in. My roof turned into the night sky. The moon was way bigger than usual, and my dog started howling like wolf. A few seconds later, it turned into daytime. My dog stopped barking, and the sound turned to bird chirps. The sun had sunglasses on it, and the clouds where floating by at incredible speed. At that moment, I snapped out of it. Finding myself in my bed, same position I was at originally. I got up to check on my dog, who was sleeping. Of course nothing happened. I was pretty convinced I was crazy. More and  more weird sleep paralysis experiences began happening. To the point I would average 1-2 a week. From dogs playing poker in my room to being surrounded by the solar system. Each experience weirder than the other. I kept this to myself for about 6 months. I started keeping a dream journal, documenting everything happening in my night life. I still do this today.
I did some research, and came to the conclusion I probably had narcolepsy. I fit the description pretty well. Besides cataplexy, I pretty much had it all. I told my parents, and was surprised to learn my cousin also has narcolepsy. I went to a sleep doctor, and we scheduled a sleep study to find out for sure. 

The sleep study was pretty cool. I was hooked up to a bunch of electrodes that measured brain waves while you sleep. I slept pretty well. The room I slept in was a lot classier then your normal hotel. So I slept the whole night, then they woke me up after I got 8 hours of sleep and had me take 5 naps. Stay awake for an hour, take a nap then repeat 5 times. The conclusion of it all when my doctor was going over the test results was that my sleep cycle is very off, just like all narcoleptics. I feel asleep within 30 seconds - 1 minute during each nap and went into REM sleep within a minute, just like ALL narcoleptics. Normal sleepers go into REM after 90 minutes. So it was clear I was in store for. 

They prescribed me Provigil, which I’m still taking to this day. It helps a ton keeping me focused and alert throughout the day. Days without coffee or medicine suck. The day feels like a flip book. Going through the day in a fog, so tired you just want to go home and sleep. Thank god for medicine and coffee beans. I still get sleep paralysis though, but I don’t mind it whatsoever. I've learned to turned them into lucid dreams, which is an adventure. I rarely have any scary experiences, which is good because a lot of people tend to have those. When I do, it’s always after watching a scary movie. For this reason, I hate scary movies and won’t watch them. I find it interesting of what my mind is doing. Projecting my dream into the real world, it’s unlike anything else. I still live a productive life. I currently have a 3.9 GPA at school, work a part time job at Starbucks, intern at the hospital, and am heavily involved in ASB. Isn’t life awesome?

I just started work this week as a server working Saturday and Sunday full shifts and evenings on Mondays and Wednesdays. I will be starting a paid internship at the end of January working Tues, Thursday, Friday. I am also going to school on Mondays and Wednesdays.

My school and hometown are an hour away from the internship. I picked up the serving position in the same town as the internship to save money on gas instead of running back and forth. I have no place to stay and these bitter temperatures are too much to bear much longer.

My bills are as follows:

Gasoline- 350
Phone-90
Food-100
Car Insurance-180
Car PMT- 500

I understand that having a car payment of $500 is outrageous in my situation, however I had the car when I was working a different job making a significantly larger salary. I own a second car with no payment. I am still upside down in the loan, so selling or trading is not an option.

I expect to make $736 after taxes from the internship and around $400 low balling from serving. Bills = 1220 Pay = 1136

I need to be able to afford a place to stay but I dont know how. Theres nothing I can do for a third job and I need this internship and schooling very much for my life passion and to move forward and get a good job. I have friends I can stay with for free in my hometown but that would mean more driving expenses to commute!!

Please help this student poor decision maker out!!


UPDATE: I called the local cold weather shelter and they are willing to let me stay for a while but not permanently since I am not from inside the county. Thanks to the responses, I realize I have to decide whats really worth holding on to (the internship? the car?) in order to survive. This is not an easy process but at least I will have a place to stay tonight out of the cold until I can get it figured out! Thank You Personal Finance! I hope to use the people here to help me get back on my feet and on to the financial freedom and stability I need! With little debt and searching for a good job in the future, I have the platform I need to build a solid future from the ground up!

2rv74z,19,2015-01-09,Pocket Monsters Version,PaultheBreeder,PokemonROMhacks,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/2rv74z/pocket_monsters_version/,"Hey guys, a bit new here!
I came here to announce a little project I would like to get started on.

I am a writer who is an English teacher by day and a reviewer by night. I currently live in Osaka Japan and am coming back to my hometown fairly soon. As a recreational activity I want to begin developing this pokemon game that's story I have been working on for more than a year now.

I won't release the big details but would like to share a bit of a preview.

Introduction:
40 years prior to the incidents that took place in Red/Blue/Green; a new tale unfolds before the chapters of a story some presume concluded. Enter the regions of Johto, Kanto and Asaka in a whole new adventure within a time in the past.
New rivals and allies with familiar faces will try to trample or succor you in your journeys as you climb to the top of the Indigo Plateau... Are you ready to be the best like no one ever was?

Main Characters Overview:

These characters are NOT the only main characters (Don't worry Agatha is playing a fairly big role). The reason I chose these characters is that they will be dynamic as the story progresses.

Protagonist: 
Just a few days after your 16th birthday you enroll in a field researcher program for the Cinnabar Labs. Born in Sinnoh, you migrate to Kanto after being accepted for the program. Selected as an intern you will be assigned a specific pokemon to aid you throughout your quest. You are not quite fond of pokemon and don't look at them beyond data for your future research assessments. As your adventure progresses; however, you learn much from your new found companion encouraging you to take on new challenges and achieve much more than the goals you have set out to do.

Samuel Oak:
Considered to be somewhat of a character foil opposite to yours. Oak joined the program roughly around the time you did and stands as a competitive rival for a future position at Cinnabar Labs. He demonstrates his ambitions through arrogance. Oak does not share your indifference to pokemon for he adores and is fascinated by them. He too becomes selected as a field intern and serves as your counterpart throughout the adventure. His ambitions and fascination of pokemon keeps him a step ahead of you in your journeys.

Dr. Fuji:
The owner of Cinnabar Labs. Fuji is an affluent individual who dedicates most of his time in his research. He currently lives on Cinnabar Island in a mansion close to his work. At the beginning of the adventure he enlists Oak and you to collect data on wild pokemon. This would implement the foundations of a blueprint for the ""Pokedex"" forty years in the future.

Prof. Blaine:
Both a close friend and coworker to Dr. Fuji. Blaine is recognized as a mysterious individual who's motives in research is questionable at best. Regardless, Blaine's experiences in his travels have made him a vigorous trainer.

Mr. Silph:
Silph is the founder of the ""Silph Company"". He is the creator of most of the hardware for the early pokemon storage system. Although he is defined as an entrepreneur; his battling skills are often overlooked.

Braico:
Leader of the notorious Rocket Clan. Braico and the Rocket Clan control markets in multiple towns and cities found throughout the regions. Braico's Rocket Clan originated in the Asaka region. After having a firm control of most of the markets in Johto; Braico attempts to gain turfs in the Kanto region. 

Synopsis:

These are the main quests within the story.

The Research:
Like most Pokemon adventures; the collection of pokemon for research is a must.
Set out through out the regions and attempt to capture them all!

Gym Badges:
From Kanto to Asaka there are 12 badges in total. Each gym will follow certain themes different from standardized mono typings.

The Rise of Silph Co.:
Silph's storage system is facile for researchers and trainers alike. Utilizing the powers of psychic pokemon; Silph co. has managed to make a number of goods that prioritize on convenience for trainers. The most recent of these products is the ""Transfer"" mechanic. The transfer mechanic allows for the trainer to transfer their pokemon directly to their storage system after their party limit has been met.

The Cinnabar Conspiracy:
Rumors of Fuji's mansion are spilling throughout the Kanto region. As a person connected to the doctor you investigate to find out the truth.

Prepare for Trouble:
Pokemarts throughout cities in Johto and Kanto are occupied by Rocket Clan members. Originating from Asaka; this criminal organization is on a suburban conquest. For every market they own the price of its goods go up by 25%. Try to fight them off and give the market back to the people!

The Indigo Plateau:
The pinnacle of every trainer's career. If you manage to collect 8 badges and grind through the victory road the elite four await you...


One thing I would like to emphasize on is that the themes throughout the game will maintain a 1950s style approach seeing as it takes place in 1955.

My questions are:
&gt; Are 3 regions possible?
&gt; Would anyone like to work with me in creating regions?
&gt; What are the limits you can do with events?"
2rvptq,5,2015-01-09,Industry: HEOR vs Clinical/Pharmacometrics?,pharmaway123,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2rvptq/industry_heor_vs_clinicalpharmacometrics/,"Hi all,

I'm in need of some life advice right about now.  I'm a P3 student who has, up until this point, focused my career on health economic outcomes research.  I have a paper that will be published (2nd author) in the next month or so, and a summer internship lined up at a pharma consulting firm.  The paper will probably lead to presentation at ISPOR or AMCP.  So far, I think I'm on the right track.

Recently though, I've been trying to use my computer programming skills and I've found pharmacometrics as a wonderful niche where my programming has been very useful in model development (SciPy/R/NONMEM/etc).  My school offers a MS in Pharmacometrics and the graduates seem to love their job and make excellent money.

My concern is this: if I do the MS degree it's going to add on an extra semester to my schooling.  But if I go the HEOR route, I can get a job right out of school (admittedly, I'll probably have to go back for a second degree sometime later in the future).  I really enjoy both, so I don't think job satisfaction will be a factor.  I would really appreciate any input from people who are already in either of these fields!"

I read on this sub about all the people who seem to have 2 - 3 internships and a long list of extra curriculum activities on their resume and are still not sure if they will land a job. that freaks me out!

 At the same time here I am, with 3 semester to go and I am just now about to join the accounting society at my campus and planing on landing my first internship this fall. but after reading this sub it feels like it is way to little, and way too late. 

 the reason why I am late is that I have been forced to work at the same time as I have been taking full time classes, in order to support myself, so there have really been no time for this stuff until now. I am sure I will get a lot of hate for saying that, and that I am just a lazy bum. Maybe that is true. 

 Also fucked up last semester with a gen ed. class so my GPA is just 3.4 now. 


I have insomnia and worry that the last 3 years of my life have been a waste since my resume is too short. 

 Fuck me. 

 Just wanted to get it off my chest and also; what do you think? How do I fix this mess?

2rvvse,2,2015-01-09,I [28/m] am falling deeply for my best friend [28/f].,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2rvvse/i_28m_am_falling_deeply_for_my_best_friend_28f/,"**TL;DR:** I’m falling deeply for my best friend.  I just need to vent.  Any insightful thoughts from strangers would be an appreciated bonus, but this story’s about to get longwinded and I don’t expect you to read it.  Writing this is therapeutic and helps me put recent developments into a larger context.

**The Venting:**

I’m 28.  I was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S.  I came to the East Coast for an internship after my second year of law school.  I accepted a job offer from the law firm where I had my internship.  I moved to the East Coast after I graduated to begin my career.  I’m a single dad with full custody.  My son’s mother has been uninvolved for more than three years.  Apart from my son, I have no family in this region of the country and no help.

**I.	The Christmas Party, 2012**

Our firm hosts a great Christmas party each year.  Because I have no family here and had no local social base when I began my career, some of my coworkers were my first local friends.  I looked forward to the first Christmas party as a rare night out with my only local friends.  It’s a work event, so it’s important to not make a fool of yourself, but generally most people get pretty drunk by the end of the night, and those who don’t have a good time talking to the rest of us drunk people without any post-party drama when we head back to the office for work.  It’s a loose enough atmosphere that the firm arranges discounted hotel rates to offer in advance of the party.

It doesn’t feel right writing about her using a fake name, but I’ll call her Jessica here.  I’d seen her around the office.  She’s a paralegal at the firm.  We’d never met; just passed each other occasionally with polite hallway smiles.

The first year associates have to perform a roast of some of the partners at the Christmas party.  I planned to pace myself from the champagne toast at 4:00 until the roast at 7:30.  That didn’t happen.  From toast to roast, I was already quite drunk.  Feeling like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders with the awkward performance behind me, I hung out in one of the open bar rooms with a second wind, drinking beer and taking shots with different people who came in to get a drink.  Around 10:30, my hilarious 40-something-year old coworker who I’ll call Deb grabbed my arm in the hallway outside of the open bar room and said “Come on!  It’s time to leave this place and take it back to the hotel!”  Apparently Deb was mad because one of the waitresses on the lower floor told her that she wasn’t allowed to bring an entire bottle of wine upstairs and that she should just ask for a glass of wine to bring with her.  Pretty reasonable in my opinion, but drunk Deb wanted none of it.  So, off to the hotel with Deb to meet some other coworkers!

Because Deb is a secretary, the coworkers she was meeting at the hotel were staff.  It’s an unfortunate reality, but for some reason law firms tend to divide themselves socially along the hierarchy of the employees: attorneys have a crowd and the staff have a crowd, including paralegals and secretaries.  I fit in more with the staff; they’re more laid back and being around them feels less stuffy.

As soon as Deb opened the door, the smell hit me for the first time since I moved here to start my career.  I immediately yelled: “WHERE’S THE BLUNT?!”  There wasn’t a blunt, but in the back bedroom Deb’s equally hilarious husband who I’ll call Frank was smoking a bowl with Jessica.  When I entered that bedroom, Jessica’s eyes went wide in panic – I’m technically her boss, and I had just walked in on her smoking a bowl.  When I asked her to please pass the bowl, she began laughing hysterically.   We passed it around for a few minutes, then headed to a local bar to drink some more.  We sang a drunken, but fun, rendition of Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here” on our way.  I later learned that the song was her ringtone at the time, and a phone call must have prompted the singing.

When we got to the bar, she went straight to a guy at a high top.  Fuck.  I’d seen him early on at the party, underdressed and quiet, standing alone near one of the drink tables when I saw him.  The guy, who I’ll call Dick, was now clearly her boyfriend or husband, and he looked a little annoyed with Jessica as we walked in together laughing and talking in high spirits.  I had one beer with Frank, then called my designated driver to pick me up.  Trying to stand without stumbling and falling, waiting on the sidewalk in the cold, I thought (1) that’s too bad Jessica has a boyfriend or husband but (2) what a cool new friend to meet in a city full of strangers.

**II.	Relevant Events, Late December 2012—The Christmas Party, 2013**

I couldn’t wait to talk to Jessica the next week at work.  I asked her out to lunch and we went to Cheesecake Factory, her favorite place for lunch.  We talked about how much fun we had together at the end of the Christmas party.  She noticed how my eyes are different colors, and pointed out that hers are, too.  We learned that we were both teen parents.  She had her first of two daughters in high school.  We like the same music.  We like the same food.  At the end of lunch, I said: “Seems like we have a lot in common.”  It was an innocent observation that I instantly worried probably sounded like one of those canned cheesy lines that people say when they’re trying to flirt but can’t do it naturally.  She said: “We’ll see.”

The next weekend, her friend who I’ll call Sarah was in town from Denmark.  She invited me out with them.  Her boyfriend Dick (I found out she isn’t married at the inaugural Cheesecake lunch) was not with her.  We were all having a great time throughout the night.  Later in the night, Sarah told me: “You must feel good about now, moving to a new city and meeting a hot fun girl like Jessica!”  I just laughed awkwardly, not wanting to hit on Jessica and not knowing why her friend would say something like that when Jessica was in a relationship.  This was the last time I went out with Jessica anywhere other than lunch or an office event until spring 2014.  I learned that the only reason she was allowed out by herself that night was because her childhood friend was visiting from Denmark, she didn’t have a babysitter available, and Dick reluctantly agreed to stay home with the girls.  She’s 28, he’s 35, and they had been together for almost ten years at that point, trying to make it work for their girls but arguing frequently and splitting up temporarily a few years prior.

We started going to lunch together about every other week, sometimes taking a quick smoke break in the parking garage.  I get paranoid when I’m high in public, especially at work, but I just wanted to be around Jessica as much as possible and took just a small enough hit or two that it would wear off by the time we finished lunch.  Sometimes I was too busy and didn’t smoke at all.  We loved our lunches together.  It was our best way to spend time alone together.

We learned more about each other.  She has a sister addicted to heroin.  My sister was addicted to heroin and eventually murdered by an abusive ex during my summer internship with the law firm.  We became extremely close friends.  She came to me for help with all problems, trivial or deep.  I came to her for the same support.  Our kids met and had fun together at a few firm events.  Her oldest is the same age as my son.  Our friendship kept growing stonger.  Our lunches came more frequently; once a week and sometimes twice a week.

In the fall of 2013, rumors started spreading around the firm that Jessica and I were banging each other.  We were initially worried, but after nothing came of it, we ended up joking about it often.  She’s an outgoing woman, so as turned on as I would get by any sexual comments she made (“Ready for some garage sex?” ; “Time for our weekly quickie!”), I tried my best to take them as jokes.  At one point when she was in my office, she shut the door to vent about some personal problems and said: “Oh god, now the whole hallway probably thinks we’re fucking in here.”  I said: “I wish I could take credit for all of these rumors!”  She replied: “I’m pretty flattered by them myself.”  We both laughed, as always when we joked about the rumors.

**III.	The Christmas Party, 2013**

No roast this year!  Time to get loose.  Of course Jessica was with Dick at the party, so I just had a little small talk with the two of them before they left for another Christmas party hosted by the electrical construction company where Dick works installing wiring and stuff.  He wasn’t leaving her side this year, so the conversation was pretty bland.

I spent most of my time that night with a woman I’ll call Caroline.  She’s hands-down the most physically attractive woman at our firm.  She’s my “boss’s” (the partner I work for the most) main paralegal, a marathon runner, and a gorgeous 35-year-old blonde.  She gave me my first tour of the firm that summer.  She asked me where I would stay that summer and mentioned: “I have a big finished basement.  I’ll let you stay with me if you mow my lawn.”  She laughed and was joking.  I laughed, too, but damn I would have loved that setup!  Caroline and I were also good friends, as we worked together frequently and she made a point of inviting me to different happy hours and even a couple vineyards with Deb and Frank.  She was good friend.

As the night went on, Caroline started getting pissed that her new boyfriend was still not at the party.  He was going to be her guest.  She drank more, and eventually had my arm, telling people “I love OP” / “Isn’t OP sweet?” / “I’m going to marry OP.”  Damn it, Caroline, stop teasing me!  Eventually, her boyfriend came to the party, she ended up off my arm and on his lap in a conference room, and I went to take shots with Frank.  Several minutes later, Frank and I found Caroline puking her brains out into a trash can.  I held her hair back for her and tried to calm her down a little as she was crying and puking – embarrassed and very sick at the same time.  Frank went to get some water and a chair on wheels.  We stayed with Caroline until she was well enough to get in the chair so we could wheel her out to the elevators and down to the lobby to get in her boyfriend’s car and go home.  Caroline called me the next morning to apologize for how she acted at the party and to thank me for helping her.

**IV.	Relevant Events, Late December 2013—Fall 2014**

When I moved here, I leased a two-bedroom apartment to settle into my job.  In December 2013, I realized that my lease was ending in a couple months, and being a victim of procrastination, I hadn’t really considered any options other than renewing my lease.  I loved the apartment complex, but hated the constant banging from upstairs that sounded like a family of angry elephants stomping around constantly.  I was also doing pretty well at my job, and felt confident that I could buy my first house.  I began searching.  I narrowed my search to a specific school district in a nice suburb.  I was looking at townhomes.  I found the development I wanted.  I arranged a visitation with my realtor at two townhomes in the development.  Knowing that Caroline lived in the same suburb, I asked her if she was familiar with the development.  I was out of town over the holidays, so I just texted her and asked her.  She texted back: “I live there! :)”
 
Not knowing what the hell I was looking for other than a home that looks nice, knowing that Caroline was in the same neighborhood and had bought a home already, I asked her to come along.  We both agreed that one particular home was an excellent choice for my son and me.  I made an offer, the seller accepted the next day, and we closed in two weeks.  My best friend from back home was in town for a night before going to D.C. for an interview for a residency program at a hospital there when Caroline texted me: “I bought a bottle of Silver Oak to celebrate your new home! :)”  My friend told me: “Go now, she wants you dude.”  I told him she’s just a really nice woman and a good friend.

I went to Caroline’s the following weekend to drink some great wine.  Neither of us had eaten, so we went to dinner together.  We had another bottle of wine.  We went back to her place, talked for about an hour, and played with her dog.  She invited my son and I over for one of the NFL playoffs games the next day.  We went, watched the game, and I asked my son what he wanted me to order for him from a restaurant near our apartment  (hadn’t moved yet) for takeout.  Caroline said: “I probably have enough here for you two for dinner, please stay!”  She had like eight chicken breasts marinated and enough side dishes to feed a family of four.  She totally planned this shit.  This was the first moment I thought I had a chance with Caroline.

The next week, she invited me to go out with her friend and her friend’s boyfriend, saying she needed a “dinner date”.  We were going to share a cab home; I would pay for the ride to my apartment (the expensive portion) and she would pay for the remaining ride to her house.  Thursday night (the night before going out), Caroline told me she booked a hotel room because she didn’t want to take a cab home.  She didn’t invite me to stay with her, but I had nothing to lose, so I asked if I could sleep on the floor in her room.  She laughed and said she booked the room with two beds.

I wanted Jessica’s advice.  Caroline is a stunning woman.  She could get any man she wants.  Could she possibly want me?  I needed to tread carefully since Caroline was a coworker and a friend, and didn’t want to assume something was there that wasn’t.  Jessica said: “Don’t sell yourself short, OP.  You’re a great guy and a great catch for any girl.  If I wasn’t with Dick, I’d probably date you.”

We started at Caroline’s friend’s apartment then went to dinner.  Her friend’s boyfriend told me while the women were in the bathroom: “Dude, Caroline likes you.  Just play it cool.  Take your time.”  We then went to a strip club where Caroline’s friend and her boyfriend like to hang out for drinks (I hate strip clubs.), everyone was drunk, and during another moment alone with Caroline’s friend’s boyfriend, he told me: “Change of plans.  Caroline just said ‘OP needs to step up to the plate’ – you gotta make a move, dude.”  Somehow, and I do not remember how it happened, I was suddenly making out with Caroline.  A bouncer told us that’s considered a “sex act” and that we’d have to leave, but then he recognized Caroline’s friend and boyfriend and left us alone when they explained it was a “first kiss” moment.  Caroline’s friend bought us a private lap dance (To date one of the most awkward moments of my life – just starting to reciprocate feelings with a woman while a stripper asks you to spank her ass – really cheapened the moment.), we drank some more, then parted ways with Caroline’s friend and boyfriend.  We grabbed a slice of pizza and another beer on the way back to the hotel, then fucked like mad for as long we could before passing out.

I immediately told Jessica about my adventurous night.  She said she was excited for me.  I was extremely happy after feeling alone for quite some time.  Jessica came into my office a couple days later and told me she really wanted to go to lunch to vent to me about something.  She told me things were as bad as ever with Dick, and that she was going to leave him as soon as she could find a home to buy.  She had her finances in order and luckily knew some helpful people in realty and financing.  I told her I didn’t feel like it was my place to comment on Dick, but that based on what I’ve gathered from her, and because she asked me what I thought, Dick sounds like he’s been a complete dick to her and that at some point, she needs to do what she feels will make her happy and, most importantly, make her free (She’s not even allowed out on her own for fuck’s sake!).

Caroline and I fucked like rabbits for a few months, but because she was worried about the workplace aspect, Caroline rarely talked to me during the week.  That took its toll on me, as I couldn’t really gauge how serious she was.  One night, we were at a bar with her mom and stepdad, some family friends, and her cousin.  I don’t know why, but I just wasn’t feeling right about Caroline that night.  I had fun drinking with and talking to her cousin, but found myself texting Jessica both at the bar and from Caroline’s bed that night, who wasn’t pleased with how little attention I gave her that night.  I didn’t say anything flirty to Jessica, just told her I wasn’t having a good night and asked how she was doing and other small talk.  The next morning, Caroline told me that she thought we have a lot of differences (we do) and that I would be better off with someone younger (she’s right).  We’re still friends today.

Jessica stopped approaching me.  We only talked when I approached her, and only went to lunch if I asked her out to lunch.  I got the sense something was wrong, so after a month or two, I left her alone.  I didn’t hear from her for six weeks.  Then she told me her dad was diagnosed with cancer, and a bad prognosis.  She didn’t want to talk to anyone about it because everyone who knew constantly talked about it to her and it was driving her crazy because she could never get it off of her mind.  Now she was ready to talk to me, but not about her dad.  We both missed each other’s company.  We started going to lunch again, but not every week.

**V.	The Breakup**

Jessica told Dick she signed a contract to buy a home.  Their problems grew worse.  Dick smashed Jessica’s car window.  Jessica took her girls with her to her parents’ house.  She’s been living there since late fall 2014 until she closes on her home and renovations are complete.  Dick takes the girls every other weekend.

Jessica and I have been going to lunch at least once a week since the breakup.  She wants to go out on one of her free weekends, but so far one of us has been busy on each of those weekends.  One day after lunch, Jessica asked if I wanted to look around some of the shops for Christmas gifts for the kids.  We left Cheesecake and before we did any shopping, she asked if I instead wanted to have a drink with her upstairs.  We’ve never done this before.  Hell yes, I wanted to.  She asked if I wanted to take a shot before our drinks.  Absolutely.  It felt great.

The next week, we exchanged Christmas gifts in the office.  I gave her a Cheesecake gift card that she used to invite me to lunch the same day, the last day I would be in town before leaving for the holidays.  We went up to the bar after lunch again, same routine.  I went back to the office, tied up loose ends, and went to say goodbye.  Jessica was sad that she wouldn’t see me until the next year, and asked if I would wait for her to meet me outside the lobby for her to pack up her things, leave early, and head to another bar.  This shocked me, and I said definitely I would.  We had a great time, as always.  She gave me a big hug and said goodbye.

**VI.	Present**

It hit me while I was away that I’m falling hard for Jessica.  I don’t think it’s a new feeling.  I think  I suppressed it because (1) she wasn’t single and (2) I wasn’t anxious for anything during and for a while after the Caroline episode.

I’ve started traveling more for work.  Jessica told me it sucks when I’m not in the office because that’s when she gets to spend the most time with me.  I told her it’s “too bad I can’t travel with a paralegal.”  She replied: “Well, some can and we know what ‘happens’ on those trips!” (“Happens” means sex btw).  I said: “Well, now you’re just reinforcing my point” – definitely a blatant sexual advance, but I was having some drinks and dinner at the hotel bar and I feel like I need to start taking some calculated chances if I want to get anywhere.  She responded: “Ha, you better watch your tone! ;)”  That is some cryptic shit right there – does she mean (1) my smart ass tone, and everything’s fine or (2) my flirty tone, and she’s politely asking me to back off?  But why the winky smiley?  Aren’t those always a good sign per some unwritten rule of text-based communication?

Yesterday was her birthday.  We went to lunch with some of her other friends in the office (all paralegals except me).  She told me later: “Thank you for being an amazing friend to me and for always doing such nice things for me!”  I should have appreciated that, but instead I started stressing about whether she sees where I’m headed with her and it’s part of a setup for an eventual our-friendship-is-too-important-to-risk-losing type of rejection.  I told her she’s welcome, and that she means more to me than anyone outside of family.  She said: “You mean a lot to me too.”

So, I’m sure there’s no one left down here for me to ask, but what should I do?  Is Jessica even interested in any potential relationship with me?  If she is, it’s probably not anything that would develop in the immediate future, as she’s transitioning from a ten-year relationship and in the process of buying her first home, finally able to enjoy the freedom to do what (and who) she wants for the first time in a decade.  I don’t want to blow any chance I might have by rushing things and turning her off.  I also don’t want to sit by idly and miss the boat by behaving only like a friend to her.  I’ve been very patient with Jessica.  I’d like her to know that I want more than friendship from her but that I’m willing to be as patient as she needs me to be if the feelings are in any way mutual.  Right now, I’m prepared to keep making small moves, keep flirting when it comes naturally, and keep making it pretty obvious that I’m interested in more than friendship.  She’s been a great friend.  If she’s not interested, I think she’ll eventually be blunt about it and tell me straight up.

If you really made it this far, thanks for any insight you might provide.  I hope you at least enjoyed a stranger's drama."

Let's get one thing perfectly clear: I'm not even subscribed to /r/subreddit anymore and I haven't been for a long time because of the undereducated, cowardly twats that play God with the sub.

You're incapable of actually responding to liberal comments you disagree with so you ban anyone whose ideals differ from yours and you use ""OMG HE USED A RUDE TONE IN HIS COMMENT"" to justify it.

GO FUCK YOURSELF. Seriously. I guarantee I've been a redditor longer than you, my comment karma is absolutely much higher than yours and you try to pretend like you have some kind of official power.

I imagine there are a few educated, informed mods in the sub, but for the most part, it's full of community college educated republican sycophants and their buddies whom they've dragged into the mod positions to try to combat anyone who has a liberal point of view.

And the laughable part? Even though you've banned and obstructed most of the active participants of /r/subreddit who are liberal, the top stories are still liberal stories. Even with your uneducated, republican hate and ban brigade, you cannot silence basic truth and that has to burn some, huh guys? 

Take a look at my history. Like I said, I've probably been on here 3 years longer than you and nothing has changed about my comments, yet i'm one of the top 1000 commenters on this site. 

Speaks volumes about the shit hole that /r/subreddit has become and don't worry! I'll make sure people know that the Fox News interns run /r/subreddit now! Don't want you unsung heroes to not get all of the attention and praise and validation you deserve for being so brave, right?

I have found most positions listed as ""entry level"" require 3-5 years experience. I have applied to dozens of positions that require undergraduate degrees and less experience such as ""HR analyst"" but I have not heard back from any. I have even applied to internships for my last semester with no luck. 

I have heard that the NYC metro area has a lot of opportunities in our field, but it seems to be remarkably competitive. I have applied to positions throughout the country with the same results. 

I have followed all sorts of advice on job hunting. Unfortunately, my network in nyc is small and has not turned out to be effective. I am trying to expand my network through professional networks, but I am skeptical as to how effective this will be. The SIOP conference is not until April and would be a real Hail Mary. 

I have done well academically, but success in the field seems to be almost completely due to prior work experience. I am worried that I wasted the last year and a half of my life. 

What I am interested in hearing from r/IOPsychology:

* Any job hunting tips specific to our field
* Your personal experiences landing your first job out of graduate school
* Is the Masters level job market saturated?

2rwh9x,1,2015-01-09,How much should I save up for a Business Casual Wardrobe Overhaul?,zhandz,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2rwh9x/how_much_should_i_save_up_for_a_business_casual/,"So I'm starting to save now for my summer internship I will be starting mid-May.  Right now I'm hoping to save up at least $300 by the time the internship comes, but I wanted to see if anyone thought I should save more or less?

Right now, I have the basics: Blue/ White Uniqlo OCBD, Navy/khaki colored khakis, 2 pairs of Allen Edmond wingtips in walnut and that wine color ((can't remember the exact name).

The dress policy where I work leans more towards the casual in business casual, especially in the summer.  Usually people dress in a polo, khakis, and black dress shoes or something like that.

I would like to get new pairs of khakis, nicer shirts, and some more sweaters.

All that being said, does anyone have any advice on how much to save?  I've checked out the sidebar a bit and looked at some business casual guides to narrow down I will most likely be going to Banana Republic for my khakis and maybe sweaters, possibly Brooks Brothers for my OCBDs, depending on how much I have left.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"
2rwnb4,5,2015-01-09,Work dilemma. Advice for an intern please?,smootie,librarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/librarians/comments/2rwnb4/work_dilemma_advice_for_an_intern_please/,"**Background**: My department, like many academic library departments, is severely underfunded and understaffed.  Our reference desk is open 35 hours a week, with interns manning the desk for the majority of those hours.  The librarians fill in the gaps.

We are going to be short one librarian next month, so the department is trying to get funding for more hours for interns so that we can pick up the slack at the reference desk.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Dilemma**: If we get the extra funding, then there's no problem.  However there is a high likelihood that we won't.  If we don't get the funding, the alternatives are to either close the desk during the hours when no one is available, or have interns work for free.

I have no problem volunteering, but I'm afraid that it will set a damaging precedent.  I don't want administration to deny funding the *next* time this happens by using the rationale that we didn't need extra money this time (because we could just use volunteers).  

Library employees are already under-valued and I don't want to add to this problem.  But I love my job and care about my department and my patrons.  What would you do in this situation?  Would you offer to volunteer?

2rwo1m,3,2015-01-09,"My SO [27/m] and I [31/f] had originally planned on closing the distance with him moving to where I live. Now I'm considering moving out there where he lives, and need advice on making the decision.",_cuppycakes_,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2rwo1m/my_so_27m_and_i_31f_had_originally_planned_on/,"Hi LongDistance!   First and foremost, I wanted to say that I'm so glad that this is a sub!  I have been lurking in it for the past few months while in a LDR with my SO.  I've never been in a LDR before, and seeing so many others going through a lot of the same hardships that my SO and I are facing while living across the country from each other has been immensely helpful and comforting.

  
&amp;nbsp;


As the title states, my SO and I have been planning to close the distance at the end of this Spring/beginning of Summer.  He is currently stuck in a lease out where he lives, and can't move until it's up.  I was born and raised in the SF Bay Area in California, and currently work and am in grad school out here. 

&amp;nbsp;


Last summer my SO and I had a talk about me moving out there, but it was pretty early on in our relationship (we have been dating a little over 7 months now), and I was scared about leaving my home state.  My SO has a pretty good job out in Virginia where he lives, while my job is a PT entry level position at a public library.  The nice thing about my situation is my grad program (Library &amp; Info Science) is a distance learning program (read: all accessible online), so I can complete it anywhere.  Once the Fall semester began last year, I became bogged down with work, school, and an internship and me moving out there was no longer an option due to my time constraints.  Because of all of this, my SO graciously agreed to look for a new job out here on the West Coast and to move out to CA to close the distance.  Our plan was for him to begin the job hunting process at the beginning of the New Year in order to give him adequate time to find something and for packing/moving.  Additionally, this Spring semester is going to be my last semester of grad school, and I plan on graduating in May.   Our plan, though a lot of work for my SO, seemed like a good one. 

&amp;nbsp;
 

Now that we are in the new year, I have been looking seriously at my life here in CA, and about the future that my SO and I want together (marriage, family, etc.).  The cost of living where I live in CA has been steadily increasing over the past few years and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.  As much as I feel like this place is my home, I don't know if it can really be a sustainable place for the future home of my SO and I.  So right now we are stuck trying to figure out what to do next.  The more that I think about the pros and cons of my SO moving here as opposed to me moving out there it seems like it makes more sense for the both of us for me to move out there.  Some things we are taking into consideration are our careers (I'm studying to be a librarian, and feel that I can basically find a job anywhere in the country, whereas my SO has a good job where he lives), where we want to eventually settle down (East Coast/West Coast, somewhere else entirely?), the stability of current jobs and living situations (my SO has a better job, I can't afford the apt I am living in and need to move in a few months), and our degree of move-ability (I feel most of my stuff is disposable so I think it would be easier for me to handle a cross-country move).  

&amp;nbsp;


Has anyone else faced a similar dilemma?  How did you ultimately decide on who should move?

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: SO was planning on moving to CA where I live to close the distance.  I'm starting to have second-thoughts about the sustainability of a future in my state, and am now considering moving across the country to VA to close the distance.  Advice needed.

2rwqr2,9,2015-01-09,"Hey /r/ schizophrenia, I'm back.",callmestranger,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/2rwqr2/hey_r_schizophrenia_im_back/,"Hello, I was here under a different username earlier (/u/callmestranger1). I just want to tell my story. Maybe you're going through something similar, or you know someone who is going through something similar. And if you do, you should walk in to the local recruitment office and sing a round of ""Alice's Restaurant"" and walk out (Arlo Guthrie). Just kidding. That's from a song. I hope this helps.

So, I was a problem youth. I had high grades, but I started drinking and taking marijuana on a regular basis on weekends when I was 13 and 14. I learned that many people with schizophrenia are prone to teen alcohol- and drug-use. I was kicked out of summer camp when I was 15 for doing drugs, which felt like the whole world was crumbling at the time, even though at the time I remember thinking that in ten years it would be distant memory. 

My friends changed a few times in high school, so I spent a good deal of time with my groups of friends, getting to know them and that. Drugs and alcohol were always a strong foundation for my friendships. I threw beer parties at my parents' house. I exhibited my self-destructive behavior by crashing cars when I got my license. I have been in more than a dozen car accidents caused by me, some involving other cars.

I started to keep a journal and have strange dreams around 11th grade. My aspirations changed. I had seen university as a definite goal and life-time achievement until I suddenly thought it was going to ruin my ""street cred"". I thought I should drop out of high school and hitchhike across the country living on the street. I ran away from home several times my senior year after I was accepted to an ivy league university. 

When I went away to university I couldn't keep up with school work. I skipped class and missed assignments. I stayed up all night smoking marijuana and writing in my journal. I wandered outside at night and sometimes walked ten or fifteen miles. I wasn't eating enough I think partially because I couldn't get myself to the cafeteria during the daytime when it was open. 

I started going to parties three to four nights a week. I was lost at least once and didn't return until after sunrise. One time on a Friday, I crashed a party a couple miles from school and begged the host to let me crash there because it was a freezing night and I was too lost to walk back. Something good that came of my gregariousness is that 
I met my current best friends at a frat party I took my roommates to.

I was raped in my first semester of college by a man. I thought I had consensual sex and came out as gay to my roommate and friends of mine, all the time wondering why I didn't have fantasies about men. I spiraled. In my second semester I got in a fight with my roommate and was kicked out of the dorm. My grades stagnated and I took an academic leave of absence.

I went to some local universities staying with my parents and went back to school a year later. I failed a class my third semester and was expelled from an ivy league college. I continued to do low quality work at local universities until I had a psychotic break in March 2011. My parents demanded I seek therapy. I was opposed to therapy and wanted to continue with the way things were going.

In retrospect, I was influenced by the culture of masculinity. Men are messaged with images and stories about men who take responsibility for themselves and who are rewarded when they take responsibility for others, though to do so is of secondary importance. I wanted to be able to control the actions of my life. To me, to take advice from a stranger, even one trained to help people in my position was anathema to maintaining control.

There is a strong stigma about taking psychoactive medication that prevents people from talking about it. But, anti-psychotics are particularly derided. There is a myth, or partial truth, that anti-psychotic medication turns people in to zombies, or, more realistically drain a person of motivation and energy. I would not have sought treatment, therapy, or medication until my parents threatened to kick me out of their house. I was eventually on a regimen with anti-psychotic, stimulant, and anti-anxiety medications.

About a month after I started taking the medication I had a memory of child sexual abuse and recalled the rape I experienced in college. I was taking classes at a local university and my grades started to pick up. I walked in to my chemistry professor's office and asked for an internship and got it. I took the medication regularly for six months in the first half of 2012. In the summer I went cold turkey. 

I continued to excel at university. A year later, my psychiatrist gave me a path of ""partial remission"" (WHO, ICD-10). After four semesters I transferred to another university and became the senior member in a new program. I was operating as a highly motivated and involved student, designed my own major and led student initiatives on campus. I formed close relationships with women and shared my memories of child sexual abuse in a support group.

I graduated with honors in May 2014 and spent the summer in Europe as a gift from my parents. When I got back I wanted to find a job and a girlfriend and I decided to start therapy once a week. I really wanted to talk about my child sexual abuse. 

The character of my child sexual abuse became darker and I saw myself hurting others. I have been having trouble maintaining my reality about my past. I am concerned that I have a hard time differentiating dreams and false memories from reality. I shared these thoughts with my therapist and we are thinking about going back on the anti-psychotics.

So, that's sort of where I have been. I was a member of this subreddit earlier. I think that our stories are a really important part of our community. Stories show the humanity of people with schizophrenia. We have oppressed experiences that others need to hear to understand where we have been and break the social stigma of schizophrenia."

How do I stop feeling this way?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rx1vb/me_20f_with_my_20m_boyfriend_i_feel_jealous_of/,"My boyfriend and I are both computer science engineering majors. He's been encouraged to code since he was a child and I didn't get an interest in it until last year, but I'm sure it's what I want to do in my future. He got into one of the top CS programs in the nation for college, and I'm at a pretty good state school, but nothing spectacular.

I lack a lot of confidence in my abilities to code. I always feel like an outsider in my classes, where the male to female ratio can sometimes be as bad as 7:1. I feel like people automatically see me first as a Girl than a Fellow Programmer. Although I'm perfectly fine coding and am great at it by myself, and even pursue making stuff outside of just homework, I instantly begin to doubt myself when interacting with other programmers, who are usually male. I am not alone in this sentiment; the number of girls in CS is now around 18% on average.

Whenever I ask my boyfriend for help, he's always very curt and direct, but sometimes really blunt. I know he's just trying to help, but his ""help"" usually comes off very brash and like he's amazed I don't know this or that. He's way ahead of me in terms of experience and knowledge in CS.

For example, one time he tested my skills with a ""simple algorithm problem"". I tend to overthink problems so I sat there thinking, while he continued to pressure and push me to answer. I was so afraid of answering incorrectly since the question was obviously out of my skill range, and he got angry that I was ""thinking too much and doing too little"". He gets very aggressive and pushy whenever I take too long to think, which stresses me out. He doesn't seem to understand this.

He gets very impatient and frustrated at my lack of confidence, and sometimes berates me for it. 

He recently got into another round of interviews at Facebook. I know I should be happy for him, but it just feels like more validation that I'll never catch up and be equal to him. I just feel like crying and giving up. I see my fellow CS classmates getting amazing internships and building amazing things, and while I work hard too, I am not nearly as qualified. I always feel behind and it feels like they are lightyears ahead of me.

I feel horrible for being so petty and envious of his success. I know that to be a good girlfriend, I'm supposed to support him and cheer him on, but when he told me the news today I could only manage to say ""Good job"". What's wrong with me? How should I get over this? I tried to talk to him about how out of place I feel in CS and how unconfident I was in my abilities, but he shrugged and said he couldn't understand. 

He gets interviews easily and gets job offers just as easily. More often than not when I ask him what he's doing, he just says ""Getting another interview"" which reminds me of all the times I submitted my resume and haven't gotten a single reply. He has several offers lined up for this summer and I haven't even gotten a single interview. I feel worthless next to him and embarrassed.

I know it's ridiculous to compare myself to him, but I can't help it and I'm acting distant towards him when he needs my support for the next round of his important FB internship.

---   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend and I are both CS majors. He's had years of experience while I only have a few months at best. I can't stop feeling envious and depressed whenever he gets job offers or interviews. I don't feel like I could ever catch up and I have no faith in my abilities. "

Well the other day I checked my e-mail and saw that they want me to join the team! Because it is an unpaid internship, everything besides transportation and lodging will be on me. I will be gone for approximately 2 months. This is an amazing opportunity to work with a great team. I have worked with the director on a previous project. And know that I will be in great hands.

For this particular campaign I am just trying to raise some funds as quick as possible to cover some expenses I will have to maintain while I am away. Expenses such as rent, car payment and car insurance for 2 months. Please help if you can, if you can't donate then please share this with your friends whom you think will be charitable and help a stranger in need.

I was recently scheduled an interview for this upcoming Monday for a social media content intern. This is exciting for me because this is the first time ""non-retail"" thing I am stepping my foot into. They primarily focus on Twitter and Instagram, which cool because it's pretty easy. However, I would love some additional info on the business side if anyone can share.


Currently, I'm involved with social-media related things: managing my works' Facebook, and managing my city's best music promoters thru Facebook. Basically, I check if the internet promoters are meeting their weekly requirements in order to be eligible for a show, fo' free.



I'm still a student attending college, so I don't really have formal training; although, I'm a fast learner and plan to research everything I should know via-internet-- Thankfully the internet is an open source for everyone!


Lastly, I am stumped on the following:


 What I *should* say and what I *shouldn't* say.

What questions to ask.  Is it bad to ask what the company believes are the key factors to being successful?


Would love to have some insight, since I'm nervous as heck.



Thank you, Redditors!

2rxaee,35,2015-01-09,Had a meltdown at an employee meeting.,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/2rxaee/had_a_meltdown_at_an_employee_meeting/,"I work at a very small establishment with only a handful of other employees. I'm the lowest on the totem pole (they make sure to let me know that) as I'm 'technically' the newest person there (a position was created during my internship and I was offered the job). I work hard, am reliable, and I mind my business, I'm a freaking aspie for chrissakes. It's kind of a given. 

But one woman, 'Julie' really, really, does not like me. She was my superior when I was an intern, and even then she wasn't the nicest person to be around but she kind of treats everyone like crap. But once we became co-workers she really became unbearable: negative, highly critical and dismissive of me especially in front of new interns. She would criticize me, correct me, or treat me like I was stupid in front of them. It was to the point where I met with the director privately and said I could not work with a person who treated me with such disrespect. So we agreed that we would work different shifts (he admitted that other people have complained about her rudeness).

After a year and a half total of interning/working with Julie, she has become a trigger. Like, even when I see her photo I feel gross inside. After just being in the same room with her, I have to lie down and curl up in a dark room.

During the meeting, she criticized an idea I had implemented (ok, for fucks sake, it's just a dry erase board I created to give a list of projects for interns to do). She said it was confusing. That she didn't even 'understand' it - despite the fact that she was in the meeting where we discussed the board and the very projects that would go on it. I countered her argument with just that. The director cuts in because it's turning into an argument between me and Julie (this is the first time I've actually gotten confrontational). He starts going on about some crap about how we should treat the interns like they're not as smart as we think they are and be very detailed about what we expect of them, then gives an example. HIS EXAMPLE IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAD WRITTEN ON THE BOARD. At this point, I don't even care. I butt in and say 'Yes, that is *exactly* what I had written' then he gets visibly agitated and says 'let me get to my point' 

By this time, my mind is checked out. I'm trying all I can to just not run from the room, start crying or just, I don't know, fly through the roof and quit my job. His lips are moving and I'm not even hearing the words from them. The mood, for them, lightens. I can't even pretend to keep eye contact. They joke, and I sit there stone faced, eyes darting around the room anywhere but their faces. To keep calm, I kept repeating to myself that I have Asperger's, and my response and feelings are valid, that I will always be this way, it will never change and the sooner I accept it then dammit, everyone else will just have to. I am *sick* of trying to be 'normal' to make everyone else feel comfortable. And you know what? Julie most definitely does not have Asperger's, and I know for damn sure my personality isn't that fucked up. I remind myself of that, that even though I might be a social idiot, at least I'm not a mean spirited asshole.

I read recently to keep your emotions in check at work, or you'll lose respect. I don't even care anymore. I don't care that I had a meltdown at work. I feel like these people already don't respect me, so what the hell does it matter if they respect me less? This will always be who I am.


edit:

thank you so much for your advice and interpretations of what happened in the meeting. I take all interactions very literally, so it never crossed my mind that my boss was trying to keep the peace. I thought he was being clueless at my expense. I am most usually very level headed and fair at work, so the fact that I became overtly upset was a big deal for me - and thank you for helping me understand how to handle people like this. I love the work I do, and it's specialized so it's near impossible to find a replacement job in this field. Thank you again, it was very nice to wake up to these helpful responses. "

Inside you'll find a brief account of my joand just some advice for those of you who are early on in your quit.,thatsharrelson,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2rxf5u/day_73_just_checking_in_inside_youll_find_a_brief/,"**My Journey:** 



I started smoking in the middle of my sophomore year in college. It was fantastic all through sophomore year, only using it occasionally on weekends.




Junior year, I had my own piece and I was smoking at least once a weekend, sometimes twice. I only did it at night, and so I felt I had my usage under control.



I got a great internship over the summer, and was so motivated to do well that I didn't smoke for the entirety of the internship. It only lasted half the summer, and so I pretty much got high every night that summer. I gained a lot of weight, and I found myself saying self destructive things to myself in the mirror after smoking. I would say things like ""you're such a fat loser"". Despite this, I brushed it off, rationalizing it by saying that it wasn't the weed that was causing me to feel this way, it was my poor relationship with food. 




I went into this senior year smoking, but had to take a forced month break to earn some money. During this month I lost a lot of weight, I went to all of my classes, and was starting to feel really good about myself. When the forced month was over, I started smoking again, and I smoked for 4 days straight. 




While some of you may be rolling your eyes at my ""trouble"" with marijuana, this was when I recognized that I did not have control of my marijuana usage and joined /r/leaves. I'm glad that I had the foresight, and the knowledge about /r/leaves to stop myself from spiraling into all day everyday usage.





Since I have quit, I made the deans list, got an amazing internship in the field I want to work in lined up, and I am in much better shape. I still have problems with my relationship with food, and my sometimes crippling social anxiety, but I am working on it both on my own and with a psychologist. Over this time, I have had several moments where I look up and I thank god (I don't even believe in god) that I found this subreddit and broke free from my marijuana habit, because I see how much potential I would have lost if I had continued down my path.








**My Advice:**

* I took up running/exercise whenever I wanted to smoke during those early weeks. It helped curb the cravings.


* For me, a large part of my enjoyment from smoking was getting the munchies. This is because I could eat a ton of food without the guilt that always followed. So when I got a really strong urge, sometimes I would just indulge myself with the snacks, and it would often quell my urge to smoke. (This one just worked for me, it may not work for everyone).



* I read /r/leaves everyday. Don't stop reading /r/leaves. One of the things that got me to think about quitting in the first place was that I recognized that there were actually people who did not have a good relationship with weed, and that were actively trying to stop using. By checking back, you ground yourself, and realize that this drug is really capable of stopping you from realizing your full potential.



* Start dealing with your problems. If you quit, but don't address the thing that is causing you to mask your problems with weed, you will not get better and will eventually relapse. Reach out to a professional for help, or start meditating to get more in tune with yourself.





Those are my big pieces of advice.



Good luck everyone.

2rxks8,8,2015-01-09,So I'm a bit nervous about my living situation for this summer...,mutantmike,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/2rxks8/so_im_a_bit_nervous_about_my_living_situation_for/,"So I have an internship this summer (yay!) in a town somewhat far from home. I was concerned about finding a place to live, but luckily I found an awesome place. It's a college campus apartment place, so I can hang out with other students as opposed to being alone. The apartment is also furnished, comes with internet, and is reasonably priced.

However, I'll have to live with 3 guys who I've never met before.

It's a four bedroom apartment and we'll each have our own room. I'm a bit nervous about this, because on one hand we could become friends and the summer could be great. But on the other hand, we could not get along and things could get tough.

I live with four other guys this year in an apartment, but we're already really good friends so figuring out apartment rules is easy. I'm just a bit nervous about figuring out apartment rules with these guys since I will never have met them before (really the only rules I had to figure out with my freshman year roommate was what temp to keep the room at, not who does dishes and so on). Plus we were put together based on roommate preference forms we filled out before getting there.

What are some of your stories about living with people you've never met before?"

But asides from this last option, can some fresh students or people with knowledge lend a hand in deciding which one is better?

Here is what I have so far, which is basically what I've searched up. SoSy is less theoretical more applications, that means I'll be coding more instead of learning about some more advanced math? The other thing was the professors are better than Burnaby over there, so I won't have to deal with this 'Jane Huang' person. Although I'd be going into second year, so I'd probably not be taking that MACM 101 course or whichever the discrete mathematics is called that people have a tough time with. (BTW I just want to get working after graduating with a few internships under my belt, so I'm not worried about which option would be better for me for research or a masters.  

What else can I be looking at other than what I've said? The surrey campus is a 20-25 min extra commute everyday for me probably, so I'd be spending an extra 40m commuting from ambleside in west van. But screw it, I can deal with those wasted minutes by listening to a podcast or whatever people normally do driving (long) distances.

I also had a question about co-op, but another thread down here answered it for me (they both have the option to do the co-op program). Honestly I'd probably be applying on my own for the most part as I kind of have the 'open source', projects etc down just from self studying but it's good to know that I'd have access to that job mine if I ever want to dish out some 700 dollars.

2rxzil,9,2015-01-10,Protestant thinking about coming to the EOC,qsabouttheeoc,OrthodoxChristianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/2rxzil/protestant_thinking_about_coming_to_the_eoc/,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point.

So I was raised in a Protestant megachurch essentially born out of the seeker-sensitive movement in America. Theologically conservative, run of the mill evangelical protestant. This was at the beginning of the Neo-Calvinist explosion and I was very much apart of it. I was particularly influenced by John Piper because he the seriousness with which he taught the Bible was something that I had not seen before. I am to this day unbelievably indebted to him because his passion for God's word was largely responsible for me taking the Bible seriously.

In college I then attended Moody Bible Institute to study theology and Biblical Languages (an undergraduate institution that trains students for full-time ministry) because I at that time could not see myself doing anything with my life other than studying and teaching the Bible (though not necessarily in a pastoral position, I was more interested in teaching high school students or pursuing doctoral work and teaching college). During my college years I attended a Presbyterian church, primarily because it's Reformed theology resonated with me and it took certain things seriously which I was convinced were neglected in my previous church (notably the sacraments, church order of worship).

While at Moody I first became seriously interested in Eastern Orthodoxy while reading John of Damascus's writings while studying the Iconoclast controversy in a church history course. In Historical Theology courses I also read Kallistos Ware. In later courses I began to become much more interested in Trinitarian theology, and naturally became acquainted with the Cappadocian Fathers. I became so much interested in them that I actually proposed a directed study in ""Greek Readings in early Trinitarian Theology,"" which I myself wrote the syllabus for (it was composed, among other components, of readings from each of the C. Fathers on the Trinity).

(Side note, I wrote my term paper on the Spirit's Procession in the Trinitarian Theology in Gregory of Nazianzus' Trinitarian theology and how it related to the Filioque controversy.)

In studying the Trinity I was appalled at how negligible a proper understanding of the Trinity was in my prior upbringing. Furthermore I had become a bit disillusioned with a bit of the silliness that took place in my home-church and in Evangelical Protestantism in general.

So right now my position is this: I have finished my undergraduate course-work and am currently back at my hometown waiting for responses from graduate schools. Meanwhile, I am doing a two month internship at my home church (due to a graduation requirement for my B.A.). I am at a point in my life where I need to decide what church I will probably attend and serve at for the next lengthy period of my life and I am beginning to wonder whether I actually fit in the Eastern Orthodox Church. But I guess I'm still a bit ignorant of what the EOC is like today, so I was hoping for some help....

I guess I'll just kinda put where I am theologically and I was hoping I could get some answers/direction as to whether I really do belong in the EOC.

I still very much have inclinations to Reformed Theology. I still think that one who has truly been converted by the Spirit cannot actually lose his or her salvation. I believe that salvation primarily comes about because of the initiative of God (hence I would still hold rather closely to the main tenets of Calvinist soteriology).

Regarding the authority of Scripture I still resonate with the Reformation mantra of ""Sola Scriptura"" but in a somewhat nuanced sense. I guess this might be a bit of a difference between me and the EOC I think? I can't pretend that I've never read the Church Fathers and (rather embarrassingly) disagreed with them. I still consider Scripture to be the ultimate standard of doctrine, but I also recognize that doctrine always is indebted to tradition in some way or another.

I guess I'll just throw out these other theological beliefs I hold, not necessarily because I think that they're the most important, but because they tend to be the points that define a person theological today.

I believe in a literal Hell. I think homosexual  practice is wrong.

I believe the Bible is inerrant... kind of. I think the nature of the Bible has been too simplistically understood by much of the fundamental-ish culture which I came out of. I think the Bible PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD, with the very ""human"" nature kept in perspective, is inerrant. And I think too often our interpretation of Scripture has been skewed because of both our sin and our distance from the original audience.

At which point I also diverge from much of conservative American Christianity because I think evolution and the Bible are compatible, I don't think Moses wrote the Pentateuch, etc. etc...

I also stilll hold to substitutionary atonement, but more in the John-Calvin sense. That is to say, I believe that Christ took our punishment from sin BECAUSE believers are UNITED with the Son, in such a way that because we are united to Him He was able to take our punishment. But also when Christ was raised from the dead, in the Union with the Son of God we also were raised from the dead and have become partakers of the divine nature. 

So, all in all I'm looking for advice. Does anything I believe drastically depart from EOC theology? Does it make sense for me to come to the EOC? What considerations should I take into account that I haven't?"

I'm not one to ever post nor comment on Reddit, but this situation I've got myself into has led me to seek advice.

**Background:**
I am a college student from Nebraska and I am dating a girl from Illinois. She and I are both in the same major and same year in school, but at different schools. We met at a professional fraternity event in St. Louis, September of 2013. I told her I liked her and thought she was pretty and left home with her phone number from that weekend. A couple months later of texting, snapchat, etc. I made a bold move to travel out to see her and spend a day with her. A month after that she came to visit me in my city. Only seeing each other for a total of about a week of in-person time, we decided to start dating. After that we really loved constantly talking. Then in Jan. (2014), I visited her again for a quick weekend trip. Tragically her retina detached and underwent surgery. In March, I visited again, this time because of another event with that professional fraternity we are both in. Then, last summer, I got an internship in Chicago, and we got to see each other for most of the weekends. Everything was going well for the most part.. until her retina detached again. She ends up having to be face down 22 hours of the day and my weekends now were consumed riding bedside with her. After that, she leaves to study abroad in Spain in September (until May 2015). Upon arriving, she learns her retina has detached a third time, and has immediate surgery again, now in Spain. Also, I am planning on studying abroad in Germany (Feb. 2015-Aug. 2015), honestly coincidentally. So it seemed like it was going to be awesome to both be in Europe at the same time for a little while. Over this last new year, she came back to the States, but not before finding out that her retina has detached a fourth time, just days before she is to fly back home to her family and then see me. She has surgery for the second time in Spain, and does make is back to the States for the holidays to see her family and then fly out to see me in Nebraska. We spent about 10 days together, practically attached at the hip. So she met the family finally, and we were inseparable for that time. I know the story sound crazy, but I'm just trying to keep in chronologically in order.

Long story short, it's been an incredibly difficult year for her. My virtual presence by texting and phone calls while we were apart and my support for her while I was with her in Chicago has helped her get through this nasty year. 

About three years ago when, as she says, she was a very happy, blissful, and even naive person... until her boyfriend cheated on her and slept with another girl. This has shaken up her world and really caused her to have bad trust and self-esteem issues. I never really had a serious relationship before her, nor do I really know any personal accounts of people cheating or being cheated on in my life (maybe it's just simpler Nebraska people or something). So it's been depressing and exhausting dealing with her worries and her not trusting me. I always feel guilty now too because anything troubling I'm dealing with is nothing comparable to hers, so I feel obsolete. This is in regards to all her eye complications. However, her issues have been tough to deal with being long distance, especially with a 7 hour time difference. But all in all, I've been an entirely loyal, caring, and loving boyfriend and she has come to really love me. She truly believes I am *the one*. I felt kind of pressured into saying *I love you* over the summer at some point, kind of in the fear that if I didn't say it then that would be the ultimatum of our relationship, even as friends. But moving on, this whole time we have remained pretty intimate. 


**Now to the issues I'm having:**
Seeing as we have known and really been a big part of each other's lives for the last year, it's become a very normal thing to survive off of texting and phone calls. It feels normal and good to have someone to contact for emotional and mental support with schoolwork and other personal events going on.

But when she got here to visit me over the holidays, and was around me at all times. I started noticing that I didn't enjoy her presence as much as I used to. I'm really starting to see or believe that we don't have as much in common as I thought earlier. The way we spend our down time, the entertainment sources we enjoy, all the nuances or attitude and emotions are all very different. To be honest, I started feeling really depressed, unhappy, and a little uncomfortable being around her because it felt different and weird having this much time together. I obviously like her and care a lot about her, our conversations about schoolwork and life keep us going when there's distance between us. But seeing as we've only really had like, what, 2 months of in-person time, I've started picking up on the her realness, day-to-day, and I don't know if that's what I want to commit to right now.

Plus, there are a lot of big life decisions that we both have to be making; which schools to apply to grad school at (we both must for our major), how we're going to spend time when we're both abroad at the same time, will we want to live together when we return. All of those questions include me as a priority and I feel really bad about that because I don't really feel the same way I think. I feel really tied down and nervous about making such huge commitments. 

So she is in Spain now, and we have already verbally said that I will stay with her and possibly travel some before I start school in March. I'll arrive mid Feb. and that will be the next time we see each other. I want to share my feelings, but those feelings are along the lines of a break up, and I feel that's the way I'm leaning because I don't really believe she's *the one* for me. Her birthday is Tuesday and she has already been picking up some of these vibes. I'm so terrified to express these feelings and feel incredibly shallow/inconsiderate to have this conversation over the phone/skype especially with the timing of all this. I feel like such a piece of shit because she is dealing with all these eye issues. To make things worse, she handles bad news very poorly. I've seen her cry 3 or 4 dozen times in the small amount that I've seen her (eye issues are chiefly to blame tho). She does get over emotional over many silly things. So this conversation is going to absolutely crush her.

The last thing too is that she is going to be wanting to be making some plans, buying tickets/scoping out what we'll do when I arrive in Spain next month. And if I'm hesitant about those plans, it will have to come out how I'm feeling over the phone (long distance) and all hell will break loose, thus making me awful human being.

I appreciate all of your guys' time reading and hope you can send me some advice on how I should deal with this situation the next few weeks. For any more information or clarification please ask or PM me. Thank you all so much. God Bless.

**tl;dr** My girlfriend dealing with constant eye problems/surgeries/sadness, but very loving of me, sees me as *the one* even though I don't think I feel the same way and haven't told her yet. She is studying abroad right now and I will leave to study abroad separately next month too. So our time in Europe will overlap for a few months  and it's expected that we see each other as much as possible. We will be planning out trips and I'm afraid to express feelings because it will ruin all those plans and hurt her so much. "

Well her roommate invited over her annoying friend, and this made me really mad. The reason it pissed me off so much is because the roommate's friend can be really annoying and loud at times and I asked (demanded?) Renee if I come over for the weekend, that he won't be there. I told her I rather not come at all versus dealing with the roommates' friend. She promised he won't be there and that is wasn't an issue.


Well, as I was literally about to leave to go down there, I get a message that the roommate invited the annoying friend over, for the entire weekend. Renee didn't say a word to the roommate before hand, so she didn't know. It sucked because I did decide to not come, and it honestly ruined my weekend and I was now pissed off instead of relaxed.


Fast-forward about a week, and we haven't talked to each other at all. She messages me and invites me out for drinks, just her and I. I made a joke about how the annoying friend will probably be there and she took me serious, I guess. We had plans the following day (Friday) to hang out, and she insisted that I just stay home because I sounded like I was in a bad mood and she wouldn't accept me saying I was fine. It went on for about 10 minutes over texts. This in return actually really pissed me off. Thus, me cancelling the plans, again. 



We then didn't talk for a week, which is unusual because we talked all day everyday through text, facebook, snapchat, etc. Well, New Year's Eve rolls around and I find out that her and her roommate are having a New Years party, I wasn't invited. I then in a fit of rage, took her off of everything, Facebook, etc. I felt very hurt and betrayed, considering this is my best friend and I felt I was hers. 


She noticed a few days later, and she tried talking to me. I was very reserved and made sure I wasn't rude to her, but I deep down had no real passion to actually work it out with her. She was very apologetic and I feel she was sincere, but I still felt very hurt. Well right now, my issue is that I don't know how to feel. She knew that between projects, work, my internship, and school, that I won't be able hang out with anyone and my break was my last real chance to relax and have fun over the next 8 months. So I feel even more hurt because we planned my entire break around hanging out, and she cancelled everything. I feel like she ruined my entire break because I don't have money to go out and we were just going to hang out, play games, watch movies, etc.


My thing right now is that I don't know what I need to do to fix this or if I should, atleast right now. I am very much a person who is about quality with friends, so I don't have my friends, mainly acquaintances. So I really miss talking to her everyday, but the way shit ended last, I have no idea how to go about this. A bit of pride, a bit of depression, and everything in between. I feel like I'm destroying this by looking too much into everything. 


---   
**tl;dr**: Friend and I had plans to hang out over my winter break. Going to be busy for the next 8 months where I won't have hardly any free time. Friend cancelled all of our plans, essentially ruining my break. She hardly spoke to me, I got upset when I saw she had a party for New Year and nothing was even mentioned to me. Took her off everything and basically cut my ties. It's been about a week since we last spoke, not sure what I should do. "

I have been doing nothing much with my life during my past two college years, mainly trying to finally finish up my Bachelor's thesis (which I am now getting close to actually doing). It's not because of actual, severe depression or substance abuse issues, I'm just really directionless in my life, don't know what I want to do when I finish college (useless liberal arts degree) and have been holding off on graduating because I'd rather be a student with a student job than unemployed (I am currently working at the university, so I'd lose that job when I graduate. I'm not in the US, this is sadly how it works here). Not the ideal situation and I'm not dealing with it too effectively, as you can see.

 I am in therapy for this, and my therapist mainly tells me that my problem is I constantly tear myself down and then remain passive instead of changing things about myself and my situation because I am too depressed to do so. So I'm supposed to stop the constant internal self-hate and criticism. So far, so logical. 

Now, enter my father. He's not a bad man, I think. I think he just never quite got the hang of being emotionally supportive. He never praises anyone (but loves to criticize). He does know a lot of things, which is why I went to help for him often. Problem is, over the last 3-4 years he has lost patience with me not knowing what to do with my life and now he is as bad to me as I am during my darkest moments!

He tells me all the time that I'll never amount to anything, that my CV is going to look horrible, that I may as well stop trying to earn my degree since I ""never learned anything at that fake university anyway"" (he thinks education has gone to hell during the last 30 years - he's probably right, but what am I supposed to do?!), that all I care about are video games (I haven't even played anything for 2 years, turns out even gaming loses its appeal when you're feeling depressed), that all I'm doing is waiting for him to die so I can inherit the house. And yeah, I get where he is coming from, I am aware that I'm a disappointing offspring to have, but how can I tell him that he is making it *worse*? 

That whenever he tears me down I lose a lot of energy I'd need to work on my thesis and maybe research internships? That he isn't saying anything I haven't told myself already a hundred times? I tried telling him exactly that in those exact words (well, not in English, but in mother tongue, but you get what I mean). But he just continues to lay into me. 

Sadly, for monetary constraints I can't move out at this point (my work pays enough to cover my expenses like clothes, transport and university fees - I am at least debt free - but it's not enough for rent on top of that where I live). What can I do?! 


---   
**tl;dr**: My father tears me down worse than my internal critic is able to and aggravates the same mental problems (anxiety, depressive feelings and a sense of worthlessness, for which I am in therapy for) he lays into me *for*. How can I make him stop when I already tried telling him exactly this?  "

I attended a mid-range 4-year college and graduated with a degree in finance quite a number of years ago, circa 2006 (Magna Cum Laude / 3.7 GPA). After graduating I started my own business with the help of my father and started doing exactly what he did. I sold residential home improvements, windows, roofing, siding, etc, and I specialized in getting financing for customers with damaged credit. I chose to do this because my father was making incredible money during the subprime boom; and because most of the competition focused on cash or good credit deals, there was a significant opportunity. In the first month of operating/advertising I made approximately $12,000 and rented a luxury apartment, bought a $23,000 car, nice furniture, a HDTV, etc.

Ultimately I had plans to finance my own deals and capture more of the profit, because the subprime finance companies would essentially 'chop' the deals upon completion, meaning if I sold $10,000 worth of improvements they would send me a check for about $8,000 upon completion (a 20% chop), which they would intern resell to investors and banks to capture a profit for themselves. There were other companies that would chop more that I never used, so I was basically limited to this single firm.

At this point in my story you can probably guess where this is leading and it's obviously not good. As consumer confidence fell in early 2008 I was shocked at the plunge in interest among my lower income customer base, which lead me to throw more money at advertising which depleted my cash reserves significantly. Then the financial crisis happened and the market for reselling subprime debt instruments essentially collapsed completely, effectively putting me out of business.

I lost everything, my car, my savings, my downsized apartment that I moved into when business first started to decline, my credit cards. I think at the low my credit score was maybe a 475-525. I was in exactly the same position that many of my customers had been in which was an extremely humbling experience. Some might say I deserved it for participating in the subprime business, but what's done is done. I can't change the past. I however think the crooks on Wall Street at places like Goldman Sachs are worse, but I digress.

I was forced to move home, and very quickly my parents were forced to sell their 5500 sq ft house in a weak housing market, but at least they had some equity to pull out of it. We then moved into a much smaller house and that is where we are today (except for my dad who died recently, partly due to losing his business IMO). At one time I did try applying for jobs in 2009 and 2010, but I essentially gave up because no one was interested in interviewing me. This lead me to seek alternative forms of employment.

By chance I happened upon an ad on craigslist and found a firm that was hiring independent contractors to find bars, restaurants, clubs, and other establishments that are illegally showing certain television programming, such as NFL Sunday Ticket, because businesses have to pay a corporate rate. This actually started out as a type of scammy, high turnover rate, high failure rate, business that I turned into being at least somewhat lucrative, purely due to my own determination and desperation. I scoured the entire United States for these establishments and used creative techniques to find them, rather than simply only working locally, which quickly extinguished the number of available establishments to bust. But my own success ultimately lead to my failure, as this was a diminishing returns business model. Each year I made less and less and it became harder and harder to find places.

Fast forward to today and I'm essentially unemployed again, but I do have some cash at least this time. My credit has slightly improved from the low 500's to the low 600's. My sister is having difficulty finding a job that I wouldn't even do, which makes me very pessimistic about my prospects. My chances of getting a job may have improved today, but I am skeptical for a number of reasons. I still have bad credit (I know employers check this, especially in the Finance industry), I have no verifiable work history of employment, and I possess no specialized skills that are easily transferable. What I did learn in school is largely forgotten at this point since it hasn't been used in so long.

My friends (all making about $150,000 at cushy corporate jobs) give me a lot of shit for living with my parents still and not searching for a 'real' job, but they don't have my problems, and I'm not working for less than $12/hour, period. I've never even interviewed for a job before and I'm about 30 years old. I haven't even been on a date in years because I doubt any decent woman would be interested in someone like me.

**TL;DR I started my own business after college, busted out, worked as an independent contractor in a marginal/declining business, and now I think I'm just fucked for life.**

I think I just needed someone to read this, so thanks.

If you haven’t read the first Chapter of Cents: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/2iyj1g/cents_by_carrot/ 

Chapter 2 

Dr. Andrew awoke from his nap with a start. Looking around he remembered that he was now in his office rather than the therapy room. He rubbed his eyes in hopes to ease the constant gnawing he felt in his eyes, which were the result of long nights of both filing his patient’s profiles as well as assisting his varying clients both from the most vegetative to the most extreme and or violent. 

“These late nights are starting to take their toll on me.” He retorted as he stretched. 
Getting out his chair, Doctor Andrew knew that he needed to wake up if he was to make it in time for his eleven o’clock therapy session with another patient. Rubbing his eyes, he walked over to his door and opened the door. 
“Well, coffee hasn’t failed me before and it certainly wouldn’t hurt to rely on it again.” He said to himself as he strolled out of his office and into the hallway. 

The hallway was composed of a variety of rooms that stretched from Andrew’s office, which was the last room on the left, all the way to the snack room, which was located to the right at the end of the hallway. The entirety of the hallway was coated in green paint as if to sooth both the patients as well as the doctors whose stress either equaled that of their patients or were undisturbed due to their long history and experience with their patients of varying sorts. The doors to each doctor’s office was all the same as far as the eye could see down the hallway, the color of the wood used for them resembled a dark chocolate kind of look and the knobs on them were either golden or silver, depending a doctor preferred either or. The floor was tiled with a sort of speckled white tile that had different tints of blue, green, and some red but the most prominent color was white. 
Being in the psychiatric ward, it was not uncommon for the doctors to stroll along and or have their less extreme patients come in to their offices in order to receive therapy or to console the families of patients. Meaning, that a variety of doctors and more sane patients strolled, with the sane patients accompanied with an assisting nurse in white, the hallway either heading to an individualized therapy room, which was most often the case, or to talk with other doctors during their own breaks. As Doctor Andrew exited his room he accidently bumped in to a patient but they didn’t seem to notice but the accompanying nurse retorted a quick “excuse us,” and walked toward the elevator, which was at the center of the hallway to the right. Dr. Andrew looked at his watch and saw that the time was eight fifty-seven.
 
‘Two hours will give me enough time to get coffee and take a nap before my next session.’ Dr. Andrew thought to himself as he began walking towards the break room. 

He began to contemplate what exactly Tyson was and why he was in this kind of vegetative state. Could it be that he might have suffered from multiple traumas? If that was the case would it be that an individual who is traumatized of this caliber actually be able to make coherent thoughts through stories or even actually talk at all without going back his vegetative state. Then again, there are cases in which an individual’s trauma could be repressed so if Tyson was repressing something in order to speak, then what exactly was Tyson not trying to remember? 

Entering the break room, Dr. Andrew saw a few nurses chatting amongst themselves around a circular table located just left of the snack and drink machines. He took in the room, as it was in order to get his mind off his work. The room was nothing special it was like any other room in the hospital except that it was a tad larger than some of the offices in order to accommodate its inhabitants and two large circular tables to make the room more comfortable. Furthermore, the entirety of the room was rather calming due to its green painted and the walls smooth texture that one could put their hand to and admire the simple texture as an individual would when they were to come home. The tiled floor was the same as the hallway and the clacking of the nurse’s shoes as well as the doctors who strolled outside the break room could be heard as well. However, what was annoying about the room was the minor humming and buzzing of the overhead lights that the hospital had installed as a replacement of the fans that it use to have. Andrew, however, much preferred the fans to the incessant buzzing of these lights. 
“Good Morning, Dr. Andrew,” one of the nurses to the left of him said as he entered the room. 

After he quickly rubbed his eyes, he retorted “Good Morning, Nurse….I’m sorry what was your name again.”
The nurse looked as though just was fresh out of grad. School as her face was a gorgeous milky tan complimented by her blue eyes with her red hair to highlight the hue of blue in her eyes. She wore a full uniform that was not revealing at all, as standard procedure required both men and women of the medical field, and she wore a light over coat representing the frigid winter that gripped the county as of late. 

She sighed and then looked to him “I’m Christina, you know, sir, I’m the new intern that was assigned to you. Don’t you remember? ” 

‘Oh shit…’ Andrew thought to himself as he yawned. 

“Um…Oh yeah…well did I assign to you anything lately? I’m having a bit of trouble remembering what exactly I told you to do.” 
Suddenly, a hand slapped Andrew on the back and he heard laughter behind him. 

“It would seem our good friend, Andy, has been letting his insomnia get the better of him.” 

Turning around, Dr. Andrew saw that his friend, Dr. Thomas or, as Andrew liked to call him “Tommy.” He was a middle-aged man whose beard, or morning scruff, made him look far older than he actually was. His brown hair was short and extended to his mid-brow and complimented his brown eyes. He was wearing his usual doctors lab coat, for show and or wanting to have something warm in the lukewarm hospital, and underneath it lay a buttoned up green shirt and black dress pants that looked they had wrestled with a furry beast that Andrew suspected was his cat but apparently his friend didn’t notice, and even if he did he usually had a lint roller in his office among his other items he liked to have around just in case such as the usual red bull or even the star wars coffee mug he liked to drink his coffee out of. To say the least his friend was a bit of a unique character. 
Andrew simply shook his head and sighed 

“Can I at least go one morning without a bruise on my back, Dr. Thomas?” 

He walked over to the snack machine and saw that the machine still held his favorite snack, the jumbo honey bun, and fumbled around in his pockets to find his wallet. 

“It’s a lot better than drinking gallons of coffee and or ingesting those honey buns you like so much.”  
After trying to find his wallet with no avail Dr. Andrew leaned his head against the plastic display glass and sighed ‘I must have left my wallet back at the office.’ He thought to himself. Then, seemingly out of no where, Dr. Thomas offered him a cup of steaming hot coffee. 

“But, knowing you,” 

Andrew nodded and took the plastic cup. 

“Your blood is practically coffee at this point.” Dr. Thomas said with a grin. 

Andrew simply cracked a smile at his colleague and thanked him for the coffee. Smelling the coffees steam Andrew immediately recognized that it was hazelnut, which was his favorite. It was not the mere taste that one took of hazelnut coffee that Andrew liked but the after taste. It was a heavenly mixture of the sweetness of the sugar of it and the bitterness of the hazelnut, which left a bittersweet after taste that, for some reason, Andrew loved. 

After taking a few sips, both doctors seated themselves adjacent to the nurses and began to chat about the latest rumors and, without revealing too much about their patients, what cases they were working on. It was always amazing to see that even doctors were interested in matters that were so trivial in a hospital. However, knowing how interesting or crazy the life of a psychologist could be it is apparently not as interesting as another doctor saying a particular sentence to another individual or even the fact that someone had been eating someone else’s lunch. ‘Human beings,’ Andrew thought to himself as he was listening to his friend ‘individuals that are more interested in miniature problems rather than being more interested in the bigger picture.’ Tuning into what his friend was detailing, there was an individual, supposedly, that was seeing one of the nurses after hours. 

“Who do you think it could be, Tyson?” Dr. Thomas inquired with interest. 

Andrew simply took a sip from his coffee and sighed, “Thomas, I’m not the least interested in the gossip that goes around this hospital.” 

When he lowered the cup from his face, Andrew saw that his friend had cocked one eyebrow and wore a slight grin. It was as if he was calling his statement total bullshit without having to utter a single word. He also heard a laugh from the table that the nurses were sitting at and they too were looking at him. 

“They’ve got you pegged, Andrew.” His friend said with a chuckle. 

“Well,” Andrew said after a few seconds of silence “I would put my guess on Dr….” 

Suddenly, in mid-sentence, Dr. Andrew remembered that he was talking to one of the nurses before Dr. Thomas slapped him on the back. He turned to face the nurses again and said. 

“I’m so sorry but which one of you was I talking to before I had a bruise on my back?” he asked. 

The group of nurses laughed, but the red haired nurse simply grinned at him. She raised her hand and said: 
“Would it be easier if I raised my hand, Doctor?” 

This made Dr. Thomas laugh and Andrew roll his eyes. Andrew remembered the disdain he felt for having an assistant to his own work, and, more importantly, he preferred the quiet recluse doctor rather than having a “sidekick.” However, due to the Hospital board hearing that he did not have a nurse to help him they were furious because apparently it is more applicable to shoulder the workload on two individuals rather than allowing a full accredited doctor do his own work with his-
“I’d say that she is the perfect for you, Andrew.” said Thomas interrupting his thoughts. 

“Changing the subject,” Andrew began “any particular patients that you’ve taken on recently, Dr. Thomas?” 

Although it was against the regulations of the hospital to talk about their patients and the particular case that they took on from that patient it was not against the rules to give broad vagueness of the recent goings on in sessions. 

“Not much to tell,” He began after crossing his arms “however I heard through the grapevine that someone took on the Story teller.” 

Andrew knew exactly what he was hinting at and simply took the last sip of coffee left in the cup. Thomas cocked an eyebrow at his friend and awaited a response from his colleague. Andrew simply sighed and responded with: 
“You shouldn’t believe everything that you hear from around the workplace.”
 
Setting down the coffee cup, Andrew simply eyed his colleague who, at this point, wore a toothy grin. 

“Well, whenever a particular doctor takes on a case that has a certain…infamy to it.” 

His friend leaned in and looked over at the group of nurses, who, at this point began to excuse themselves from the table and were on to work renewed with the energy to continue their work either by the aide of coffee or even the sating of their need to know the happenings around the hospital. Either way Andrew bid his new assistant, Christina, farewell and asked if she could review some of the files on his desk to see if he missed something. 

“What exactly do you mean ‘find something,’ Doctor?” She asked.
 
“My eyes are beginning to play tricks on me and my mind is still asleep. Perhaps you could aide me in reviewing them since you’re not as sleep deprived as I am.” Andrew said as he twisted around to look up at the nurse.
 
“Uhm, Doctor I don’t believe that I’m particularly allowed to see the personal file cases that you have, sir.” She said wearily. 
Andrew hated being called a sir due to the fact that in being called a sir meant that he had been knighted or had the pretense of him being old and thereby demanding respect. 

“I’ll give you the gist of what I have so far and then you decide which case is more…demanding of time and those who are less violent per say.” Dr. Andrew said as he looked back at Thomas. 

“Violent? What do you mean by-“ 

“What Dr. Andrew is trying to say is,” Thomas interrupted  “that he wants to help him validate a particular case he is working on.” Dr. Thomas said as he leaned back in his chair. 

 	Andrew simply looked up at the nurse and said, “Well, not really validate more or less your opinion on what you think of it. I’ll meet you outside my office once I’m done chatting with Dr. Thomas.” 

She stood there for a moment thinking over what the two of them had said and looked at both of them. But walked away but not before retorting what she thought was out of ear shot 

“Unbelievable I get stuck with the lazy doctor.” 

After the door shut behind her, Thomas and Andrew faced each other. 

“When did you take on the Everson case, Andrew? You know that he is near catatonic.” Thomas said in a more serious tone. 
“Thomas, this case is not as simple as that.” Andrew said as he leaned in. “Do you remember when Everson actually arrived in the hospital?” 

His friend nodded “He was severely malnourished and rambled to everyone who would listen to him.” 

Andrew himself remembered the first instance of Tyson Everson entering the hospital. The nurse at the front desk had actually greeted a very cloaked individual who had a long gray overcoat, and due to the storm outside of the hospital created an uneasy ambiance to the whole situation. The individual who was cloaked talked to the nurse about something that Andrew couldn’t remember but what he did remember was that at the end of the conversation the individual opened his jacket to reveal his skeleton like body. 

‘Maybe I should ask around about what happened that night. Or maybe Tyson could-‘ 

“Andrew?” Thomas asked as he stared at his friend. 

Andrew shook his head “Yeah, sorry I guess the insomnia is starting to get to me.” 

After to taking a moment to gather himself he looked back at his friend. 

“Tyson… actually reacted.” 

Thomas was surprised to say the least but not as wide eyed as Andrew might have hoped. His friend simply opened his eyes a little and sat there bewildered for a moment before saying:
“ What did he talk about first?” 

Andrew then told him the vagueness of his discussion from the story that he told first, which was Bad Taste, and then the story that Andrew told Tyson in order to get a reaction out of him. 

“Do you know how dangerous that kind of policy or-“

Andrew raised his hand to interrupt his sentence. 

“The man reacts only when an individual tells him a story or something of that nature. I doubt that he’ll be using personal stories against me.” Andrew said as he crossed his arms. 

His friend didn’t allow his stern look subside and kept his stare but after looking quickly to the right, where a window was seated displaying doctors, nurses, and assisted patients walk to and from their destinations and occasionally looking to see if there were any occupants were in the break room. 

“Tyson Everson is not something that can be toyed with, Andrew,” Thomas said as he looked back at his colleague. “Madness, doesn’t come in its purest form often.” As he finished his sentence, Thomas stood up and straightened his lab coat and was about to walk out of the break room when he patted Andrew on the right shoulder and said “Be careful, Andrew, we don’t know Tyson’s story or even what he is capable of.” 

Andrew stood up himself, and smiled at his friend “I intend to find out, but if anything does happen I’ll ask for you personally, Thomas.” 

His friend stood there for a moment, opened the door, then nodded at him and left without saying another word to him. 
Andrew stood there for a moment thinking over what had been said. 

‘Maybe after the talk with Christina I can ask around the hospital to see if anyone knows anything.’ 

He opened the door and proceeded to walk towards his office.

She is taking a year off from college in Oregon. Over those two months we have become very close and we share a lot of interests such as diehard EDM music fans, love space and science, engineering majors, and both love watching football. We both hung out a bunch and saw a concert together and yesterday we went on out first official dinner date at a restaurant. This is where everything gets depressing...

Earlier that day Megan got a call for an internship opportunity back in Oregon but she has to move back and start school in two weeks and won't come back to Illinois until summer and only for three weeks. This is when she really opened up with me. She told me she doesn't want to go and really loved spending the last two months with me and loved knowing someone who shares so many interests with her. Megan then said she wants to spend as much of the remaining two weeks in Illinois with me and said I have to visit her back in Oregon. We both were almost tearing up during dinner.

I have never been this close to a girl before and I know we have only known each other for two months but I really want this relationship to stay. I am planning on talking with her about it tomorrow but have no idea what to say. I have dated a couple girls but never got to the point of being in an exclusive relationship where I get to call them my girlfriend. I feel like Megan is the one for me. I know long distance relationships are tough but I really want to be with her.

So in short, how would I talk to her about our relationship?

Thank you so much for your help. I am in a tough situation here and appreciate everyones input.

I'm 22, just graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, and I started my first job in mid-October, 2014. I'm working full time in the bay area at one of the Big-4 tech companies. I also interned this summer (Jun-Sept 2014) at that same company.  

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the situation: 134k/yr in income (92.5k base salary + overtime, for overtime I assumed 52hrs per week, which so far seems a safe estimate, might actually be higher than this)
0k in student loans (got full financial aid since my family had a pretty low income and I went to a top 5 engineering school).

My company pays for public transportation ($100 per month stipend) so most transportation costs come from taxis/uber. They also pay for my cellphone bill Currently I'm on an 8mo sublease while I find a good place. Housing is insane in San Francisco. I'm paying $1695 for 1 room in a 4br. Luckily, it at least already includes utilities and wifi. It's also furnished so I didn't have to spend money on furnishing an apartment. My company also pays for lunch and dinner so I very rarely have to spend money during the week. This means I usually spend a little more than I normally would on restaurants during the weekend.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is my estimated budgets:  
Budget
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
(Monthly)  
Income After tax/401k Contributions: $5846  

&amp;nbsp;

Roth IRA Contribution: $458.33 &lt;-- (I'll need to use the backdoor method)    
Rent: $1695  
Electric Bill: 0  
Cable Bill: 0  
Water Bill: 0  
Car Payment: 0  
Gas: $30  
Groceries: $30  
Insurance: $20  
Gym: $18  
Phone: $0  
Prescriptions: $0  
Haircut: $20  
Restaurants: $160  
Entertainment/Bars: $200  
Taxis: $60  

&amp;nbsp;
      
Total Expenses: $2631.33  
Net Income: $3214.67  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Per Year:  
Tax advantaged Savings: $23000  
ETF/Investing: $38,576.04  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Total saved per year: $61,576.04 

&amp;nbsp;

^^ Those numbers are overestimates since there are a lot of extra costs that I'm not taking into account like vacations, gifts, and miscellaneous expenses. So, to make numbers cleaner and account for these extra expenses let's assume that $8,576.04 goes to these miscellaneous expenses.  

&amp;nbsp;
   
New Savings per Year:  
Tax advantaged Savings: $23000   
ETF/Investing: $30,000 

&amp;nbsp;

Total saved per year: $53,000

&amp;nbsp;

As of today, this is how my accounts currently look like: 

&amp;nbsp;

Savings/Checkings: $48,382  
Credit Card Debt: $0  
401k: $9,078  

Most of the money from my savings and checking account is from my internship. I wasn't allowed to partake in the company's 401k as an intern so it kinda just accumulated (also, my starting bonus, relocation bonus for internship and full time).

&amp;nbsp;

Now, my full time job is pretty tough/stressful. I work around 60 hours per week and travel internationally for business for around 2 weeks every 2 months. For this reason I fully intend to use a property manager. There is no way I could handle my full time job plus being a landlord. I guess I'm just wondering if real estate is the best approach. The bay area is pretty expensive so it might be best to invest somewhere else. What would be the best methodology for choosing what real estate to invest on? From reading other posts around here it seems that single family homes aren't the best idea. Also, I would buy this property explicitly for rental; I plan to keep living in San Francisco and judging by the rental prices I don't think I could afford a house here. What factors should I be looking at when searching for a good deal on real estate? How much of my own money should I be investing vs using loans?

&amp;nbsp;

Would I be better throwing all this money into an index fund and letting it grow? 

&amp;nbsp;

I know I'm already at a great start and I'm very fortunate to be in this position but I think there's always room for improvement.
 

Thanks!!"
2s0l8y,1,2015-01-10,test,compsci-throwaway,PostPreview,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostPreview/comments/2s0l8y/test/,"Hello all.

**Background:** I'm entering my last semester towards a BS in Computer Science. I have a 3.61 cumulative GPA and a 3.87 in major GPA. I have some minor ""research experience"", if you could call it that; I spent 2 semesters helping a faculty member with minor data visualization and data mining projects related to Bioinformatics. With a LOR from this professor, I was able to land an unrelated software engineering internship this past Summer, where I completed my project (slightly above?) satisfactorily. 

With limited research experience, I *believe* I want to go to graduate school because:

* For the minor projects I worked on, I absolutely loved reading research papers in the field.

* From my internship, the most fulfilling aspects of my project were the investigation of the problem that I was assigned and the design of the application I implemented.

* I want depth. I loved **every single one of my CS classes**. Some came easier than others, sure. Even the ones I struggled to get a B in, I loved reading the material. I didn't just like the programming; I loved discrete maths, automata theory, data structures and algorithms, compilers, etc. I didn't feel like I got enough of it in undergrad, though.

**Problem:** I didn't solidly decide I wanted to go through with a PhD until what I perceive is too late. I don't have significant research experience. Lastly, I didn't get to know my professors aside from the one I worked with, and I need LORs. I only started preparing for the GRE this Winter break.

With a semester left, is there meaningful interaction I can have with faculty to get worthy letters of recommendation? Is there meaningful research experience I can gain in this time window? Do I have any chance at funded acceptance into a middle-tier PhD program? I'd actually like to stay at my current school, which is in the bottom half of the top 100 for CS graduate school rankings; I enjoy this city and the overall experience I've had at this school.

**TL;DR: Entering my last semester of undergrad and want to do a PhD in CS, but about the only thing I have is a decent GPA. Meaningful relationships with professors is practically nonexistent. Meaningful research experience is practically nonexistent. Am I hopeless?**

Thanks for reading."
2s1232,1,2015-01-10,If my mum wasn't alive I would of committed suicide a few years ago.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2s1232/if_my_mum_wasnt_alive_i_would_of_committed/,"Okay so I am going to try and keep this short and to the point.

I left school in 2006 (I was 16) didn’t do anything at all for 3 years (so 2009) then got an apprenticeship (aka an internship) but got sacked a few months into it for assaulting my boss for making a sexual comment about my mum, ended up going to court, getting a 2 year suspended prison sentence so that fucked me over for getting a job for at least 2 years as it always showed up on a criminal record check (csb).

Fast forward to 2011 and I am still unemployed and after doing many courses trying to progress my skills/education ect I still get no interviews so in 2012 I did 3 volunteering  jobs all for 6 weeks each for experience and gaining skills, this helped me get a few job interview’s but still no job, in 2013 I joined a few job agency's and they got me 2 night shifts temporary jobs which both lasted for about a month and then a about 5 months one of the agency's got me an xmas warehousing job from the beginning of November 2013 to the beginning of January 2014 but since that ended I have not had a single interview, I updated my cv with new skills ect that I have gained from doing that work ect.

I am nearly 25 still unemployed living at home with my mum and its just fucking depressing and I just wish I was dead or would just die in my sleep but I know that would be extremely  unfair on my mum which is why I have not done it, about 3 years ago (2012) I actually told my mum about my suicidal thoughts due to feeling worthless from not being able to gain a real full time job and she just cried and didn’t want to leave me on my own and over the next 6 months or so my mum always made sure I was okay and happy ect.

I even looked into getting a loan and paying to have my life ended with a Swedish company (can’t remember the name) and I rang them up and spoke to them but they told me they could only end a person’s life if that person was elderly or terminally unwell so then I googled ways to commit suicide ect and found some that I wouldn't mind trying  but I have never tried for that fact that it would destroy my mums soul and basically turn her into a wreak which even if I was dead I still wouldn't want that to happen as it’s so unfair.

Okay so this ended up being a longer post then I wanted but whatever, you get the idea that I pretty much feel like a worthless piece of shit with my hope in gaining full time employment being non existent, even though I have re-educated myself (retook my maths and English gcse’s), done various course in health n safety, moving and handling, food hygiene, food preparation, customer service, IT skills and then I have done 3 volunteering job and jobs a few job agency’s but still all I have managed to get is god dam shitty temporary  work.

2s1elb,2,2015-01-11,Am I a bad person?,Ralliah,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2s1elb/am_i_a_bad_person/,"About a year ago I broke contact with my Ngrandmother. The story is long and complicated but I'll try to give an overview in a moment. The main problem is that I still feel horrible about it all and I often wonder if I'm just a bad person for all of it. So feedback would be nice. 

My grandmother and mother have not spoken for decades. My aunt was the GC - despite being a complete selfish bitch with a psychotic streak - and my grandmother did horrible things to my mom growing up. My mom and I don't get along either and I lived with my grandmother for a few years growing up. Despite all the shit I got for it from my mother, I kept in contact with her and kept visiting her at least once a year at Christmas. My partner and I don't live locally so we rarely go out there. My mother kept warning me that eventually I'd see the kind of person my grandmother really is but that just wasn't the experience I had and so I basically never believed her. 

Around this time last year, my grandmother had a heart attack. Now, before you go ""Oh my god, that poor woman"", she has lied many times in the past about medical conditions. She's had to change doctors twice because they've refused to see her anymore because of these lies. My grandmother ""fibs"" about everything, her age, her wealth, everything. I was, however, extremely concerned. My aunt texted me late at night, I called her immediately, she informed me my grandmother was in the hospital. At the time I was still studying for my degree, had a full course load and an internship I couldn't get out of lest I lose what little money I had then. The course was a government scheme for unemployed people, it's a long story, let's just say that I couldn't get out of the internship without essentially becoming broke and homeless. I was in the middle of exams as well and this was my last semester. I tried everything I could to get out of it and go visit her - she lives really far away - but I just couldn't. I called her the next morning to see how she was, she said she would be okay, that they were going to operate on her and that she would call or text if anything changed. I heard nothing from her for days. 

Like I said, I had a full course load, internships and exams, in those days I felt like I barely had time to breathe. The weekends - usually my only free days - were spent finalizing a huge project that would be responsible for the majority of my final grade, studying for exams and desperately trying to catch up on housework with my partner. I had zero time to travel for two hours and go see her. Note: I don't have a car or a license, neither does my partner. So after a few days, I got a message on facebook from my niece - the GC aunt's daughter - she asked me to go see grandmother and I immediately knew it wasn't my niece but my aunt I was speaking to. When I informed her that I really wanted to but couldn't, she began spouting profanities and essentially telling me I only cared about my grandmother when she gave me money and what an ungrateful whore I was. For reference, money has been a point of contention between myself and my grandmother. I have asked her many times to stop giving me money, that I didn't need it, that I was fine, that she didn't have to buy my love. She has always insisted that it was hers to do with what she wanted. 

The following days were filled with text messages - often at work - from my aunt filled with profanities and just downright hurtful shit about my appearance, my selfishness, how I was a whore - I've been with my current partner for three years so... not so much -, and so on and so forth. When I finally called my grandmother again - because I was concerned as I hadn't heard from her and I was afraid my aunt was basically spouting all this nonsense to her as well -, I informed her of the reasons why I couldn't visit. She told me, and I quote, ""You don't have to lie to me, I know you don't care"". I explained to her again that I cared very much, I'd been in tears the first time I'd called and had wanted nothing more than to catch a train and go there immediately. She replied ""Well, it's not like you have anything going on during the weekends"". I tried and tried to make clear to her that it really wasn't a case of not wanting to, that I couldn't get out of my internship or my courses, that I was in the middle of exams, the house was in shambles and I was essentially drowning already. She remained cold and cruel to the point where I was so hurt I started to cry. She hung up on me. Hours later she texted me to say ""You have to understand, it's hard for me to be sick like this and not having you care just makes it worse"". 

What made me break contact is that I had stuck with her. Through all her lies, all her drama with my mother, all the horrible things she let my aunt say to me in front of her without ever telling her to stop, I stuck with her. Because I refused to believe it was all bad, I refused to give up on the hope that eventually the family would be reunited again. I have never in my life lied to her, never treated her with anything but respect and the one time I was forced - if I could have, I would have made a different choice - to put myself first, she treats me like that. I've talked about this with my partner and two friends I'm very close with who know a bit about what my family is like but I just can't shake the feeling that I'm a horrible person for not visiting her. Rationally I know that I couldn't have, that I would be broke and homeless now if I had, that I wouldn't have gotten my degree. But emotionally I still feel like I'm a shitty person. What do you guys think? "

It is basically the boss, my coworker, an intern and me. My coworker and I are the only females in the office.  
When I started working there half a year ago I was told that once she takes time off in the last months of her pregnancy and care for her child there would be more duties and more a higher salary in store for me. I think she has now been trying to get pregnant for about 1.5 to 2 years. She is in her early 40s, her partner is in his early 30s. She has been taking a bunch of hormones and has massive mood swings. She knows about these mood swings but there isn't anything she can do about them.  
Because I am the only other female in the office, I am told everything about her struggles. All the failed procedures, everything. I have to comfort her when she is feeling down because something went wrong again. I have to try and make her stop crying when she had another fight with her partner.  
I have no idea about the pain she is going through. I assume it really sucks. However, I really can't help her. I want to, but I don't think it is healthy for my mental state to try and carry her burden. Neither do I think it is helpful for the work environment. Often when I come into her office to ask about work-related things she tells me about her personal life and struggles for a long amount of time. A few days ago she nearly cried when our boss suggested to her that if she was struggling with her work load, she could always give me more tasks.  
I have tried to be as curt as possible, but I can see how this is really depressing for her and bad for the working atmosphere as well.  

How can I establish professional boundaries to get my work done while not cutting my coworker off completely?

I love my mom. I love her a crazy amount. I also hate her more than i've ever hated anyone sometimes. 

* She used to hit me and occasionally still does. And not like, one or two hits. My mother once beat me with a metal broom until it bent. I used to sleep in the bathroom when she would go into one of her rages because it was the only room with a lock in my house. I once cleaned the entire house for her and then when I was cleaning the fridge, a glass bottle of tomato sauce broke and I ended up with a large shard in my foot. She beat me when she found out and took it out. I couldn't stay after school, I never had a sleepover with any friends, I couldn't pick out my own clothes, etc. When I was younger, she never bought me lots of clothes or anything fun ever but she SWEARS that she did! She spoils my brother with expensive shoes and games and game consoles that cost hundreds of dollars when I couldn't even get a gameboy color as a kid. She says that she is my mother and therefore I will always owe her. 

* I did not have any contact with her and had an order of protection from ages 16-18/19. Once the order of protection expired, I missed her a lot so I called her and moved back in. She was great for the next couple of years. I fell into a cycle of being really self destructive since I did not know how to regulate and control myself since I was SO used to being controlled. I did a lot of shitty things and was just kind of a horrible person. From 21 until now, I have gotten my life back on track and am doing really well! I'm graduating college in a couple of months with a good GPA, have two really good jobs, have a potential internship in the summer, etc!

So now on to the financial stuff:

* I've been working since I was fourteen. When I lived with my mother, she took every single one of my checks and I never saw a dime. I had owed this community college $1000 two years ago and could not register elsewhere since they had a hold on my name. I said that I could wait and get a job and pay it off but she sold some of her jewelry to pay for it. I paid her off months later when I got a job. She will never stop bringing this up. She will always tell me how she sold her jewelry as if I did not pay her back. She will also brag to family members. 

* Every semester, I get a substantial amount of money back from my financial aid. I should be getting this last one (since I'm graduating in May) at the end of January. Every single time, I try to save the money. The first semester, I bought myself a laptop since I was sick of having to drive to school to type up papers. Then she asked me for some money. I told her I wanted to save it. She got in my face and told me if I didn't give it to her, she would never help me out financially again. I ended up giving it to her while I was sobbing. She quickly changed her demeanor and smiled and hugged me. Same thing for the last semester.

* I told her a week ago that I was taking extra classes (not true) and so I wouldn't have very much and could only give her like $300 (free money). She gave me this scary and calm smile and said ""we'll see"" and I said ""seriously mom, I'm graduating in May and need money so that I can start my life"" (BTW, she never wants me to move out and thinks I will always live with her). She said ""We will just see when it's in your bank"". When I try to ask her why thats not enough, she just keeps saying that we'll just wait to discuss it later. She also came in my room last night and asked when ""our money"" is coming. My mom doesn't NEED the money. She wants it so that I have to depend on HER for gas money or money for food!

* BTW, I am always in a cycle of borrowing money from her because she'll ask me to do something, like pick up pizza for my siblings and then I will and she won't pay me back. The maximum I owe her right now is $200. So she would be getting an extra $100. She wants more. ALSO, If I borrow $50 dollars from her, she will make me pay her back like $80 and when I ask why, she says ""because i'm your mom"" and I just end up doing it and then being broke again and having to borrow money again.

* I've cried and begged and told her that this is money I have to pay back and NOT free money and she doesn't care. She's thrown things at me and screamed at me and I always end up so tired and just give it to her. And then she gives me a hug and a kiss (while i'm crying) and walks away. 

* I'm really scared because I CANNOT give her the amount she wants. She wants to keep me here with her forever to treat like shit. I am physically abused at least once a month and emotionally abused every single day. I always end up having compassion for my mom because my grandmother is MUCH MUCH worse and I can see WHY my mother is the way that she is but I just can't do this anymore. My therapist compares me to a battered woman. I want to move out but I always end up manipulated and threatened into staying. She also does not do this with my brother who she treats like her GOLDEN child who deserves everything and can do no wrong.

I guess I just need some help in what I should do. I'm scared of what will happen when I say no. I'm scared to move out because she will take my car (that I PAID FOR) which I need for my jobs and school (live in a different city) because HER name is on the title. I can't take it because she wouldn't hesitate to call the cops on me (she has done it before).

I feel like i'm cursed for having the mother that I do. I also feel like i've done a lot of things that i'm not proud of and I may not deserve anything better than this.

Hope this makes sense and is not just rambling (it might be) and I appreciate any advice. Thanks so much. And good luck to all of you!!


*** Hey Guys,

I am going to delete this thread in a couple of minutes since it's giving me a lot of anxiety and i'm freaking myself out thinking my mom will find it or another family member will.

 I really appreciate all the advice you've all given me and it has helped me a lot. I am going to try to start planning my escape. 

Thanks so much. I truly appreciate this!  ***

2s29na,4,2015-01-11,"Request: How to deal with a friend, male, with AN.",EDPostRequests,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2s29na/request_how_to_deal_with_a_friend_male_with_an/,"
Reddit, my best friend of three years has had an ED far before I've known them. I was so oblivious until I joked about it one day, saw their extremely off-put reaction and began noticing all the typical signs: excuses for not being hungry despite them spending entire days on urbanspoon looking at pictures, googling pictures of food, more time fiddling with food than eating it, being particular about food not touching and then refusing to eat it because it wasn't the way ""they liked it"", CONSTANT comments about their weight, and thinking any comment about their appearance was a direct comment to how fat they've become.


About a month after noticing all the direct signs, I confronted them and of course, was greeted with lots of attitude and denial despite my very calm and understanding demeanor. For a while, I felt that it was important to bring it up about once a month in order to remind them that despite my knowing, I was caring to them, still cherished the friendship, and that I was still willing to be there for them in case they ever wanted to do anything about it. I began a hobby of ours to try new restaurants every week to encourage them to find the passions and joy that can come from eating, and we have been going strong. This has been happening for two years.


Fast forward to today. Right now we are roommates, and I try my hardest to never allow their ED to become how I identify them, because despite it all, I know they are human and my dear friend. It's come to the point where even after strongly suggesting alternatives to the starvation, with things like therapy, group support, they still refuse strongly, still continue starving themselves, and has continued to watch their own health deteriorate before their eyes - cessation of the menstrual cycle, hypothyroidism, severe nutrient deficiency, thinning of the blood, thinning of the hair, hair falling out, dry and crackled skin, extreme sensitivity to changes in temperature, ""greying"" of the skin, and only then to say it's because of their ""genetics"", despite the other five members of their family having perfect health. I've brought it up to their parents only to be responded with a very high level of respect, but still extreme denial from both parents.


Reddit, I'm a 20 year old male college student with a lot more on my plate than my friends ED - engineering school, an internship, and a part time music job that demands lots of my time for practice in order to pay bills. At this point today, I feel so ready to just draw the line and call it quits, because I feel that I've done everything I can do, and that if they aren't willing to open up their ears to anybody's help, even from their best friend, then there's nothing I could do to change their ways. It's become so severe to the point that my friends whom I have around the house have begun to notice and will make unintentional comments, leaving my best friend to feel more insecure and defensive (accusing me of sharing it with everyone) even though I've kept the ED to extreme discretion and have only told my mother who is in the medical field to ask for her guidance. I care so much for them, but in the end, feel that I need to look out for myself now that I feel like it's beginning to take an effect on my emotional health, but don't know if that's even the right thing to do. I don't feel that it's fair that they want to just use me for my friendship, but never address the real problems that true friends have the ability to discuss like adults.


I reach out today because I have no experience with this, and need the perspective of someone who has dealt with this before. 

I'm desperate, I'm confused, and more importantly, I feel so defeated that even with my extreme patience (it may sound cocky, but I know that I've been abundantly patient), I haven't been able to get them to even take the first step to treating this, let alone even have them acknowledge it. 

I'm still treated with adamant denial, extreme close-mindedness, and I need help other than my own. 

Am I bad friend for wanting to move on? What should I do?"

In the review I want to ask for ~30,000 as a salary but I'm not sure if they'll go for that as I let them low-ball me for my internsship salary. Anyways does this seem reasonable? I also have 6 months developing experience with a larger company."

It would start by MVM completely shutting down for a week, and a mysterious robotic countdown coming up on the MVM page. The changed maps would be an option, you could still play the originals.)

Introducing: ***ROBOT BOOGALOO: THE SECOND WAVE!***

As all of you Mercs know, a good amount of you have been battling Grey Mann's evil robotic hordes, bravely defeating them, getting loot, yaddah yaddah yaddah. But that's not as important as what's *really* happening here, you guys are acquiring  ***ROBOTIC. HATS.*** They were made to defeat us, but only made us revel in their metallic, quickly depreciating glory! 

Now, you've been wondering, what are those robotic rascals up to now? They can't just still be making those old robotic hats? Could they - Could they be . . . Making new ones?? If you thought that, then . . . 

You're right!! The Robotic Menace have crafted a new wave of robotic hats! You may be thinking, ""Wow! You'd think those robots would realize, hey, maybe making even more hats might not work!"" They have. That's why they've made . . . 

ROBOTIC MISCS! That's right. Robotic shirts, heads, pants, shoes, gloves, everything under the miscellaneous rainbow! The Metallicy, lustrous, metal rainbow! 

They may be uncomfortable, maybe even painful and heavy enough that you'll probably *die* before ever even fighting a robot, but who cares? You've got a ROBOT COAT! Unfortunately, the crates for the new hats, and the separate crates for the new miscs, have blocked mann co's supply lines. While this was happening, those brave mercs fighting off the robots had to retreat for a whole week!

That absence caused quite the damage to every single Mann Vs. Machine map, completely and fundamentally changing them, but not altering the amount of rounds! But that's about all that hasn't changed . . . The loot has changed too . . . But we'll find that out in the update notes and patch notes!

Now that you brave mercs are back at the ruins of those tours, bravely fighting Grey's army, Mann Co. needs to go in to overdrive, supplying you those crates ASAP, so we need to stop talking about our update. Go out, have fun, and smash some robot skulls in!

---------------

***Miscs*** 

Business chrome casual - Need a tie that's made completely out of Chrome? Two things - Why? And we have it!

Noh Metal - This hat is a filthy, filthy liar, as we can assure this hat is 100% pure metal!

Le palladium party phantom - You will wear this to the Opera House, and the people there will say ""Pfft! How uncultured!"" That's when you'll show them that the hat is pure ***robot***, and they are the real uncultured swine! That's when you can leave, without looking back, because only bad asses do that. Bad asses who wear ***robot hats!***

-------------

That's not the only difference in the second wave! New loot is gotten too!

Every new operation can earn you charred robot parts every round and a 1/15 chance to get an ***elite killstreak fabricator!*** An elite killstreak weapon gives the professional killstreak benefits, but adds colored explosions when the gun fires and hit walls or enemies! This effect comes out of the barrel of the weapon, and the bullet holes! Elite Fabricators are completed through charred robo parts and Bot killer weapons from all other tours! There are also rare 1/15 drops of ***New Zealium*** kits. When 200 refined metal is placed into them, it generates a kit to make whatever weapon it's for ***completely Chrome!***

From operation oil flood, you can get quartz botkillers! These botkillers have random robo heads, the least rare being a heavy head or a sniper head, which has a 1/5 chance of dropping at the end of a tour, a Demoman or Soldier head, which has a 1/6 chance, an engie head, which is a 1/7 chance, a scout head, 1/9, a medic head, 1/11, a pyro head, 1/13, or a spy head, 1/15. 

For Bent Steel, you could get a Gallium botkiller, with the same rarity of heads from Oil Flood, which is a lustrous metal forming the head, but made solid again while dripping! An awesome effect!

Undead Mecha Engie can earn you a prismatic botkiller, having the same head rarity. The prismatic botkiller reflects different colors as it goes near light, for example, while walking near red, it will reflect a red beam that bounces off nearby surfaces!

Fallen Cities has an extra rare head, a Cluster of heads! You could drop a Scout, Soldier, and Pyro head clustered together, a Demo's, Heavy's, and an Engies together, or a Sniper's, Medic's, and Spy's together. The first cluster has a 1/17 chance, the second 1/20, and the Last 1/25. These heads all have a Prismatic, Quartz, and a Gallium head, randomly generated. You can choose between two styles, together hanging high in one group of 3, or all hanging down 3 at a time. Regular botkillers that are dropped have the Prismatic effect, with the same rarity as undead mecha engie. 

Operation Crushed Gears, have an effect called wavelength, where the head will randomly warp and change between heads! They are extremely rare, and only have a 1/30 chance of dropping.

2s3xni,10,2015-01-11,Advice from fellow bumpers much appreciated...TMI?,w4nd3ringsoul,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2s3xni/advice_from_fellow_bumpers_much_appreciatedtmi/,"Hi ladies! I am about 5w2d and this is my first pregnancy, so as expected everything has me on edge. Friday night I started spotting. It is a little red, mostly dark brown, and it's not in my underwear or a pantyliner (I only see it when I wipe). Of course, I freaked out, but there wasn't much I could do as my OB office is only open Monday-Friday afternoon. I called the after hours hotline, and actually had an OB return my phone call. She told me not to be too worried and that if it continues to call back in a week. That seems like kind of a long time not to get checked out, so I'm going to call back on Monday (tomorrow) since I'm still spotting. 

That being said, with the help of old posts on here and some advice from babycenter.com, it seems like the best thing for me right now is to try to stay off my feet and rest as much as possible. However, as a current intern, much of my job includes running back and forth to the copier, running errands around town, and being up on my feet for different events. So how can I avoid being up and about so much at work without telling my boss that I'm pregnant and spotting?? Hopefully, I'll be able to get into the OB sooner than later this week :/"

2s43l2,1,2015-01-11,"feeling so low, empty, no motivation. hard to find the good in anything.",pandaman3000,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2s43l2/feeling_so_low_empty_no_motivation_hard_to_find/,"I've had a very rough past couple months. In early September, my now ex-gf and I were in an incident where I called the cops on her for biting me and refusing me from leaving her house because of the fear I was too drunk to drive home. I paid for her lawyer and bail, which I am still paying off to this day. At the end of September, I was laid off from a job I really enjoyed. The day after I was laid off, I caught my now ex on tinder, and she met up with a guy that night, so I was cheated on. Within a span of 2 days, I lost my job and girlfriend (whom I still love to this day, but realize I deserve better). I also found out that my sister who was 3 kids is cheating on her husband, and believe there is no such thing as monogamy, or true love or soulmates.

 I got an internship at a software company as a data analyst, and the job just isn't fulfilling. I have taken up hobbies such as learning a new language, playing basketball, occasionally playing the guitar, and I've set many goals for this year. I see friends I haven't talked to in years, hang out with friends every other day, go to a therapist, hooked up with other girls, met new girls, mew new people, but I just can't seem to get over the hump of being cheated on, and it has affected my drive for everything. Everything feels so empty. My ex had an eating disorder and self-esteem issues, and it was just so toxic to me because I ended up investing so much of myself to make her feel satisfied, which could never happen because she was never satisfied with herself... and her to just walk out on me like that, I've definitley lost a lot of myself. I want to do something that I am proud of. I want to throw myself into the fire, and come back new. I want to travel to Europe this year, but tickets are so expensive and I'm still paying off the lawyer. 

Why can't I let her go? She was so much to me, and when I lost her, I really feel I've lost myself. How could she cheat on me? "

2s4562,1,2015-01-11,That crushing feeling of always being not good enough,keemer,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2s4562/that_crushing_feeling_of_always_being_not_good/,"So backstory about my past: parents divorced at age 3, never met my dad until I was 10. I was completely manipulated by my mother to ruin my dad's second marriage. I came out of closet to dad when I was 20, and unfortunately got disowned. Supported myself through college, when one day my dad got hospitalized. Sister and I made the decision to pull the plug after 8 days of coma-- he was declared brain dead. I have since graduated and now have an amazing job (where I interned). However, I'm only 22 and now I have unfathomable amount of responsibility upon me that I wasn't ready for. Having a house with a mortgage, deciding to sell or keep the house that I cannot afford with my own meager wage, Taking care of mother who does not have a job and doesn't speak english and doesn't drive, on top of all the things expected of a real adult entering the real world. 

Aside from those facts, I keep getting depressed over the fact that I'm always plan B, second choice, on the backburner, a reserve, always 'just barely not good enough'. 

So far the list includes:

* College: wait-listed, accepted last minute
* Internship: Last minute hire due to new addition of a team, so I was #1 on the 'rejected' list
* Case competition: three-time 4th place. 4th place never gets recognized.
* Ex-boyfriends: cheated on, cheated on, cheated on.. And one time I was the 'backup' in case his first choice said no when he asked him out..
* Family: I was always the #2, not smarter than my sister, and my sister got along fine with my parents. I never got along and was physically/sexually abused. 
* Hobbies: I love cooking, photography, and hip-hop dancing. Everytime I audition of a dance team, I always seem to get the same response: ""you're good, but not good enough to perform with us yet"" I had to audition three times to get into my college team. The most recent audition I had, I really really did my best I've ever done and the feedback from the judges I got were amazing too. But I only made the 'scholarship program'-- people who have potential and weren't good enough, which means I will get discount on their company classes. Everyone else tells me that I'm amazing, very good at dancing, but in the end no one invites me to be part of their project when they are forming a project group... I feel so left out and unwanted as if im not good enough

In the end, a lot of things here, I prove myself to the people involved and get accepted. For one, I even became director of a dance team I used to be on.

Everytime I get rejected, my depression gets longer and longer. Last one I had, it lasted about half a year. I feel so weak. I tried to dance today, and my body wouldn't just budge. I'm the common denominator in all these situations-- I'm starting to really doubt myself.. I suck at everything, and that's why I'm never going to be the first pick. My self-confidence has reached its lowest point it's ever been to the point where I can't get myself to do anything. There's no motivation for me to get up and do what I love to do. I'm always going to be average, mediocre, and barely passable. I so SO desperately want to feel better, get out of this depression. I so SO desperately want to feel good about myself again. But here we are again today, everywhere I turn is a reminder that I'm not good enough. I WANT to be good enough for something, it just seems like I'm looking in all the wrong places. I just want to stop struggling and trying extremely hard to get what I want. I see people who have everything and never struggle for anything, so why do I have to struggle for EVERYTHING that I want to do? It's unfair, but the world continues to spin. It just hurts so much that I have to accept I'll never be good enough"
2s45wc,1,2015-01-11,"I'm [24 M] and I live with my parents and work 80-90 hour weeks. I've never had a GF and haven't gotten laid since March. Where should I start, and what am I doing wrong?",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2s45wc/im_24_m_and_i_live_with_my_parents_and_work_8090/,"I'm pursuing dual degrees computer science and chemE at my decently prestigious state school 20 min from mom and dad, and I won't be finished until I 'm 26 because I fucked up massively when I was 19-21 (2 felonies, terrible grades, etc etc) and had to pretty much start my life over at 22. I have ADHD and moderation has never been my thing, so now I have a research internship on campus, and I teach kids martial arts about 15 hours or so a week in addition to the ridiculous workload of junior year in engineering. Pretty much all of that money goes towards gas and food, and I don't have time to work more shifts, or a desire to take any more student loans than I absolutely need to, so I'm gonna be living at home for the next two years. 

Even going past the point of the logistics of having time to date because of my insane schedule, how do I deal with my complete lack of experience with relationships and my very limited sexual experience? 

I'm 5'7"" so I'm too short for some girls, but other than that I'm actually conventionally attractive and know how to dress up when I need to.  I used to post on r/ladybonersgw fairly regularly and when I had a fetlife account last year I got inboxed all the time. I met a couple regular fwb's through that site but they all panned out and I deleted my account because I felt kind of desperate being on there. I've never been able to maintain a relationship or had anything consistent or ongoing, and it really affects my confidence. I'm terrible at expressing my emotions, and to quote an ex-lover from before I went to jail/rehab ""I need to learn how to fuck"". 

Whenever I hang out with my more socially savvy friends and go to house parties I always feel like a boring nerd who can't talk about anything but math and programming when people try to talk to me. Girls will come up to me and hit on me, and I don't have a problem approaching them either, but I can't keep a convo going for more than a couple minutes. I can talk to someone about something I'm interested in all day, but I can't flirt to save my life. It always ends up with me getting curious about what their studying or their job and it turns into an interview. Even if I get their number it just doesn't work out. I have so much anxiety over it that I usually delete the numbers I get at the first sign of disinterest, sometimes even before I ever try to text them or anything. Girls my age don't want to be with someone who lives with their parents and hasn't finished school, and girls younger than me seem to go after guys who are more fun and extroverted. Their eyes glaze over when I start to talk about school or how much I love engineering and programming.

I'm happy in almost every aspect of my life, I'm doing great in school, have a decent size circle of friends, I have a fun job where I make more per hour than almost all of said friends, and before I messed up my back a couple months ago I was in great shape and getting pretty good at bjj. I know I shouldn't tie so much of my self-worth to sex, but it really bothers me that I'm the only one of my friends who just can't seem to get any. Most of them tell me it's because I'm not trying hard enough, and that I'm too logical. But I don't really understand how I could change that. I don't have time or money to go out and try as hard as I could to meet girls, and I don't have the attention span to hold a conversation with someone I think is boring all night just to sleep with them. And as far as being too logical that's not something I can change. 18 credits a semester of math, physics and programming will do that to a man. And it's not like my engineering classes are a great place to meet women.

TL;DR; Stereotypical introverted, neurotic STEM student with poor social skills and male dominated hobbies needs to figure out how to get girls without posting naked pictures of himself online. And how to maintain healthy relationships with them. Sorry if this was a rant

I need some help:

Flirting &amp; expressing your intentions
Conquering sexual shame &amp; anxiety
Developing attractive body language

Relating to women sexually in general. I have platonic female friends, but I feel like my entire personality is the exact opposite of what women in their 20's think is attractive.

2s4v01,3,2015-01-11,"Thoughts on computer usage, it all depends on how you use it",Sheehan7,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2s4v01/thoughts_on_computer_usage_it_all_depends_on_how/,"After seeing some posts about cutting out computer usage all together and even selling/getting rid of your computer I just wanted to share my own personal thoughts on the matter.

Computer usage can vary from person to person but the majority of people here have a stigma against the computer due to addiction whether it be porn or general computer addiction. To me computers are a large part of my life. I built my own computer and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had and was a ton of fun so to me it's kind of special. I am an IT major and I run a website/youtube channel all about tech and computers. However this isn't to say it's all I do and to me it's all about how you use it. 

Since starting NoFap I have cut back on the mindless internet surfing and video watching and have instead focused on more productive things such as coding, IT support instructional videos, website/branding tips (trying to grow my website more), applying for internships, motivational speeches, /r/running /r/bicycling and /r/fitness discussions, less facebook, and well even a game or two of League of Legends with my friends (we all have to have our hobbies right?). I also hate being home especially on the computer for more than a few hours if that. Usually I will wake up check emails and Youtube/Twitter notifications and then go to school and use my laptop for notes and studying, go to work, workout, and then when I get home have some free time on the computer to do the things listed above. I would also never turn down a friends invite to hangout regardless of what I am doing on the computer besides school work. I also try to take my computing elsewhere such as Starbucks or my college campus as much as possible or at least be Skyping a friend while using it. 

Basically on an average day I am on the computer quite a lot but it's almost  always productive and I think that is the ground people need to find with computer usage and NoFap. The computer is definitely something that can become addicting, I have seen it. I have seen people just waste time mindlessly scrolling through facebook and tumblr things that give back almost nothing useful. However in this day in age it is very hard if not impossible to  go without a computer and I hate to see people calling it the devil in some instances on this subreddit. The computer is (in my opinion) the greatest advancement the human has accomplished so don't give up on it but also don't use it for stupid crap. 

TL;DR: Computers are a great thing when combined with productivity and moderation so don't make them out to be some sort of devil but tread wisely as they can be your worst enemy. "

Got nowhere with it. I was too scared to get a job and only managed to do a few months of volunteering. 

I ended up applying to university because I didn't know what else to do. I just finished my first semester at one of the top universities in the world but I'm not enjoying my major. We can only change our major once at my uni but I don't even know what I would to change to. I only have the prerequisites for humanities subjects (I suck at math) which all seem to be equally useless for future employment. I'm getting good grades in my assignments but they're stressing me out a lot. I manage my time really poorly and procrastinate too much. I haven't made time to make friends or join student societies or anything. I feel like it's too late for all that now. 

Outside of academics I have roughly zero marketable skills, other than being bilingual. I'd like to teach myself skill or audit an extra class in programming or something but I can't even manage my current work load properly. Everyone on my programme is already being proactive with internships, jobs, societies etc. and I have no clue what I'm doing, I'm totally lost. I've gotten out of shape in the past few months too - nothing extreme but it's affected my confidence. 

I'm trying to arrange to see a therapist on campus in order to deal with the stress but I can't imagine them being very helpful. Maybe I needs meds. I don't know. I'm worried about the future. I have no experience of the real world but in a few years the real world will thrust itself upon me and I need to be prepared somehow. I've been trying my best but I don't have direction anymore. I know I want to get fit, have better study habits, be more social, be more decisive, find internships, learn useful skills etc etc. but it all seems so overwhelming that I end up doing none of it. I feel like giving up at this point.

2s657t,271,2015-01-12,Walked in on my girlfriend cheating on me.,plasticized,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2s657t/walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_cheating_on_me/,"tl;dr: Practically walked in on my girlfriend with another guy. Found the freshly used condom in the trash. Much pain and misery ensues. 


We had been kind of bickering at each other yesterday morning. I was going to go over to her place in the afternoon. She was going snowshoeing and I had some errands to run so I went out to try to get my stuff done so I'd be able to go over there as soon as she was back. But, she got back and hour later than she said she was going to and I had already gone home. I wasn't going to go over then, and it really stung that she didn't seem to care. Maybe an hour or so later, I decided to go over. I had been kind of childish before and I thought I would go see her. I was having a rough day, and I really needed the comfort of seeing her, and I wanted to apologize for not coming over earlier. 

The entire drive across town, all I could think about was what I might find when I got there. The guy she went snowshoeing with was someone she had started hanging out with a lot lately. First he was going to show her around his gym because she wanted to start working out but was afraid to go in by herself and not know what she was doing. They never made it to the gym. They had lunch or coffee or something, and then a day later or something she mentioned that he had come over there. To the apartment she had been madly cleaning for the last week. 

I had been having some trust issues with her for a couple of months. She had asked me how I would feel if we had an open relationship because she wanted to try things with other people. I was the only one she had ever had sex with, so I certainly understand that desire, but it just wasn't something I knew I could handle. She wanted to be able to go fuck other guys, with no strings attached, just to see what it was like. She wanted a threesome with two guys. That was a big fantasy for her. I was working on adjusting my mindset. I wanted to be supportive and open to new things. I just needed to get the jealousy under control. And I told her that. It was something I was trying to learn to accept. I didn't want to keep her from having those experiences. I am so much older than she is, I've had some experience with other people. I didn't want to deprive her of that experience, but I needed some time to adjust to the idea. 

I parked on the street near her apartment. I knocked lightly on the door and tried to open it, but it was locked. There is a keypad to unlock the door, so I would have been able to just let myself in as long as she didn't have the chain on. But she didn't have the chain on. She put it on as soon as she realized it was me. She said ""fuck"", and then I thought I heard whispers. But I didn't want that to be true, so I didn't really hear them.

For a few minutes she kept telling me to go away. At first, there was terror, and fear, in her voice. She knew she had been caught. But, she quickly came up with a story that she was mad at me, and was sure that I had just come over there to fight with her about something. She just said she didn't want to talk to me. 

I finally gave up. I walked back to my car and just started balling. I started to text her. She just kept saying that she didn't want to see me. And suddenly she asked where I was. I told her I was in my car, and she told me to come in. She had figured out a way to sneak him out. There was a second door in her apartment that went to the basement and the laundry, but there was an exit to the outside that way too. I went in and she was standing there in the living room. I was glad she had finally let me in, but I was still looking around at everything suspiciously. The things she usually kept sitting in front of the basement door where not quite in their usual place. But I didn't want to see it. I took off my shoes and my coat, and I walked over to her and embraced her. I was so madly in love with her, I was just blind to what was going on around me. 

She started telling me something about the cat or something, and led me into the kitchen. There was no reason to go in there. Afterwards, of course, I realized she was giving him time to escape where I wouldn't see him through the window. 

She invited me in her room. We usually spend our time there cuddled up in bed. The pillows were arranged, one next to the other. I could see, what I later realized was panic in her face when she saw the stains of her own wetness on the sheets. I saw them. But I still didn't see them. 

We talked and cried and went on about how hard it was for us, that we couldn't be together as much as we wanted. How she felt like she was giving up her dreams for me. She didn't apply for some summer internships out of state, she didn't apply to any other colleges. And in there somewhere, left unsaid, but still heard, that she was giving up on a host of sexual experiences that she longed to have. That she wasn't really giving up afterall. 

I laid there in bed with her. It makes my skin crawl, and I want to vomit. But we laid there and talked and cried. She climbed over me to grab a kleenex. Either she realized that the used condom or wrapper was still sitting on the top of the garbage can, or maybe had just been sitting on the bedside table. It did strike me as odd that she didn't just ask me to hand the tissues to her. But as she straddled me, I declined to care. 

We talked and it seemed we had worked things out. Things had been rocky for us for months, partly because I hadn't really trusted her for some time. But I had written it all off to my depression and my anxiety. I just called those thoughts my demons.

She had to go to work, so she got ready. She stood there in front of me and changed her shirt. She had dressed in a hurry obviously so she was only wearing a tank top and a pair of sweats with nothing underneath. She snuck around the corner to pull off her pants and put some underwear on. I don't know if she didn't want me to see that she wasn't wearing any, or what exactly she was hiding from me then. That wasn't a usual thing for her to do. 

When she was ready, I was going to give her a lift to work. She always just walked. It wasn't far. I kissed her. I kept my lips on hers and I could feel her tense. I kissed her again, but now she had lowered her head to avoid it somewhat. 

I took her to work. She was texted furiously as we drove. I can only assume to him. To fill him in on what happened after he left. Maybe to tell him that I hadn't suspected anything. But, I suspected everything. 

I pulled away from the parking lot and went straight back to her apartment. I had bought her a few things on my errands earlier that day and I had forgotten to give them to her. I wanted to look around. I wanted to find nothing so desperately. But, I knew exactly what I was looking for. I looked the the kitchen garbage can first. The least likely place, but I still was hoping I would find anything. I had to check the small can in the bedroom. I picked the two wadded tissues off the top and saw the gold wrapper. It still didn't convince me. Maybe she was just playing around with one. She did that from time to time. Put one on a toy or something. I reached in and pulled it out. A condom, heavy and full of cum. At that moment, I died. 

I sent her a text, to tell her that I had gone back into her apartment, that I had looked in the trash. I didn't expect her to get it unless she had a break in a few hours, or 6 hours later at the end of her shift. But my phone notifies me when she sees my texts. I sent three messages to her. Each one was seen, with no reply. Eventually she write back something about that she was sorry. Then that she had left work, that she had thrown up. She asked for some confirmation that I wasn't going to hurt myself. I've attempted it, although feebly once before. She tried to call, and I rejected it. 

The last I heard was text a few hours later. Simply, ""Be well,..."". The ellipsis was replaced by her pet name for me. 

I have no one I can talk to about any of this. I didn't sleep much last night. I woke up thinking it was much later, but I had only managed to stay asleep for an hour. I wrote her a rather lengthy email. I needed to explain everything I saw. How much I had wanted it to be simply my demons. How angry and hurt I am. I needed her to understand what she did. She never gave me any words of remorse. The only sorry, was not for what she had done, but that she hadn't done a better job of keeping it from me. 

I am lost. directionless, floating in an abyss. I am an empty shell. I feel completely devoid of all life. I am already dead. My body just has not caught up to this fact yet. I don't want to die. I want to turn it off. 

The worst part is that I could forgive her. I love her. I'm really far less hurt that I feel I should be. But I could never trust her again. 


I know how things go on this sub. I don't expect any comments. Just a note to say you listened would be nice.

Update: I want to thank all of you for all of your kind words. You should know that we have split up. Our relationship had been rocky for several months. It was bound to end. I just wouldn't let it go. I'm so much older than her, and she has a lot of growing up to do. She's not ready for me yet. I went to work today. I made someone come with me on my route. I couldn't be alone. I was afraid I'd steer myself into an oncoming truck. I've had the last hour at home by myself. We talked a little this morning. I want to be her friend, even though she did this horrible thing to me. I've been where she is today. Hell, I've been where I am now before. More than once. I sure know how to pick them. (All the more reason that it is so hard not to blame myself though. Four times I've been through this.) Part of me still cares and wants to help her figure it out without having to go through the decade of pain and misery that I experienced trying to figure out life for myself. I need some time away. A little time to heal. A little time to detach. I don't think that's ever really going to work though. Keep reading and you'll find out what I just found out. 

I asked her about STD's just now. She's dancing around the question a little. That's not very promising. Her and I hadn't done anything before she hooked up with this guy, but she apparently blew some other guy a few weeks ago. I'll have to go get tested then. I feel like I'm going to be sick. 

I'm home by myself now. I stayed at work just hanging around for several hours so I didn't have to come home and be alone. I rescheduled a job interview I had tomorrow so I could finally have a real, full-time job after being unemployed or under-employed for several months. I talked to my mom on the phone, but I couldn't bring myself to mention anything. Someone is here now so I don't have to sit here alone. I think I'll be ok.

I love you all. Thank you.

Update 2: I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone. I'll keep trying. Thank you all so much. I'm trying very hard to be bigger than all this. Right now, I just feel so sorry for her. She's just a depraved little girl who has to whore herself out in order to feel good about herself. It makes me very sad for her. She could be so much more. 

I've got my meds in order again too. I ran out and went a few days before I could get a refill. Being off the meds for a few days seriously fucks with me.

2s6bmx,1,2015-01-12,I (22M) have been in love with my gf (21F) for over a year. She's amazing. Why am I so confused?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2s6bmx/i_22m_have_been_in_love_with_my_gf_21f_for_over_a/,"We met at a festival through mutual friends. Our friends didn't want to see the metal band, we did. Made out in the front surrounded by thousands of people. It was magical. We saw each other a handful of times. Made out, it was passionate. then an internship in florida for me. she happened to be in the area two months in. We admitted our feelings. Talked on the phone every night for my remaining four months of the internship. 2014 we spent an hour apart and now she's just moved back home for grad school. After being in each others lives, we are finally no more than give minutes away from each other.

In leaving this internship. I sort of left behind my dream job (don't want to detract from the story, but it involves a mouse and a castle). I now work 40+ hours between a pizza restaurant (bout 36+ of those hours) and a light bartending gig. I love my restaurant. I love bartending. But not the way I was back in FL. But it hurt being away from her. The first four months of our relationship(the first four months we weren't making out at parties we happened to be at) were spent long distance.  We talked for hours daily I never stopped texting her, and called for at least an hour nearly every night. I moved home and that hour of distance was traveled weekly by one of us. Sometimes more than once. Over time I texted less. I called less. She hated that. And noted it regularly. 

""We're still long distance I still should hear from you. I still want to talk to you"" 
""well babe I drove in from seeing you this morning and worked a double. I kinda just don't feel like talking a bunch"".

This conversation happened a lot. I still don't know if I was ever really at fault. She expected me to talk until I fell asleep. That was what she would do for me, why wouldn't I do it for her six months after cutting the distance down from 12 hours to 1. I felt smothered.

Fast forward to last week. She now lives here in my town. Five minutes away. Our first meeting was about two years and some change ago. My mom was going on a vacation. I would have the house to myself for a week. Holy shit this has never happened before. Bought a PS3 for super cheap, a copy of atlas shrugged and a bit of weed. Finally living alone for a small bit of time

I spent twelve hours of that week by myself. I played no games. I'm on page 30 of atlas shrugged. I was with her the whole time. She doesn't like it when I play video games when she's spending time with me. ""You can't just play it later?"" No it appears that I can't. The realization that I had seven full days to do what I wanted and the majority of it was spent not doing what I wanted. Does that make me selfish?

She's amazing. She's kind. Beautiful beyond reason.  One of the few girls I could know that can make me laugh. Really laugh. The sex is great. I couldn't picture a more amazing person to spend my life with. Hell I want to spend my life with her. The thought of her in a wedding dress seriously makes me want to cry. I love her.

If i ask her for space, she gets upset. She's very vulnerable.  A wrong comment ruins the next two+hours.  I haven't hung out with my friends nearly as much I used to (this whole relationship, x5 now that she's home. They notice. I also feel like I'm her only true friend these days. The people that are her ""friends"" don't hit her up all that much. I don't think I'm ready mentally to commit this much, but I don't want to end something that is so wonderful. But every day I feel like it's harder and harder to manage. She believes that there is something wrong when I don't want to talk or be around her. I just like time to myself. She gets upset and negative. And suddenly the time to myself is now an hour or two of convincing her that nothing is wrong.

I haven't been alone in five days. I don't want to hurt her. But the commitment I'm in is just building on me and I have no idea what to do. Any guidance please. Thanks

Tl; dr: dating most amazing girl ever and not sure if I should commit. "
2s6et6,0,2015-01-12,Could you give me some advice for searching for internships / jobs?,mtm028,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2s6et6/could_you_give_me_some_advice_for_searching_for/,"I am studying for a Masters Degree in Mathematics.  I have one year left, and I really want to take advantage of the upcoming summer break and do something useful toward building a career.  But I do have some circumstances to consider.
  
I live in the middle of nowhere (my University is also in the middle of nowhere) and I have a wife and two children.  So traveling to New York City or Philadelphia to do your basic actuarial, financial, or other internships this summer is out of the question.
  
I reached out to a local research hospital to see about an internship in their data science department and they are happy to take me, but the funding must come from my University because the entire health system is in a hiring freeze at this time.  As I work towards writing a grant proposal for my university, I want to explore other options.
  
I am within commuting distance of some larger towns that have software companies.  I am thinking of reaching out to them for internship (or summer job) opportunities.
  
As far as my qualifications go, I have successfully completed two courses that had programming and computer work involved, including Numerical Analysis (we used a lot of python and sage) and Theory of Statistics (Minitab, we learned to write some macros).

So I am familiar with the basics of programming and use programming to solve actual math problems.  I solve Project Euler and Rosalind.info problems for fun in my spare time too.

My question is, how can I take this ""resume"" above and present myself in such a way that I would be more likely to obtain a position this summer?  What is the best way to ""reach out"" to companies and let them know that I am interested in working for them?  What else can I do to prepare myself and try to get a good summer internship?
  
Thanks for your time."
2s6ha7,177,2015-01-12,What To Expect 6 Years In - My Personal Experience In Accounting,SamuraiAccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2s6ha7/what_to_expect_6_years_in_my_personal_experience/,"Hello All,

I thought I would share for everyone what my experiences have been in the accounting world, both so others can compare and share their experiences, and so those that aren't this far in yet can have some perspective on what to expect.

I worked in public accounting for 5 years, and I have worked in private for a little over a year. I worked at two different firms in public, one a smaller mid-sized regional firm (approximately 100 auditors) and another a multi-office small firm (only about 30 staff in my office but probably 100 total). I now work in private at a company with approximately $125M in revenue a year as the Manager of Financial Reporting. Below, I will share my experience by year, both in terms of pay, knowledge and experience learned, work/life balance, and expectations for the future.

Year 1: As a brand new staff, I didn't know anything coming in besides what I learned in my accounting classes and the short internship I had in an accounting department. Auditing was very different in practice from what I had learned in school, although knowing journal entries very well definitely helped a lot at certain points, and it was expected I knew journal entries coming in (it was perhaps one of the few pieces of knowledge I was expected to know). I received a week of training in my office, most of which was useless, and then received the rest of my training on the job. My first couple of months I barely had any work and just picked up tax returns that seniors didn't want to do or did scanning of work papers. I didn't really know what I was doing for the first 6-8 months besides tracing to things. While I was able to check of the boxes saying I traced to this invoice and saw the backup etc., I didn't really understand the purpose of why I was doing anything I was doing. At around 8 months, a senior on one of my clients left and I had to work closely one on one with the partner to get things done. It just clicked then, at least for the areas I was doing. I still didn't get everything, but I at least started to understand what I had been doing and felt a bit more confident in myself. I also began to feel more comfortable around the clients and not as self-conscious (I used to be afraid of calling strangers on the phone). My pay was around 52k a year. During busy season, my hours were generally not more than 52 a week, although I had to come in every Sunday regardless of work needs. This was right around the time when the recession hit, so they had over-hired and were overstaffed, which is why I wasn't busier. By the end of my first busy season, they had layoffs, which I luckily avoided. Most of the people that got laid off were out of work for a long time, and had too little experience to get any real jobs. My seniors were mainly nice, and they treated me well, and took the time to teach me, which was very important in my avoiding getting laid off.

Year 2: I was now much more confidant in my skills, but also much more aware of the ""political"" needs of being an auditor. At the beginning of my second year, I was given a small raise (was told I was lucky to receive one at all because of the economy) to about 54 or 55k. My main senior decided to quit the firm at this point in the middle of a small client. I was left as the in-charge. While it wasn't a complicated client, I had never touched certain revenue accounts yet, and the client was really touchy about being asked for ANYTHING (i.e. if I asked for personnel files, I was told that we were given that last year and shouldn't need it again). When speaking with this client, I said we should be able to meet their deadline as long as we got this last revenue spreadsheet wrapped up. The client flipped out at me and said they didn't need a pep talk from a staff accountant, and complained to the partner. While my first time being an in-charge wasn't as glorious as I hoped, I still learned a lot, mainly about the need to always suck up to the client and how much that sucks. This is when I began doubting I wanted to make partner, since I didn't want to have to always please stupid clients, but no firm decision had been made yet. I continued on with the year, and was an in-charge on a couple smaller clients, and basically acting as a senior even though I wasn't yet. Because people had been laid off, they were now understaffed, and my hours shot up. I worked 55 hours every week during busy season, and every Sunday. I became recognized in my firm as an expert in a very specific area since it was a newly introduced area and I had the first firm client with the first year end that it would be applicable. This definitely helped me get the respect from a couple of partners early in my career, and the hours I was putting in and being productive also helped. I still felt like the low-man on the totem poll.

Year 3 - Remember that client that had been annoyed with me in year 2, almost a year prior? Well apparently, the partner did, and during my annual review, I was held back from becoming a senior (in title, since I was already a senior in action) because the partner thought I needed to learn more how to handle clients. Even though that was the only thing ever that had happened and the partner knew the client was a dick. This is when I first learned about how easy it is to get screwed over. I was told the economy was still bad and got a raise to about 58k. I was still in charge of multiple clients, and began to supervise more staff. My hours fluctuated from month to month, where I had some regular weeks of 40 hours and others with 55 non-busy season weeks, going to a different client every day to supervise my staff auditors. I was put on some of the worst clients in the firm (small fees, horrible books at the client where I was correcting almost every single account in their trial balances, and jackass management even worse than the guy that screwed me over before). I began to feel very unmotivated after they held me back from my promotion since I was still doing the work of a senior, and dealing with such crappy clients, and began to slack. A couple months later they promoted me and said I was ready now (ha! great reinforcement that no one notices how you are doing). I got a small raise to 60k. I worked through the busy season, averaging 55 hours about. Even after the promotion, I still couldn't get myself to care as much about the firm. I felt like now that I was the senior and didn't have nice people above me, the partners didn't appreciate my hard work, and didn't care if I had crappy clients. I saw the partners coming in on Sundays too during busy season, although not as often as staff, and decided that it wasn't worth it to be 60 years old and still having to work on the weekend and late into the evening so often, even if you make tons of money. I would rather have a life outside of work.

Year 4 (First half): I was put on the worst client in the firm, and at the same time, booked on travelling clients (I had to stay overnight in hotels for one month straight). It was a nightmare busy season. I had managed to shake myself out of my funk, and was focusing on work again. I had interviewed at and received an offer at McG for 68k, but turned it down since someone I had previously worked with went there and said it was crazy there in that specific division. I also had other interviews lined up at other public accounting firms, but nothing came of them. By now I was able to handle all aspects of an audit, including areas some partners didn't know, and needed very little partner involvement in the audits. I had multiple staff on different clients under me. I was very lucky to have smart and hard working staff most of the time. Then, right after my worst client was finished, I got laid off. A few other people were also let go. I was told it was because the partner wasn't happy with the work done on a client I was assigned while I was out of state, as if I could have done anything about it! I was somewhat regretting not accepting that offer from McG, but at the same time, kind of happy. This was my first real break from working in almost 4 years. I wouldn't start looking for work for another month or so. I just relaxed and studied for my CPA exam finally since I had pushed that off. At first being out of work felt freeing, then I felt depressed since I had nothing to do after 3 months and started looking. I had to wait until busy season got closer to find something.

Rest of Year 4 and Year 5: I got a new job at the second firm for 58k, through someone that used to work at my old firm. The 58k didn't bother me as much because they had no overtime that wasn't compensated with additional time off, and I still needed to finish my CPA exams, which I did. I was a senior here, and things were MUCH easier at this smaller firm. It was like being a big fish in a little pond. Competition with other auditors was non-existent. Most people viewed their jobs as 9-6 and that was it. Since it was smaller, I had to do more of the work myself. I had decided to start looking for a job in private almost right after being hired, because I didn't see the point anymore in staying in public and not being promoted to manager for what would've been another 3-4 years at this firm minimum. So I looked for a new job for a whole year in private, and enjoyed the better hours and wrapped up my CPA exams. I was treated well by my managers, the partners did nothing at the smaller firm and left at 6 every day and never worked weekends. They definitely made less money than the partners at my other firm, but they had a work-life balance. It was too late for me though, I was burnt out of public accounting.

Year 6: I did it! I finally got a sweet job in private! After getting turned down for senior accounting jobs at small companies, I got a Manager of Financial Reporting role at a large one. My salary jumped to around 80k, with a lot more vacation time. My hours were generally 35 a week, with rare overtime around audit. It was a big transition, but I actually felt like what I was doing had some value. Auditing felt stupid, like I was just checking someone else's records and not really doing anything else. Now, I could actually help with decision making financially inside an organization. I did a lot of different things now. I didn't have to travel all over the place anymore, or carry a heavy laptop. I had my own office, and a boss that treated me great. I was really happy finally. It was a good job. Soon it began to get a bit boring, since the interaction with other people was much less than in public. A part of that was not feeling like working in a team the same way. In public, I would have 2 or 3 people on a team with me, we ate our meals together, worked late into the evening and on weekends together, but in private, people come in, do their jobs, and leave. The age differences are much bigger in private. I don't feel as connected personally with people here. It is still a great job, but it is something in public you just cannot get in private. I don't travel to different clients sites anymore either. It is less exciting. But I would still trade the auditor lifestyle again in a heartbeat for the predictability that comes with being in private, even if it is boring sometimes, and a bit lonely.

Expectations going forward, lessons learned: After all of this, I occasionally get calls from recruiters. They seem to think they can get me jobs paying 105-120k for assistant controller positions. I got a small raise after being here a year, and I still think I have a bunch to learn before I leave. I won't turn down an interview though for a job with a 20k pay bump. Looking forward, I think and hope I will eventually become an assistant controller at a large place or a controller at a smaller place, and eventually become a CFO/Director of Finance in another 10 years. I expect my salary to go to 120k in the next 5 years, and to 150k by the 10 year mark, but I have to make sure I don't get sloppy or rusty. I have learned a lot. I think the interpersonal skills and politics I have learned are more important than the skills. At the end of the day, my experience in public accounting really doesn't make me that much more qualified than I would have been straight out of college in my current position. A lot of the stuff you just pick up and learn on the job, and need to not be afraid of trying new stuff on your own using logic. I learned how important it is to suck up to people (in a non-obvious way), whether they be clients, partners, or bosses/seniors. Also, always treat someone nice, as you never know when they might be able to help you in the future (like after I got laid off, I got a friend from the firm I had supervised a job at another firm, and he was really good so that hurt my old firm, and I got the job because the manager liked me at my old firm for my second job). Realize that your career is a marathon, not a race. It is a bit hard to see that with the constant promotions you get at first in public, but you have to not lose hope after a small setback in the first year or two of your career, and just keep focus.

I hope my story was helpful! Let me know if you have any questions!"
2s6rn8,3,2015-01-12,PhD depression,lordymosh,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2s6rn8/phd_depression/,"Hi,

I'm currently in my third year of a PhD and I fucking hate it! Let me give a little background.

I did my undergraduate degree in Physics. In fourth year we had to do an undergraduate project. So luckily I got the one I wanted in this research institute close to my university. I had no idea what I wanted to do after my college course and I was worried about this. Luckily, my supervisor asked me back for a summer internship with the possibility of a postgrad. After the summer I got offered a PhD by the same group. I took it, though I wish now I didn't. I never liked the internship at all (constantly feeling down and anxiety), I was sort of pressured by my dad to do a postgrad if offered and I had no idea what I wanted to do anyway so I thought it wouldn't hurt. A year into my PhD I had a fainting episode due to stress. The doctor gave me the all clear. This has happened twice since then. I've been for a few counselling sessions in between.

The work is constantly on my mind, I feel like a failure if I don't reach specific goals. During your PhD your suppose publish papers. I'm in my 3rd and have none yet. This is more due to equipment failing and I've moved to a different yet related work for my thesis.

One of my main problems is that I'm too hard on myself. Numerous people have said this to me. But I've felt this way basically since I was 10 so I find it hard to not be so negative as I have been my entire life.

Its been really tough the past while, I even started having ideas of self harm to get out of doing the PhD anymore. The problem is I would quit, but I'm in so far now, I'm nearly finished. Also if I quit, I don't think I can handle that idea of failure hanging over me for the rest of my life. I take life too seriously?

Another problem is that I'm a big lover of weed. Over the past year I've basically smoked weed everyday. I know that this is probably contributing to the way I feel down all the time but its the only thing that I really enjoy. But I've made the decision to now give it up for a few months to see if it makes me feel better. It can't be good smoking that much.

So today, I went to the bathroom during work and started crying. I was sick of feeling this way. So I told my supervisor about my feelings and the thoughts of self-harm (I had told him a number of times before about feeling down etc.) He's totally supportive, he urged me to seek counselling again and to go see a GP.

I just want to be happy in my life. But the PhD is like a do or die situtation to me. If I stay I feel trapped, if I leave I'll feel like a failure.

Luckily I have a gf of nearly 9 years. I love her so much, but it is and always has been a long term relationship. She lives about 3 hours away. Its tough, I do see her like 2/3 weekends of every month. But I'd just love it if she could move in with me. I'd be so happy. We have talked about this but she has her own problems at home with her mom, trying to find work etc.

Sorry for such a disjointed passage of text!"

City of Philadelphia Dept of Parks &amp; Recreation (PPR) has determined that selected ash trees should begin being treated during summer 2015, in order to protect them from this pest.  Approximately 1000 ash trees have been identified for treatment.  Trees will be treated systemically, which requires drilling a series of small diameter (1/8”) holes and injecting pesticide via a small pressurized tank connected to a network of hoses. Treatment data will be collected on electronic tablets.  PPR anticipates hiring four (4) interns to work in two teams to perform the ash tree treatments throughout PPR of parks during summer 2015.  Interns will be expected to obtain PA Dept of Agriculture “Certified Public Pesticide Applicator” license prior to beginning field work.  PPR will subsidize the effort required to obtain this license as an initial project task.   

Specific Responsibilities:
•	Work with PPR staff to obtain the Certified Public Pesticide Applicator license
•	Work with a partner intern to locate and identify ash tree that are to be treated throughout PPR parks.
•	Remove vines and weedy vegetation from tree bases as necessary to access root flare.
•	Calculate pesticide quantities, drill required number of holes in tree bases and properly inject each individual tree 
•	Use I-Pad Tablet to collect field data on individual trees including diameter, date, pesticide quantity, weather conditions, treatment time length, tree health, etc.
•	Re-tag trees that are missing identification tags.
•	Work in a logical and consistent manner to maximize productivity
•	Communicate clearly and politely with citizens.

Job Qualifications:
•	Availability to commit to working for duration of project (approx. mid-May – late August 2015).
•	Interest in obtaining the PA Certified Public Pesticide Applicator Certification
•	Ability to work in field conditions and walk long distances over variable terrain.
•	Basic plant identification skills for common Philadelphia trees.  
•	Familiar with electronic data collection and equipment use.
•	Good written/oral communication skills.
•	Valid State Drivers License.  A vehicle will be required by each intern.  PPR cannot provide transportation

I'm looking for a job. I would prefer a career. I hoping to find a unique opportunity or non-traditional job. You travel often and need someone to hold down the fort? You need someone to travel with you? Do you do something local that many people don't know about or would even think about for work? Let me know I could totally be your guy for working with or for you. Maybe you have a mundane job with great pay and benefits? You should let me know I might be just the guy to join you. You thinking of starting your own business and need a partner to hold you accountable and throw himself into it right there with you? Get in touch.

I've got a Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Criminal Justice. I've got a couple years of experience working in the school system and with at risk youths/populations. I've done some other things as well, but I doubt you care about my paper route, fairgrounds, police department internship, or security supervisor work stints. 

Your business out of the state or country? I wouldn't rule you out. I'm willing to relocate if the pay is right and I'll force my family and dogs to come with me. I'll even leave them at home if it's temporary leave. If you need a mascot or just love dogs I could even bring my St Bernard around with us. 

To sum the whole spiel up. You've got an open position or thinking of opening a position and need someone who isn't going to quit six months down the road. You let me know and lets talk. I've got a lot I can bring to your business or company.

Please contact me via a private message or post a way for me to contact you in a reply here.

Thanks."
2s8295,13,2015-01-12,NDad being taken away from EMom,chyell,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2s8295/ndad_being_taken_away_from_emom/,"Background of my family:

NDad: Loves all food that is bad for you, diabetic, conveniently had 4 strokes 4 years ago(around the time mom started talking about divorce again), cheated on my mom multiple times by leaving the state or the country with his mistresses. Threatened to kill my sister and myself as a form of disciplinary action. Started a bunch of construction businesses which all failed and had my mom file for bankruptcy twice(From what I understand, all under her name). Momma's boy(grandma passed away now). His dad shot himself when I was 3 or 4.

Emom: Met Dad in Korea. He was best friends with my uncle in High School, they decided to go to school together at the University of Massachusetts. Believes in christianity blindly, which is her main excuse for not leaving her husband. went to school for linguistics, I believe she did not finish school to give birth to my sister, now she does real estate, and she hates it. on her free time she likes to drink my beer(just half a small cup and I end up drinking the rest, even if I didn't feel like drinking) and being the victim of everything.

Sister: Born in korea, left there to be raise by our grandma for two years, parents took her back to live in Chicago, then they all moved to California. She's an aspiring musician/urban planner. Intelligent and creative, but has an addictive personality, short temper, and a hoarding problem(still 10000x a better parent then my mom and dad combined). Currently an intern for a city and a waitress at a sushi joint. Lives at home. May have been physically abused by my dad as a toddler. Recently was choked out by dad and he bashed her head against my bass guitar.

chyell: Me, Awesome, majestic even while pooping... family scapegoat. Suffered with anxiety since I was a little girl, I often was yelled at for getting nauseated in busy malls and in the car. Also yelled at for being socially awkward around strangers. Recently diagnosed with major depression, also recently married(not related to the last fact). I currently work in IT for a large school district. I called 911 on my dad last year because he chased me upstairs and try to break into my room to attack me. I have also been avoiding my family since I moved out of the house.

The situation:
Apparently last night, my Dad called 911 because he thought he was having a stroke, this is probably our millionth time calling 911, with the addition of my last 911 call, I guess a case worker decided to get involved. They deemed my dad to be too violent to be under my mom's care and also decided she is a victim of mental abuse. They took him away and told her she can't see him or even say goodbye. 

My sister reached out to me to be supportive of my mom, despite my sudden efforts to cut the umbilical cord. I completely agree with her. I've known that my mom was a victim of my dad's rage forever. I don't care for her much as a person but I can't turn my back on someone in my life that's been traumatized for over 40 years, especially since I witnessed half of it. 

I'd like to ask this community, how do you go about helping someone who has been so hurt for so long. Someone who truly believes that she could never leave her husband's side, even if he murdered one of her children. How do I get her to understand that she is a victim of him and not a christian vessel who has to roll with all the punches that god throws at her. How do I get her to understand that moving on with her life is not a sin? I don't expect her to change over night, but I don't want her to waste the rest of her life blaming herself for something she shouldn't be.

**TL;DR State wants to put my ""Crippled"" Ndad under special care, with no visitation allowed from mom for being too aggressive and mentally abusive. Emom has stockholm syndrome and won't stop crying. what do?**

My boyfriend and I have been in a LDR for an entire year now! We plan to close the distance after I graduate from college in December, so we're officially halfway through. Throughout the relationship, he has never been more than 2 hours ahead of or behind me, but that's going to change soon.

This summer, I will have an internship in his town (yay!!) but I just found out he has to go to London for work for about a month. The exact dates aren't known for sure, but he will likely leave about 2 weeks after I arrive. I'll be there for 11-12 weeks, but he will be gone for 4-5.

I don't know very many people in the town (my mom has a friend who lives there and I've met a couple of his friends once or twice) and that only makes me more nervous about how this will pan out. 

There will now be a 7 hour time difference, so no more falling asleep together over Skype. I will be extremely lonely, and while he may be too, he will be kept busy about 12 hours per day with work. I am so, so proud of and excited for him because it's a great opportunity for potential future advancement in his job. I want to be 100% happy for him, but I can't help but be a little selfish and bitter about it.

I mostly needed to rant, so thank you for reading/listening. Also, any advice is appreciated!!"
2s8ws8,5,2015-01-12,HELP! advice for snagging entry level accounting positions,aaandnope,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2s8ws8/help_advice_for_snagging_entry_level_accounting/,"accountants! if you have a few minutes to read a scenario and give a fellow accountant a little advice for a friend, it would be very much appreciated.

note: this isn't for me, it's for a very close friend of mine that i'm watching struggle to find any kind of accounting job.

background:
-located in Los angeles (if that's relevant)
-he graduated in summer 2013 (so been out of school for about a year and a half) from a good university with a solid accounting program. accomplished a decent 3.0ish GPA. was also a member of a professional business fraternity.
-has since been working at Target and studying for the CPA
-has recently passed all 4 parts of the CPA
-no internship, no accounting work experience

he is feeling lost and out of options on where to look for accounting positions. it seems most mid-size/large accounting firms hire entry level positions directly from the university and now that he's graduated and been out of school for quite awhile, he has lost this convenient means of applying and interviewing. it seems his applications and inquiries to HR are getting ignored. he's been applying to jobs posted on sites like monster, indeed, simplyhired, and even craigslist but it seems even positions titled ""entry level"" require 1-3 years of experience that he doesn't have. he's even been trying atypical accounting positions like AR/AP. but as i said, any positions he has applied for have gone unanswered.

he's a capable individual and his people skills are better than how he appears on paper but the first step is even getting an opportunity to get into the office. he's passed the exam, that has to count for something.

ANY advice would be fantastic. tips on how to better market himself, places to look that he may not have thought of, anyone with an ""in"" to an accounting firm -nudge nudge- (just kidding!)"

The Copier Room: 
And then there's that young new college intern, Josh.  You know he's been checking you out; every time you walk by his little workstation, you can feel his eyes glued to your high heels, and traveling up your stocking-clad legs to your toned ass...  You've looked back a couple times and caught him, but the cheeky bastard just gave you a smart-ass smile before turning back to his work.  At first it was infuriating, but recently his youthful appreciation has become ... invigorating.  He might be young, but he's not exactly bad looking: Standing just under 6', with a mop of dark hair and warm brown eyes, he filled out his polos and chinos nicely, and you think you've heard something about him being on the soccer team for his university...

Well it's getting late on a Friday night, and you've just heard Josh's supervisor give him a task in the large closet that serves as a copier room, sorting through a bunch of old files and getting things ready for the following week..  Everyone else seems to be fleeing to home, dinner or a bar, leaving the two of you the only ones in the place.  Perhaps it's time to get to know Josh a little better?

2s96mi,9,2015-01-13,"Me [19F] with my boyfriend [21M] 1.5 years, is he being selfish or am I being sensitive?",selfishboyfriend123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2s96mi/me_19f_with_my_boyfriend_21m_15_years_is_he_being/,"Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my username.

**Background** : My boyfriend and I met while we were both in community college far from our hometowns. He is my first super serious boyfriend whereas he has had a couple serious relationships. When we met we lived a mile apart and hung around with basically the same type of people and really there were no issues in our relationship. His mom supported him and he had more than enough money, I worked and have always supported myself. At the end of last year it was time for him to transfer he choose a school an hour from his hometown so he could commute. His hometown is conveniently 30 minutes from my hometown. I choose to move home at the end of the year also but I am still going to community college. 


**Past Issues** : When I moved home I worked full time over the summer at minimum wage plus tips. I ended up making a good amount of money because I live at home now and I have barely any bills. He on the other hand refused to get a minimum wage job because ""it was not even worth his time"". I pointed out to him many times how much money I was making and he just kind of snubbed it out. His mom stopped giving him as much money once he moved home since he no longer had as many bills and she could now buy food for him. This drastically changed his lifestyle, he has always gone to private school so he is used to having rich friends always doing activities and spending money that has no worth to them. When his mom cut him off he could no longer do these things and that meant if I wanted to do anything I had to pay for the both of us. I didn't mind over the summer because I thought he was looking for an internship, but months past and he still didn't have any money. He also didn't have a car which meant I was driving the 30 minutes to an hour with traffic to see him on my days off. Finally I snapped I told him he needs to get a job I am sick of paying for everything and that he needs to get on a bus that goes over the hill to see me. After I snapped he got a job 3 days a week 4 hours each that pays $11.50 and started tutoring 3 people a couple times a week at $25.00 a hour. He also started taking the bus which costs 5 dollars to come over to my house every once in a while. Things were looking up for a little bit.


**Current Issues** : My boyfriend seems to think that if he does one nice thing for me if I ask him to he can think only of himself the rest of the time. I feel like we have had at least 5 conversations how I am tried of feeling like he only thinks of himself. He told me the last time we had the conversation ""It's hard for me to put in my full effort when I feel so pathetic, I live at home, I don't have a car and I am not happy about where I am, I will really try to do better."" Then he cried about never wanting to lose me. I thought that would be a turning point but I am afraid it only has gotten worse. My boyfriend has a pretty bad memory, before christmas we were talking about what we wanted for christmas. We came to the conclusion that we both want a bunch of little things preferably cheap and or homemade so we had a lot of things to open since my parents don't buy me anything and I know he likes gifts. I love giving gifts and I kind of went overboard I bought him around 8 things to open including a comforter and some nice pillows. I gave these things to him on christmas eve, he told me ""your gift isn't ready i'll give it to you on new years"". The next week built my anticipation up I got to excited he made me something then when it came to handing me the bag my heart kind of sunk it was small and it contained: a pint of ben and jerrys icecream (which he knows I don't like since I mainly eat organic), a couple candy bars, and a plastic thing you put tea in (I also don't drink loose leaf tea since it is expensive). I have been trying to tell myself that gifts don't matter they are just materialistic but crap I can't get over it. He had a whole week after I gave him my gift to make his not suck. The kicker is when he gave it to me he cried saying ""my gift sucks i'm so ashamed I don't even want you to open it"". I don't know what to do I am so at a loss. I am a strong believer in hard work and I feel his work ethic sucks. He would rather play minecraft than go surfing like we used to. I live in a beautiful ocean town and he lives in the valley, he used to love spending time where I live playing in the ocean and hiking. Now all he wants to do is stay inside and play games. When we lived away at community college not near our hometowns we did so many activities and I liked all his friends. Now that he is home he only hangs out with his private school high school friends who never attempted higher education are 22 and still get allowances. His best friends is a pretentious male model who is a grade a asshole they also live on the same street and spend most of their time together. I am afraid my boyfriend is becoming like him and I can't no matter how hard I try like his best friend. My boyfriend got a gift certificate to a burrito place for christmas from his mom for $50. I was driving him home today and since I was driving him home (which is over a mountain) I asked if he could buy me lunch with his gift certificate and he said ""i'm not hungry"". I was so livid, I was driving him home then driving straight back to my home so it ended up being 1:30 of me driving and he wouldn't get me lunch since he wasn't hungry and he didn't give me gas money. When we were about to get off at his exit he said ""I can get you lunch if you really want"" and I just said no. I left without kissing him and I am now seriously questioning our relationship. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend seems to be inept to how his actions affect me. Despite me trying to use my best communication he says he will try harder but never does. I hate his best friend who is a male model and I fear my boyfriend is becoming more and more like him since he has moved back home. "

2sa1g6,11,2015-01-13,"Me [31 M] and [20 F] bonded, then she turned 180. What was her reason?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sa1g6/me_31_m_and_20_f_bonded_then_she_turned_180_what/,"I’ve always wanted a little sister. It happened when I worked with a new intern at work. Eventually we bonded and did things like any other siblings would do (watch movies, go to the mall, and eat out). She also hanged out with my wife, they did/talked a lot of girl stuff, and she even invited us to her house a couple of times and we met her parents. Wife and I hanged out with her siblings too.

Months later she went to attend an event and met a lot of people a bit older than her (21-25) and similar background. When she came back, she instantly got attached to them, hung out and talked with them constantly. She even strongly rebelled against her parents just to hang out with them 1 more minute. She started ditching me too.

Just when her internship was about to end, her behavior changed. She started becoming grumpy towards me, giving excuses, and downright ignored my messages. She even ignored my wife and me when we drove to her place to surprise her for her birthday (which I told her I would do a while back, yet she scolded me for not telling her in advance).  Didn’t even mention, ever, the gifts we sent her.

Now that she’s back at work, she’s been ignoring me completely, as if we never knew each other. I had to talk to her for work purposes… she treated me with utmost disrespect and looks at me with hate and disgust and acts rather condescending like I'm not ""good enough""? Strange. She seems to draw certain “fun” when casual “bad” things happen to me. Anyway...

So why the 180 degree turn? My theories involve:

1) She was lonely at the time and needed someone to talk to. Then she met her new friends, so she replaced me with them, losing total interest in me and considering me dead weight. I was just a “rebound” object for a while. She missed her friends a lot when started working here.

2) Or she was overwhelmed by all her problems (parents/friends/school) and I just added up to them. She needed to drop something and she dropped me thinking “who is this guy to me anyway?” I had a hard time approving of her new friends (not the old ones, they were good friends for her) because from my point of view, they were careless hooligans that could turn her into an irresponsible cold-hearted woman. I don’t think she knew what she was getting into. I’m disappointed she didn’t let me know rather than drag me around for months!

3) Or maybe she didn’t know what she was getting into with me and didn’t expect this relationship to become this serious and just wasn’t ready for it. I asked my mother for a little sister when I was only 12 years old, so having a little sister is relatively a big deal to me, so I may have overwhelmed her too.

4) Or maybe she just used me to do work for her, boost her ego, etc. and now is attaching herself to our team lead because she figured he’s the guy she needs to butter up to (which is correct if she wants a good report card). Kids her age only want one thing in school: a high grade, and would do anything for it.

5) She trusts hew new friends greatly. I feel she clings to them and would do anything to stay in that group. They may have put a stereotype in her head that I wanted something “else” from this relationship (i.e. sexual). That is not the case. I doubt her friends really care about her, or are more traditional and gave in to stereotypes.

6) A combination of the above.

So what do you think? Or is it something else I missed? Did I do something wrong?

I would just like to understand what happened. I know she’s the best person to talk to, but given her evasive attitude, she will not open up to me and will not step out of the office to talk about this maturely, and I am “respecting” whatever she’s doing by keeping my distance. I am however uncomfortable with the way she treats me. I don’t like being the same room as her, I feel sick and disgusting when she’s around.

I understand this relationship is over, and I am not interested in restarting it in any way. Try not to put me in a stereotype; this was a serious and genuine relationship.

Thank you.

2safar,91,2015-01-13,Doing the Time Warp (bj from goth girl),[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2safar/doing_the_time_warp_bj_from_goth_girl/,"""It's astounding, time is fleeting,
Madness, takes it's toll... ""


T. was my former best friend's girlfriend/eventually wife; but the were divorced and there were no feelings. At least that is what she told me. I wasn't too concerned what my former friend thought, we had a falling out and weren't on speaking terms. Again, morality police can stop here, as is the case with every good story that comes from me it seems. You could say our falling out was because I'm an asshole, and you would be right; but my girlfriend and his ex girlfriend were as much to blame as I was. It started so innocent, just heading over to Rae's friend's house because she wasn't feeling good and wanted help forgetting about the relationship she just got out of. It started with just innocent hanging out in her room, proceeded to a game of spin the bottle, but ended with nothing more than a plan for something that we all wanted to happen. That night changed my relationship with my best friend, and my girlfriend as well, in ways that never quite healed, but that is another story. I started out (and finished, to be honest) not knowing T. very well, but I thought she was pretty cool. She had a fun, if not heavily political and opinionated at times, attitude. The signs were always there that she liked me, but was also in love with her boyfriend and would never make a move. What I noticed first about her, and what fueled my lust for her, was her appearance. She was probably 5'4"", 140 lbs, and fit every definition of the word goth you could think of. She had black hair with multiple colors mixed in throughout, tattoos, piercings, and always seemed to be wearing heels. I don't know if it is something to be proud of, but she had the marks of prior self mutilation, and wore them with pride.

Like all good stories I have, this one started with an unexpected text on my Razr. Man, that phone would tell some stories if it could talk. It's like the phone made up texts from random people and forged a new and unexpected reality around the 160 characters it decided to display. Like every other good story that took place over this glorious summer of hookups and lust, I was again playing CounterStrike when this one began. I will forever maintain I went into each of these stories trying to maintain an sense of innocence, but it never worked out that way due to things outside of my control. I knew she liked me, but I really believed her text that said she just wanted someone to hang out with. I fought to find her house, as I had never actually driven there or been there in the daylight. What I found was an open gate and long gravel driveway that wound through the woods. After what felt like a mile of twists and turns, I arrived in front of the house. Thinking back, the house in the Twilight movies reminds me a lot of T's parents house. Very big, set in the woods, and very open and airy feeling because of way too many full height windows. Great, another rich girl. I'm not rich, but expect to be just as soon as my internship finishes transitioning into a full time job. Any day now, they keep promising me. For now, my choice is hang out here or at my mom's house. Coming in and meeting T's parents for the first time was uneventful, as meeting parents always seems to be for me. They always seem to be all over the fact that the guy their daughter brought home is in school full time, making decent money at a tech internship, and expects a real job from it in the coming months. I can hear their thoughts now, ""maybe he will be the one to straighten her out!"" 

My mind is a little unsure about T. She is wearing a flat-grey/black colored slip dress type of thing, but to be honest it is not very flattering to me. I guess I don't really care, we're just hanging out anyways. She's trying to be comfy around her house, she is getting over a breakup and I'm here to comfort her. Still, the thought crosses my mind. Did I only find her so attractive before because she was taken? Where is the banging hot girl I remember? We go to her room to watch a movie.

She holds up a copy of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" I've heard of it, only indirectly because of my circle of friends all seem to have some obsession with it. I have some plans to see it at some sort of event with another female friend in a few months. The friend told me that the event will probably turn into some huge sex party, so don't be surprised. Sounds like a good time. I guess now would be a good time to see what the movie is all about before the party. As much as I wanted to remain a ""Rocky Horror virgin"" for the party, I recognize that there is a chance that I will be dating T., and therefore not going to random sex parties with female friends. I make myself at home on the bed, slightly propped up so that I can see the 12"" TV that is on a stand at the foot of the bed. T. starts the movie and lays down on the bed next to me. She cuddles up next to me right away, so I put my arm around her. Not even five minutes into the movie, she starts running her hand up and down my side, working her way under my shirt and touching my bare skin. ""This movie makes me horny,"" she says. Damn, it's the first time I've ever actually hung out with her and she knows me well. I bet Rae filled her in on a lot of stuff when they were friends. I respond by going in for a kiss, which she passionately returns.

Before we can really get into making out, she stops me. She stands up and slips off the hideous dress thing. There she is. There was the sexy, tattoo covered girl I was hoping for when I showed up. Naked in front of me. ""I like my boobs played with,"" she said. I could only oblige, I took her left boob in my right hand as she laid back down next to me. We proceeded to passionately make out.  T. was the first girl to ask me to play with her boobs, so I was unsure what to actually do. I just kind of went between squeezing it, grabbing her nipple and giving little tugs and pinches, and just rubbing. I had the excuse of being distracted by making out if she asked what I was doing. We continued this for a really long time, with the sustained passion that you can only find in a new relationship.

""I have something else to tell you,"" she threw in there suddenly. The making out stopped instantly. This is where she drops a bomb. After a brief pause, she finished her thought. ""I really like giving blowjobs. I don't tell people very often, because then that will be all that guys want me for."" I couldn't come up with a good response, all I could say was ""I'm not like that.""

With that, we started the shuffle to pull my pants down and get her into position. I went back to sitting up, my back against the headboard of the bed, and she took her position kneeling on all fours by my side with her head near my cock. She started by brushing her fingers lightly over my cock, a fine first introduction between her body and mine. I watched her as she quickly made her way closer to my cock with her mouth. No hesitations or second thoughts in her mind, just one goal. She gave the entire length a quick lick, and then took the entire thing into her mouth. Straight down to the base in one swoop, there was no cock, only T's head. She forced her face into my mound, and I could feel my tip touching the back of her throat. She brought her head all the way back up until just my tip was in her mouth and repeated these strokes a few times. Full strokes, top to bottom, using just her mouth. She then grabbed my cock with her right hand and stroked me while continuing to pleasure me with her mouth. I can't even describe what she was doing with her tongue, just that it was the best blowjob I have ever received. I was barely able to squeak out the all-important question ""Do you want me to tell you when I'm going to cum?"" Her reply, squeezed in between strokes of her mouth on my cock, was ""No, (gulp) I'll figure (gulp) it out, (gulp) just relax.""

Wow, that was hot. She didn't even want to stop to answer the question. Her amazing skills at work, it took less than two minutes for me to reach climax. It was a climax like no other I'd had before. The tips of my fingers and both of my legs felt tingly like the had fallen asleep after being sat on or something. It was like there wasn't enough blood in my body to fuel my cock and my other extremities at the same time. I started shaking, almost convulsing under her. I thought for sure I would gag her with the sudden movements, but she kept pressing on. I finally felt myself erupt in her mouth. Still no sign of slowing from her. I could feel her swallow after every spurt, sucking and swallowing it down as fast as it came out. I knew what a drinking straw felt like. Her mouth now felt slimy from the cum that stuck inside of it, and she kept moving her head. She gradually slowed down her strokes, and I was unable to move. My entire body tingled and I was 100% spent. All I could do was lay there. I have a vague memory of her saying something like ""next time you should grab my head and make me do what you want,"" as I fell asleep.

Even better, though, is that she actually did like giving them as much as she said. Every time we got in my car, there was another blowjob while I drove wherever we were going. When we got to the destination, if there was any waiting for anything, her mouth was on my cock while we waited. I received no less than 50 bjs over the next 3 weeks, with her swallowing every load. I really think I lost my sensitivity to bjs during these weeks, or it was just overuse, because it got harder and harder to cum from what she was doing. This came to a point one day when giving her a ride to school.

The ride was maybe 3 miles, across some country roads and then just a little bit into town to get to the campus. In typical fashion, my dick was in her mouth as soon as we made the first corner of her winding driveway. For the only time ever, I tried to turn down a blowjob. ""I just don't think there's enough time,"" I pleaded. It was an awesome position to be in, knowing that I could just turn it down because there would be another one later. She took that as a challenge. ""Push my head, fuck my mouth, do what you need to do to cum in time."" As if those orders weren't hot enough to drive anyone insane. After we got out of the twisty driveway and onto the long and straight country roads, I followed her orders. I grabbed the back of her head, getting a handful of hair as well, and forced her down while thrusting up. I could feel my tip hitting the back of her throat with every thrust. Normally, I am sensitive and afraid of hurting a girl, but her moans told me she was loving every second of it. It still took most of the ride to get close, but I did. I was about to finish, so I pushed her head down as far as I could and came straight down her throat. To my surprise, there was no gagging or anything. Just, again, the feeling of being a drinking straw giving her the drink she craves.

I have yet to get a bj from another girl with the same skill level. Those feelings set the bar for my dreams until this day."

2sb5p0,5,2015-01-13,UCAS application deadline in 2 days. Planning to take a gap year. Need advice.,arcisal,malaysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/2sb5p0/ucas_application_deadline_in_2_days_planning_to/,"Hi.

I'm an A-Levels student and I've been procrastinating on my applications to university for a long time now. So much so that the deadline for UCAS applications is this coming Friday.

The reason for the delay is because of my indecisiveness. I'm considering taking a gap year as I am one year younger than most of my classmates (they're 19, I'm 18). I'm already on my final semester for A-Levels and if I decide to follow through with the application, I will be studying in the UK at the ripe age of 18.

I think that's a bit too rushed as the course I plan to apply to (Economics &amp; Politics) is only 3 years. I feel like being a year younger than everyone has given be the privilege to take a gap year without too much repercussions rather than a chance to end my studies earlier.

The problem is I have no idea what I would do to make this gap year worthwhile. To add to that, my parents are pretty conservative and like most Malaysian parents, the term ""gap year"" is synonymous to ""lazy"".

I'm thinking of taking up an internship and travelling, but one can only do those things for so long. Not to mention the question of where. My family isn't particularly rich either so I want to be able to at least become partially financially independent rather than leech of the hard-work of my parents.

I've also heard that taking a gap year may look unwholesome on my CV/resume/application. Honestly, I only think it looks bad if you take it without being able to have things to talk about during the gap year. In other words, you've wasted a year of your time and money.

Are there any more things I could do during a gap year? I'm a banana so I definitely intend to learn Chinese (or Mandarin). I might take up some form of Computer Science or Programming as I'm interested in taking a CS degree alongside my Economics degree.

Please help. 2 days left."

2sb74n,36,2015-01-13,Me [31 M] concerned about my friend [29 M] cheating on his wife [21 F],throwybecause,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sb74n/me_31_m_concerned_about_my_friend_29_m_cheating/,"About me:  I'm happily married, and we are very very close friends with this couple in question.  The 4 of us hang out all the time, and the two wives always do girly things together.

David is beginning to cheat on his wife, Brittany.  I've known David for many years, and he has always had many flings of short term relationships, engaged 4 times, one with a child that he signed his parental rights away.  It always starts with him creating secret accounts on several dating sites.  Then it evolves to txting and emailing and facebooking and video chatting these random girls.  Then it moves on to playing girly video games with these girls.  Then it moves on to random secret meetings.  And gets worse from there as things like money begin to go missing due to this secret 'hobby' of his..  And he always spends lots of money on women.

This time, he chose to marry Brittany and very quickly.  It is not even 4 months into their wedding life when I found out that Brittany broke down in front of my wife one day, when she found out that David was spending a lot of 'intimate' time with this hot new intern at his work.  He maintains that nothing is happening, but their sex life has dropped to 0, and Brittany's sex drive is through the roof.  She had no solid proof of him cheating, but Brittany suspected something was up.

Before this intern incident, he was always getting txts from random numbers and when asked about it, he would always say it was a coworker or to help a friend from down south with a computer problem.  He would even disappear in the middle of a gathering for an hour to jump onto his computer.  One time I checked up on him, he's chatting up with a girl on facebook and bragging about her pictures.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

Here is the catch:  Brittany and I would do things together that on the surface would seem questionable, which has led to David accusing Brittany of cheating with me at one point.  This is flat out not true.  A lot of times Brittany is the 3rd wheel whenever my wife and I do things, but on a few rare occasions just Brittany and I would hand out.  Of course my wife knows everything, such as Brittany and I would go swimming or the gym together, just the two of us.  Or we would go and grab macdonalds at night after running an errand just because we both had cravings.  Again, just the two of us.  Or that I would help her around her house doing handyman things.  Again, just her and me.  Nothing happens as we are just close friends, and I'm the only stable male figure in her life.  It doesn't help that Brittany is absolutely stunning and David is the jealous and insecure type.

**question**: Now that Brittany directly involved us in her issue, how do I go about addressing this as David's friend?  David already threw me under the bus by indirectly falsely accusing me of cheating, but never had the guts to ask me in person.  Have you been in my shoes before, and what was the outcome?

---   
**tl;dr**: My friend is beginning follow the same pattern he always does, when he is bored with his existing ""arm-candy"", and is beginning to cheat behind her back...  Both him and his wife are very good friends of mine.  What do I do?  Have you been in my shoes before, and what was the outcome?"

Last semester, I took a class on Chaucer and had a very popular professor. Let's call him M. M is really charming, funny, and attractive. I'm an English major, and I often go to professors for help with my papers, and since this was a writing intensive class I saw M often for office hours. Soon he got to know me really well. We developed a great relationship, which I thought was the relationship between a mentor and mentee, as I wish to get my PhD in British Literature eventually. He made it seem like he valued my opinions, flattered my intelligence, and would try to make me laugh. Eventually, he'd invite me to his office hours after class (as they were right after class) and we'd just talk about books and movies. I have to admit I had a crush on him. But I'd never act on it, as I have a boyfriend whom I love and am very attracted to as well, and besides, every girl in the English department has a crush on him, it seemed like a normal reaction to someone like him. I realize now that going to his office hours just to chat was probably a bad idea.

&amp;nbsp; 

Things started getting dicey near the end of the semester. My hometown is near a big city, and I applied for an internship with a publishing house that would be in the summer but was so competitive the due date for applications was in January. I asked M to write me a letter of recommendation, and he said he'd be glad to. I also asked him if he could critique my writing sample (something I'd written prior to being in M's class). He said yes. When I went to his office hours to do that, he told me he was falling asleep standing up and that he wanted coffee; could he critique the paper in Starbucks? I said sure. The first warning sign was that he paid for my drink, which made me uneasy. Then we sat down and he helped me with my paper. But after he was done he began saying that I was such an amazing young lady and that he wished his girlfriend was like me and made jokes about us being like May and January from The Canterbury Tales (literature nerd moment: it's a story about an elderly knight marrying a beautiful young woman, and it's mostly about them having sex). He complimented my hair and eyes, and even touched my leg ""accidentally"" (it was a prolonged stroke on my thigh so accidentally my ass). After this I stammered out a ""thank you"" and got the hell out of there. I put my final paper in his mailbox instead of dropping it off in his office, and when the next day he emailed me saying he missed me and that he wanted to take me out for Chinese to celebrate the A+ I got in his class, I politely declined. I went to Christmas break and told myself I'd just never take his classes again. But I got back and ran into him yesterday in the English Department when going to meet my advisor, and he told me that I was beautiful during the course of our awkward small talk. Again, I peaced out as quickly as I could, but this morning I woke up to a friend request from him on Facebook. My profile is über private so I have no idea how he found it. Now I'm here for help. 

&amp;nbsp; 

I just want M to leave me alone. Obviously, I can't change the past, and I realize that I probably encouraged him, but I never thought he'd be this unprofessional. But, I'm scared to directly confront him because, like I said, our school is tiny, and I'm worried he could spread it around the English Department in retaliation and ruin my chances there by either telling them some distorted half-truth about whatever our relationship was, or just saying I have bad qualities. I'm also a rape survivor (it was a long time ago and I've worked through it for the most part with therapists) and his aggressiveness is making me really anxious. I'm afraid to report it to the school because I'm not exactly innocent here, and they could penalize me, too; I also don't want to ruin his life by getting him fired, even though he's a total sleaze. Also, I'm worried that I didn't legitimately earn my A+, and that makes me feel gross and cheap. But that's besides the point.

2sbh3r,3,2015-01-13,When I'm leaving,treesyeahman,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2sbh3r/when_im_leaving/,"EDIT: fuck, that's supposed to be ""Why"" not ""When""

I understand I may not get a hugely positive response for this, but I feel I should post it anyway.

I don't mean leaving permanently, or taking a break. I mean I'm saving smoking for special occasions like concerts or parties. Granted, I've never posted much to this sub, but I browse pretty frequently.

I've never smoked that much, maybe like once every week during breaks and once a month or so during the semesters. It's never negatively impacted me; I've held a 4.0 for three semesters studying CS at pretty good university, I've got a sweet internship lined up for the summer, and generally enjoy life.

I'm leaving because I'm getting bored with smoking. When I started smoking about three years ago, everything was new, unexplored, and mystical. Now it's just more of the same. Music used to captivate me while stoned, but now I know what it feels like while stoned; I understand how my perception is altered and now its boring to me. Same with video games (although I've never played video games that heavily anyway) - It's just no longer more fun stoned. Weed was fun because I could explore new ways of experiencing things. Now that world of experiences has been mapped; there's no where on the stoned globe that hasn't been charted.

Another reason why I'm leaving is because being stoned prevents me from doing other things. I'm not saying smoking does in general, just while I'm stoned I can't focus. I can't (and wont) drive while stoned. I can't program while stoned. I can't design circuits while stoned. I can't create things, which is what I really enjoy doing. I've run out of things to do while stoned. Even when I'm bored, being stoned doesn't help, I'm just bored AND stoned then.

My final reason I'm leaving is ""stoner culture"". It's just not my thing. I've always felt it's fine to be a XXX guy who smokes, but I've noticed a lot of my peers tend to be smoking guys who do XXX. The ""stoner culture"" tends to promote this. For example, one of my friends realized his life was kinda shitty - working minimum wage to barely pay for a cheap apartment with two roommates and not working on things he loved, like music or woodworking. He wanted to make some changes like stopping smoking, but most of his friends gave him shit for that. This kind of shit is what makes me hate ""stoner culture"". It tends to celebrate irresponsible behavior (like driving high, or smoking at much too young an age imho). 

I plan to continue to occasionally try other drugs like shrooms and LSD (I've done both before) as they still offer a world that isn't explored. I plan to shy away from anything more serious that that though, for safety's sake.

Well that's it.
Goodbye, and toke on if you want.

Peace"

2sbpfi,13,2015-01-13,True Blue Colors,ironhandsilverback,Chargers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/2sbpfi/true_blue_colors/,"This is a true story.

True Blue Colors
          By John P. Thomas

               Sometimes a story needs to be told. When someone in a large organization stands up to do something right it says a great deal about them and their organization. This statement is being said about Mr. Dean Spanos and the San Diego Chargers.
               My wife Terri and I know a lady named Labonnie Taylor. In 2014 she was informed that her battle with cancer had taken a turn for the worse. She was told it was terminal. In November she went on disability from her job at 32nd Street Naval Base. She was determined to fight as long as she could. I met her through my wife and the first thing you notice about Labonnie is her smile. She is a warm hearted individual with one of the most positive outlooks I’ve ever seen. No one who has ever met her will forget her. She’s like that warm cup of coffee, warm and good. She has a lot of passion for life. One of her passions is the San Diego Chargers. Win, lose, or draw she is behind them 100%. As she has been heard to say “ Those are my Boys”
               On November 25, 2014 the Chargers held their annual blood drive. This is not only an opportunity to donate blood for a worthy cause, it is also a chance to meet and greet the players. A shirt is given to those who donate and the players come throughout the event as well as the cheerleaders to sign the shirt. This event brings a lot of people out and the players and the cheerleaders graciously donate their time.
               I regularly donate blood to the San Diego Blood Bank and they are the organizers of the above event. I have been going to the Chargers Blood Drive for over 10 years. My shirts have been given to friends and family alike. This time the shirt was dedicated to LaBonnie. After I went through the line and got five signatures from the players there, I spoke with one of the Chargers community representatives. I explained why I was trying to get the whole teams signatures on the shirt and who it was for. He sent me to an intern who took my information and telling me that an autograph session was set for December 6. I thanked her and went on my way.
               On December 8th I went to the Chargers offices. I spoke to the receptionist and told her the reason for my visit. She got in touch with community services and was told that one more signature was needed and would be gotten that Saturday. I was also told that the shirt would be mailed to my residence. I thanked her and went home.
               I waited and on the 23rd of December went back to the Chargers office to inquire about the shirt. A short time later a community representative came out and handed me the shirt. The problem was that there were no additional signatures. I did not feel this was right. So I wrote a letter to Mr. Spanos and sent it registered mail. I mailed it on the 26th of December.
             That Tuesday following I was contacted by phone by a Mr. Chase Hartman. He informed me that Mr. Spanos had seen the letter and as he put it wanted to make things right. I was asked by Mr. Hartman who Labonnies favorite player was. She had told me it was the quarterback Mr. Philip Rivers. Mr. Hartman then assured me that a signed football, and other memorabilia, would be mailed to my residence to give to Labonnie. Mr. Hartman and his staff did not disappoint. On the 6th and 7th of January the items promised were delivered.
              Football is a hard game and it takes tough men to play it. This same toughness is necessary for the owners and staff as well. Everyone on the team knows that all must work together to have a winning season. Other attributes as well are also necessary. Like integrity and compassion. I would say that Mr. Spanos and his staff have both. At times thank you does not seem enough for those who went beyond to make one person happy. To Mr. Spanos, Mr. Hartman, Mr. Rivers and all who made this happen a heartfelt thank you is all I can give you now. That and my promise to support your blood drive as long as I am able.
              Ms. Taylor will be back on Naval Station on the 27th of January. She is to receive awards for her service to the Navy. It will be at this time that she will also be presented with the football and the other gifts so graciously given to her by the Chargers organization. Again as Ms. Taylor says “ Those are my boys.”

One things that is bothering the hell out of me is my constant diarrhea. I haven't shit right since I quit. I know I'm eating right and healthily. I was worried that I wouldn't have any appetite because when I was using I'd have to smoke to get hungry. My appetite went back to normal after a day or two though. I can't say the same for my poops though. It's so bad that I'm afraid to fart. I constantly feel a rumble in my stomach and sometimes when I sit on the toilet it's only gas. Once again, I don't think it's my diet. I would have been able to pinpoint that.

They didn't have good spare mouses and was on order. I had one that worked pretty good.

I hinted her kindly if I could have my mouse back since I use photoshop 100% of the time while her job was data entry and talking to clients mostly. She said no. I am an intern, so she thought she can screw me over. Fine, bitch. 

What she didn't know (and I found out at the time) was the apple mouse will be always connected to her MAC, and does not work properly on other macs unless it's was her MAC (ANOTHER GOOD reason I told her, since I couldn't use it). 

So, when she uses her MAC I move my apple mouse a lot, and it makes trouble for her. She thought her mouse was moving by itself. She later found out it was the mouse I was using. I acted innocent, she brought it.

But that's not the end of it. When the new mouses arrived..I hid the old apple mouse and moved it at times so she couldn't properly click or move her mouse.

I am moving completely across the country to live nearish the Los Angeles area. I worked a shitty job to save up money to keep me from being homeless until I find a job out there. My first mission is to get a paying entry level job that has something to do with tv, film, media, entertainment, etc. so anything from an assistant to a production assistant (I know that's not real) to well anything would do.  I need advice for that as well, but also opinions on...

* where's the best place to live that costs $800 a month or ""less"" with roomates so that would be a personal amount or if I can find a place that cheap? **also like it to be safe and close enough to other things**
* what's the best way to travel? Should I plan on taking the bus, get an inexpensive car, or buy a bike? **i know this may depend on where I work**
* how can I find a job that I may actually enjoy as a first step into what I love?
* how do I make friends? **not as important but still nice to have.
* when is the best time to move? **for jobs, apartments, internships, etc.**

I have some friends out there already and don't want to solely rely on them for help because they all have their own stuff going on and they're not very close friends but will probably end up that way. Obviously I don't have a full proof plan but I'm doing this to work on one. 

Thank you!

to be as vague as possible, I recently started working in a company as an intern and in the time I have been here I  didn't feel any particular way about the work but have enjoyed the environment so it was bearable. 

among all the workers is the Boss' daughter. She works among us and is pretty much treated the same as any other employee, the only difference is obviously that she is the daughter of the boss. At first, I just thought she was a moderately attractive woman but never really spoke to her seeing as how we worked in different departments. Eventually I started speaking to her casually and ended up hitting it off. We occasionally had small conversations and eventually I started going out of my way to have some time with her. Unfortunately, I let myself get closer than I wanted to her. 

Up to this point, things have always been platonic, especially knowing that she was pretty much off limits due to her already being taken and the obvious fact that she is the boss' daughter. I still couldn't really stop myself from getting to know her better and getting to know her better on a personal level. 


after some time I was told that I was being promoted to a different position. The position I have been assigned to now placed me in the same office as her and now we see and speak to each other on a daily basis. Now I know that with my experience I would be able to get this same position for a higher salary almost anywhere else. and that's where my predicament comes in. I'm into the Boss' daughter and being close to her on a daily basis is not helping me at all. I'm having issues making the seemingly obvious move of changing into the same position at a different company. As for her feelings about me, I doubt there's anything too serious since she has a boyfriend. but the slight delusion of a chance with her is keeping me at the company without questioning much of anything. I can't believe I'm doing this to myself while seeing the issues that it can cause. This sucks.

I'm 19F in college at a state uni, and he's 19M going to one of the best colleges in the country. Our families are friends from a while ago, but we never really saw/talked to each other much growing up. Both our families are conservative, and heavily discourage dating/relationships due to cultural beliefs.

I went a bit rogue and rebelled quite a bit growing up, dabbling with a (secret) relationship in my 2nd year of college, whereas he was very socially awkward and was never really interested in relationships. I never went past making out (one time) in my relationship, because I still have trouble letting go of some of the conservative values concerning dating that I was brought up with. Other than that, I've formed a lot of liberal new opinions in college away from my parents, and it's an amazing thing for me.

When we entered college, we ended up being in contact more often, even though we are going to universities that are really far apart. I ended up being on his college campus for a few days for a program, and reached out to see if he'd like to meet up, which he did. That was the point when we started talking to each other more (but still not enough to be considered ""often,"" they were just many isolated incidents).

We met up that time, and chatted for a few hours, until I had to leave. I was actually surprised at how much he had changed. I had a bit of a crush on him before because even though he was pretty quiet and awkward, he was so intelligent, nerdy, insightful, and funny. He got a lot less awkward and a lot more social in college, and quite liberal as well. He seems very laid-back now, but with this quiet confidence that I really admire. I always thought he was conservative, but was pleased to find out he has formed more liberal values like I have since entering college.

I still don't know his views on relationships, however.

The only way we communicate is through messaging. We have 1- or 2- hour ""incidents"" where we end up chatting to each other online. I don't have his number or anything, and honestly can't ask because it'd be considered too forward and it would make it all too obvious that I like him. After that first meeting, we ended up having one or two more messaging ""incidents,"" and a few weeks after that, I sent him a letter (yes, irl).

No, it was not a romantic letter. One of my courses that semester had us writing letters to people that inspired us to pursue the major we were studying, and he was honestly somebody who changed my perspective and partially caused me to choose my major. So I told him that in the letter, and sent it off. He messaged me when he got it and told me it made him smile. We cracked jokes about it for a bit, and I didn't really muster up the courage to message him for a few months after that.

We had messaging incidents every few months after that (I initiated all of them, he isn't too active in social media), but other than didn't really talk to each other. All of the conversations were great; we had deep conversations about a lot of ""nerdy"" topics, and I really enjoyed chatting with him on the rare occasions that we did. I know he hangs out with a lot of intelligent people, and I know I'm nowhere as smart as him, but he isn't degrading about me not going to as good a college as he is. He talks to me like he would anyone else.

**Current day**:

Around the same time the next year (this year), I ended up in town again, so I asked if he'd like to meet up. He said yes, then messaged a few hours later to say he was busy at that time, and asked if I'd like to grab dinner with him instead. He justified it saying that since I'd be in the area for dinner, it'd make sense because he wouldn't have to travel much and I'd get free dinner (in the dining hall). I agreed, and we met up later that evening.

I had changed my appearance, which he noticed and asked about. Dinner itself was horribly awkward, but that was mostly my fault. I'm terrible with eye contact because of a facial deformity I have and that I'm horribly self-conscious about. He brought up something about an interview he had where the interviewer didn't make eye contact with him... maybe that was a hint for me? We talked about the internship I did last summer (it was at a fairly prestigious company that mostly hires Master's/PhD students, and my parents are so proud that they can brag about their daughter getting in as a freshman in undergrad... I'm convinced it was a fluke). I mostly picked at my food, finished maybe half of it, which he definitely noticed and pointed out later. He asked about a bad roommate situation, then told me I'm too nice when I told him how I handled it. I felt like I stuttered and stumbled over my words, maybe repeated myself. I was extremely nervous. The dining hall closed after about 2 hours, and he walked me outside, then I walked back to my car. I messaged him thanking him for dinner, and he said, ""it was my pleasure.""

I haven't really messaged him lately, and the couple times I did, we didn't have much of a conversation, either because it was during finals/vacation, or maybe because he thinks I'm an antisocial weirdo. He messaged (he initiated) me with music recommendations I asked for a couple weeks ago, which I responded to in a way that unintentionally was dismissive (I just said thanks and put a smiley at the end). I also noticed (in passing, I swear I wasn't creeping) that he liked a post about how guys who aren't tall, dark, or handsome tell themselves that they have to be funny for girls to like them... maybe too much reading into it, but he *is* a really funny guy, maybe... ?

There's a good chance he's figured out I like him and he's just being polite because our families are friends and he doesn't want to make things awkward. I don't know his views on relationships, maybe he doesn't want one. Maybe he likes some super smart not-disfigured girl that goes to his college. I'm painfully shy, and he isn't exactly the type to up and tell someone he likes them. I need help figuring this out.

Reddit, tell me if I'm just getting my hopes up for a guy who's way out of my league? If you think there's any chance, can you suggest some subtler ways to get it across to him that i like him, to test the waters and gauge his reactions without being obvious? Have I already screwed it up? Give me some tough love here, I need some brutally honest opinions and suggestions on how to go forward.

**TL;DR**: I like a guy who's way out of my league, I think I'm reading too much into our interactions and getting my hopes up. I need brutally honest opinions and suggestions about it."

The problem is that I have to be there starting Monday morning and I am at a complete loss at how to find an apartment and all that so I have a couple of questions. I will be flying there Saturday by the way.

Should I stay in a hotel for a couple of days until I find an apartment?

How hard is it to find an apartment or shared house or shared apartment, what sources are there for this kind of thing?

Would it be possible to find a place to live for 6 months on Sunday? Should I just run around finding apartments and ringing their bells?

My budget will be around 1050 pounds per month for 6 months, will it be possible to live in London with that amount of money per month or will I need to ask my parents' help (and how much would that be)?

I am specifically looking to live in a place around here http://tinyurl.com/kl79mcb how could I look for apartments (or shared houses) around there and how cheap could it be?

Any other tips you could have for me?"
2setro,10,2015-01-14,Am I[27F] overreacting from my SIL[25F]'s behaviour? Been with BF (27) for 4 years.,silproblems,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2setro/am_i27f_overreacting_from_my_sil25fs_behaviour/,"Throwaway account since I think SIL's boyfriend might be on Reddit. Names are changed. Sorry for any grammatical errors - English is not my birth language.

REALLY sorry for the wall of text.

I've been seeing my boyfriend (Leo), 27, for 4 years, and we've been living together for 3. We have a great relationship. This post is not about him.

When I first started seeing Leo, I noticed that his parents are very involved with his life - in a good way. My own family has never really been there for me, so I felt so lucky to be welcomed into this nice family. My parents separated when I was about 4 years old. My father spent my childhood being drunk and working in different countries, and my mother moved me and my baby sister around a lot. She eventually married some guy who then molested my sister, went to prison for only half a year and is now living somewhere on the countryside hooked up on drugs. I say this because it takes a lot for me to hate someone, and I can safely say that he is the only person on this planet who I truly hate.

Because of my past, I felt so happy and lucky when Leo introduced me to his sweet family. Sure, they have some skeletons in the closet, but who doesn't?

I have really tried my best to make his family like me. This especially includes his parents and Leo's sister, Vicky, 25. I put on a big smile whenever we visit them, and I try to engage in conversations with them about stuff they are interested in. Vicky and her boyfriend, Luke, are pretty different people than Leo and me, though. This has made it more difficult to form a friendship of any kind since we don't have much to talk about. When we see them, Leo and Luke usually ends up discussing sports, and Vicky picks up her phone to text her friends. Then, I also pick up my phone to read online news, and we just don't talk.

It's not at all a problem that we are different people. I respect that we all have different opinions on things or different interests, and you can't go through life expecting to become best friends with everyone - including your sister in law. I accepted that we would just have the kind of relationship where we are friendly with each other whenever we're at the same event and that's it.

During Spring 2013, I was doing the final year of my degree, and this included an internship at this company who I was so lucky to get into. The company was somewhat far from where Leo and I live, so my in-laws offered me to stay with them for four months during the internship. I happily accepted! While I knew, I was going to miss Leo, this was a great opportunity to also get to know them better. I offered to pay them rent but they kept refusing. I ended up buying them a present at the end of the period to thank them and not feel like I took total advantage of them.

So... I move some of my things to their house and start my internship. I knew from the beginning that Vicky would also be staying with them since she and Luke were in the process of moving to that city, and she got a job close-by.
Then I started noticing why Leo sometimes makes rather negative comments about his sister. We all knew our different work schedules. Leo's parents work night shifts. I got up at 6am in the morning, took off by 7 - around the time where his parents get home. Vicky works in a store, and she usually got up around 8 or 9am in the morning.

Vicky and I had rooms next to each other with a wall so thin, you can hear everything on the other side. She stayed up most nights in the week watching TV-shows or calling Luke, and I had a lot of trouble getting enough sleep. She would slam the bathroom door when she was finally getting ready to go to sleep, making sure that even if I had managed to fall asleep, I would wake up. This is not crazy stuff, and I didn't want any trouble so I never said anything. I did, however, tell Leo about me missing sleep when he asked how my nights were. He asked me why, and I told him that it was due to his sister being a little loud until around 1 at night.

My birthday is in Spring, and when the day came, his parents had made a nice dinner, and my boyfriend came to celebrate. I noticed that Vicky didn't give me any birthday present, but hey - maybe she just didn't think about it. This thought only occurred to me since we had been giving each other presents since the start of my relationship with Leo.

When my time at the company was finished, Leo told me, however, that he had called Vicky to try and tell her that she was being a bit loud at night and that maybe she could wear headphones when watching her shows. She became mad at him for suggesting that she was doing anything wrong and, well, she never changed her behaviour anyway.

I began to notice how her family behaves around Vicky in general. Vicky doesn't eat that varied. She will only eat white bread, fried stuff and meat. She never eats vegetables - only the carrots that her mother makes especially for her for dinner. I noticed that Vicky actually has to have individually prepared food for dinner at their parents' because she will refuse to eat anything that has touched the stuff, she doesn't like. She will say that the food we are eating is gross, and that vegetables are for rabbits.

This Summer, Leo's parents decided that to celebrate their anniversary, they would take all of us (Vicky, Luke, Leo and myself) for a vacation for three whole weeks. In short, the vacation was horrible. We couldn't eat anywhere else but at fastfood places, because Vicky would demand that we eat there. Leo's parents actually yelled at Leo and me for wanting to just for one night go somewhere that had salads and other foods that would not make our stomachs explode. They said that we were being selfish, and that we should appreciate spending time with the whole family. Well, we spent the entire three weeks with them! We even shared rooms!

Another thing about the vacation was the horrible planning by Leo's parents. They thought that we could just go to the states for three weeks without having any type of schedule of what we wanted to go see or any tickets booked. For this reason, Leo and I offered to help with the planning so we would all be able to see what we wanted. They took our offer and, well, we planned A LOT, booked tickets and everything, and we did not get one ""thank you"". Actually, Leo's mother came to me one morning and told me that Leo's father was mad at me for taking over since it was his job as ""the father"". I told her I was sorry for that, and I stayed out of it from that point on.

In the start of the vacation, though, we were at a theme park, and like everywhere else, nothing was planned. We all agreed that we would do the attractions in a certain way, but when it came down to it, we were just walking around randomly missing out on some of the things. Leo said to me: ""This is not how we agreed"". And I told him: ""No, but we can't really do anything, people are just walking around randomly"". Vicky heard me, spinned around to face me (she is a lot taller than me), pointed her finger closely to my face and said a lot of stuff about how I should stay out of her business, that I had no right to treat her that way, and so on and so on. She stepped up right in front of me and looked me straight in the eyes and cussed me out in the middle of the park. I just said that what I said was not at all directed towards her, and then I stayed silent trying not to cry and ruin the day for everyone.

At the hotel one night, we had arrived very late (21pm or something around that time). Vicky chose a restaurant for us all, so that there would be something she liked to eat. We sat down, and the waiter came to our table with water and bread, and we were all so hungry, we took some of the bread while we were deciding what to order. Vicky decides that she doesn't want anything on the menu and asks us to find another place. This has happened before the vacation where we were out to eat at restaurants. She will say that she can't eat anything on the menu and make us get up and find another place to eat. It's so embarrassing.

Leo and I decided that we wanted to stay at the restaurant. We were hungry and tired. We said: ""Hey, let's just meet at the room - it's fine."" Well, the next morning, Leo and I find Vicky crying to their parents, telling them I'm a bad person for embarrassing her. She is litterally gasping for air, she is crying so hard. Their mother yells at us for ruining this trip that they had saved for for so long. We did not once get asked about our opinion.

Okay, this is getting long - last example, I promise! Leo and I moved this January. A year ago, Leo's parents got rid of some of their stuff to clear out some clutter in the basement. Specifically, they had this designer lamp that they didn't just want to throw out. They asked Vicky if she wanted it. She said no. They asked Leo and I, we said yes. They gave Vicky 650 dollars to compensate for giving us the lamp. We did not have room for the lamp at our old place, so they stored it for us. When we moved, Leo asked his father if they would bring the lamp. Well, apparently, Vicky wanted it for when she and Luke moved two months ago, so she got it.

Leo's mother said that she felt bad, and they had agreed to find us a new lamp similar to the one they had. I was completely stunned. Not only did Vicky very blatantly use them, the parents were actually willing to buy us a new designer lamp just to not upset Vicky! I mean - what?! After a short talk, Leo and I decided that we did not want to take advantage of the situation. His parents are not at all rich. We told them that we didn't want a new lamp. By that time, they had already bought it. We just accepted it.

Sorry for the rambling. My question is:
I am really uncomfortable with Leo's sister now. These are VERY FEW examples of her behaviour. She cannot stand anyone making a joke on her or her dogs, she has no respect for other people and she and Luke are both very homophobic and racist as it turns out from conversations with them.

I have not said anything to Vicky or the parents. It's not like she has cut my hair in my sleep or anything. She is not crazy - she's just selfabsorbed. I just feel kind of violated on the vacation and by some comments she's made at other occasions.

What is the best way of dealing with this? I've always been someone who likes to talk about issues and get everything cleared so we can all be friends. I'm just not sure it's possible in this instance. Leo has told me that they never really talk about feelings or problems in their family, and he does not think that anything good will come of discussing this with anyone else. I want to respect that, I'm just another type of person.

What about when Leo and I get married someday? Will I have to have this person who has disrespected me and Leo sit right next to us?

Right now, Leo and I are just being nice to them when we have to see them, but neither of us really want to be a part of their life. Vicky is pregnant now to everyone's surprise, and we want to have a relationship with the baby, but not so much Vicky and Luke.

Am I simply overreacting?

---   
**tl;dr**: SIL is very selfabsorbed and has yelled at me and made me cry. She uses her parents for money on more than one occasion. I have ignored her behaviour until now - how can I best deal with it and be comfortable around my BF's family?"

Yesterday after going down a series of thought spirals, I began thinking of all the things I have been able to experience that Hae never had the chance to, and I decided to write them down. Here is my list:

	•	I attended college and got my degree
	•	I did 2 years of post-graduate study
	•	I moved to NYC
	•	I made new friends and a lot of valuable connections 
	•	I had some really awesome internships
	•	I struggled for a year when the recession was at its worst, but eventually I got my first job and launched my career
	•	I moved into my first apartment and learned how to live independently
	•	I studied abroad in France and it was the most amazing experience of my life 
	•	I rebuilt my life after a toxic/abusive relationship (emphasis on the “rebuilt” part)
	•	I met my wonderful boyfriend
	•	I adopted two adorable felines 
	•	I got to watch so many movies, read so many books, and see so much art and culture that didn’t exist pre-2000
	•	I got to see my relationship with my brother develop from him giving me noogies and teasing me to something more adult…well sort of
	•	I get to visit my parents every month. They can call me and talk to me whenever they want.
	•	I volunteered for a career-building program for people who are living below the poverty line, something I wouldn’t have had the experience to do when I was younger 
	•	I took a risk and quit my full time job to freelance
	•	I have had 15 (almost 16) birthdays since 1999. Not all of them were happy, but at least they happened.

What did this exercise accomplish for me? A lot, actually. I turned 30 last year and it scared me how fast my 20s escaped me. I’m scared of getting old, feeling old, and looking old. I often get depressed thinking about how much I wish I did things differently over the last decade, and I worry how my mistakes might have set me back. But now, any time I have those needling thoughts, I imagine feisty Hae giving me a well-deserved thwap on the back of my head and telling me to STFU, and I obey her."
2sf4ro,26,2015-01-14,"My (potentially) Nparents are doing their best to take my tax return money because ""in a roundabout way, that money is ours anyway."" Partial rant, looking for some advice.",drakesjam,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2sf4ro/my_potentially_nparents_are_doing_their_best_to/,"Hi folks, be prepared for a wall of text because I haven't really been able to vent about this in any productive way and it's only just beginning. So sorry in advance for what may be a very long read. Also, I apologize if this doesn't quite fit in here: I'm new to posting and this was the best place I could think of. 

I have lurked here for a while, and it's becoming much more often I find myself relating to the posts here. You see, my parents can be completely amicable and really cool, when they get their way. If anyone or anything even dares to challenge them on anything, the shit will hit the fan. Hard. 

A little context: I am a 22 year old man who lives completely independent of my parents except for 1 caveat; they pay for my school. I have always been a hard worker and have always sought to make them proud. I was a smart highschooler (3.8 GPA at graduation, and I am in my last semester of University with a 3.4 in Economics and Political Science. I also maintain a high level internship with an energy company that allows me to work part time as many hours as I can manage throughout the school year, and I will be the first one in the entire history of my family to graduate with a 4 year degree. Since moving out this past summer I have not asked them for anything financially or otherwise, because I truly believe that I can do it on my own and I take pride in that. Up until I moved out I thought my parents were regular parents, with a little bit more tough love than most. Their true colours came out when I moved out of their house and into an apartment with my girlfriend (against their wishes). I can go into more detail about this if you all want, but this is not my reason for posting, this time at least. 

Alright so now here is where I'm caught up and could use a little advice. It's tax season and everyone is looking forward to their return, including me. We (SO and I) went all out on Christmas (for them) and are moving into an apartment better suited to our needs at the end of February. I am *really* looking forward to this money so we can get back on track and finally be financially stable for a little while. Anyway, since my parents pay for my school they want the tax benefits from it. Understandable and completely reasonable. The conundrum comes in the fact that they have to claim me as a dependent when I obviously wasn't one. This is the same situation I was in last year, and it ended up that a full time student working 30 hours a week had to pay the state more money as a tax ""return."" As you can imagine, I was thrilled. However I could not fight it as I was their dependent. Fine. As I said this year is different though. Since my name is not on my current lease, my ""address"" is still my parents house, so I came up with a compromise that I thought both parties would benefit from: they claim me as a dependent for this year, and thusly can claim my tuition. Since they will get an extra $3950 for claiming me as a dependent also, I simply asked for them to split that with me so we both get what we want. I get a return, they get to claim my tuition PLUS an additional ~$2000 in refunds. Reasonable right? Wrong. 

I was repeatedly told how ungrateful I was and that while no, they didn't pay for over 50% of my life and didn't house me last year (requirements to be a dependent), they had paid a lot of money towards my school and are entitled to my tax return because ""in a roundabout way, that money is ours anyway."" Uhm excuse me but no it's not, that money is taken out of my paycheck every month, not yours. You see, they are completely selfless and will give unconditionally, until their opinions are challenged. At which point everything they have ever done for you is regurgitated right back onto your face. My dad also likes to threaten, act superior, and call me ""boy"" (think plantation owner talking to slave ""boy""), while my mom likes to cry and say everyone is mean to her, which provokes my dad even more. After a certain point logic and being reasonable and even listening go out the window in favor for ""well just stop paying then"" and ""you disrespectful little shit"" and ""this conversation is over."" They see themselves as bastions of tolerance and reason, when in reality if they don't hear what they want they put their fingers in their ears, threaten, and end the conversation. At what point did respect go out the window?

And on top of all of this, they have continuously illustrated that they have moved on from giving a shit about me. They don't ask how I am or how I'm doing, ever. They never ask about the school the supposedly care about until its time to pay tuition, time to claim it on taxes, or if somebody else asks. They wont hesitate to tell anyone who asks what a hard worker I am and how smart I am and how I will be graduating without student loan debt (all thanks to them of course) and for Christ's sake my dad didn't even know what my major was when we talked about it last year! I honestly doubt he could tell me now. They don't know what classes I'm in, or how my grades are, and if I ever outsmart them (happening more and more) they will throw the fact that I'm educated in my face! ""Oh well aren't you smart college boy."" So it makes me wonder why they really sent me there, to better me and my life and my chances of success, or to better their own reputations so they can feel better about themselves?

Also note: their justifications for the way they have acted towards me and my SO have been that I have ""pushed them"" this year by acting ""against their wishes."" (I can elaborate more on this if you all would like me to, if that would help at all) They can't grasp that I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions and have opinions that aren't theirs and that's alright. Even worse, they say that they understand the struggle of your early/mid 20s but can't seem to understand why $1500-$2000 would really help me right now? Like really?

I'm just at my wits end with this stuff, my head hurts all day and I'm not sleeping well. They make me feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall in Morse code trying to communicate when I honestly don't think I could have been more calm, reasonable, and clear.

I was born and raised in one region of the country but started my career in a different region a couple years ago.  I have no family in this region and moved here with no social base outside of the office.

I started my career excited and too busy learning how to do my job well to spend much time thinking about meeting new people.  I just wanted to make sure I was on a solid trajectory in my job and that my son adjusted well to the move.

Two and a half years into my career, my son and I are doing great.  He's in a great school system, I own my first home, he's made many friends in school and in the neighborhood, and I'm continuing to earn a high salary.

But now I'm feeling lonely.  I've only dated two women out here.  The first I met during my summer internship at the law firm.  I was by myself that summer, my son stayed with my parents during the internship.  One night, I was at my favorite bar near my apartment that summer.  I was pretty drunk when I went in - it was my last stop and I just wanted to talk to some of my favorite bartenders before heading home for the night.  I sat down next to her and her friend, ordered a beer, started small talk, and before I could take my last sip, she grabbed my arm and said: ""You're coming with me!""  We closed out, walked back to her place a few blocks away from mine, had drunken sex, met the next night to talk about what happened the night before, and agreed that a casual summer fling sounded good to both of us.  I wasn't interested in more, and I made that clear throughout the summer.

The second was a shock.  There's a paralegal at the firm who's just gorgeous.  She showed me around the firm when I first visited before starting my summer internship and has been a great friend ever since.  She's 35 and great with kids, so she'd often hang out with my son and I.  We were friends for four years when, last winter, she suddenly got pretty flirty.  She invited me out with her, one of her friends, and her friend's boyfriend because she had stopped dating somebody the week before and needed ""a dinner date.""  We were going to split a cab back to our area of town, until she told me the night before that she had booked a hotel room.  I asked if I could sleep on the floor and she laughed, saying she reserved two beds in the room.  We didn't need two beds.  That night was awesome.  We dated for a few months until she suddenly told me we had a lot of differences (we do) and that I'd be better off with someone younger (I would).

I haven't dated anyone since.  Another paralegal here has been my best friend in the area since after the firm's Christmas part my first year here.  I met her at a hotel after the party and we hit it off great.  We were singing on our way from the hotel to a nearby bar, walked in laughing and in high spirits, and then she walked straight over to a guy at a high top who looked very annoyed with her.  Fuck - she was in a relationship.

We only grew closer from that night, going to lunch every week and talking almost every day.  We just have a ton in common - both were teen parents, many of the same interests, similar personalities - so I was just enjoying the friendship.  We're close enough that many people in the firm think we're banging each other (I wish!).  She has fun with those rumors and often jokes about it when we're going to lunch (""Ready for some garage sex?!"").  We have only been out together at night once, as she's never been allowed to go out alone without getting in a huge fight with her boyfriend, the father of her daughters who she'd been with for ten years trying to make it work.  She's 27, he's 35, and he's always been in control.

As soon as I started dating the other paralegal, she told me she wanted to go to lunch to vent about something.  She said she planned to leave her boyfriend and buy a home.  I didn't think it was my place to talk bad about a guy I knew very little about, but told her that based on what she's told me, it sounds like it would be a good change for her after trying for a decade to make things work without success.

She moved out after he smashed her car window when she told him she was looking for a home for her and her girls.  She's been living with her parents while waiting to complete a short sale on her home and have renovations done.  She has the freedom to do what, and who, she wants for the first time in ten years.

She's started talking to me even more, asking me out to lunch even more, planning on going out at night (finally) as soon as she has a free weekend on a weekend when her ex has the girls, and even left work early to go have a few drinks with me before I flew home for the holidays (It was her idea.).  I've been trying to feel her out to see if (1) she's just really happy to be free and is choosing to spend more time with me and talk to me more often after work because she can for the first time but is still strictly a friend or (2) maybe there's an opportunity for more.  For example, I was out of town for work last week and she texted me to tell me it sucks when I'm not in the office, I replied ""too bad I can't travel with a paralegal"", she responded ""well, some of the attorneys can, and we all know what 'happens' on those trips"" (referring to more gossip about people banging each other in this office), so I decided to tell her ""well, now you're just reinforcing my point"", pretty nervous about that text but happy to see a "";)"" a minute later.

We've both been pretty busy the past week, so other than lunch for her birthday and a few texts, we haven't talked much.  We're going to lunch tomorrow.

I'd love a chance to date her, but (1) I don't know if she's even interested and (2) I don't want to ruin any chance by moving too quickly after a serious breakup but (3) I don't want to miss the boat by not making any move at all.  I feel like I'll probably keep reading her as best I can and, if she gives any good signs, make a move fairly soon.

But what if this doesn't work out?  Where should I be looking to find someone?  It's expensive to get childcare to go to a bar and hope to stumble upon a nice woman.  I don't have any friends here outside of the office.  I had no luck with online dating when I tried for several months before dating the first paralegal.

I'm lonely.  I know I'm a good catch for many women, but I just don't know where to look (well, outside of the office at least!).

Please help!

I'm 21 year old virgin who has never even asked a girl out in his life. I have struggled with very bad porn and musturbation addictions which has lead me to not desire to be with someone. I have been combating this the last year. I have had a few crushes over the last year.

Side note: I excel quite well in other areas of my life.  I have some really good close friends. Including one who is abstaining from porn and masturbation with me to help both of us. I graduate with an engineering degree this May and already have accepted a perminate job...

Girl 1 met a little more than a year ago with about two weeks left in school (we worked on a project together). I wanted to ask her out but didn't have a chance for awhile because we were both leaving college for a semester to do internships. Plus I was super scared. We got back and had summer classes together. Guess what she had a boyfriend now. My brilliant mind said wait for her to break up then she's all yours. I was thinking this would happen because they were in a long distance relationship. During this time I got to know her quite well and realized we were not compatible at all so I can give up on her.

Girl 2. She has been in a few classes I had taken over the last two years but I had never talked to her until the summer classes which was only a little bit. The last four weeks of school I sat next to her in a class and talked to her quite a bit. I realized that we have a lot in common. This semester ended and it wasn't until after I got home over break that I really liked her and though I should ask her out. I determined that I would ask her out when seniors come back a week before school starts to get a head start on design projects. She wasn't able to make it to this. I was like okay you can ask her out right when classes start. I was able to talk with her just fine when we were next to each other in class. But now I have a goal of asking her out and come up with these stupid plans on how to do it. I am so shy to even approach her. I said hi and how was your break on Monday but after that didn't do anything else. I failed with one of my stupid plans today as well. I have been getting so nervous as well. I freaking puked this morning before leaving my apartment because I was so fearful. 

I NEED TO MAN UP BE COURAGEOUS AND ASK HER OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

2. I'm also wondering how much I'll be able to learn from Code Academy. I've been planning on learning JS for a while, but the reason I'm learning it now is not for pleasure, but actually for my job. I'm an IT admin intern (I think I'm going to be hired part time soon :D). I'm also kinda IS, as I'm ""serving"" the business by managing tickets, new hires, etc. I'm only an intern right now and I actually went to school for Game Design, not IT, so I wouldn't know why your vpn isn't working lol. I recently ended up switching my major to IT, but anyways... My manager wants me to learn how to use Changegear, which is used as our ticket/new hire/termination software, it also links to QAD (ERP system) and Epicor (finance). Changegear is very visually based, dragging and dropping fields into forms, but I will need some knowledge in JS so I can customize the forms more.

My question is, do any IS brahs here know how much JS I'll need to know in order to manage Changegear? 

Not sure if there's a better place for this question, I'm kinda new to Reddit. Any help is appreciated :)"
2sh2mr,3,2015-01-14,How to break in with zero experience,elbygee,userexperience,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/2sh2mr/how_to_break_in_with_zero_experience/,"Hey everyone.  I've done extensive reading on job markets and the industry.  I'm pretty familiar with the tech scene in general (from the outside looking in).  I read hackernews regularly, studied Computer Science for a while, know a lot about education credentials (HCI, Interaction Design), the importance of portfolio and experience, networking, etc.  I've also read most topics on this forum regarding ""breaking in.""

My task here is to figure out a gameplan given what I've gathered, for my personal background.

First, a quick story:

I was recently reading about the experience of someone back in 2010 who graduated with a bachelor's degree in HCI from University of Washington in Seattle.  During and after his studies, he interned in various places, including big names like Amazon.  However, he had trouble finding a real job.  He went to meetups, events, networked furiously, created new designs, redid company's designs, worked on projects, etc.  But apparently, when he went for a job, he either lacked experience or needed a graduate degree.

He ended up doing the User Centered Design and Engineering masters from the same school, and I see that a couple years later (now)  he seems happily employed in the Bay Area working for a well-known company.

It seems like he did everything right but still needed that graduate degree in the end.

My understanding is that those who break in without a relevant/graduate degree usually slip in from another related field -- usually engineering, product management, sometimes marketing, and of course graphic/visual design, often within their company.  Or with luck.

My understanding is also that UX is not really an entry-level job, but more of a mid-level one (its pay certainly reflects that).  So everything I've mentioned so far seems to make sense.

-----

Where I come in:

I've worked in a non-related industry (mental health) for over 2 years.  I have a bachelor's degree in Sociology and recently did time studying Computer Science (I enjoy CS/programming, but realized it's not my end goal and primary interest).  I no longer plan to finish the CS degree (for what it's worth, this decision is final for me).

My original plan was to maintain student status (as this affects internship eligibility, and gives me opportunities to work with professors) taking some relevant classes (Cog Sci, HCI), do related research, and try to build my portfolio and snag internships until I could leverage my experience to get a UX position. Now given what I've said above, this doesn't seem like a doable path if someone else did all these things with a relevant degree from a reputable school with very strong internships, and still didn't get work.  If it fails, I'd have wasted significant time and money taking more undergrad classes.

Right now, I see two options.

1) Aim for graduate school
2) Weasel my way into a UX role from a front-end position.

1)
The graduate school path is pretty similar to my original plan, so I don't think there is much here worth discussing.  Building a portfolio, doing user-related research, hopefully getting internships, all for getting into a good HCI/design program as a focus over a job.  I suppose an emphasis on research may be useful for graduate school.  I would prefer a more holistic program over one focused on web/mobile technology design.

2)
This is something I'm hoping maybe someone here could provide info for me.  I see a number of roles that seem to mix UX (more like UI) with front-end development.  It's difficult to study just how common these positions are because the keywords (front-end, UX, UI, design, etc) often all show-up in the same positions (front-end developer, UI developer, UX engineer, UX designer, interaction designer, etc).  This position seems to be a ""lite"" front-end developer position with strong UI skills.

Now I don't mind this because I enjoy coding, and it seems that this is a very valued skill in UX.  I also consider it the safer path because front-end skills are more valued and entrenched in the industry (UX still needs to be sold its value), and it provides a background for me in case I end up going into grad school anyway.

My biggest concern is in aiming for this kind of role.  Many front-end developer positions are becoming engineering-heavy (and require a strong CS background working with angular, etc.), and well, by focusing on this middle-path, I'm eliminating myself from the engineer-heavy role and the whole UX/designer role.

How viable would it be to try to break in by selling yourself as a UX/designer guy (or gal) who can code?  Are these positions still out there?

-----

TLDR:
For someone with zero relevant experience (no engineering background, no product management background, no design background, no marketing background, etc.), is aiming for a front-end-engineer-designer-hybrid role a doable path for working my way into a UX position?  Is an entry-level hybrid designer/coder valuable and somewhat in demand (NOT a unicorn UX guru who's also a rockstar programmer)... This is opposed to going the traditional grad-school route, where most job postings, people's experiences, and surveys indicate needing a master's degree or at least being mid-career.

Industry knowledge or personal experiences are appreciated.  Any helpful words on things I touched upon are also welcome!  I understand that most people here probably came from more traditional design roles (it seems), but I'm not in a position to play from that angle, so am looking for other people's experiences and ways to leverage some CS skills.

Thank you."

I'm a 2L, going into my 4th semester.  Top 60 school in the state I want to practice in with a full scholarship.  GPA is 3.7 rounded, on law review, starting an internship with my state supreme court next week. 

So far law school has been whatever.  I've been grinding through it and getting by.  I ended my last semester in relatively good spirits.  Then, the new semester started Monday, and I couldn't get out of bed.  I literally just could not do it.  The thought of going back to that building and doing it all again made me almost physically ill.  I sat in my room the entire day and realized I couldn't remember the last time I have been truly happy.  The worry, stress, and grind of school has consumed my life to the point that I cannot remember what it felt like to be relaxed or just normal.

I've yet to go to a single class this week, and I likely won't.  I really don't know what to do, and I know if I confide this in anyone I know in real life they'll treat me like I'm nuts.  I've been sitting on gmail for the past 2 hours going back and forth on e-mailing the dean of students to discuss me dropping out.  

I deep down feel like bailing now would be a mistake, but I thought this feeling would have passed after Monday, however it's only gotten stronger.  "

Should I?,Steel_Pump_Gorilla,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/2shd0i/my_boss_is_trying_to_steal_my_client_talent/,"She had me sign on as ""head"" of her commercial division. She had me submitting people for commercials on the LA Casting website all day and nothing else. I brought in dozens of new clients and booked them for things. Here's some of the problems that I had with her:

- She and nobody else was at the office on my first day of work. They forgot that I was going to show up and told me to go home and just submit from home when I called them after I arrived.

- She never showed up once to work. The office is in Los Angeles, but she lives in Palm Springs. She has the office there for some reason, but it's just a one room office and it just seems like a cheap place holder for her business.

- She just had me doing tedious work like submitting people on breakdowns for commercials. That's all. Nothing else agency related. I might as well have been an intern with a fancy name.

- I had the sneaking suspicion that I was only there to be a place holder at the office so she wouldn't get in trouble with SAG for having no other agents at the office.

- They never introduced me to anyone in the business and claimed it was because they were a very ""hands off"" type of company.  I honestly think that it was just being lazy and wanting all of the agents to do her work for her.

I know that I could really easily have her shut down because now that I'm not there, I know that there have been multiple days where nobody has been at the office. She's trying to hold onto my old clients and there's a part of me that wants to be stone cold about it and call the Screen Actors Guild on her. There's another part of me that says live and let live, but yeah.

I now have a much better job with a much better company in the same field (which I still love), but yeah. Not sure where to go from here."

Coulda went to an Ivy League but had a great scholarship to this university, plus I loved the feel of this place. I really excelled in and out of the classroom: 3.95 gpa, made great friends/girlfriend, leader of student organizations. 

With all this came drinking. Nothing far fetched for a guy my age. Drank once per weekend and maybe once on a weekday. I was working too hard on other stuff to do much more than that. 2nd weekend as a freshman I didn't know my limits and got arrested because I was puking in the dorm bathrooms. Strike 1, sigh. 

Spring sophomore year, day drinking at a friends on a Saturday, I feel myself getting too drunk(about to black out), so I make what I thought was a good decision and head home. Cop sees me cutting through a yard and boom. Arrested again, strike 2. Have to go to jail for two days and attend alcohol counseling classes. 

I went to the classes with a decent attitude, I continued drinking but stopped blacking out and going to bars with a fake id (very rare amongst my peers). I actually lost some friends junior year because they never saw me out as much, and was a reason my gf and I broke up (no hard feelings, she understood, I missed her but it was for the best). 

 I spent my newly found time on positive things like exercise (lost 20 lbs and was a healthy BMI for first time), classes (picked up a minor in mathematics for fun), and job hunting (the biggest time commitment-getting an internship on Wall Street from my school is very tough, you have to network like crazy, talk on the phone with dozens of professionals just hoping you can sneak into an interview. Studying interview guides more than class textbooks so you can make an impression. and it paid off! I got an internship on Wall Street this summer on a trading desk.)

I couldn't believe it, nor could family or friends. From jail over the summer to this! I was happy with life for the first time in a while. I had pulled so many all nighters and sincerely worked the hardest I had In my life that semester. 

After I take my last final, my buddy Jake asks me to go to the bar for a drink to congratulate me. Jake was one of the friends I had kind of lost so I really wanted to go, even though my roommates and I planned a Family Dinner where we eat everything in the fridge and freezer cause break was about to start. So I go with Jake and I have a great time catching up. Then my friend Neil comes by and buys me a drink as well. Why turn it down I earned this and I want to celebrate! But I like to get people back so I buy a round. And so on.


Next thing I know I'm getting woken up by cops in a school building. For some reason my blacked out self (It had been so long since I drank heavily, + I had pulled an all nighter so my tolerance was lower) passed out in a lecture hall on campus. Strike 3 I'm out. 

I'm Going to jail for at least two weeks, but I could deal with that. The worst: getting kicked out of the school that I loved midway through the year, losing my internship and chance at a dream job/career, disappointing my parents, losing all the friends I had made. 

Now I commute to a much lesser college, retaking a bunch of classes because the credits didn't transfer, then I go to work at walmart, then I come home to sleep/ lay in bed thinking about how badly I fucked up my life &amp; write this post. 

I'm obviously very depressed about this so I started with therapy which is depressing in and of itself. Like 2 years ago I could've never imagined being this sad 24/7.

 I told her my story and like anybody else, looks at me like an alcoholic. In my heart I know I'm not. I'm just a kid who made some bad decisions mixed with bad luck. I never liked partying as much as my friends, and haven't even looked at a drink since( part because I'm disgusted with the thought of drinking and part because I have no friends around anymore). 

I'm very grateful that my parents still support me and I'm still able to go to some college. It's an opportunity many others aren't afforded. 

When I look at drunken snapchat stories or my twitter feed on a Friday night, I can't help but think I didn't deserve all this. (If I had an earlier birthday I could've been 21 for my recent 2 arrests and it would've been a moot point.) I never hurt anybody, I was one of the schools best students (the colleges chair of the finance department even tried to fight my expulsion, to no avail).

I just wanted to tell this story to someone other than my psychologist or lawyer, cause it's hard for them to listen to some kids sob story for so long. I'm truly thankful of you read all this. "
2si3yq,1,2015-01-15,Roommate drama,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2si3yq/roommate_drama/,"**Background information:**

Let me start by explaining the agreement worked out with my roommates. I live in an apartment where rent is not shared, it is per person. I was randomly placed with two roommates, and frequently had my boyfriend over. They liked him, and almost a year later when he decided to attend college, but did not have finances for rent I asked if he could live with us. They agreed, as long as he paid utilities, this seemed fair and we agreed to do so. 

One of the original roommates has moved out, and without my consent, the other original roommate (Jamie) chose a new roommate and informed them of the agreement and currently live with us. Jamie is currently 27 years of age and we have lived together for a total of 4 years now. Of those four years, she has known my boyfriend for three years and had never had an issue with him. We have always paid rent on time, as well as the utilities (even when it was a struggle). We have never asked for help, and rarely have even made our financial struggles known to Jamie. 


A little bit about Jamie, she is very tidy. Her standards of clean do not match our standards of clean. I can admit we have slobbish tendencies, but make every effort to keep the common areas clean. I have admitted this to her, and she stated she did not mind. During breaks, Jamie goes home and we stay at the apartment for the most part and put forth special effort to clean before she returns. We mostly stay in our room, and have no possessions in the common areas other than food. 

She has a dog that still poops on the floor, and while she is gone (which is most of the time) we would clean up after him and take him out. I ended up being the one to train him and took him on walks and to dog parks when I had time. Jamie appreciated this, and even called me his other doggie mom. I did not mind helping with the dog, as he is very sweet. 

Over the years she has also had many boy problems, that she would come to me about and would often cry. I always listened and would make every attempt to cheer her up. Once, my boyfriend and I surprised her with a fruit basket when she was really down. 

My point in mentioning all this, is that we have made efforts to maintain a good roommate relationship with her. She has also done nice things for us as well in the past. 


**Current situation:**


Over Christmas break, my boyfriend and I hit a major financial crisis. For the first time, we had to live off of cheap food such as Ramen, yet we still paid all bills on time. Jamie came back during the break to work at her internship, and there was minimal interaction as we both felt too depressed to engage socially. I can admit, we left some food in the fridge that should have been thrown away, but we didn't. Before she left to go home again, she threw away a pizza we had only bought one day prior.


Being annoyed, as this was my lunch for the next day, I confronted her through text as she had already left. I asked, ""Hey, what happened to the pizza we had bought yesterday?""  To which she replied, ""Oh I thought that was old, my bad.""  I simply said nothing, and decided I would survive.


Classes are about to begin, and Jamie and the other roommate return on the same day. Despite our cleaning before her arrival, Jamie was passively aggressively hitting our door with the vacuum cleaner and woke us up. Later I spoke to her politely, and asked how her time away was and had a small conversation. 


The next day, I am awoken at 6am by her yelling on the phone with her mother. She said, ""I work so hard, and my roommates lay in bed all day."" Instantly, I felt my heart drop. She did not understand how hard it was for us to even move from bed, and with little finances we would not be able to go anywhere anyway.


When she comes back after her internship, she starts telling the other roommate how messy the apartment was when she came back and how bad the fridge was. She said, ""I threw away their pizza and I got jumped on for it."" Then she apologized for waking her and her boyfriend up. I suddenly became furious, and was tired of her talking behind our back so my boyfriend and I walked out and confronted her.


She began by saying she was the only one who cleaned, and wanted everyone to help more and that it wasn't a big deal. By the tone of her voice, it was easy to tell there was more behind it so we asked and it eventually turned into a cussing/yelling match. All of us hate confrontation, and this was the most we ever had. It's safe to say, we all had things boiling under our skin for awhile.


While I would love to type a transcript of what was said, essentially she undermined everything we said. We both felt as though we were being talked down to, and almost as if she wanted us to feel like lesser people. She said the apartment was a mess when she returned. (There were some dirty dishes in the dishwasher, a box she left on top of the garbage can filled with her own trash, some pieces of cotton on the carpet from a dog toy, and maybe crumbs on the counters). I stated that it may not have been clean by her standards, but it seemed clean to us. She said that the other other roommates' boyfriend helps out more than my boyfriend. My boyfriend lost his temper and said that he could pay the electric bill. She then said my boyfriend could just move out. I just sat there, astonished that someone who we've always been there for emotionally could say such a thing.
 

Somehow during the argument, she mentioned how I apparently caused a scene when she and the other roommate (and her boyfriend) went to a concert without inviting me. I recall that when she was getting ready to go, she asked if I would care for her dog. Initially, I said I would care for the dog and did not mention feeling left out. Before she left though I brought my feelings to her attention, which is something I have never done before. The whole conversation was civil, and she made dinner plans for the next week for all of us. 
While I thought this was no big deal, apparently it was worth mentioning in our big blow up.


We confronted her about her comment about us being in bed all day, to which she replied, ""Well you do, don't you?""  I snapped back about our situation and feeling depressed. She said, ""Welcome to my world"" and went into how I should be working if I am so broke...and her friend agreed.  Mind you, I have had jobs during summers while also struggling with anxiety and depression. She's known I have been diagnosed with panic disorder, but showed no empathy. And while I can understand the point, it was unnecessary as I have paid all bills on time. It was the lowest blow. I feel it came from a place of her own fear about not getting a job after working her internship and feeling as though she shouldn't have worked so hard toward it, but it was no excuse to talk to us in that way.

Before I could get many other comments in, she said ""I'm done"" and walked into her room. It was definitely more heated than it should have been, and I only regret losing my temper but not what was said. In my mind, I finally stood up for myself which has always been difficult for me. Tensions are high, and my boyfriend continues to be nice to her while I say nothing. I have made attempts to be even more clean, and cleaned what I thought of to be an already clean space for almost an hour.


I'm feeling exhausted, and have an emotionally draining internship ahead of me this semester and intensive classes. I am tired of not being comfortable in an apartment we are paying extra money for so my boyfriend has a place to stay. We are confined to a room that is too small for us, and feel judged for anything we do. I feel the resentment is too high to truly mend...especially if she was upset at me for telling her I was feeling left out once. Additionally, I feel too old for this kind of thing.


The lease is up in August, but that feels too long to endure. I have been looking into subleasing, and found what seems to be a perfect apartment we could move into. The only problem is, classes are starting next week and I'm feeling as though moving would be too much stress. Subleasing is also new to me and makes me worry. On the other hand though, I believe it would be better for everyone involved if we all went separate ways. 


Given this situation, what would be the best course of action? I truly appreciate understanding and advice, as this has caused me increased anxiety. Thanks for reading, I know it was a lot as it is still fresh. 


**TL;DR:** Roommate of four years was acting passively aggressively, and when confronted blew up and exposed all of the things she had bottled up for a long time while taking many low blows and talking down to my boyfriend and I despite our attempts to be good roommates.

2sidpi,228,2015-01-15,My [24/F] European bf [32/M] is having a hard time understanding my student loan debt and my need to move,culturemoneyclash,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sidpi/my_24f_european_bf_32m_is_having_a_hard_time/,"I moved to Europe from the US when I was in college (I attended online). The initial thing was for me to just be in Germany for a year and then come home. However, after my first year was up I was offered a really great internship at a very well known company in the gaming industry and I couldn't pass up the opportunity. I spoke with my parents, they agreed to help me out financially, and I stayed. Before the internship I met my bf. He is not from Germany, but is from a neighboring country, and he lived there. We met when he was on vacation in Germany. We have been together for over 2 years now.

During this time it came out that the man who hired me to work at this company was scamming them. I was about 4 months into a planned 6 month internship (with a possibility of being hired after) and a bit naive. The first two months I was paid, like normal, but the third month he was late. My boss (the one who got fired) made excuse after excuse, but promised it was coming. During the fourth month (when he got fired) I was told by the company that my contract was with him, so they would not be keeping me on (which is true, the company I was hired by was registered to him, but with their name, but a different company.. this is why he was fired, he was illegally using their name for his own companies). My boss basically begged me to continue to work for free. I said absolutely not and that I wanted my money. I quit the internship and tried to get my money, but the German legal system is confusing to a foreigner and I just gave up.

After this point I was struggling to find some other job to allow me to stay, and I'd fallen in love with Europe. So my bf asked me to move in with him in his home country. I viewed this as a great opportunity and was super excited to go somewhere new. He assured me that I'd be able to find work in one of the nearby cities. So I did!

However, we ended up getting a house (government subsidized, and he had already chosen it before asking me to move in) way out in the country. There is absolutely no public transportation here and I cannot legally drive. I was searching for work but jobs that I was qualified for were at the other end of the country and just completely inaccessible. My bf assured me it was no problem, he could afford to support me while I finished university, and then we'd go from there.

Well, time has passed, I hate where we live and it makes me depressed. It has been years and I still have no friends. Our town is under 5000 people and it's just miserable. During this time we've gone to the US to visit my family for various occasions and it really made me homesick. We discussed the idea of moving to the US and he seemed really on board with it, especially after hearing how much money we'll make and experiencing the super cheap prices.

So a few months ago we decided to move to America. We were originally going to see about getting work in Germany first so I could get some more experience (the gaming industry is really hard to break into, but I'm more marketable in Europe because I speak 3 major European languages), but he said that he just wanted to do it. He likes America, he likes Wendy's (lol), and it's a better choice for us. Our dog will have plenty of room to run around, dog parks, and it's cheaper.

We were just waiting for me to graduate so we could start making preparations and.. it's happened! I graduated a few weeks ago and I'm super happy! However, like most Americans, I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. My parents are helping as much as they can, but my mom owns a small business in real estate which isn't doing too well, and my dad has a terrible habit of giving all their extra money to my drug addicted 40-year-old half sister (that's an entirely different story). So, there's not much they can do. My bf has known from before we got together about my loans and that I need to pay them back.

Well last night I was talking with my dad and trying to decide which repayment plan is best. I have roughly $90,000 in loans split between government and private. They give pretty rigid repayment methods and I'm looking at a monthly payment of either $540 (over 25 years) or $970 (over 10). I really would prefer to pay over 10 years since I would eventually like to own a house and don't want to end up paying $40,000 extra in interest because of the 25 year payment plan. If I get a job in the US I'm going to be able to do the nine hundred something per month payment because the income there is just that good.

However, it seems like my bf just doesn't understand. Lately he has seemed to be dragging his feet about moving to the US and seems less and less interested. We've discussed his disinterest numerous times and he assures me he's interested but ""when you moved here I did all the research, so now that we're moving to your country, it's on you"". Which I understand, but I've done all the research. I know his best chances of getting a visa are either through work sponsorship or marriage. Marriage is our last resort sort of thing because I don't know if I can support him while the visa is processed and pay off my loans at the same time.

I've researched jobs and companies that are willing to sponsor foreigners for visas, but he just makes up excuses every time I try to get him to look. It's getting a little frustrating.

His father also bought him a car for Christmas. He's very well off (I mean, seriously, the man drives a Maserati) and my bf's car was from the 80s and needed an upgrade, so he bought him a car. Super generous.. except pretty poorly timed. I did some research and transporting a car from the EU to the US is SUPER expensive and a pain in the ass. My bf assured me it would be no problem and we could sell it if we had to.

Because I have no job here and no income we have no savings. Moving us and our dog to the US is likely going to cost somewhere around $6000 including plane tickets and shipping of some household items (we both have relatively new gaming PCs, I have a plethora of expensive kitchen items, clothes, etc.). This is completely taking into account selling our furniture and appliances, since they won't even work in the US.

So now onto the big issue we had last night. I have anxiety. I worry too much about little things, but I'm diagnosed. I have therapy and I'm getting better. But my debt makes me feel nauseous. It makes me feel like I have this insurmountable obstacle and that I'm going to be crushed by it. He thinks I'm overreacting.

He suddenly started to think that we can get by if we stay in Europe. I keep telling him that's impossible. Salaries are much lower here because no one has student loan debt. And taxes are much higher to make sure that's the case. For the jobs I've interviewed with in my field here I'm looking at roughly $1900 per month after taxes. Take away half of that for my student loans and I haven't even covered health insurance (which you do have to pay for where we live), rent, food, utilities, transportation to work, etc. I'm literally unable to survive here.

He thinks that's wrong. He thinks that salaries cannot possibly be as high in the US as I'm saying they are. He keeps asking me what minimum wage is in the US and doesn't understand when I tell him that I won't be making minimum wage at a salary based job. He thinks that we can still make it work on his income and mine. Because he's fully supporting me now, we can make it work with my minimum wage job.

But that's not how I want to live. I don't want to just get by. We will literally have no more savings. His government gives him money every month to help pay for my cost of living (they pay 70% of my insurance, which is quite expensive). If I get a job that money is gone. So from my $1900 we can subtract the loans, which is roughly $1000, my health insurance will be another $250, and then transportation costs to work, if we were to stay here, would be about $200 per month. Not to mention the increased groceries from me making lunch (food is very expensive here), and everything else that comes with it (our health insurance only kicks in after you spend a few hundred euro a year, so if I get sick I pay out of pocket).

I'll never be able to visit my family, do anything fun, or go out at all. We'll still be living paycheck to paycheck, and that's just not how I want to live.

I just don't know what to do. How do I explain to him how serious my loans are? He thinks that if I miss a payment it's no big deal. My parents cosigned this for me, so if I cannot pay the loan company will come after them. He still thinks it's no big deal and that I'm over worrying things.

Has anyone had any experience explaining the importance of loans to a foreigner?

I'm sorry if this isn't even the right place to post it. I wasn't sure if there was some finance subreddit that I should ask instead. But I feel like there are more issues than finances at stake. I don't want to lose a great relationship with a man I can see myself with for the rest of my life because I cannot explain student loans to him.

**TL;DR: I cannot find work in the country I live in with my bf (his home country). I graduated from college at the beginning of January and am in serious student loan debt. He doesn't understand just how much I need to pay off (nearly $1000 per month). Salaries in Europe are too low and I need to move back to America to find good paying work. He thinks I'm overreacting and that we'll be fine. Don't know how to explain to him that this is really serious and defaulting even for just a month could ruin my life and my parents' (co-signers) lives.**"
2sie39,8,2015-01-15,Trying to divine if I [24/F] should let my grey area best friendship [24/M] go or buckle down and fight for it.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sie39/trying_to_divine_if_i_24f_should_let_my_grey_area/,"Typically when I tell this story I crack my knuckles and tell the audience to settle in. So here we go, I am going to try and abbreviate this as much as possible because, I don't know you- but I respect your time is precious.
One day my Russian co-worker comes into my office and drops a CV off on my desk and explains he is a friend of her husband's friend and to hire him as an intern. So I do, I sit through a Skype interview and do my nails as this kid babbles on about his interest in international development. Half an hour after he was done I put the request for his hire through. It completely slipped my mind and then three weeks later this tall, beautiful boy in pressed suit comes into my office and is introduced to me as Jim, my new intern.
Yeah, of course I blanked on this, and then it all made sense. I explained to HR in front of the new kid that this was someone else's intern and I had just interviewed him. HR insisted that they were correct. I was expecting another intern in a week so I thought I would keep him busy and far away and then when my intern came- I would hope someone else would snatch him up.
Jim was beautiful, he was Italian and Swedish, tall and had the very slightest Nordic accent. All the other Associates chided me saying that they knew exactly why I hired him. I did know however that the largely female population of interns were going to eat him alive. This kid, who was stereotypically hot- which was more than enough reason for me to despises him seemed very sweet and genuine- and somewhere in my cold back speck of a heart I felt bad for all the busy work I was giving him.
As time wore on it became clear he and I would be working together. I was mostly okay with that. I did resent the multiple times an hour he would come into my office to ask seemingly pointless questions. We had a slow and easy friendship. He learned my quirks (I have a shit ton), and he seemed to account for them in work and public events. I liked the kid.
The office where we worked was something like a battleground- co-workers were friends in arms and happy hours were insanely necessary. Interns and Associates alike mingled and drank- eventually I was outside with him smoking a cigarette. Outside he told me that he used to be a drug dealer before he came here and recounted the violent things he did. His face seemed genuinely upset. I started to see my mild mannered intern in a different light.
Another company tradition was the sangria night where we said goodbye to co-workers with endless sangria and guacamole. Needless to say this particular night everyone got hammered. He and I went outside for a much needed smoke and as we sat there he told me that he had been having an ongoing affair with a member of the table who had a boyfriend. I just shook my head and agreed that he had quite a problem on his hands. Then he turned the conversation and told me that we would sleep together as often as I wanted and there would be no strings attached. He talked about it like it was a done deal. I doubled over laughing and declined- he followed me back into the restaurant insisting I change my mind. Spoiler- I didn't sleep with my intern.
The next day it was revealed to me that while I had turned down his advances he had found a home for his lust with another co-worker. I then understood who my intern really was and I found it super amusing. He led a life I could never ever imagine but I thought it was cool in theory. So I listened to his adventures in lust. One day he came into my office and insisted that tonight the coworker who had a boyfriend, Kim was coming over to get her things and then he was done sleeping with her. I retorted that there was no reason at all for her to come over as they would most likely sleep together- he fervently denied and promised to call when she left to prove it.
At 3 AM I woke up and saw that I had 14 missed calls and two progressively louder sobbing messages on my machine. Jim insisted that I call immediately. So I called right away. He apologized right off the bat and insisted that I check my company e-mail. I did and saw that Kim's boyfriend had found out and had chosen to e-mail the whole entire home office all the details of the affair. Needless to say that the mood in the office was incredibly tense and Jim knew he could no longer be visibly friends with any women in the office.
Our friendship grew in secret though- and I also did not want people to know how close we had gotten. We quickly did ""Little Saturdays"" (drinking like it was Saturday on Wednesday), laid in the pool area of the near by hotel, once we fell asleep in front of the Washington Monument- we shared an incredibly large amount of fun together and quickly were together every weekend.
WE-were-just-friends
Of course, he was BEAUTIFUL I thought so too- but I knew that Jim was troubled-he was a sex addict- sleeping with anyone he possibly could; not even because he wanted to because he felt he had to. This included some of my friends which caused bitter fights between us. Refer above- I knew that I didn't love him but there was just something weird about my friends being on a level of intimacy with Jim that I was not. I don't know it- was weird.
Around this time though I received news I had been waiting for, for a while. I had been accepted into a graduate program in London and I was going to leave in a few months. I'll be completely honest one of the hardest things to leave was Jim. He was the relationship I loved- I had all the emotional intimacy that I could ever want and I did not need to worry about monogamy- I would never have it. I felt this weird superiority to the women he slept with. They were things he could throw away, but he told me that he couldn't sleep with me out of fear that it would ruin our friendship.
I left the morning after our last hurrah- we went out in true fashion and drank till we couldn't anymore. Grabbed champagne and passed out in a hotel together. We woke up very late- both of us missing important events in favor of not getting out of bed. Until the time came and we had to face the fact that we had to leave each other. I hugged him tearfully and watched him leave.
The next day I flew out. He had given me a journal so I could write the script of our friendship movie and I had given him a lighter with a favorite quote of ours on it. I wrote in that journal obsessively as I arrived, everything I was afraid of i told the journal- every first day- every class. Until I realized I should send it to him to write back.
December hit and Jim was coming to visit for a week and I could not be more excited. We had kept in touch via Skype. I skipped to the airport to pick him up and brought him home with me for hangovers, boozing and revelry. It was like old times. Jim briefly left to visit Sweden and came back for a day. I planned the whole day out to the T. We ended the night in a panoramic sky bar above London, where we kept throwing back absinthe martins. I started to realized that he was trying to get me drunk. I paused and asked him what was going on. He put down his glass and looked me in the eye and told me he was sleeping with Kim again.
A this point I lowered my head and I started to laugh- I turned to him my dear sweet Jim, who we had both mutually swore off relationships ever in our lives, I said you must love her. He immediately jumped back and said absolutely not. He confessed she had feelings for him and he had told her it was not mutual. But she was still running when he called and he was in the process of convincing her to engage in a threesome.
I was drunk sure, but hot tears came to my eyes and I told him he was being so cruel. No girl deserves to be treated like this. I know she knew what was happening to her and still accepted it, but it simply wasn't fair. We were BEST FRIENDS- I was not going to let my BEST FRIEND treat someone (who I did not even like), the way he was. I railed into him telling him I knew he was better than that and I was going to hold him to a higher standard, sorry.
The conversation petered out as we realized there was nothing more to say. I had shocked him into silence and we rode home on the bus with promise to talk further. Once back at my place I told him I thought we were both tired and suggested we go to bed.
The next day we flew back home and went our separate ways for Christmas to be reunited at New Years. I of course missed him- he was my bud and he had been my constant for the past week. So I looked forward to NYE where we were going to meet mutual friends for dinner. I drove down at top speeds looking forward to everything.
Once in the restaurant I saw Jim and immediately realized he was drunk. At the table he was feeling his nipples and talking about how sexy he was and how he wished he could have sex with himself.
Pause- the Jim I knew in London was raw and emotional. I know I couldn't expect that again- but not this. I constantly asked him to please stop and that's really the only way I have to do that. Like a dog growling. He wouldn't stop so I went to the bathroom to cool down. I came back and tried to regear the conversation. Instead he brought it right back around to Kim showing naked pictures of her. I became incensed and asked him to please stop right now. He refused and brought up out conversation in London as if it was a joke and made fun of me for crying.
I snapped.
Being nice was far from over. I snapped and lashed out using words that I knew would sting his fragile ego. I left that night and sent him a variety of messages saying we owed our friends an apology for our fight in the middle of their dinner.
I heard nothing and the following days I was in town he cancelled every day. The final straw was when he cancelled on me for a party being held in my honor. I broke down sobbing- I was so hurt- I had done so much for him in London- this was it? My friend called him and he was guilted and he finally he came to the party. He came in went down stairs and didn't even say goodbye.
He finally decided to come to dinner one last time- he was mad at me for being mad at him and insisted that I was the one who ruined the dinner, not he. It was civil peace until he decided after a bottle of wine to bring up our problem within a group of people. I asked him to stop several times and lashed back, I wasn't ready to discuss it and didn't want to share it with the whole group. He insisted and it spiraled out of control. We let all of our problems with each other out and in half an hour time we both stormed out in tears.
The next day I felt like I had broken up with him. I thought back on what he said- ""I clearly care about you, I have never left you to go sleep with someone else"". That was kind of it. Did I want a best friend where that was how his love was?
There was a time in my life where i needed Jim and I needed to party till 6 AM and try new things. But I wasn't sure if I needed someone in my life who I gave so much to and never got a whole lot back. Sure, Jim cared for me in his own way. I don't doubt it- but I faced the fact that I may have outgrown him.
Jim has a deep plethora of problems he refuses to deal with and hides them with sex and alcohol. He would call to vent about his family and friend issues and I always listened. I was where he was and I needed that friend. Now I think I may not need that kind of relationship.
We talked for a second agreeing we needed to talk again and alcohol fueled everything. Now I am back in London and we haven't talked for over a week.

Do I try and fix this?

So, my girlfriend is working on her PhD in Psychology and her dissertation requires her to use SAS.  I am working on my PhD in Computer Science so I'm well versed in virtualization, computing and mathematics, however I've never used SAS, so I wasn't sure if what I want to do is possible.  I did, however, read a good deal of the Little SAS Book last night, so I'm confident I can at least install it.  

Her lab uses SAS 9.2 and its only installed on one computer so she has go into the university at night (she's in the middle of a clinical internship) to do her dissertation work. I decided to help her out by putting the free university version on her laptop (MacBook Air) so she can work from anywhere.  

The only question I have is, will the SAS programs she writes (and the datasets she produces,etc.) on the new free University version be compatible with SAS 9.2 running on her lab's windows machine?

Also, any advice or insight would be appreciated."

2sjry4,9,2015-01-15,I [17F] don't want to spend time with my mom [56F].,baddaughter1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sjry4/i_17f_dont_want_to_spend_time_with_my_mom_56f/,"Long TL;DR: I don't have a lot of freetime, and I would rather spend that freetime with my boyfriend than my mom.

My parents are divorced, and I was raised by my mom. My mom is a good person in a lot of ways, she's very smart and driven. She’s the VP of marketing for a massive company, so she works a lot. She usually gets home around 8ish because of her commute. She's not a bad person, she’s just never really been the mom that baked cookies and fixed boo-boos. It's just not her thing.

She’s always pushed me academically and I’m a very good student. I have one of the highest GPAs in our grade, and I do a ton of extracurriculars as well. 

Weekdays I have 6am practice, 8am-1pm school, and then an internship from 1pm-7pm on Monday and Wednesday. And that’s not to mention college applications, SAT prep, and the fact that 4/5 of my classes are APs. There's always a few different extracurricular events on weekends, and weekends are generally kind of a mess scheduling-wise.

I have to go to bed at 9:30 if I want 8 hours of sleep, which leaves me only 1.5 hours to spend with her.

Like I said, she pushes me pretty hard academically, so it's not my fault I don't have much free time. I like being busy, but it does mean my schedule is really tight.

We’ve gone through phases where we’ve tried to carve out more time together but I feel like something always gets in the way.

I would try to get her to spend more time with me when I was younger and sometimes it would work for a short time, but sometimes she gets kind of sensitive and will go off about how her job is the reason I have a phone and nice clothes. And I get that, but I don't think it's ungrateful to want to spend more time with her.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year, and I’m good friends with his parents and his sisters. I pretty much always go over to their house on the afternoons I don't have my internship. Usually I do homework during the week, but there's one afternoon (thursday) where I pretend like homework doesn't exist. I basically just relax for the whole afternoon, and it's literally my favorite part of the week. I call them lazy Thursdays but he gets fake-offended and calls them productive Thursdays haha.

My mom is going through a phase where she really wants to spend more time with me. I think it’s because she realizes I’m going off to college soon. She doesn't work weekends, but she'll ""work remotely"" all the time. But sometimes she'll just like appear at my door and want to spend time with me. If I say I have too much to do she normally lets it go but lately she will point out that I could have done it Thursday if I hadn't gone to my BF's house and that I need to learn to ""use my time wisely.""

Obviously I'm apologetic/regretful when I turn her down, the truth is that given the choice between: 

a) spend Thursday afternoon watching TV with my boyfriend and decorating cookies with his mom and Sunday afternoon working on homework and 

b) spend Thurs afternoon working on homework and Sun afternoon getting my nails done while my mom sits in the next chair and spends the entire time responding to email on her phone, I’m kind of going to choose Option A.

I keep expecting her to ban me from going to his house during the week. Just the thought stresses me out, but I keep telling myself that I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

This going to sound harsh, but to be honest I’m pretty busy and I don’t have time to make my mom feel less guilty by doing feel-good mommy-daughter stuff. And maybe I resent her a little for thinking she can just show up and I will suddenly shift my whole weekend around so that I can spend time with her.

TL;DR: I don’t get very much free time due to school pressures and extracurriculars. I would rather spend my small amount of free time at my boyfriend’s than with my mom."
2sjxm7,3,2015-01-15,Some help with delayed sleep? Went to bed at 7 am and my sleeping schedule is pretty fucked.,Elvira333,insomnia,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/2sjxm7/some_help_with_delayed_sleep_went_to_bed_at_7_am/,"Hi everyone. I never have problem staying asleep but I do have problems getting to sleep. I realize that there are a lot of things that I should do to reduce my insomnia: stop using the computer in bed (blue light), start working out, write anxious thoughts down and vow to deal with them in the morning instead of tossing and turning! I am on break right now and my sleeping schedule has gotten messed up due to poor sleep hygiene. This has happened countless times before. I know what to do in the future to create better sleep habits, but what do I do now? 

When I'm at home, I can't force myself to wake up with little sleep. I always end up going back to bed if I try to sleep 3 hours, 4.5 hours, etc. I have thought of scheduling an outing with friends so that I *have* to get up, but I don't want to drive sleep deprived. (Years ago I got into an accident precisely because of that). Today I went to bed at 7:00 a.m and tried to take a nap until 10:00 a.m. to not mess up my sleeping schedule, but I woke up at almost 3:00. 

My messed up sleeping schedule leaves me feeling pretty depressed, because it gets dark at around 4-5 p.m. here, and I see very little sunlight during the day. Also feeling like I'm not on the same schedule as 'normal life' makes me feel isolated and will become a problem when I start my internship. 

I get a lot of anxiety around sleep because I don't want to be tossing and turning all night. I think that I wait until I'm absolutely *exhausted* to go to bed so that I know I won't be lying awake. Of course, this causes problems and conditions my body not to sleep until I absolutely need to, which isn't good. 

So what do I do now? Pulling an all nighter hasn't seemed to work because I can never stay up. Should I just take some melatonin at midnight and try to sleep? Or get up at my target time (8 a.m. no matter what?). Or spend like two hours on the elliptical to try to tire myself out? 

**Woke up at 3 p.m. Want to go to bed at 12 and wake up at 8. How do I do this?**"
2sk19w,1062,2015-01-15,I[25m] think I am falling in love with my best friend[25f] who was a victim of an acid attack,acidgirlhelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sk19w/i25m_think_i_am_falling_in_love_with_my_best/,"My family and I are from India, growing up my parents wanted us to have a better life so they immigrated to the USA when I was just a little kid. Every couple years though my family would go back to visit family and friends. 

At my grandmother’s house there was this girl I was particularly close friends named Swati (Fake name). Swati and her brother and I would hang out all of the time, we would build forts together, play Holi with new water guns that I would bring back from America. As I got older, I would visit India less and less frequently, summer breaks were filled with internships, and classes.

 My friend Swati grew up to be a beautiful woman, which made her the target for a lot of unwanted attention. There was a Muslim kid in her class that wanted to date her, however my family are all Hindu. She told him no, and when he persisted her parents complained to the school. 

That kid got angry one day and when she was coming home from school, he and his cousins attacked her throwing some caustic chemicals on her. She was in critical condition for a long time, her face was completely deformed, she lost her eye sight in one eye. She can barely smell anything anymore, and has been dealing with all of the emotional trauma that came with it. 

After the incident, my family went to visit India, I saw her and from there I just got very protective with her. Of the days we spent in India, I elected to spend the entire time with her and her family. When I came back to America, me and Swati would communicate all the time, texting over Whatsapp, Skyping when her internet was good. 

Over time, many of the people whom went to support her, stopped caring about her. Her own brother got married, and moved away, and they talk less than once a week. Her friends have also all moved on with their lives, she now just lives with her parents and works a small job. 

Over the past two years I have gotten to know her better than any other person I have ever known. I had to move to another city for my work so I don’t have many friends here. So when I come back from work, I spend a majority of the time talking to her. Even when I do make time to hang out with some people, those interactions with them feels all so shallow. Like I am doing it just so I can feel like I checked off my “social interaction” for the week. With the rest of the world it feels like I am coasting on by with life, that I maneuver my way around a sea of robots, to come home to talk to the only other real person I know. And it’s not like the conversations we have are deep either, we just talk about the small parts of our day, just stupid pointless things, but it feels so good sharing them with her.  

What I am starting to realize is that life for me has stagnated since I became close with Swati. My days are just spent earning money at work that I will never spend. All the passion and energy I have in my life I have dedicated to her. Most of the people that I was close to now think of me as some hermit. 

And now I realize that I do need to do something. I often day dream at the idea of bringing her back from India, and living together here. But I don’t know if this is really genuine love. My friend Swati, accepts that her life is pretty much over in that no man will ever want to marry her. 

We have had earnest talks about her situation before, she says she doesn’t want to hold me back from getting married and starting a family. She says it will be the saddest and happiest day for her. Sad because she knows we will talk a lot less, but happy because she says she knows I will be happy.  

I desperately, desperately, want to. I want to be the guy that makes her life great and amazing, that her life didn’t end because of the acid attack. The thing is I don’t genuinely know if I love her, I don’t really know how to describe my feelings toward her. If I had to describe it, most of the time I just want to hold her and squeeze her tightly. 

I am confused about what to do in my situation. I don’t have any real close friends that I can really talk to them about so I am coming to you. I will try to answer questions as best as I can, and if you need me to clarify anything just ask. 

**tl;dr – old friend from India was a victim of an acid attack. We have now become best friends, however I know that our relationship as is, can’t keep going on. I want to marry her however I don’t know how I feel about her.**

How would you proceed if you were me?,hopefulwrongsrighted,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2skjzh/i_am_a_23_yo_engineering_student_with_a_rough/,"**tl;dr**: I have two convictions (one criminal), bad credit from unpaid traffic tickets, and a suspended license (read: unpaid tickets).  I have begun to turn my life around by selecting a practical, challenging major, working hard in school, and vowing to live as an honest man for the rest of my life.  I need suggestions on how to proceed with getting an internship, job, apartment, license, despite these things in a few years.

Hey guys,

I hope this is an appropriate place to start a thread like this.  I could use some guidance and reassurance.  Sorry in advance for the long post -- I've attached a tl;dr at the top for convenience.

To keep things concise, here are some quick facts about where I am right now in life:  

-----------------------------THE GOOD--------------------------------

I am a 23 year old CC student.  I have a 3.5 GPA and am currently taking Calc II, Phys I, and a mid-level course in C++.  I'll be transferring to a four year in Fall 2016, after I finish my physics coursework -- I will most likely be applying for computer engineering.  I'll likely be going to one of the University of California campuses.

--------------------------- THE BAD ----------------------


I was something of a bad kid when I was younger -- my license was suspended when I was 20 for unpaid tickets, of which I had acquired a significant number.  As I am currently a waiter, my money goes to rent and food and I have not had any extra cash to spare toward alleviating the damage done there.

I have been arrested twice.  The first arrest was for petty theft at the age of 19, for which I was given an 'infraction' (in the state of CA, the seriousness of an infraction is comparable to the seriousness of running a stop sign).

The second time I was arrested was at 21 and for petty theft again, but the DA made a deal with me and I agreed to instead plead guilty to a 'disturbing the peace' misdemeanor charge if I promised to clean up my act.  Between the misdemeanor and infraction charge, only the misdemeanor count is regarded as a criminal conviction.

--------------------THE UNCERTAIN---------------------

Well, clean up my act, I did.  I'll spare you most of the details, but I got a job and was able to go from living out of my car to renting a room in a nearby apartment.  I re-enrolled in college and signed up for remedial math classes, working my way up to integral calc (where I am now).  I like to code and have been getting straight A's in my CS classes.

The amount that I owe for my tickets and suspended license is probably in the many thousands.  Rather then work full time for x years as a waiter to afford these costs while putting my life on hold and watching my friends sail by on their way to success, I figured it would be better to graduate and get a decent paying job, at which point I would be able to pay what I owe and regain my driving privileges.

Although I consider the hardest part to have been making the decision to turn my life around and invest the effort, I am becoming increasingly awake to and paranoid of the considerable challenges that lurk ahead.

Reddit, if you were in my shoes, how would you proceed with regards to searching for internships/jobs/apartments while acknowledging that pesky 'disturbing the peace' misdemeanor, the bad credit from the many still unpaid tickets, and my disadvantageous older age? 

Upon graduating, I would feel flexible about employment in computer engineering/programming/software engineering. "

I'll try not to make this too long, but there's quite a bit of info I need to share.

My girlfriend and I moved here not too long ago and live in uptown. Everything has been awesome and we love it and then life took a quick turn. Our dog Bandit got into an altercation with another dog outside of our apartment complex. In the chaos of everything, while my girlfriend and the other dog owner were trying to break it up, they both got bitten by the dogs. Bandit got taken to animal control and remained there for almost 30 days. We got served with a notice of destruction. Bandit has never been in any sort of altercation with any dog before this, nor has she ever shown any aggression towards humans. We hired a lawyer, fought it, and won. We got her back home (yay!), but she now is considered a ""dangerous dog"". We were okay with that ruling, much better than having her be put down. We have taken all the proper steps to follow the new rules--getting her a muzzle, three foot leash and hiring a trainer to work with us and her to rehabilitate her and help her get over her anxiety/aggression towards dogs. So everything seems great. 

Today we get a call from our landlord telling us that our lease states no dangerous or aggressive dogs can live in the building. Understandable and I was afraid this was going to happen but we fought so hard to get her back to us I was hoping maybe life would smile on us for just a little longer. Our lawyer talked them into letting us have until Sunday to figure something out for Bandit.

So basically here are our problems:

-We don't know anyone back home in Des Moines without a dog that can take Bandit temporarily while we try and find a new place to live. 
-If we move out, we have to pay four months rent to break our lease which would essentially cost us $7,000 (and not considering we would have to make a deposit and rent on a new place)
-We have two dogs, and now one of them is registered as dangerous which will make finding a new place nearly impossible, especially in short notice. 
-We both are very low on money as my partner's job is basically an internship and I was unemployed the first month I lived here and had to pay our bills with what I had saved up (which is now almost gone).
-Bandit has to be out of our apartment by Sunday.
-We also have practically no friends up here, and the only few that we do all have dogs already so they can't take Bandit.
-Most dog rescue programs won't accept a dog that has been declared dangerous, especially one that was scheduled to be put down.

Does anyone have any advice or know anyone who has dealt with a situation like this? We really don't want to give Bandit up, but in my opinion (not so much my partners) the best option would be to try and find a foster family that can give her the attention she needs and restart her life. But in the meantime, we are desperately trying to at least find a temporary fix for her until we can get our shit together after this mess. Are there any dog rescues that accept 'dangerous' dogs? Or does anyone know of any foster programs I could contact and talk to about my situation and get some advice? The last thing I want is to lose our dog, but if we can't find at least temporary fix until we can move, she'll be back in animal control and I can't bear the thought of her being stuck there again. I know she'll just sit there for a few weeks before they put her down.

I know I'll probably get a lot of angry responses for this post about being a bad dog owner and I understand if it seems like I'm trying to take some easy way out by pushing her onto someone else but really I'm not. Bandit has always been a great dog and this all happened out of the blue, I've never had anything like this happen before and I feel lost and hopeless. I'm in a city that I'm completely unfamiliar with and I have 2.5 days to find a new apartment or a foster home for my dog. 

Any advice on the situation is greatly appreciated.
And if there's a better or different sub to post this on as well, please let me know. Thank you.

Anyways this distance the break up was kind of easy for her and I knew i would get a shot back somehow. I knew I would get another shot if i made it to her city for a longer time because she has always told me how much influence I had on her with my physical presence and my voice.

So here I am now having an Internship in her City to get her back. we went for a coffee last week and first thing she says was ""you still smell so good"" later ""sweater looks beautiful""....she linked her arm into mine while we were walking and we looked us deep in the eyes for several times. she texted me ""really enjoyed my morning with you, was a pleasure to see you""

all i would like to do right now is get to her place and tell her how much i love her. but i can't do it, need to wait and the wait is killing and at the same time.

Our lawyer talked them into letting us have until Sunday to figure something out for Bandit.

So basically here are our problems:

-We don't know anyone back home in Des Moines without a dog that can take Bandit temporarily while we try and find a new place to live. 
-If we move out, we have to pay four months rent to break our lease which would essentially cost us $7,000 (and not considering we would have to make a deposit and rent on a new place)
-We have two dogs, and now one of them is registered as dangerous which will make finding a new place nearly impossible, especially in short notice. 
-We both are very low on money as my partner's job is basically an internship and I was unemployed the first month I lived here and had to pay our bills with what I had saved up (which is now almost gone).
-Bandit has to be out of our apartment by Sunday.
-We also have practically no friends up here, and the only few that we do all have dogs already so they can't take Bandit.
-Most dog rescue programs won't accept a dog that has been declared dangerous, especially one that was scheduled to be put down.

Does anyone have any advice or know anyone who has dealt with a situation like this? We really don't want to give Bandit up, but in my opinion (not so much my partners) the best option would be to try and find a foster family that can give her the attention she needs and restart her life. But in the meantime, we are desperately trying to at least find a temporary fix for her until we can get our shit together after this mess. Are there any dog rescues that accept 'dangerous' dogs? Or does anyone know of any foster programs I could contact and talk to about my situation and get some advice? I know a lot of you aren't from Minneapolis, but even neighboring states or I don't know. Any advice on any part of this. The last thing I want is to lose our dog, but if we can't find at least temporary fix until we can move, she'll be back in animal control and I can't bear the thought of her being stuck there again. I know she'll just sit there for a few weeks before they put her down.

I know I'll probably get a lot of angry responses for this post about being a bad dog owner and I understand if it seems like I'm trying to take some easy way out by pushing her onto someone else but really I'm not. Bandit has always been a great dog and this all happened out of the blue, I've never had anything like this happen before and I feel lost and hopeless. I'm in a city that I'm completely unfamiliar with and I have 2.5 days to find a new apartment or a foster home for my dog. 

Any advice on the situation is greatly appreciated.
And if there's a better or different sub to post this on as well, please let me know. Thank you.

2slofu,1,2015-01-16,Need to complain for a bit. The New Year hasn't been off to a good start for me.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2slofu/need_to_complain_for_a_bit_the_new_year_hasnt/,"I want to purge some emotions ive been keeping inside the past few weeks, maybe i'll feel a bit better. This is going to be a wall of text that I don't expect people to actually read. But if for some reason you do, thanks. It means a lot. So, where to begin. 

Some background: I'm a 20 yr old college student, female, have social anxiety disorder and depression. Currently on winter break (dec. 19th - jan. 25th). 

I'm the type of person that internalizes my feelings and everything builds and build until I break down. I also get sick extremely easily because the stress fucks with my immune system. So the day after all my finals were done, Dec. 20th, I woke up with strep throat and an ear infection. Fun stuff. Luckily I went to the doctor right away because I'm prone to ear infections and knew I had one as soon as I woke up (found out about the strep a few days later, but luckily I was already on antibiotics for my ear). 

So anyway, that Monday I was supposed to start a seasonal job at Macy's. I was so proud of myself for getting this job. It was via phone interview, which freaked me out more than a face to face interview. I have a weird phobia of talking on the phone. So I feel like absolute shit but the fevers had finally went away and I had been on antibiotics for 48 hours by then, so I pushed myself to go to the training. I show up nervous but excited to start. As a college student I really need the extra money. They have no trace of me in their system. There ""must have been some sort of miscommunication."" I received confirmation emails, the call was absolutely legit, so I have no clue what went wrong on their end. I could barely even speak because of the strep throat so I just said it's okay and left. It felt surreal. Normally something like this would trigger a panic attack but I was just so shocked that I felt numb. It was humiliating. I was looking forward to getting out if the house, putting myself out of my comfort zone by socializing with strangers, maybe building some confidence. But that was all gone. 

I tried to turn around this negativity by visiting my brother who lives 3 hours away. I stayed there the 28th - 2nd. I pushed myself and went to a museum by myself, but I just felt anxious and uncomfortable the whole time. I couldn't shake that feeling that I was being judged by all these strangers even though I knew logically no one was giving me a second thought. So I got back home 2 weeks ago and I haven't done any socializing, besides with my parents. 

So now here I am. January 16th. School starts in 10 days. I'm going to have a new roommate because my previous one had to commute for financial reasons. Every time I start to think about it I get anxious and immediately force myself to stop thinking about it. I'm nervous about new teachers, new classmates, my new roommate.. I have basically zero friends at home and only a handful at school. I've lost nearly every friend I've ever made throughout the years because of my anxiety and depression. We have great times and lots of fun, but then I'll fall back into depression for whatever reason and they view it as me pulling away, so they do the same. I haven't spoken to my best friend in months. I have no clue why, but it must be my fault because I'm horrible at keeping in contact with people so they just give up on me. I've lost the close friends I've made at college. They basically hated me up until a few months ago when I gained the courage to confront them and ask what happened to our friendship. Of course it was because I ""pulled away."" How could I have thought their reason would have been any different? It's always the same reason. Even my current best friend.. I can feel our friendship diminishing. We only talk about class and school clubs, there's no depth. It all happens so fast. One day we're as close as sisters, then all of a sudden we're like strangers. 

I can honestly say I've never felt so alone in my life. Its so fucking frustrating because I've come so damn far. I've had jobs and an internship and lived away from home. That shit is fucking HARD when you have anxiety, but I did it and then some. I don't want to throw that all away. 

Part of me wants to become a commuter and just go to school and come home, and give up all my extracurriculars. But I know if I did that things would only get so, so much worse. Its just so hard. Overcoming obstacles only to be rewarded with bigger ones. 

I know things could be so much worse, and I really am grateful for my life. But sometimes I wish I were stronger, because all these little issues add up and really drag me down. 

Oh, and in case anyones wondering, I go to therapy and see a psychiatrist. Although its extremely hard for me to express my feelings in therapy because of the anxiety. And I take medication for it, 200mg Zoloft and 1mg or more of Xanax for when I'm feeling particularly anxious or have a panic attack. 

I keep telling myself things will get better, and they do. But then shit happens and I feel worse than ever. 

Eh I'm done ranting/complaining. Had to let it out, even if online rather than irl. I know i'll get passed this, but for now im just really bummed out.

2slszt,2,2015-01-16,My life is a movie. Need to vent.,Condhor,Needafriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/2slszt/my_life_is_a_movie_need_to_vent/,"So, I used to work at a summer camp. I graduated from uni in 2013, and the summer afterwards I worked an internship at the same camp I worked at the previous summer. My job was an Infirmary Coordinator. I was a position below programming staff on the totem pole. 

I also met and dated a girl at the camp. She was the business manager , a position on par with programming staff. It's important, because our status meant we spent a lot of time together working. I had to contact lots of parents and work in the office a lot of the week during the summer, so we spent tons of time talking and joking and that's how things started off. Regardless, she was the first love of my life. I'm ""abstinent"" by choice, aside from doing some things with her that I regret. Never any oral or anything more than that, but we messed around physically. Considering she was the first real relationship aside from high school junk, I fell in love and I fell hard. And being physical with her made it all the more difficult. 

Now that's some of the backstory. We had insane chemistry which is why we got together. But things weren't meant to be and I understand that now. Two years ago, she broke up with me. That's not the point of this post, if you'll keep reading. When she dumped me, I cut all ties with everybody at camp. I wanted to go back, but I started paramedic school at a community college in my hometown (where the camp's located) and couldn't work anymore anyways. It was great to occupy my thoughts as I got through the breakup. I met a great friend at school, she was a second year when I was a first year and was about to graduate. The camp contacted me because they needed a replacement for me since I wouldn't be able to return. And, knowing how the ex and I met, I wasn't about to let a guy fill my place--I was still in love at that time unfortunately. So, this new friend that I met at school, also happened to be a lesbian. We literally had the same personalities, so we instantly kicked off an awesome friendship. I of course confided in her and she learned what type of person my ex was. (My ex dumped me through a text message, after a year long relationship, and then cut me off completely and refused to talk to me or meet up to settle things, it was horrible). It was great to have someone at school to talk to about stuff, and get a female opinion on stuff. KNowing her so well, and that she was competent and could fill my place well in the camp environment I pushed and got her hired in my place. I trained her and everything on site around my ex...

After two semesters, we head in to summer school. My school friend graduated that May and camp started, so I figured we would lose touch some with her not being able to text around the campers. I was ready for that. What I wasn't ready for was for my friend to completely befriend my ex and no longer talk to me. Everyone at camp (I was friends with all of the returning staff, and some of the new people even) thought it was weird that they connected so much. My ex, at some point, told me that she loved my friend because our personalities were so similar and that I did a great job in finding her. I didn't know how to take that; a compliment or what, so I shrugged it off. 

Today, after two years of not talking to my ex, I reconnected with a coworker who's now programming staff at the camp. My ex is still the Business Manager and my ex-friend got rehired at my school as a part time lab instructor. She won't talk to me. I found it odd. Anyways, my programming staff friend told me that my ex and my school friend are now dating. Not just hanging out, but like, screwing. 

I can't make this up. It only happens in sitcoms and weird books. I need someone to talk to. I've talked to some friends already, and I know no one can really say anything. But I seriously just had my ex claim that she's a lesbian now. I don't know if I feel betrayed, or lied to, or what, but I don't feel well. I need a random internet stranger to give some input, if you're willing. 

I didn't bother making an anon account, and my ex is still active on reddit, so if you find this: what you did is fucked up. Really not cool. 

**TL: DR:** Ex is apparently a lesbian now and is dating a lesbian I got hired to replace me in my old job. Just read the wall of text, it'll make more sense. "
2slul4,2,2015-01-16,Negotiation ... when you know a peer's salary,SpaceTongue,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2slul4/negotiation_when_you_know_a_peers_salary/,"So, I'm about to negotiate from a 3-month contract to a salaried position (software engineering).  A friend of mine with a very similar background - same school program and tech background; I have way more overall work experience but in an unrelated field (geology) - was hired about a month before me, also with a 3-month contract.  We got identical starting offers.

He told me ALL of the details of his negotiation, down to the offer he finally accepted.  Basically, they offered about a 20% raise from the intern/contract salary, plus benefits and all that.  He countered by asking for almost twice the intern salary.  They settled at about 150% (105k).

Based on our experience level I thought it was almost obscene that he asked for so much, and was floored at their final offer.  I would never have imagined asking for so much, for fear that they'd laugh me out the door.  In fact, part of me is nervous about negotiating at all, even knowing what he got away with.

So, how do I use this to my benefit?  There are some differences:

a) I'm on a different team - mine is more structured and relaxed.  Less stress = deserve less $?
b) I'm a woman, in a male-dominated industry.  Maybe relevant, maybe not.  In this case it might be - they interviewed me for 10 hours - 3x as much as they interviewed him before giving him the internship.  They also gave me a formal ""evaluation period"", which he didn't get.  I know that technically I'm just as good as he is, but the role they gave me isn't quite as well-respected.  In their defense I did kind of flub one interview question, but I felt like the hours of coding questions that I got right that they never asked him in the first place should have more than made up for that fact.
c) I know that I personally don't have the guts to ask for as much as he asked for.  I work longer hours, and have a more diverse array of projects.  But my work is more behind-the-scenes, and pays slightly less industry-wide.

I would still be happy with a bit less than what he's making, but now that I know his salary I feel like I can shoot for more than I was originally thinking.  

Their offer comes in on Tuesday.  I plan to ask for some time to think about it, unless it's exactly what they gave him.  But I have a feeling it'll be either about 10% less, or they'll offer me the same as they originally offered him and see how hard I negotiate.

Anyone have some good advice?  Pep talk?

Edit:  I should mention, I have no intention of telling my boss that I know my coworker's salary, I'm just wondering if there's a way to use it to my advantage.

Tl;dr - I have nearly identical skills as a coworker who just got an insane salary increase that he told me all about.  My negotiation is coming up on Tuesday.  How do I leverage the fact that I know exactly what he's making?"
2slv3b,0,2015-01-16,Help Me Adopt a Dog!,quesacocha,fundraiser,https://www.reddit.com/r/fundraiser/comments/2slv3b/help_me_adopt_a_dog/,"All of my life I have wanted a dog. I am a natural animal lover at heart. Since I was 10 years old I've begged my parents to get a dog, but each and every time I've been turned down because of many reasons. 5 years later, I am STILL trying convince my parents that I am ready for one. I have researched for months on the breed of Shiba Inu's and have become in love with them. I joined a forum, read all about them, and studied them more than anything else. On February 23rd I will be turning 16. I believe that NOW is the time that I can convince my parents that I am mature enough to raise a dog on my own. I have been doing everything in my power to raise money; babysitting 7 hours each day, doing graphic art online, and seeking internships just so I can reach my goal by February 6th, which is when my puppy is adoptable.

I reserved to adopt a puppy on February 6th, because it would be PERFECT and just in time for my birthday, and I haven't been any more ready for a dog in my life than ever before. The only problem is that I NEED to reach my goal by this date or else I will not be able to get the puppy. If I am unable to reach the goal by this time, I will have to wait even longer.

For this fundraiser, if you donate AT LEAST $1, I will do ANYTHING for you. Yes, that's right, ANYTHING, as long as it is not illegal and unorthodox.

If I reach my goal, I will send EVERY SINGLE DONATOR a personalized note (written by me!) to you with my new best friend beside it.

Please check out my indiegogo link here: https://life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/help-me-adopt-a-dog--2/x/9623194

Literally ANYTHING helps, from $1 to $100. I am truly grateful for anything. Thank you :)"

I got my phone in February 2014. I was super excited since it was my first phone. After 20 days I started noticing the LCD had little spots on it from the inside. My luck with electronics has always been horrible. I am a very OCD person and I take great care of my things. I started worrying. Meanwhile, Since I was a college student I started focusing on school and used my phone to scan documents. And voila, I found that my camera wouldn't focus. Every picture came out blurry. I took my phone to Best buy and they said its the 18th day, our return policy is 15 days only. They told me to send it to Samsung. Since I had my classes and I can't drive I needed a phone so I waited till August. I sent it in August and it came back after 20 days. I was relieved that the issue will be gone. But, everything was the same. They just changed the camera settings. And messed up the charging port somehow. So I spoke with them, they told me to send it again. Since classes start again in sept I Couldn't. I sent it again in Dec and got it back this month. The issue was still there. I was promised that they'll Fixit. My phone stopped working well and I'm about to start a job and can't drive. I spoke with them again, but they act like its not big deal. I expect customer care above all things. Also my phone used to get extremely hot just when I was charging it and not even using it. Given all this, samsung should have replaced my phone. But after so much disappointment, I think they would give me a refurbished phone to start the cycle all over again. I have been a loyal customer. But this just saddened me. Now I am at a point where my phone barely works and it's almost out of warranty. Samsung told me I should send it again. Instead of putting a customer through so much trouble why can't they just replace the phone? I spoke with them and they said that's not our policy. When I ask them to connect me to a manager they say that's not allowed. If I tell them to take my number and have a Manager call, that's also not policy. Next week my internship starts and my life is going to be so hard juggling between school an work. And Samsung doesn't care. Some of us buy a phone because we need it. It's not just a toy. They told me to send in the device that's not working but so far I haven't heard anything from them. They just put me on hold now.
Should I just give up and get a regular phone? Because right now I have lost hope. Kind of disappointed in smartphones and customer services."

So basically, i've been hired as a Social Media intern for a Digital Agency. They are your typical agency in the sense that they create websites, graphic designs, SEO etc etc. 

My task is to run the day to day operations of their Social Media profiles. That is Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. 

I just don't know where to start. If this goes well, they may offer me a permanent position. I want to create a good schedule which i can use to aid me in keeping all the profiles up to date and regularly updated with content.

Can you guys help me with brainstorming some ideas please.

2smcm4,7,2015-01-16,Creeping loss of excitement about my (26/m) relationship with my girlfriend (24/f) due to incompatibility issues,Taebak,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2smcm4/creeping_loss_of_excitement_about_my_26m/,"My girlfriend (24/f) and I (26/m) have been together for about a year. Before that, we had been relatively close friends for about two years. I like her and enjoy my time with her, and I appreciate her for the devotion and tolerance she brings to the relationship, regardless of my quirks. Nevertheless, I felt a profound lack of excitement about our relationship over the past two or three months. After some thinking, I see several issues at play here:

* A lack of common hobbies. I’m into sports, music and reading, but I was never able to evoke much interest for either one in her. At times, this becomes an issue. When I mention plans to go skiing or swimming with friends, she blames me for leaving her out – which I do as she can’t ski or swim and does not feel like taking classes (regardless of my encouraging her for a year). To concerts she sometimes tags along, but apparently more because of me than because of the music. At our last festival she therefore spent most of her time with her phone while I was having fun with friends. I tried to find the things she is into, but quite frankly I don’t think she has any hobbies beyond watching movies. When my mother reasonably asked me about my girlfriend’s hobbies, I came to the uncomfortable realization that I really can’t bring up much. Hence, we usually watch movies, eat dinner or end up in bed when we are something together.
* Different social preferences. I like hanging out in groups of friends, while she does not – which is totally fine with me. Yet we had two situations in the past year when some friends of mine unexpectedly joined us hanging out in a school cafeteria and a bar (whom I did not want to just send away). Both times she got angry at me for exposing her to this. Once, she just walked out on me in front of the others; the other time she made a point out of ignoring everyone else at the table. I told her I am sorry for these situations, but I don’t think she got how uncomfortable and embarrassed her behavior made me feel – especially because she did not even make an effort to socialize.
* Slack. While I feel terrible for saying this, I can’t help but admit to myself that I am loosing respect for her due to slack. She complains about not finding a job or internship, but instead of sending out applications, she manages to watch whole seasons of series in a day. The same is the case when it comes to hobbies: there seems to be hardly a way in which I could motivate her to try something new. On top of that, she has a terrible habit of lateness, usually 20-45min. She is sorry for it every single time, but these instances add to my frustration every single time.
* At the moment I am preparing applications for a half-year stay abroad to do research for my dissertation. This is important to me, both because I am excited about the opportunity, but also because this might be of great professional value to me. Whenever I even bring this up to my girlfriend, I get to hear something akin to “Great, I and got to stay here…” She apparently tries to make me feel guilty; never did I hear a word of encouragement or interest. Subsequently, I do not even talk about these efforts anymore.

These issues ultimately led to the current situation in which I feel little excitement about this relationship. The time I spend on my hobbies, my friends and my academic aspirations seems to be distinct from the time I spend with my girlfriend. While I can hang out and travel with her, the every-day life of our relationship is one in which I have problems coming up with stuff to do with her.
Am I egoistic and unable to see her side of things? Are my expectations for a relationship too high, should I stop pushing to her to conform to my expectations, and should I rather appreciate that habitual being together? Or are these issues possible signs of a deeper rift between us?

**Tl;dr:** I feel a lack of excitement about my relationship as my hobbies, my friends and my aspirations seemingly don’t go together with my girlfriend."
2smgcu,20,2015-01-16,[Rant] [Trigger] [Support] Bf's NMom is going off the deep end,thr8waway5,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2smgcu/rant_trigger_support_bfs_nmom_is_going_off_the/,"My bf and I have been going out for a couple of months.  Both of us have a bad case of NParents. To make matters worse,  we're both still living at home (we both live close to the University). I thought we could handle his NMom, but I'm starting to think we need some help. 

Here's the background:

He's living alone with his NMom, his older brother (GC) moved out a couple of years ago. We've both known from the beginning that both of our parents have some serious problems, I explained to my bf what narcissism was and he agreed is very likely his mother is one. 

She has a thing with knowing what my bf is doing and where he is. She looks into his bank statements constantly. My bf has ADHD and she is constantly putting him down because of it. She's constantly saying that he's always irresponsible and never studies. Then when my bf is studying, she comes around and stays asking him to do things for her and gets upset when he says he's trying to study. She has a bad sleeping pattern and constantly goes into his room to check that he's asleep. If he isn't she goes on a rampage about that. If he is, she might wake him up and go on a rampage over something else. Whenever my bf tries to establish boundaries, she goes and lays the ""I'm just completely worthless to you"" guilt trip to try and manipulate him to do what she wants. She is also unstable and has tried to off herself a couple of times (bf thinks she did it to manipulate him).

I already knew this when I met her and I have tried to be guarded around her. I am pretty sure there will come a time where she will talk badly about me to my bf's back and maybe to my face based on how she treated my bf's brother's wife at the beginning of their relationship (she once told her to her face that she was worthless). 

Related to our current dilemma:

I'm going on an internship this summer and my bf is looking to do research in the same city so she can both be out of there and spend time together. 

Now,  the problem:

A few days ago, my bf and I were in his house with his NMom. She started asking questions (she's pretty much always either talking or asking questions to someone) about summer and asked about housing. I was honest (my mistake) and said that I had several friends in the area that could help my find housing and was working on it.  Next,  she asked if my bf was going to stay with me over there.  I said it was a practical solution to reduce apartment costs. 

A few questions later, she asked if my parents cared that my bf and I might be staying together. 

Now,  my bf and I ate both adults and do not require parental authorization to live together. We're also paying this with our own money. Based on this I told her that it didn't really matter how my parents felt. She asked what I meant by that (and I realized I had made a mistake by saying that). I looked her in the eye and told her that it didn't matter how my parents felt about it because I was using my own money (from last year's internship) and so was he and that it was our desicion if we did. 

She clearly understood the double meaning of my words: I didn't care what she thought or had to say about us moving together and she was not part of the desicion making process. As we later found out, this really pissed her off. 

When my bf got back home from dropping me off at mine, his mother went into full rampage mode about me.  She said that I was extremely liberal and didn't care what my parents thoughtabout what I did (both true). She said that we were too diffrent because he's a Catholic and I'm liberal (I'm actually Catholic as well but I don't go to church often so that and my don't care sortie make me liberal in her eyes).  She also accused him and me of having sex in his room while she was gone. She went on and on about how she didn't think we would last very long because we're so different (we're not,  my bf just hides as much of his life as possible from her to keep same). She's also insistent that since we're having so much sex, I'll surely end up pregnant and ruin our lives since we won't be able to handle it. 

My bf tried to appease her at first and then repeatedly said that he did not want to discuss this with her because he felt uncomfortable and asked that she respect that. She ignored his attempts to set a boundary and insisted that she be notified well in advance when I was coming over. He told her not to worry that I wouldn't be visiting any time soon and shut down the conversation. 

He couldn't tell me that this happened for hours because his mom decided to stay in his room to use the computer until he went to sleep (she does that to 'make sure he goes to sleep') so he couldn't call me until she was gone. 

I wasn't shocked when he told me what happened, but I was shocked at how easily I fell into one of her tricks and at her behavior in general. My bf always worries that she'll do something drastic after a fight (since its happened before). We're both aware her actions are probably out of fear that she can't control my bf and jealousy that he's closer to me.

Right now, we try to keep her in an information diet as much at possible,  but we could really use some help with other ways to avoid these situations. Neither of us is in a position to move out for at least a year (or more),  we have decided to establish LC once we finally do and move into NC if its necessary. Both of us have short tempers sometimes and I have the bad habit of sometimes saying exactly what I think. 

Tl;dr: bf's NMom thinks my bf and I are destined to break up and ruin or lives by having a thousand babies and detests the idea of us spending the summer together alone because babies and religion. 

Sorry this is so long. Any ideas? "
2smhtc,3,2015-01-16,Today I - an unemployed grad - turned down a paid job for an unpaid internship.,sunshineandspike,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/2smhtc/today_i_an_unemployed_grad_turned_down_a_paid_job/,"Am I mad? Probably. Just looking for some reassurance here.

The paid job was with a very well known charity, working as a researcher for grant applications. Bit boring. I didn't really click with the interview panel, although they were very nice.

Unpaid internship is at the biggest charity I know. I was practically begged to take it, they really liked me. I get training, advice and access to internal vacancy listings. 80% of their staff in my department started as interns, so job prospects are good. And it's most importantly a job that I will really enjoy doing, which I know from past experience. The team are social and very nice, and I got on well with the interview panel.

My head is saying ""You idiot, its a paid job, there's no argument"".

My heart is saying ""You need to do what makes you happy. You've got a job once, you can do it again.""

And I went with the internship. I found myself defending it, and thus knew I needed to do it to keep me happy. I'm lucky enough to live with my parents, so I can afford to do this.

I don't know, I'm just looking for some reassurance that I've done the right thing here. I think I have. I'm just not sure."
2smil3,2,2015-01-16,"Me [26 M] with my Girlfriend [24 F] of almost 5 years - I don't know where we're ""at.""",_Dirt_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2smil3/me_26_m_with_my_girlfriend_24_f_of_almost_5_years/,"My girlfriend and I started dating back in college and continued through our graduate school. She's a couple years behind me, so I'm now almost a year into a first job post-internship and she's just beginning her first big internship.

We've always had the unofficial official plan of getting married once we were both settled into our jobs and secure enough financially to do it, but things have become difficult recently. When I first began my job I was working a normal day and also competing as a low-level pro athlete (as in I made little money but got a lot of enjoyment out of it). She was working in a semi-internship thing (hard to explain without naming the organization) and working part time, too. 

We were doing great at this time, which carried through October, but she started to feel neglected because I was (and I really was) on such a tight schedule that her time with me would be limited and I'd generally be tired during it. We got into a pretty big fight shortly after due to a misunderstanding between us where I thought she was ignoring me because she was mad I said we should hold off another 6 months before moving back in together since her job wasn't set and our employers were ~50 miles apart (meaning that living someplace together would likely be a 'mutually inconvenient,' crappy town between the two).

I apparently really hurt her with that and then misinterpreting a text from her as we were trying to fix things as being a break-up text and ending our relationship status on Facebook (I know, immature on my part and that such a thing is such a big deal).

We've spent time together a few weekends since then, but haven't stayed together or been intimate since, though it's never been a situation where that'd be an easy option. 

For the last couple months we've been alright, but just not in contact much (did the whole Christmas and some holiday stuff, but she had to work most actual holidays). She recently finished her old position and is out of the schedule she had (pretty much opposite mine), moved into a new aptartment with a couple of girlfriends, and is now in a professional internship at her dream company - I'm very proud of her. 

However, our contact during this time has been sporadic. She's dropped off of social media completely and we rarely have text exchanges or calls. That brings me to last night.

Last night, when she confirmed her new position, we had the following exchange (M = me, E = her)
M- ""Are WE still a WE? Because if so we need to start acting like it... no more of this not talking or texting for days and never seeing eachother""

E - ""I don't know how to answer. It's hard. I wanna focus on my ____ career, and focus on being where I want to with all that. So, when I have time off I have been schedulign meet and greets and interviews. Now that I have this internship, that doesn't stop. ____ is all about whom you know and whom you have relations with. So, I need to keep building and keeping up with those I already met.""

M - ""Alright then. It's been fun.""

M (minutes later after no response) - ""God that was a terrible statement, it probably should have been: ""I love you and I understand your career goals. That's not a problem and I want you to achieve them. Bu tI can't keep holding onto, and planning for, something when the other party just shows indifference""
I think that's better.""

E - An dI understand that it's not fair. That's why I need to stress the importance this is for me. And later on in life I could be happy. This is something I really want for myself and really feel is my primary focus right now. I don't wanna give up on my dream.""

M - I would never ask you to do that. Are you kidding?

M - I hope you don't feel like I've ever wanted you to do that.""

M (20 or so minutes later) - ""____, I'm serious. I need some sort of finality here or a confirmation that there's a future... it's the middle ground that's more unfair than anything. I can't believe I'm still texting you like a desperate child, but the thought of looking into a life without you, with everything we've had buried and dead is breaking my heart. If that's the case, then just give me some finality.""

M - (after waking up in middle of the night with no response and feeling troubled by all of this) - Ugh. Right... well, ok. my flight is at 12:50pm. Could we please just put this to bed before then? I'm really stressed with a lot of things and don't need this big one, too""

No response yet.

This is THE girl I was planning to propose to in march. THE girl we'd already planned on so many wedding ideas and life plans with and it seems like suddenly things have gone into a fog for no reason I can define...

Anyone able to give some advice or help me? 
(sorry for the wall of text!)

We went through all of our school years together being the absolute best of friends, could finish each other’s sentences, that sort of thing. I guess I never had any doubt that we’d be friends forever, not in a sappy way, but just in the way where I couldn’t imagine a time where I wouldn’t know him. We were each other’s first kiss, but any fourteen year old crush feelings that we had for each other, although admittedly they were stronger on his side, have long gone, and we were, for all intents and purposes, brother and sister. Just ignore the slightly incestuous undertones there.

We went to the same college but obviously had our own friend groups and hung out less, because regardless of how well we knew each other, we had grown into fairly different people. He liked hanging out with his gamer buddies, was quieter, and didn’t like going out as such, while I turned into a bit of a lunatic for a while with drinking and, cough, experiencing the college life, as it were. But we would always make time for each other, would message every day for several hours, it was as easy as breathing. 

Things started changing a bit more in the last year, however. We both got significant others around the same time, and I made a point of becoming friends with his girlfriend because I didn’t want her to think I could be a threat, but he pretty much hated my boyfriend. He knew him first, and wasn’t his biggest fan, but really took a dislike to him once we started going out, saying he was a dick and not good enough for me. But our friendship wasn’t affected, he was always there for me for whatever. 

Then I got the opportunity to go on work experience for eight months in Europe, which I’m just coming to the end of, and it’s been wonderful and a fantastic opportunity and everything. Unfortunately at the same time, my friend flunked his exams and dropped out of college. He was working for a while but outside of tourist season, that’s petered out and is essentially just stuck in our home town (couple of hours away from his friends at college). He’s looking at a new course in a new college next year, but that’s a long way off still, and money could be an issue and he might not get to go at all. Obviously I felt terrible for him, particularly because of the timing of things going really well for me. But we still made time to talk, skype occasionally, I didn’t rub his face in anything, we just shot the shit and talked about anything and everything like we had always done. He would occasionally go weird on me, though. I had to go back for an exam that I needed to repeat (but it was extenuating circumstances rather than me just slacking off that semester or struggling with material, so I couldn’t even say that I understood how he felt about flunking) so I was in the country for a week, and whenever I’d message him to meet up, he’d just flat-out ignore it. The night before I came back, he said that he would come to my house for a few drinks and just never showed up. I was pissed for a while over that and we didn’t talk. However, the next week, I ended up in a horrible break up with my boyfriend (who I was long distance with, he was about an hour and a half away from me in Europe) and called him in tears. He was there for me and we returned to normal, I had too much else on to wonder why he hadn’t met up with me when I was home. 

But when I got back with my boyfriend about a month later, he just flat out started ignoring me. I stopped trying after a while. Figured he’d come back at some point. But at that point I was caring less, because I was sick of being messed around by someone I considered my best friend.

We didn’t talk for three months. Of course I was upset when I thought about it. I didn’t know why he was ignoring me or what I had done, and I had seemingly lost my best friend that I saw myself knowing for the rest of my life. This was broken when I drunkenly sent him a text telling him to pull himself together and that I missed him. He replied with a sarcastic comment. After about two weeks, I finally replied back to that message and we fell back into talking like we used to. This went on for about a month, but I was still pissed at him to be honest. He would dodge explanations on why he had done it, and I kind of felt like I couldn’t trust him any more to be there when I needed him, so what was the point of the friendship. But I found out his girlfriend (who he was long distance with at this point for her work experience, but still the same country) broke up with him, and didn’t want to abandon him when nothing was going right for him.

But then I started noticing things that I had let slide for many years. I’m not sure if this was due to meeting new, really lovely people, from home and abroad whilst on my internship, or if it was taking the break from the friendship, but I suddenly realised that he made all these snide comments. But only when I was talking about something good in my life. Got a new phone and couldn’t type on the keypad properly? I was clearly exaggerating the typos just to show off the new phone. Mentioned something about finally feeling good about myself after years of self-esteem-ruining at school? He feels the need to say he never saw what was ‘so great’ about my arse anyway (I’m kind of known for being a little bottom heavy. Or arse heavy. But this was not me saying I have a great arse or anything. )

Then I started realising a trend of him only being a great friend when something was going badly in my life. Repeating an exam and being really stressed/upset over it? He’s all attentive and wishing me luck and telling me he’s there for me. When I got the result that I passed? He barely acknowledged it. Breaking up with my boyfriend and being heart broken? He’s there to talk and moan to and tell me that I’ll find someone better. When I get back with the boyfriend? He ignores me for months.  I try to say that I’m overthinking things, but there’s just too many instances of this for it to be a coincidence. From talking over it with friends/family, I’ve had people say it always seems/seemed like he always had to put me down if I was happy, or like he wants to be the only source of happiness for me. 

So it seems like a no-brainer that I don’t need that kind of person in my life, right? I haven’t spoken to him for a few weeks now and he’s made no effort to see if I’m alright after I abruptly left a conversation from a snide remark he made. But this guy is my best friend. I genuinely believe he loves me. I love him. Platonically, of course. When things are good, they’re great. I don’t want to lose that from my life. I also don’t want to not support him at such a crap time in his life. I don’t know if I’m being selfish by not giving him a chance to get out of what I really think might be depression, not that he will do anything about it. (I’ve tried many times, at a loss for what more I can do to help someone who doesn’t think they need help). I don’t know if I need to be doing more in this friendship or less. So my question is, what do I do in this situation? 

EDIT: Okay, I can kind of see where some comments are going to go. I honestly don't know what his headspace is regarding me and undying love per se, but I know that my feelings, while strong, are completely platonic. I still have the boyfriend, who I love the bones of, and couldn't see myself with anyone else. And not cos he's a massive douchebag and I have daddy issues or anything like that. As far as I'm aware.

I created a form for new drinks which populates to a database which calculates drinks per batch, ABV, etc and can be pulled from the list to give a rough idea on a function's cost for drinks. Now all I have to do is select a drink from the pull down tabs and select how many and it all calculates automatically.

Well, I am a 21 year old father to a lovely 2.5 year old. I'll tell you what I went through and where I am now.

****When I was 18 I found out that my girlfriend of 2 years was pregnant (she was 19), my first reaction was disbelief, but I somehow kept calm through it all. I decided to tell my family about it and they were in shock with the whole situation. My family pressured me to get an abortion and not ruin my whole life with being a young father. They told me that they would help with child support, but that leaving might be the best option. My girlfriend and I decided that we would weather the storm together. She was always great with kids.

****Once we decided that we were going to go through with it we started losing a lot of friends. It was much harder on her because she actually was a receptionist at the highschool that we both went to so a lot of people would stare at her and I'm sure that she had a really hard time with all of the judgement that everyone gave her. 

****At the time I was working a crappy job at a restaurant while still in school. I decided that I had to find a legitimate way to provide for my family now that we were becoming a family. I enrolled in a program at my local college for IT and began studying furiously so I could get a decent paying job ASAP. I ended up doing what is really looked down on in this situation.   I left my girlfriend.

****I tried to make it alright my telling her that I wanted to be a part of the child's life and I had a room in my apartment that was going to be our son's room. She took this really hard as I'm sure you can guess. I couldn't handle all of the pressure and needed some time alone. We didn't have a perfect relationship and to be frank, I wanted to experience other girls.

****This obviously wasn't the ideal situation, but I was unequipped to make any other decision at the time. When she was 7 months pregnant I decided that getting together would be the right thing to do. About 3 weeks later I proposed to her mainly because I didn't want to have to call her my girlfriend. I felt like saying fiancee kind of legitimized it all. I was very concerned about what other people would think about us.

****We struggled through a lot together and have a great child. She raised him all alone for the first 6 months or so. I never woke up at night to help out because I was studying my ass off. Eventually I got an internship for IT which paid shit, but it was an in. About 6 months into my internship they offered me a full-time job. I made it. We were so happy, we were finally at a place of relative stability. I had a career and could finally provide. 

****I felt like a lot of judgement was off of me because even though we were a young family, I provided for them and was involved in my son's life and was there for my fiancee. Eventually, things got better and we actually started talking about getting married. We moved into an actual house (renting.)

****We finally got married at a small reception in our house. It was our version of a courthouse marriage, only our parents were there. We went on a honeymoon. I feel like we actually made it now. It was such a hard journey. I can't stress it enough. We have the greatest 2.5 year old and my wife is a great mother. It took me a long time, but I finally learned how to be a good father. I don't think I would be this close with my wife if it wasn't for the struggle of raising a child while we were both so young. We are also now excited to be welcoming our 2nd child this summer.

Learning to be a good parent is something that all parents go through, not just young ones. The best thing that you can do as a parent is to just be there. You don't have to be perfect, but be involved in your child's life. Do the best that you can do, even if that isn't much. Families come in all different forms, and there is no reason that just because you are a young family/parent, means that you are less of a parent.

If there are any couples/single parents in our situation that want any advice or have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I would have loved to talk to someone who had been through what I was going through. "
2snz0h,10,2015-01-16,Sober for 6 months! Nietzsche and Alcohol....,RobertaBreitmore,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2snz0h/sober_for_6_months_nietzsche_and_alcohol/,"""Two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity.""

Friedrich Nietzsche

Sometimes I think about this quote and it makes me realise that before I was sober I was just knocking on walls and hoping for them to turn into doors. I realised I was never going to be the person who I want to be if I didnt make a change.

About 9 months ago I was a horrible drunk most days.  I am a 24 year old female and I have been drinking excessively since I was 14. 
I put myself in awful situations throughout this time, regaining consciousness in strangers cars, taking a plethora of Class A drugs on a weekly basis and generally not caring if I lived or died. Everytime I drank it was to completely forget who I was and basically to a point where it could be considered semi -suicidal.

6 months ago I had a few serious incidents which made me decide to stop drinking for good. I have not had a sip of alcohol in all that time! I decided to create a challenge (www.justgiving.com/tttotal) for myself and tell all my friends and family. This reduced the chance of me giving up as I was determined to prove everyone wrong!  (most people did not belive I would do it!) 

in the past six months my life has improved tremendously. My appearance has transformed as I have lost weight,  clearer skin and the drive and energy to exercise. I have completely chanced my social sphere and only really keep in touch with people I genuinely connect with, as opposed to people who loved drinking as much as me. I have started a new course at university l, got a new job, got an amazing internship in the field I want to work in. My relationship has had a new lease of life,  so much so that I recently got engaged!

The hardest bit for me has been surviving pressure during social functions /weddings Eg. Work party etc. I have found most people my age who I don't know,  write me off as boring instantly. When I am having a hard time coping I think of this quote.... 

""The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, sometimes frightened. But no price and is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.""

2so18q,11,2015-01-16,"Hey r/Leaves, I'm quitting, and I know I need help",lanadelgayfish,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2so18q/hey_rleaves_im_quitting_and_i_know_i_need_help/,"Where do I begin?

The first time I smoked pot was in fifth grade with my brother two years older than me. My family was in turmoil...we were poor, my parents were recently divorced, deadbeat dad, mother working two jobs...my life was not safe or stable or good in any way. The sort of darkness that seeks out the weak was bound to find me, and it did. My brother presented us with the infamous stoner soda can bowl. I was scared and I knew I shouldn't, but I did. And despite what they say, I was very high that first time. I was so high, I went in the living room, lit a cigarette, and promptly passed out on the sofa. *I was 10 years old*.  I could have burned the house down. And my poor mother, with nothing, and no choices, would have died right then and there of a broken heart. 

I didn't smoke again until high school and it was very intermittent. The events of that night scared me and I knew that was not who I was. I was watching the aftermath of my parents divorce and the role drugs played in my siblings coping. They were sad. All of them. And drinking, and smoking pot. And getting arrested. And coping. I thought I was different from them, as usual, but I was only coping differently. I longed for a close family that was happy and took pictures and went to Grandma's for special events, despite never having that life even before the divorce. I coped by being away. I spent most of my childhood living at my best friends house. His mother was my mother. And we took pictures, and went to grandma's house. It was everything I needed. I did pretty well in school and balanced a full time job of pretending my family was not in complete chaos. When I was home, I frantically cleaned the house, dressed myself well, and did everything to put up this illusion that we were ok. I was well spoken, and intuitive. Always ready for anyone to come over so I could show them how ok we were. I wonder how sad that must have made adults, for if I saw that now, it would kill me. 

Fast forward to college. I didn't want to go. I was excelling at a sport that could have made me a professional and had nothing to do with school. I chose to do college because everyone else was doing it and how could I possibly do something that would question my standing? I was from a small New England town. Everyone went to college *because that is what you do*. I was the first to go to college in my family, and my parents were no help. I had no contact with my father at this point. My mother and step father didn't know how to help and didn't try. I was alone in my decision-making, and scared. This decision was life-changing, and bigger than I was capable of understanding. For me, college was awful. I hated it, I was scared, I was drowning in feelings of weakness, and by then my somewhat settled family had exploded. My mother divorced my asshole step father who beat my ass from grade seven to twelve simply because he hated us. She moved out of our house while I was living in the dorm and said everything at home was left and probably burned. It was all of my prized treasures from my sport...equipment, trophies, memories, my identity...I fell into an incredible depression that I didn't even know I was in. And in that darkness, where I was weak and alone and away from anything that was familiar to me, I was reunited with weed. I didn't ease back into smoking pot, I went into it full force. It was numbing. It was the new me; numb. I became a proud stoner. I wore it like a badge, but it was a shield. It helped me be around people and covered the feelings of shame I felt about myself. Here had I worked so hard to cultivate this image of who I was. I was smart, I was valuable, and people liked me. And in my sport, people respected me and I respected them. I felt whole there. I was invincible. And now, I was one semester into college, and invisible. I had no family, I had no identity or sense of self left. God, I was so sad inside. I was broken. Jumping into cars with strangers to get some weed. Smoking from morning to night. High for this, high for that. I was high driving, I was high presenting in class, at work, or anywhere the day takes a 17-21 year old.

Fast forward ten years. I work a shitty low-skill job that I make pretty good money at. I have a degree that I don't want or use,  and a mountain of debt following me around. You see, this is mostly attributed to my depressed/high brain. The numbness I felt allowed me to make some seriously shitty decisions. I didn't care. More loans? Sure. More classes? Whatever. Internship? Connections? I guess. Can I go home?  I've seen a therapist, who I ditched like everyone and everything that doesn't interest me, and won't as long as this is who I am. She did say depression has a beginning, a middle, and an end. 

After so many years of sadness, I'm feeling a break, seeing a light, or any other thousand cliches about moving on. My brain is trying to end this. I know I'm capable of a bright future. But I do everything in my power to block myself from it. I have heaps of guilt, self doubt, resentment, and abandonment that I have to work through to be who I know I am inside. But it's there and it wants out. I'm tired of being nobody. I am not nobody. I am strong, I am smart, and goddamn it I matter. Even when I remind myself how unworthy of happiness I am, I know it's not true. I've seen it. I've been valuable before, I'm valuable now, and I've got value that I haven't discovered yet.

 Interestingly, you wouldn't know any of this if I didn't say just now. I present as a polished, well mannered, likeable man. My outside is candy-coated my what's inside is just...brittle. I need help. I'm out of pot, but I'm a ten year regular. Every bag signals the end, but it's not. I just go back. I smoke about 1/8th per week. 

Help me r/leaves. I know there is a better person inside of me than I tell myself. And he doesn't need to cope. I am committing right here and now to stop. To allow myself what I've denied myself for so long- a chance. I know my weaknesses and what drive them, so what do you do when you know the answers but are aren't strong enough to move on?

People tell me I'm nice, easy to work with, and a fast learner. I'm open to full-time employment, internships, or contract work. Also please message me if you have job search advice or any general Seattle tips =]

I'm already interviewing with the big companies (Amazon, Facebook, Google), I'd just prefer to work somewhere small to mid-size if I can be choose-y. "
2soobs,5,2015-01-16,"Just emailed NStepMom after 10 months NC... feeling regret, feeling sadness, feeling anxiety.",Bobo1993,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2soobs/just_emailed_nstepmom_after_10_months_nc_feeling/,"So basically, I cut off contact with Nparents 10 months ago and pretty much ran away to live with my boyfriend and his family. I knew where I was wasn't safe for me so I made a very quick decision and left. While I occasionally feel regret and wonder if I made the right choice, I think I know deep down that what I did was necessary.

Anyway, because I left so quickly, I didn't go back for my stuff for fear that they would find out that I was leaving. So I literally moved to a different city, in a different home, with the clothes on my back.

It's been 10 months and has taken a long time for me to somewhat cope with the feelings I have in regard to the situation. The one thing that keeps holding me back though are my things.

I know that might sound selfish. Why am I concerned with stuff anyways? It's just stuff, it can be replaced.

The clothes and the shoes and the books and stuff, I'm over that. I've replaced my entire wardrobe with clothes that I love. I have shoes, I have clothes, I have underwear.

I did an internship with the Walt Disney Company and bought many things from Disney that I brought home with me. Unlucky for me, those were the things that they stole from me.

I've tried many times to get my things back but every email and every letter I've sent has been ignored. I tried driving up there to get my stuff only to be threatened with a lawyer warning me that I'll be arrested.

About a week ago, I finally emailed my NDad (I'm not really sure if he's an enabler, to be honest, or actually narcissistic... not that that really matters) one more time about getting my things. Like always, he didn't respond to my email. I guess I'm done trying.

For the first time since I left, I finally emailed NStepMom and asked her about getting my things. I just clicked the send button maybe ten minutes ago and keep refreshing.

The reason I feel so much regret is that the whole time I've been here, NC, I've made it a mission to not speak to her. She's the main reason I left. I made all efforts of communication towards my dad, but he hasn't sent any back to me. Instead, he forwards my emails to her and she sends them to me. I don't want to talk to her, so I ignore them. Now I'm struggling with the fact that I sent her an email and I feel like I've given her the power back again.

I don't know, maybe I'm crazy for feeling regretful... I just guess I'm writing this so that someone may give me advice or even just an ear to talk to. I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

**TLDR** - Have been NC for ten months. Parents stole my stuff and I've tried to get it back. Just emailed my NStepMom about my stuff and feeling regret because I've tried very hard not to speak to her, only to my dad, because she's the main reason I left."

What I look like- [me!](http://imgur.com/BpGClbk) [me again] (http://imgur.com/cAkEStG)

Where I live- The Bronx, born and raised

What do I do- I am a student at Monroe College on my last semester... Hopefully, I don't mess that up! I also intern at an art center in the Bronx where they do programs for kids to help with different types of art. (I really love this place) 

What do I play- I mostly play games on the pc (well, my laptop). I've been playing MMOs forever and I've finally chose FFXIV to stick around on. I also play Elsword, but I feel like no one knows about that game lol. I will be playing more PS4 games whenever I get around to buying one.

What I like about  r/NYCgamers- You guys seem like a bunch of fun loving people and I need more gaming friends. I seriously don't know any gay guys who actually game and aren't afraid to talk about it.

2sp7nx,3,2015-01-16,New laptop questions,greendragon2010,LinuxActionShow,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxActionShow/comments/2sp7nx/new_laptop_questions/,"My current laptops graphics card is going out and its time for a new laptop.

2spcr9,4,2015-01-16,First impressions after teaming up with a massive group,GreatBigJerk,h1z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/2spcr9/first_impressions_after_teaming_up_with_a_massive/,"So I finally got in the game and was able to play, yay! I definitely see potential, but it's going to be a long road before this will be ready for release.

**Things I disliked:**

* *The damn near total lack of loot*. It's ridiculous. Aside from two times, every spot I checked had nothing. The only loot I found was a can of food that made next to no difference, and a bunch of water. Scarcity is one thing, but there was a complete lack of pretty much anything.

* *The crazy huge population on the server.* I think the longest I went without seeing or hearing someone was about 10 minutes. I would say 1/3rd of them were kill on sight people, it probably would have been more if not for the group I came across (more on that in the ""things I liked"" section). Maybe it'll be better when the map is expanded, but it's just not a good zombie apocalypse game if the people outnumber the zombies 50 to 1. Which leads to...

* *The low zombie population.* There weren't enough zombies. I watched a stream last night where there was a massive horde, but I didn't see anything like that while playing. I certainly came across more than when I played DayZ Standalone, but it wasn't remotely enough to pose any threat. The lack of zombies means that people start killing people instead due to a lack of a unifying threat.

* *The map.* I know it's early access, but man is it rough. It doesn't feel like a place where people would actually live. It's almost like the devs really wanted to emulate the feel of Chernarus, but got an intern to lay out the map. The trees are also ridiculously huge for some reason.



**Things I liked:**

* *The day/night cycle.* Playing at night in DayZ sucked if you didn't have any gear to help you see. Having the day/night cycle much shorter prevents that. It's also a good sense of accomplishment to survive a day and night. Night time is way too light though, there's not a huge loss in visibility, even when inside buildings. I did find changing the graphics settings had a pretty drastic effect on lighting, so maybe it's just a bug.

* *The crafting system.* It's intuitive and seems to have a lot of stuff you can make, though I couldn't do much with the entire map being stripped bare.

* *The emotes.* It was good fun to be able to have so many non-verbal ways to handle communication. Being able to run around with your hands up is also a hilarious way to mess with people.

*  *The massive fuckoff group of non-violent people I came across.* After getting murdered about six times, I came across a group of 20-30 people who were all friendly! They were roaming the map and starving together as they looked for loot, twerked, and mercilessly took out bandits. I think my time with the game would have been a lot more dull if I hadn't run across them. I roamed with them until I starved to death while chasing after a dude who attacked the group. It was supposedly getting streamed on Twitch, so maybe some people saw me running around like an idiot. If you're one of the people from the group, say hi!

**Conclusion**
I think the game will be alright. It's SUPER rough, but there is some fun to be had. There's a lot I didn't comment on (combat especially), but most of it was due to bugs or things that just didn't seem to be implemented yet. If you're on the fence, definitely **DON'T buy it yet**. Give it time to improve, I'm certain that it will.

Oh, and I did see a couple air drops. Almost got to one, but got shot by a guy who was scoping it out. There were a few other people around too, so I think that the idea that they are to be highly contested stands so far. I didn't see anyone kitted out in super gear or anything that implied a paid advantage.


***tl;dr - Don't get the game yet. It's fun, but rough.***"
2spp63,2,2015-01-17,Thoughts about my dying NGran that I need to get out.,monkey_nucleosis,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2spp63/thoughts_about_my_dying_ngran_that_i_need_to_get/,"I've thought about this day for a very long time and wondered when it would happen. I have wondered how I would feel. Would I feel guilty? Would I feel sad? Would I feel indifferent? Would I be angry? The answer is yes, I have felt all of these feelings at some point during the day. 

I contemplated going no contact with her one of the many times she was hospitalized. I think this was in 2011 or 2012. Somehow, she could always manipulate her doctors into thinking she was responsible enough to go home (Background: she had a foot and a half  and never stayed off of it because making appearances around town and shopping were more important than being well). The hospital she was staying in was an hour away from my parents, and my mom (NGran's daughter) was not able to pick her up that day. So, NGran called my dad at work and asked him to pick her up and gave him a sob story about how no one loved her enough to get her from the hospital. This caused a fight between my parents because her emotional appeals work on my dad. Unfortunately for her, one of her doctors didn't agree that she should be released and she was not allowed to go home. She called my mom and said ""Tell your husband I can't leave"" and hung up. She really seemed to enjoy playing my parents against each other. 

I didn't go NC with her because I felt guilty every time I thought about it. 

My mom is my NGran's SC. It breaks my heart. I worry that after NGran dies, my mom will feel guilty for not liking her own mother, or for not falling victim to NGran's verbal abuse and master manipulation. NGran manipulated my mom just three days ago. She called my mom and said ""the doctor told me I can't take care of myself anymore"" (we were planning on putting her in the nursing home, pending her living and not dying). NGran started crying on the phone, and my mom felt sorry for her. My mom even cried because she felt bad about the choice she was having to make to keep her mother from OD'ing and falling and killing herself. My NGran's sister called a few hours later, and said NGran was really happy and joking and excited about going places with her boyfriend. I don't know if anyone else will agree with me, but that is manipulation. She has always wanted to move in with my parents; she knows they are both against it. I think she was trying to play on my mom's emotions so she wouldn't have to go to the nursing home. 


I've often wondered if I am golden grandchild or the scape goat. Sometimes I think I'm both at the same time. My brother went mostly NC with NGran years ago, and she never said much about it. She always tells people how much she loves me and how proud of me she is, but then she tells me how great this married couple close to my age is, and how much they help her and how much she loves and appreciates them. It would make me feel like such a terrible granddaughter. One incident of her N tendencies has always stood out in my mind. When I was 8, she yelled at me because I could not carry a dresser down a full flight of attic stairs. What kind of person even asks a child to carry a dresser down the stairs? 

I've spent today feeling guilty because I can't be there to tell her goodbye. I might not even be able to go to the funeral because of obligations with my internship. My parents understand and told me not to worry about missing anything... but I know she would want me there,and I feel so guilty for even thinking about not going. I don't know if this has resulted from years of manipulation or if it's just me. 

I'm also angry. I'm angry that my mom never got to have a mother that was as loving and kind as she is. I'm angry that my NGran took so many pills all the time. I'm angry that she was so mean to everyone in my family. Yet, I am sad that she will be gone soon. I will miss hearing her stories about my papa and my great grandmother. I think I will miss other things, too, but I can't think of them right now. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just have a lot of conflicting feelings about this and I just want the burden of being related to an N to go away... but I have a feeling it won't... 

**TL;DR** OP has mixed feelings about NGran dying and doesn't think the burden will ever go away

Hello,

I read your e-mail regarding my apartment available for rent located in: Pääskylänkatu 3 A, 00500 Helsinki

I'm sorry but i speak only English.

The rent/month is € 650 ( including running costs ).
 
The deposit request is 1 month € 650, and you will pay one time and get it back when you will leave (I will need 1 month notice if you want to move before the contract end). You can rent it for any period even for a long term.

Bright and well maintained two bedrooms apartment. In the apartment a spacious open plan kitchen / living room, separate bedroom and a spacious bathroom. Well groomed housing company in which all of the major repairs (eg, pipes, roof, facade, staircase). Apartment Area 50m²

Now, a little bit about myself: My name is Mikkel  Thomsen and I'm a 56 years old designer and structural engineer from United Kingdom. It was my wife's apartment ( she was original from Finland ). Unfortunately she passed away 4 years ago. The apartment was used by our daughter during her studies and internship in Helsinki. In the last 1 year and half was rented to a Norwegian family and their contract just expired. I don`t want to sell it because never know in the future what will be my daughter option so we decided to rent it to some one who can take care of it.

If you do not mind I would like to know how many persons you intend to share the flat, and for how long. Any other details about yourself would be appreciated.
 
So I guess this is it for now, I hope I didn't forgot anything.
Thank you

PRAISE JESUS,faithfamilyfootball,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2sqmma/i_am_saved_praise_jesus/,"I had been godless for too long, when i lost my right arm i basically cursed God and gave up. I was praying to the opiate god and i was not happy with my life.


Then I learned about the truth of Jesus from my best friend. I listened, started understanding, and now beileved. I broke down in front of my crucifix, begging God to save me and saying sorry. I heard him tell me to lift my head, and I saw Jesus with his arms wide open, forgiving and accepting me.

In that moment I felt the most indescribable feeling of joy, and I still have it.  I keep telling myself ""God will provide"" and immediately I met a girl on the bus.

Then, I nailed the interview to intern as coach for my colleges D1 team.

That night, my sister told me her God fearing, Jesus loving boss at chic-fil-a told her for me to call him.

2sqmpa,44,2015-01-17,I saw the light!!! -the road to recovery of a former neckbeard.,Mjollner05,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/2sqmpa/i_saw_the_light_the_road_to_recovery_of_a_former/,"Hiya folks. Long time lurker, first time poster, you know the drill. I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

TL;DR: How a former neckbeard got beaten up over m'lady, took a long hard look at himself, and turned his life around.

So gather around, and i will tell you the epic tale of how yours truly went from being a prototype neckbeard, to a more or less functioning member of society.

Be current me: 24 years old, 1,89 metres tall, weighing around 95 kilo's, Krav Maga enthousiast, former historical re-enactor, bit of a fitness nerd, and i do take quite a bit of pride in my appearance (neatly trimmed beard, clean, fitting, mostly fashionable clothes, daily shower etc). 
Apart from that, i have my own starting leatherworking business, and i am an engineering student (how i came to that combination is another loooong story). I love steampunk to the point that i have my own entertainment group which goes to festivals, schools etc to just have fun and well, entertain people.
I also enjoy discussing a wide variety of stuff with others, and with an open mind, ranging from religion and politics to why a certain football referee should be dragged out of the stadium and ran out of town with pitchforks and torches.

So, where did i come from you ask?

For the love of flying richard dawkins on a bicycle, don't be 18 year old me: 
Weighing in at 130 kilos, with the body shape of the stay puft man from ghostbusters, and showering only because my mom told me so. My gentlesirly daily attire consisted of new rock boots, black trousers, usually some sort of black metal vest, a skull cane, multiple of those horrible armour rings, a long ponytail (thankfully i had hair a m'lady would be jealous of, my one redeeming quality at the time), a patch of fur that might be called a goatee if you look reaaaaally hard, and you guessed it, a trilby and a leather trenchcoat. The latter of which didnt even get taken off in hot weather. 
In terms of behaviour, creepy doesn't even begin to cover it. More like downright stalker to the poor girls that were ""worthy of my gentlemanly affections"". I also did the hat tipping thing, saying ""jongedame"", which literally translates as ""young lady"", AKA m'lady. In addition to that, i thought i was a badass for carrying one of those useless little fantasy knives in my boot. Oh, and don't forget: the magic the gathering and World of Warcraft stuff.

Alright, now that im done banging my head against the wall in shame of what a jackass i was, time to carry on. In hindsight, i wish i could reach back in time, kick my own arse, and throw myself into a military bootcamp. Anyway, how i managed to recover:

It all started with the latest object of my affections, a girl in my class. Surely, i could woo her without trouble, being the nice guy i was. The only thing standing in the way: her boyfriend, also in that class. I spent most of that year trying to convince her he was the devil himself, and how i was her shining knight, and her one true love. Needless to say, that did not go over well with her boyfriend, who kicked my ass as a result, which was more than deserved in hindsight. 
So, after he was done, he dragged me up, took me to the nearest pub, and bought me a beer. Turns out he was an awesome guy, that literally slapped me straight and saved my life then and there. He told me ""sorry dude, but you need to get yourself together, and learn some discipline. Get a haircut, shower on a daily basis, and change your style. I'll even help you out on the last bit. Here's my number"". I went home crying like a bitch, took one long hard look in the mirror, and i realised he was right. The first step to facing your problem, is admitting you have one. I dropped out of high school that year, since World of Warcraft was more important than grades. I never called the guy, but his words stuck with me.

So the next day, i did exactly what he told me: i went to the barbers to get some styling advice for my hair, let them pick out a short haircut that fit my head shape, and said goodbye to my ponytail. That moment, it was like someone turned on the light in my head. 
The next thing i did, was to bring my precious trilby, trenchcoat, rings and cane to a pawn shop, and buy some normal sneakers with that money. I then went back to the pawn shop to sell my new rock boots as well, and bought two pairs of normal jeans and a few shirts with that (those boots are expensive as all hell).
The next thing i did was to walk into the nearest gym i could find, and signing up. The first week there was hard. i could barely do 5 minutes walking on treadmill before people began to sort of hover to the AED, just in case of a heartattack. But then something weird and wonderful happened. I began to actually enjoy working out, and slowly seeing the results. I could walk up the stairs in my own home again without being out of breath. And i kept upping the ante on my workout regime, even going so far as to ask if they could teach me how to slowly build up running. 
Then i found out there was this group in my town that did historical re-enactment. I signed up there too, in order to learn how to fight. It took a few broken bones, but i learned how to fight. I still have the swords and helmet that i used for that. That is also where i learned my first bits of leatherworking, which i have gotten pretty good at, and which i am currently earning my money with. When Krav Maga got taught at my gym, i started doing that too. I just couldn't get enough of learning new things. By that time, i was 20 years old, and well on the road to recovery, at least physically. 

But, the trilby and neckbeard on the heart are persistant. Mentally, i still had all the discipline of a wet paper towel. As far as i figured, i got myself into shape physically, so how about mentally? Turns out, i could. The first thing i did was to finish High school in record time. Right after that, i signed up for Aviation Engineering at a university. I Almost made it, but failed on one subject. So, i reapplied for that same university with a new fire in my eyes, because i was not going back to being a loser. No. Fucking. Way. So, i did my first year at a course that combines engineering and design principles to create technical innovations. I never dropped below a B+ (7-ish) mark in any subject, and i excel in 3-d drawing. And here i am, about to embark on finding an internship, having a lot of fun in the process, and trying to be a decent human being. Luckily, i have some wonderful people in my life who are genuinely supportive of my current efforts, including that one ""special girl"".
But for the love of all that is holy, i will never, ever go back to being what i was.  

Anyway, Cheers for reading that particular wall of text, it felt good to write all of it off me after all this time. The moral of the story: If you know a neckbeard, kick his ass, buy him a beer. You just might save his life. "

2sr0wr,1,2015-01-17,Why,SkyTroupe,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2sr0wr/why/,"I really should make a throwaway account for this, but I don't care anymore. Caring takes too much effort.


I was doing fine until I stupidly decided to text my ex this morning and got a response. Now I feel depressed, literally weighed down upon by a weight, and completely apathetic.


Background time. Last January I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression. The two semesters before I had done well until the end and then basically ran out of any motivation to do well and did terribly in classes. So I go to a therapist and psychologist and get diagnosed. 


So I return to school and my dad forces me to take the lsat, and my girlfriend keeps on asking me to apply to school and jobs in Cincinnati so we can be together. I don't study for the last and get in the 160's, I apply to jobs and schools but don't hear back from any of them. I start to get really down and worried. I want to be with this girl, I love her, but nothing is going right. I go home for easter and my dad says he wouldn't help support me if I moved out west to stay with her without a job offer or law school. I go back to school and she breaks up with me. Saying she can't do long distance and that she's been thinking. We're just too different, it would never work out she says.


I'm heartbroken. I stop giving a shit about anything. I don't groom myself, I skip my last few classes and finals. For the first time in my life I purposefully drink more than a beer or two casually at a party. I drink in excess and attempt to blackout every time I go out. I fail to blackout once. I accept a full ride to some law school back home because fuck it, I have nothing else to occupy my time or mind except thoughts of my ex. We were together for four years. She haunts my thoughts every day. I know I didn't pass any of my classes because I skipped finals but no one knows. I walk graduation and they even call my name for it. I'm officially a college flunky and NO ONE knows. Not my parents, my ex, my best friend, my law school.


I go home and do NOTHING all summer except sit around being depressed and playing LoL. In August I get a part time job at a library and start law school. Things are OK. Not great, they just exist and aren't terrible. 


Then I feel slightly better about myself at the end of October and try to get back in touch with my ex. I miss her so much and feel that even just friends would be fine if I can just talk to her again. She starts off the Skype conversation saying she wants to be friends but only wants to keep in touch for big updates in life. Wtf is that? What kind of friendship is that after four years of dating is that? I'm a smear on the sidewalk to her now. My self confidence is shattered. I stop doing any work for school and take finals I fail a class, get a D and B's in the rest. 


Winter break comes and I go to a dance camp. God I've missed dance so much. But I'm in more chest pain more frequently when dancing than before. (I have congenital heart disease). This upsets me. New years comes and I tell myself to forget my ex, move on, and embrace law school even if I don't give a shit about practicing law. I wanted to go into medicine but chickened out on the MCAT due to depression and self-loathing/doubt.


Then I go to my cardiologist for my yearly check up. Well it looks like I'll need open heart surgery as soon as finals are over. Yay me. So much for getting a summer internship. There goes all my motivation to try and do well to stay in law school this semester. I had deleted my ex on fb and Snapchat, but stupidly kept her number. I texted her this morning to let her know I was having surgery in May. Her reply? I'll keep you in my prayers. I don't know what to do anymore. I am worthless.


Why? Why can I not move on? Why can't I let go of her? Why has she moved on so easily and quickly while I'm stuck in the past? 


Why does everyone say the same advice about her? Just move on. You obviously just didn't match well. Feelings aren't factual. Everything happens for a reason. OF COURSE EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. THAT'S BASIC PHYSICS. Stop saying it like it's supposed to comfort me. All it does is remind me of all the times I failed as a boyfriend and make me think she sees me as less than human now. That I'll have some glorified memories of the past forever and she'll look back on our relationship and hate it.


My therapist doesn't even help. I asked her to help me build on life and social skills to move on but all we do is circle back to my ex and how we weren't a good fit. It's infuriating.


Why can't I be normal? Why am I so unhealthy? Why can't I not have a surplus of medical issues? I'm afraid to have any kids because they might have heart problems or mental issues. Fuck that.

Why am I so obsessed over this? Why am I constantly stuck in the past? Why can't I connect with people? Why do I always feel awkward and unwanted? Why can I never express this whenever anyone asks about it or me? Why do I no longer have motivation, drive, determination to do anything?

Why, why, WHY? Why do I feel like I just want to sleep and never wake up? Disclaimer: not suicidal. I could never harm myself. Suicide doesn't make sense to me. Although sometimes I do wish I'd just DIE. I'm just so tired of an apathetic world.

Why do I get small bursts of extreme drive and motivation at all the wrong times, with no way to follow through on them? Why am I stuck in a field I hate, surrounded by people I like and knew more about me? Why can't I take a god damn break from life? Why does everyone expect so much from me? Why do I need these pills to stop feeling miserable? Why does my dad sound so condescending when he says""you're not planning on taking these pills long term right?"" Why does no one understand? Why can't I help myself? Why am I so self centered? Why do I swing between apathy and empathy so strong I want to weep for another person and all the emotions in between?

2srkqf,6,2015-01-17,Just moved to Plano,omy123,plano,https://www.reddit.com/r/plano/comments/2srkqf/just_moved_to_plano/,"Hi everyone,
I just moved to Plano for an internship with a tech company.  I don't know anyone here and thought this might be a good place to start making some friends.  I'm near the Shops at Legacy, what's fun to do around here?"
2ss08h,6,2015-01-17,[Help] I have to sort my life out and get some perspective but I don't know how to fix myself.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2ss08h/help_i_have_to_sort_my_life_out_and_get_some/,"[Warning: long]

Is this anxiety?? I thought it was depression. But maybe they're linked. I don't know what to do anymore, but I am so so tired. I just want to rest. 

There are way too many tracks of thought going on in my head and I really need some way to sort everything out, but the people I do trust enough would be hurt if I told them anything, and they might use some things against me in the future (so maybe I don't really trust them that much?).

Anyway, here's a bit of a brain-dump:

* I've been really really fucking lucky in my life and every day I am reminded by myself that I don't deserve it. I failed my third year of university studying abroad because I fell into a deep depression and started just being mentally out of it, incapable of making decisions, solitary and scared. I lied my way through the end of the year and my parents/friends never found out. The possibility of them realizing I lied (and for parents, wasted so much of their money) terrifies me. I dropped two more classes the following year, which my parents did know about, but had little reaction to except ""well, do what you need to do and get it together."" 

* My work never found out about the failed university courses (I don't think they even saw a transcript) because I had an internship that converted to full time, so I've been given an incredible job opportunity making much more than I probably deserve. I don't know what to do with all this money though, and want to use it wisely, but feel like I'm going to fuck it all up somehow. No loans, a decent savings, and too scared to make any decisions because I'm afraid it will be the wrong one. (Plus, what's the point of a retirement account when you're pretty sure you're going to off yourself someday.. ^(bleak jokes, sorry :] ). I have started a 401k but need to decide what to do with the rest of my savings. ) Like, I'm living at my parents' home now, but they're having marital troubles and I don't have a lot of freedom, so maybe I should move out and be an actual functional adult? But, my work is pretty close, so maybe that's a stupid idea to throw away money on rent and I should stick it out for now and save while I still can? (But then later down the road, keep saving, or buy a house? Or go to grad school? What if I have a repeat of undergrad and start dropping classes?......)

* I don't want to be human. Or alive, really. Bodily functions are so messy and gross, mental health is a chore to keep up, and nothing is very fun (even drugs/alcohol don't work anymore, which is probably a good thing, really)... it all feels foreign, like I am an amorphous being locked in a human body. I tried to fight it; when I was little I would try to go for ages without eating or going to the bathroom.. this developed into a full blown restrictive eating disorder in my teens and then compulsively over eating in my early twenties.. so I've never had a good relationship with my body, even though I've always been in the ""healthy"" weight range, which generates a lot of stress and what I assume is body dismorphia. 

* I'm not a very social person and my self esteem is pretty much a -5 on a scale from 1 to 10. And at 23, I'm getting to the point in life where you're expected to have a decent social group to hang out with, a bit of dating experience, a growing network at work, and so on. I've had only 2 sexual partners and neither were a ""healthy"" experience. (One might've been downright assault, but I'm not sure and would honestly rather just forget about it.) 

* I've sought therapy about 3 times over the last 3 years, but end up ""fleeing"" at various points. The first one started off badly with three doctors interviewing me at once; the entire thing was extremely uncomfortable. The second doctor just put me on medication, which I was scared to take for fear of going even crazier. The third doctor I just couldn't bring myself to trust for various reasons.  

So you know how they say when everywhere you go smells like shit, check under your own shoe? I *know* the issue here is me, but I just don't know how to fix it! And it is quite literally killing me....the idea that you can't outrun yourself. This was the gradual epiphany I had in London, when I realized my dream of studying abroad there had come true and I still was still the same miserable mess I was back at my home uni. By the time I fully understood that I was stuck with myself, I was a neurotic shell of a person. **I really hate myself and have done so for the better part of the last decade.** This reads like a clear case of ""spoiled princess has a quarter life crisis because she was told she was special a few too many times and now realizes not everything goes her way and life isn't fair/fun all the time"", but even if it is, how do I resolve it...

If you made it this far, you're a saint.. truly, thank you for listening..."

I am 27, I have never worked in my life, I have never dated, I do not know how to drive, even so I have tried but I can't drive according to 2 doctors. I been taking anti depressants and anti anxiety medications since I was 15. Even so I did not want to give up due to my conditions. I was able to graduate with honors from college and get into grad school, it is in this part of my life where I believed I had hope and a future, but I was completely wrong.

I almost finished with my master in mental health, but then I discovered that I suffer from paruresis and I was unable to give a sample for a drug test in order to do my internship. This devastated me, but I did not want to give up, not after believing for so long that I had a future finally, I tried again and ended up in the emergency room for drinking too much water, I was scared senseless. But then I did not give up I tried again, and the same result ensued.

I was told that almost all agencies, if not all, require you to pass a drug test, and even if I finished my degree I still have to pass more drug tests to get a job.

Now what I am suppose to do? I had counseling as a teenager, the counselor closed my case and told my brother that I could never function in society, something that haunted me cruelly. But after some time I thought she was wrong and I dare to challenge her and for a moment I believed I had finally, finally believed she was wrong and that I had a future, but now I am back again to the same problem. My mental illness comes back to ruin everything.

I dropped one semester and I was hoping to come back to graduate school, but I think I am pushing things too far, after all I am sick and I won't be able to function, I don't know if I will be able to work, I don't know if I will be able to be like a functional person.

I get so angry and frustrated seeing other people, for they are able to live normal lives, while I keep struggling with the same problems. That is why I do not go out at all, I am at the point where I hate society and everything because no matter how hard I try I can never be part of it.

I do not even think about dating, having sex, or the gay world because I know there is nothing for me in there. The only solution I see is to remain at home all my life, but I worry horribly about my future.

I now hate reality and people, I discovered this forum when I dropped out from the world again, reading about other people's lives and how they go on about them, and thinking I am only an outsider seeing the world pass by without me taking part of it and being unable to do anything at all, nothing at all.

I had tried counseling yet again, but then seeing another fellow mental health worker being able to function, being able to pass those drug tests it is unbearable. Last time I stormed out from the session because I could not take it anymore.

I am being ignorant in believing that I have hope and that someday I will reach those dreams? I am not getting any younger and time is flying pass me. I don't know the answers but for now I will remain living separated from the real world, and maybe on day I will be able to comeback to my life.

Someday.

Please help me, I am suffering so much!!

TL;DR: 27 year old, due to depression and anxiety . Unable to finish my master's due to shy bladder, I don't know what do anymore, counselour gave up on me while young, recent events only confirms that it was true that I could never function in society."

He asked me how much I made an hour and then told me that for my skill level and knowledge I am vastly underpaid.He seemed to be exaggerating a little about the pay but I started looking at salary.com and other similar websites. I always thought I didn't make as much as I could if I went to another company, but didn't think I was underpaid by much.

I started at my current company as a paid intern and they hired me on after. I never really negotiated my new hourly rate and explained that I was upset when they just gave it to me. I do like the company and thats part of the reason why I don't leave and go somewhere closer in SF and get paid more.

I've gained almost all of the 15lbs back now that I'm on campus again. I'm in a much smaller, subrurban area. I've got my eating habits mostly down again in the last couple weeks, but I'm struggling *so much* to get to the gym since I rejoined in November, with having to drive out of my way to get there, and my friends all being nearby.

I'm an extreme extrovert and seriously cannot stand being on my own (""why go to the gym alone when I can watch TV or have a few drinks with a friend instead?"") So I'm looking for some things that I can do with other people to push myself and burn calories.

2ssvnh,1,2015-01-17,I think I've hit a dead end,[deleted],churning,https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/2ssvnh/i_think_ive_hit_a_dead_end/,"Hi! I'm a 19 y/o college student who did some churning last year. My current portfolio consists of:

* Chase Freedom ($2,500)
* Discover It ($1,500)
* BoA Travel Rewards ($3,000)
* Barclay Arrival Plus ($1,500)

Closed Accounts are:

* Barclay Arrival World Mastercard
* United Explorer

Today, I applied and was declined for 3 cards: Citi DoubleCash, Chase Mariott, and Amex Fidelity. The denials were for the same reason: low income. As a full-time student, between my summer internship and my TA job, I make about 6500/yr. I have to admit that these denials caught me off-guard. All of my approvals used the same income. My FAKO's for TU and Equifax are 757 and 763, respectively. While I did have a lot of inquires in 2014 (none after September, though), I have no derogatory marks.

I closed the United card today, after 5 months of use. The Chase analyst I spoke with today lectured me about being lucky to have been approved for the card in the first place, never mind its high limit ($5,200, then increased to $6,700 by Chase). Since I already got the miles I needed, I decided that enough was enough. 

My master plan was to use the United card and the Mariott card to pay for my summer trip to Tucson, where my aunt lives. I used the Barclay World card to pay for it last year. She is an unbelievable aunt, so I make it a point to try to visit her each summer. 

Aside from that, I had planned to use either the DoubleCash or the Fidelity card as my every day card for the 2% cash back. I don't do any traveling besides the aforementioned annual summer trips, so I think a cash rewards card better-suits me than a travel rewards card.

So, I guess my question is where do I go from here? Should I go forward with what I have, or should I look elsewhere?

Thank you all so much! : )         "

Sorry for the wall of text but I just needed to type this out. Never posted on Reddit before and I'm not even sure if anyone will answer, just needed to get it off my chest. 

Story goes like this: At the end of summer I had to go back to school as she stayed home because she was already graduated and had a job. It was always difficult leaving her and doing distance but this was my last semester away so we thought it would be easier then in the past. 
Around late september she starts making new friends at her job and decides that she wants to go out with drinks with them on a Friday night. I was so happy for her that she was making new friends at her new job! 
So one Friday we're texting all day up to about 3pm, talking about our days and how she was excited to go out with them, then, mid conversation, she didn't respond. After texting her around 10pm asking if she was still out and okay, and then calling her around 11pm, I get a text around 12am saying that she's sorry she didn't check her phone, they were busy celebrating someone's birthday, and on top of that her car is having problems and that she's going to have to stay the night at one of her new friends. Of course he's a guy, we'll call him Ryan, but he has a girlfriend (which I don't find out till the next day), but a roommate who does not have a girlfriend (this will be important in a little bit).
Her commute is about 40 min to work, so she didn't want to have a family member come out and pick her up at that hour, or have someone drive her when everyone's been drinking. I understood that and told her I was a little upset that I didn't get a text for about 9 hours even giving me an update, and then she would be staying at Ryan's house when I've never met him but I understand her situation and tell her as long as she feels safe I trust her and her instinct to stay there. 
The next day, I just explained to her how upsetting it made me and how bad it kind of looks to not get a text for 9 hours when we were mid conversation, and then conveniently her car won't work and she'll have to stay at Ryan's house. She apologized but explained that he has a girlfriend and said sorry again for not texting and saying how everyone was busy celebrating. So then I apologized it was just a little upsetting and we made up and went back on to our normal great relationship. 
She came to visit over Halloween and everything was normal, I thought. We'd be texting each other every day, calling every once in awhile just to hear each others voice. But then again, on a Friday night she decides not to talk to me at all, and then into Saturday as well till about 2pm. Then she texts me saying sorry she, Ryan, his girlfriend, and his roommate were up all night playing games, and then went to breakfast in the morning. And that caught my attention. This other roommate. My girlfriend never really had a problem texting me when she was with her girl friends, or close guy friends, the ones I've met and could hold a conversation with because they're great guys. But for some reason this irked me a little that she felt like she didn't have to, or didn't want to when she was with the roommate, we'll call him Kyle. Kyle is around 27, works in the same type of industry as my girlfriend so they have some in common. So this kind of makes me jealous in the first place because here's an older guy who has a job, no debt, ready to get settled. And finishing up school and will be doing an internship in the spring. 
I let it go because I trust her, love her, and don't think she'd ever do anything with him because they've only known each other for a few months. Fast forward to December. I notice they're friends on Facebook, Snapchat (he's one of her ""best friends"" on the app, which means they snap chat each other a lot) and again I let it go. However, when I got back from school, graduated, she texted me asking if it was okay if she went to get lunch with him because he was in town visiting family. I told her I was uneasy about it but I don't want to be the boyfriend that doesn't let her hangout with other guys. She was very happy and said she'll talk to me later. Well, 6 hours later I get a text saying that they're now getting a few beers at a bar in town. This made me very upset. I texted her that night, while she was still out saying how I think they should stop hanging out and how it's unfair to me yada yada yada and that I'll talk to her tomorrow. And she doesn't respond for another hour or so and just says she made it home safe and that she loves me. 
We talked the next day, I apologize that I texted her that and I should have brought it up in person and she never really apologized for anything. I was just happy to be with her. After Christmas her fam goes on a vacation, all the while I can still see they're snapchatting back and forth on her page, she gets back and everything seemed kind of tense. Couple days later, she again had to spend the night at Ryan and Kyle's place after work because the weather was too bad for her to drive 40 minutes home. Same thing next day, snow advisory so she couldn't leave. Throughout her entire time there (2 days) we probably talked for a total 30 minutes. 
When she finally comes home, I go over in the morning and she apologizes for how crazy the past couple days were and I finally tell her fine, if you want to be weird about it and not text me when you're with him that's fine. I won't bug you anymore. Then I asked for a final time if he's ever tried to get with you or made a move on you and she straight up tells me no. So we both apologize, have a good talk, laugh, kiss, we talk about her vacation and all that. Not even 30 minutes later, her phone goes off right next to us and guess who it is. It's him, and the text says, ""I can't stop thinking of you..."" 
I ask her what that's about and she says nothing. I ask her why he's texting her that and she says she doesn't know. So now I'm getting pissed and ask if she was sure nothing ever happened and she said he kissed her on the cheek once. So I'm upset, not screaming, more of just staring in space like, ""wtf am I supposed to do here?"" So I ask her that and she says, ""nothing, it was just a kiss on the cheek."" 
The thing that made me most upset is that she lied to me. I asked her back in December if he's ever tried to make a move on her and she said ""no"", and then I asked her again and she said, ""no."" But then five minutes later she tells me yes. It just makes me think if I didn't see that text, would she have ever told me? What happened the night her car was having problems, or the other times she hasn't been texting me, or when he took her out to lunch. All of that has just been stuck in my head. So after I see the text and I ask her what she's going to do about it, if she thinks it's okay to keep talking to him, and hanging out with him. She says he's a good friend so she doesn't know, and then she starts crying and bringing up how if I noticed how we've been off lately? So she just completely changed the subject from her and ryan to me and her. I did notice how the past couple months have been a little off, but nothing worth breaking up over. We both just figured it was because of distance and that once I was back for good it would all go back to normal. I guess it didn't. However, I never really feel like I got the chance to hangout with her alone once I was back from graduating. We both live with our parents so there's never any alone time where we can be romantic. I tried to explain that to her how we just haven't had time alone and she wasn't buying it. 
She came over later that night so we could talk some more and she just explained how she doesn't feel the spark anymore when we kiss and how she doesn't know what to do. She spent the night one last time and then in the morning I drove her home. It was a very tough night, a lot of talking, crying, and trying to figure what we could do to make it work but she felt it was best to kind of take a break and have some space. 
We've taken a couple breaks before so at the beginning I was like, ""it's okay, in a couple months we'll be back together, I just need to show her I'm sorry."" But then it hit me. Those past breakups was because of me doing something stupid, and I won her back by apologizing to her and showing I'm different, this time around I can't apologize because I didn't do anything wrong, I just have to try and hope she falls in love with me again. 
Throughout the night I kept telling her that she was the one for me and even though we're going to be taking a break, that it doesn't ruin my goal of marrying you, because I know for a fact she is the one. It's just hard knowing for the first time in three years, she might not feel the same way. 
When I dropped her off that next morning we had our teary goodbyes, she said sorry for making me feel this way and I just kept telling her that I want her to be happy, and that our paths will cross again and that I know I'm the man for her, but I need her to find that out on her own. I also told her to be careful with Ryan, and that I don't want her getting hurt. And she reassured me not to worry about him because she's going to be too busy thinking about me. That gave me some optimism. 
The next five days we texted each other at the end of our days asking how they were, me trying to sneak an ""I love you"" in there and seeing if she responds. A couple times she did, but she has yet to say it first. I bring up how maybe we can see each other soon to talk and she says, ""yeah, maybe."" The last time we talked was on a Thursday night so I asked her if she was going to be going out with all of them Friday and she said yeah. So I didn't bother her at all Friday because I knew she wouldn't respond but I also don't want to look crazy. Waited to get a text all day Saturday and never got one so I figure she spent the night there again, so I texted her Saturday night just saying how I miss her hope she had a good time going out last night and a good day then I said something about how she's always on my mind and if I can do anything let me know. Didn't get a response. I see they're still snap chatting and all that and I just try and tell myself that maybe it's not meant to be, and that I should be upset with her for not giving me some respect or telling the truth but I just can't keep that attitude for more then five minutes before I check my phone to see if she texted me. 
There's just something about her that I just can't stay upset with. She's been my only serious girl, and I just don't know if I should fight for her or if I should just give her space. 
I love her to death. It just sucks because we've been dating for so long always talking about how we're going to get married, have our kids names picked out, and all that. And then she gets the job, and it felt like she met this new guy and it all stopped. Then she dropped a bomb on me saying she doesn't feel the spark anymore and that she needs some time to figure out what she wants. But during this time we've taken apart she texts me saying she loves me, but I don't know if she means as like a friend or a boyfriend or what. I'm just confused and all my friends are back at school and she was the only one I had back home and now I have nothing.
I don't even need anyone to respond really, just felt good typing it all out. Sorry for so much text. 

TL;DR: GF of 5 years gets new job, makes new friends, one of them is a single guy, she doesn't text me when she's with him and all his friends, I try and bring it up but never gets solved, two months later they're closer and we're further apart, she doesn't feel that same spark and now we're on a break I think.

2stf3c,1,2015-01-18,To my friend,[deleted],UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/2stf3c/to_my_friend/,"This letter is titled to my friend and it is with regret that ""friend"" is all you will ever be.

It's not your fault. It's really not. When we had our break up, delayed though it might have been, it was I who was quick with the assurances that  ""friend"" was what we were meant to be. I who told you that things wouldn't be weird, that our friendship was able to withstand the severing of our romance. I have nobody to blame but myself for our awkward dance. This does not make it easier.

My parents tell me to forget you. I know that I have a bright future ahead of me, that you would hold me back, that you are concerned with the small life in front of you and I have the world ahead of me. I nod my head and agree with them. They, even in their conservative and protective worldview, have approved of me bringing random girls into their home, if it would help me get over you.

God, what a train wreck you are. So uncertain, so unfocused, so adrift in the world. What will you do? Where will you go, who will you meet, where will life take you? You don't know and still feel so comfortable. 

That is what you gave to me. A sense of peace in the unordered and yet perfect cosmic order of the universe. When I was with you, I couldn't help but feel that wherever life took me, it would be alright. And not only have I lost that with you, my anxiety has been intensified.

Didn't you notice me? When I lost the weight, when I learned (not one, but two) foreign languages, when I got an internship, when I pulled a 4.0? I told myself I was doing it to spite you - to ""earn"" someone better than you. I was lying to myself. I was doing it to impress you. What a fucking joke - you couldn't care less, and that was why I loved you. To you, I am the same person regardless of what I can put on a resume - and that person is not somebody you want to be with.

I'm sorry. I can't see you any more. I can't tell you my secrets and trust you to hold them (you have always held them so faithfully - how can I resent you - you have been faultless in all this). I can't hear about the men in your life. I can't shake their hand and be introduced as ""one of your best friends"". I can't. I won't. I don't know what I'll do, but I'm running away to somewhere - if there's anything I've learned from you, it's to groove in the uncertainty.

What will I say to you, years hence when I see you? When I attend your wedding, or you mine (no, I won't begrudge you that)? It's so unfair. Why do I pine over you, and you are able to move on so ably?

There's nothing to be done for it. C'est la vie and onwards forwards. But if I could for once get drunk without thinking of you…a few more beers and sleep will take me (do you remember how I used to get drunk, I would sleepwalk around your apartment and you would take me back to bed!). 

Goodnight, goodbye. Tomorrow I will be convinced I am over you and start applying for jobs far away. Tonight I know I am not.

I would be very grateful if y'all could have a look and let me know what you think. I'm ultimately going to send this to a proofreader, so don't worry too much about the grammar etc (Lord knows I didn't).

Please give me your opinions about whether this is a catchy opening, if you find it funny, and if there's anything that's unclear.

WORM: DEMON ATTORNEY AT LAW

Mel Garvol stood rooted to the spot. His secretary had said something to him that he only half listened to, and a few seconds later there was a demon standing on the other side of his desk.

The demon was taller than him, about six foot. He had the body of a human man, with a couple of notable differences. There was a crown of horns growing out of his bald head and his skin was the colour of blood. The demon's eyes were two empty pits. Its mouth was smiling an unnaturally wide smile showing off perhaps a hundred thin, dagger-like yellow teeth. He was wearing a cheap, three-piece suit.

“Please, I don’t want to die, my time can’t be up yet,” said Garvol, weakly.

The demon looked confused. ""I think you’re thinking of someone else.”

The portly lawyer’s shoulders relaxed slightly, then tensed again when he realised that he inevitably had to ask the next question: ""then why are you here?""

The demon smiled and handed him a completed application form. ""The legal apprenticeship. I saw that you were hiring and I wondered if you could squeeze me in for an interview.""

The demon sat down in one of the chairs on the other side of Mel's desk. Garvol, his suit soaked with sweat at the armpits - more so than usual - took his own, comfier, seat at the other side. 

“Oh, I see,” said Garvol, his hands trembling, “we normally like to read over the application forms first, then decide which candidates we want to invite for interview."" Garvol tried to estimate how quickly he could run out the door. Not very, was his estimation. He racked his brain for any scrap of information he had about banishing a demon, but nothing came to mind.

The demon sat patiently, smiling the whole time.

""Um, yes, well. Why don't you tell me about yourself Mr?""

""Worm,"" said Worm. 

Garvol winced at the name, but didn't know why. ""A-and your education? I see from your application form you studied in Maverro... two hundred years ago?”

""Yes, that's correct. Although you'll see that I've updated my learning with a further degree from Unity College. I was very keen to get back up to date with the law before returning to  practice,"" he lied.

""Yes of course. And your extra-curricular activities..."" The lawyer began reading the list on the application form before shuddering and averting his eyes.

He cleared his throat, and sat up straight. He performed a small internal routine he'd learned as a young lawyer trying to hide his fear from judges with ice-cold stared. In a clear voice he told Worm ""I'm sorry, I don't think that there's anything we can offer you.""

Worm continued to smile. Somehow his eyeless pits became darker. In fact, everything became darker. Garvol had a corner office in the building, which was glass on two sides. Either the weather had taken a sudden turn for the worse, or the suns had disappeared out of the sky completely. Garvol stared directly into where Worm's eyes should have been, fearing that if he looked away something truly horrifying would happen. The demon's mouth moved and Garvol was vaguely aware of noise. The 'words' - if they could even be called words - were audible, but seemed to be in no language that Garvol had ever heard before. Nevertheless, he understood them.

""Well that's a very interesting way of putting it, Mr Worm, I'd never thought about it like that before. I do believe we can offer you a legal apprenticeship here after all.""

Worm spoke to him again in the wordless tongue.

""Yes, I think we can start you today. Last year’s apprentices have now moved onwards and upwards, so all the offices are free.""

Garvol stood up from his chair and led Worm out of the office. Both the man and the demon had broad grins across their faces. Garvol’s secretary Vera marked this as odd. In the thirty years they had worked for him, not once had they seem so much as a hint of a smile on his broad, pale face. Garvol and Worm stopped at the firm’s typing pool.

“Ladies, this is Mr Worm, he will be our newest legal apprentice.”

The secretaries, all middle-aged women with a zero-tolerance approach to nonsense glared at Worm over the tops of their spectacles. Worm smiled his yellow-toothed grin broadly at them.

“It’s a pleasure to meet all of you,” he said. Several of the secretaries screamed, some got up and ran out of the office, others hid under their desks, and some - being made of sterner stuff - gave the demon a glance then returned to their work.

Garvol led him through the main office. Worm smiled and said hello to each of his new co-workers as he passed by their cubicles. This caused about the same level of panic as would a visit from a coven of hungry vampires. Tens of hastily scribbled notes were sent through the mail tubes from clerks to their loved ones tellling them that they loved them and hoped they would meet again someday. Coffee mugs, piles of paper, office equipment, and interns were thrown out of the way as secretaries tried to hastily make good their escape from the demon.

“I don’t know what’s gotten them all riled up like this. Normally they’re a very level-headed bunch,” Garvol said to Worm over his shoulder.

“Oh don’t worry, they’ll get used to me.”

Garvol led Worm down a narrow corridor off the main office lined with doors on either side.

“This is you here,” said Garvol, opening the door to a room barely larger than a closet. It contained a desk with an uncomfortable leather chair behind it, and an empty bookcase.

Cosy, thought the demon.

“So, boss, what’s my first task?”

“Well normally we have the apprentice lawyers provide administrative support to the fully qualified lawyers for the first few months, to see how it’s done, then we’ll take it from there.”

“I don’t think that’ll be necessary in my case,” said Worm again in the strange wordless tongue.

Garvol prided himself on being a difficult man to persuade of anything, it had taken his first wife six months to convince him that blue was an acceptable colour for their downstairs bathroom, but his brain, his gut, and everything in between told him that what the demon was saying to him was correct beyond a shadow of a doubt.

“Well I suppose we could let you sit in on a trial this morning...”

“I reckon I could run a trial.”

Garvol’s heart missed a beat, but Worm’s dagger-toothed smile seemed to tell him that everything would be okay.

“Yes, yes I think you can. I have a jury trial that I was planning on letting one of my associates handle, but I think you could be the man for the job. I’ll get you the file.”

Garvol began to walk, quickly, back up the corridor. Worm called after him:

“Oh, and Mel, why don’t you bring down my apprenticeship contract. I think we should get that signed before we forget.”

Garvol thought that this was a wonderful idea, and nodded enthusiastically."

Before we got together, we used to hang out as friends and he was trying to convince Girl X to commit into a LDR with him (December 2012). Girl X didn't want to and 3 months later, poof we became a couple. From what I understand, Girl X was a former classmate of 2 years and he had a crush on her throughout, before they decided to date briefly in 2011, until she ended things. Girl X is basically his ideal type of girl - incredibly skinny, spritely, etc. 

Just 3 months ago, we were separated for awhile for 2 weeks - I was in another country for an internship, etc etc. When I came back, there was an occasion once where we were going through his photo album in his iPhone to locate a certain picture - no invasion of privacy here, mind you, we were looking for the picture together - and lo and behold, I come across pictures stolen off Girl X's social media. Was very upset and confronted him about it, his reason was that he was 'just looking' and it was 'hard' not to since she was always appearing on his social media feed. Decided to compromise by deleting her off all his social media - fb, instagram, etc. I personally found it very creepy and quite abhorrent to my feminist side. 

In the meantime I feel as if he's withdrawing from me physically/sexually. We no longer have as much sex as we used to and more often than not it's just about him quickly pumping and I don't even get an orgasm. I've asked him about it and he admits that he has been masturbating in private. I also suspect he may still be looking up Girl X in private because he has been very cautious with his electronic devices and recently started changing passwords and washing out his entire web history (sometimes I use his laptop when we're watching a show or movie together). 

I've tried to put this behind and get past it - but I admit, I recognise that I have genuine trust issues. That and coupled with my anxiety issues - I was diagnosed with anxiety + depression on-off and I'm currently on the brink of graduating from law school, so high levels of stress (e.g. job searching, graduating with good grades) - has led me to bouts of downwards spiraling thinking. Maybe I'm just a horribly crazy, paranoid and anxious individual that needs to get a grip but I feel like all these events have really put a dent in my self-esteem and I constantly feel like I'm not good enough. 

Would genuinely love some advice - dealing with my trust issues especially. I can't bring myself to talk to any of my friends about it because I don't want anyone to know the extent of my craziness and I'm not really a fan of airing relationship dirty laundry. 


---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend saves pictures of girl he used to date, suspect he may still be doing so. Sex life has gone down. Lots of trust issue and self-doubt on my part. "

My name is Charlie Thompson, and I am a 17 year old VR enthusiast who probably spends too much time on this sub. I've been working with my DK2 since October, and as soon as I tried it out I knew it would change things.

I am extremely excited about VR and all that I think will happen, especially in education. I've been working on a personal project that is also related to VR - I have been preparing to build a first-person VR camera. (website: http://www.fieldtripvr.com/) (Render pics &gt; http://www.fieldtripvr.com/about-us/)

There is an entrepreneurship class at my school, and I have been working on my project in it. We are making a trip to Palo Alto this March, and I would love to show the people at Oculus my idea and use their ideas and criticisms to do a better job building it.

I feel like I was born too late to be a real part of Oculus (at least at this point), and I don't have nearly the specific skills to actually contribute right now. But if I can get into contact with them, do you guys think they would let me be an intern or a general helper this summer if I offer to do it for free? Just being at the center of the VR world and getting experience and skills would be payment enough for me.

So if you guys have any questions or criticisms of my idea, I'd love to hear them :-) And if you have any suggestions about reaching out to Oculus about an internship I would be extremely grateful.

Thanks!

In this case the reason for the age-regression would be natural or medical, applied consciously by you when I (perhaps) visit you during office hours or we decide to meet up after class at your house.

**2) Colleagues.** You're a college intern at my company or organization, and I'm your mentor, training you to do some facet of my job so that I no longer have to. It starts when I find that you're getting cozy with me at times--not intimately, but maybe you're comfortable working in ""close conditions,"" you might say. Our personalities work together really well; you're outgoing and enjoy having fun and joking with me to cut through the sometimes-boredom of work. When I teach you a new concept or some computer program, you strive to put it to memory, because you know I'll quiz you on it in the near future! We could enter the age-regression through me tricking you (but perhaps you realizing it and being okay with it) with a spell or potion. So that our interactions are not dependent on the workplace, perhaps we live near one another as well.

**3) Doctor-patient.** I'm a cavalier cancer physician who thinks he can cure your carcinoma and many others by my new, secret, age-regression therapy. This one is not well developed in my mind, so you have more blanks to fill in here. Ideally you begin as a single woman under 40, and it may perhaps involve you becoming a live-in patient with me. You may have gone first to other doctors who were pessimistic about your chances for long-term survival, but something about my optimism and enthusiasm causes you to select my clinic for your treatment.

**4) Potpourri!** I'm open to other ideas and kinks here. We could be college students in a relationship, husband-wife, brother-sister, neighbors, whatever. Throw something at me: the only things I consider off-limits are poop, rape, violence, gore, and animals.

In my mind, your character fully consents to the age-regression at the time of the application of its impetus, though as you enter the age-regressed personality (with its physical characteristics, too) you would begin to experience those attendant feelings or hesitations, whether they are expressed or not expressed to my character. Between our ""encounters,"" I thought that you would return, at least briefly, to your character's starting age, if for no other reason than that we're not in a committed relationship and you wouldn't want to arouse suspicion about your ""condition"" to others. I'm open to your thoughts on both of these things, though! 

-----------------------------------

Ideal RP partners for me are able to contribute several times a week, if not daily. You should be articulate and able to express yourself well, comfortable with details and slow build-up. I'm open to chatting on an instant messenger platform, but I prefer the RP to be in the form of 2-4 paragraph reddit PMs. I usually play in the first person, but if you have other strongly held preferences, I'm open to entertaining them too. 

In your first message, please tell me (at the very least) the option from above that you'd like to explore and your low-age limit, plus any other ideas or questions you have at this preliminary juncture. Please don't start the RP right away, as we have a lot to discuss together before that happens!"
2sw8r1,3,2015-01-18,The Me who Drinks,zelkovafr,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/2sw8r1/the_me_who_drinks/,"You aren't supposed to drink if you're bipolar. It seems that many do anyway. This is a post about my relatively short experience with alcohol. It's not meant to be any sort of reference to anyone, but I need to lay out out, process it, maybe get some other opinions.

My parents gave me small amounts of alcohol for much of my life. Never much, but it was okay, and I enjoyed it. I more or less maxed out at two glasses of wine. I stayed clean of pretty much everything through high school, which looking back, is probably a good thing.

Last year, I came to college. That's when I started really drinking. It's also when I hit what I call my ""rock bottom."" Aside from consistent nightmares, hella intrusive thoughts, and being in a general mental state where I should have been in a mental hospital, I started drinking during the day. It cooled me out. A shot or two to prep for Calc. I probably would've had a panic attack without it, but its nature as a depressant contributed to a downward emotional spiral. A lot of really bad things in my life were converging and multiplying, which the alcohol did as well.

A few months later I cleaned up my act and cleaned up my life. I started meds. Starting meds was one of the best and most important decisions in my life. With the bipolar out of the way (albeit still present) I was able to jump at everything else. Trying to deal with everything at without the drugs was like trying to defend myself when I couldn't control my hands.

I'm a student. I have an internship. I volunteer. I have a workout schedule. My free time is Friday and Saturday nights. I drink almost exclusively those nights. Most times I drink one, but not the other. Sometimes I drink both. Occasionally I take a break, especially if I drank particularly heavily the last two weeks. If I'm not with friends, I don't drink or drink very little. I've never blacked out completely, and I've never woken up particularly regretful of my actions. I like being intoxicated. I feel that it enables me to express a part of myself that can't be otherwise expressed. Also, when I wake up the morning after, I feel like I burned off all of the negativity from the week and am ready to start fresh. 

I don't know if I could handle the week without that. It seems to me like that's just my way of blowing off steam. I guess, technically, that's a form of dependence. Maybe it's a symptom of my schedule, but I'm much worse when I don't keep busy. When I wake up the morning after, I'm inspired. I clean, eat healthier, get work done - it's like I'm burning really clean. But it doesn't feel like before, where I needed it to get through the day.

Drinking lets me be a part of myself that I don't get to be sober. I can have more honest conversations, and I feel like joint intoxications furthers the bonds between me and my friends. Maybe I'm wrong, and I'm walking a dangerous road. Since my recovery, I have come to trust in my judgement to realize when things are going too far, because historically, for me, it's been by far the best indicator I've had. The input of others, especially others with similar experiences who have walked different paths, is nonetheless invaluable."

2swg86,3,2015-01-18,Help with internship preparation,T13397,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/2swg86/help_with_internship_preparation/,"I'm a 2nd year college student going to school for construction management right now and just landed an internship for this summer and into the future and had a couple questions on how to be more prepared. The internship will start off with ground level hammer swinging work, something I've loved doing for the remodeling company I work for now, then moving into an office where I can get a feel for the project management side of things. My question is what would you suggest in terms of necessary/required tools for the job. I've got a pretty large set right now, but I'm wondering if there is anything really important I'll need that a remodel company might not use. The kinda stuff I'll probably need everyday 

Next I'm curious what kind of tool belt set up if any is preferred. 

Also looking for recommendations on a good pair of boots, I've got a decent set now, but it's time for an upgrade for this internship. 

The reason I'm asking now is to spread out some of the cost before I'll need it. I'll be working on commercial buildings mostly assisting in carpentry. I'll be getting more details in a month or so but really wanted to get on this asap.

Thanks in advance for any help! "

A note: this is really long, partially because I am never going to be able to tell this story to anyone I know for reasons that are obvious, and partially because I had easily the best sex of my life last night and as a long-time reader here, I thought many of you would want all the juicy details.  Feel free to skip to the good stuff below.

So the backstory on me:  I co-founded a company straight out of college, and things went well.  It got bigger and bigger, and a couple years ago we were bought by a much larger company.  They were based on the East Coast and we weren’t, and I was a life-long Cali resident with no desire to move to a gloomy northeastern city… this meant that in order to close the deal, the company buying us had to agree to let us open and run a West Coast office.  My partner took a buyout and split, but I stayed on.  This had an interesting effect- even though I’m probably #15 or so in the company, I’m the top guy in the West Coast office with about 50 employees working under me, give or take, which makes me look a lot more powerful than I actually am.

Most people at the company are young, with late twenties/early thirty being the average.  When you're in charge of a large group of young people and are fairly young yourself (and you care about the consequences), you get quickly used to being the responsible one.  Our company is full of high pressure all-nighters, travel and a lot of social drinking.  But as a young, unmarried executive, the first thing everyone tells you is to leave your dick in your pants, and that lesson stuck with me.  Most of our employees are women, and most of them quite attractive, but I've always kept a firm line in my head and have never once crossed it, despite loads of temptation and opportunity.  At least, until last night.

We have a robust intern program, so there's usually five or six new college grads running around the office at any given time. I don't interact with them much, so I don’t pay much attention (or do the hiring).  So when we started a new crop a couple weeks ago, I didn't notice Shelley.  

Shelley was pretty but a little bit plain, and not really my type at all.  Chinese-American, with a pretty face usually lit with a great smile, black hair pulled back in a ponytail but usually with a little hair coming out of each side.  She was tiny: 5-foot-3 and very skinny, with no real hint of any curves under her ""not quite sure how to dress in an office so going to dress like my mom"" outfits- lots of pantsuits and not terribly flattering jacket/blouse combos, even though the office attire here is generally pretty casual.  I'm an ass-and-tits man through and through, so I didn't really pay her much attention.  At first.

Obligatory paragraph about me: I'm not the most handsome man in the world but I do alright and take care of myself: 6-foot-3, spend time at the gym, well-groomed and very well-dressed, thanks to my girlfriend of the last six months taking over shopping duties for me.  I put a lot of my twenties into working, and now that the money’s come in, I like to have fun and so I haven’t caught the marriage bug yet.  I could see maybe getting there with the woman I’m dating now, but monogamy has been tough for the last four months, and I confess I’ve missed the good times I had on Tindr.  

I like life, I’m happy and I try to make my staff feel welcome, so I try and make a round of small talk with everyone as I make my way through the office in the morning. That part's important, because I noticed on Monday that when I stopped by the ""intern corner"" to say good morning, Shelley looked totally different.  Clearly she'd had a makeover over the weekend- new haircut and a new outfit comprised of a tight pencil skirt that showed off what looked like a nice little ass, and a white blouse with one extra button undone, showing off some very smooth, almost porcelain skin… and some previously undiscovered B-cup breasts.  She had gone from plain jane to absolute knockout in a weekend.  I of course kept it together, but unlike the nervous ""hi""s the other interns usually gave me, Shelley gave me a huge smile and asked what I did over the weekend- pretty bold for an intern, at least compared to the norm.  I politely answered and made my way to my office, where I shook it off and got to work on the pile of papers on my desk.

Over the week, it seemed like she was making an effort to bump into me when she could.  I'd go to get some tea in the kitchen, and she'd suddenly show up to make some coffee, and a little small talk.  I'd walk out to go to a lunch meeting and she'd walk across the office and smile when she’d catch my eye before I could make it to the door.  At one point, she was talking to someone whose desk was right outside my door, and I looked up to see her bent down with her ass pointed right at me.  It was awkward to stand there- was she doing that on purpose?  Nah.

Friday is when it finally clicked for me that something was definitely up.  She “caught me in the kitchen” like she’d been doing all week, but today she stood extra close… way closer than she needed to.  Asked a few too many questions about what I was doing this weekend, and at one point, put her hand casually on my arm when laughing at a joke.  Now I’ve been around a bit, and I absolutely know that move.  But again- there's a line, so I kept my cool. Was actually pretty proud of myself.  You get yourself out of a situation smartly and you win- plus you can always jerk off to it later.  Easy enough.

So, onto my big fuck-up.

With the girlfriend out of town for the weekend, I decided to take a day to get ahead of some projects I was running a little behind on.  As I arrived to what I expected to be an empty office, I was surprised to see several cars in front.  I walked in to find one of my junior staff and a few of the interns, one of whom was (of course) Shelley, who looked a little too happy to see me for my comfort.  I nodded, but kept going straight to my office.  Turns out there was a big project the interns were working on this weekend, and I hadn’t noticed the email about it.  Gulp.

I got to work, when suddenly my employee popped in looking pale, and informed me he wasn't feeling well and if it was ok for him to leave early.  Since there were four interns there and they were busy with tasks, I didn't see much of an issue, and besides, he looked like death.  

Around lunchtime, I ordered some delivery for everyone, and decided to be social and eat with the gang in the conference room.  This was mistake #1- I hadn’t thought this through.  Throughout lunch, I couldn't stop looking at Shelley.  Everyone was dressed casually, and Shelley was wearing yoga pants and a tight, grey tank top under a light white jacket.  I snuck a glance as she grabbed a soda, and her ass looked amazing, nice and tight. I also noticed that Shelley had some very hard nipples.  Even though her jacket was covering them, whenever she turned or moved her arm, you could see them clear as day.  I couldn't help but sneak a few looks when the opportunity arose, and at one point, she clearly caught me doing so.  Mistake #2.

I quickly looked away, but I am certain I saw her mouth form a slight smile.  Busted.  With lunch almost done, I made a quick exit and went back to my office to work, trying my best to avoid her for the rest of the day, and was pretty successful at it.  Around 5, one of the interns knocked on my door and said they were all done and leaving for the day.  I was relieved (and a little disappointed not to get a last look at Shelley), said goodbye, and got back to work.

About an hour later I was wrapping up, when I heard the faint BEEP of a keycard letting someone in door.  Could’ve been the cleaning lady, could’ve been someone dropping by to grab a hard drive or some papers, it could’ve be anyone- but I knew who it was.  A faint knock at my open door and a ""Hi Mr. Throwawaybadhuman, are you busy?"" and my hopes/fears were realized—there was Shelley.

Now I have to come clean- this is my fuck-up, and it was a conscious decision.  I know what I did was wrong.  I have a girlfriend.  I have common sense.  I wasn’t drunk, wasn’t stoned, wasn’t lonely, and I was not particularly overcome with lust.  Everything in my brain was telling me not to, but I said ""just wrapping up, come on in!"" and invited her to sit down, knowing exactly what I was doing.  I wanted her, she’d been giving me signs all weeks that she felt the same- and that was without me making any effort at all.  What would happen if I did?

She came and sat down, and seemed instantly at ease.  In hindsight, I realize that I never actually asked why she'd come back, and she never actually made any effort told me.  We talked for a little while, at first about work and office stuff, then slowly getting into the personal.  She asked a few personal questions, and I did the same.  It was pretty clear to me that she was no wide-eyed little girl, like some recent grads can be.  Shelley was a woman, a very young one, but one that was confident in herself and seemingly in on the game.  Maybe I'm saying that as an excuse.  But I have to say the conversation felt less like a boss-employee talk than it did a date after fifteen minutes.  She made jokes, I made jokes, and the conversation started to get a little flirty, nothing obvious but neither of us was shying away from things that were clearly inappropriate.

The windows were shut and the A/C was off, and after about a half hour in my office it was getting a little warm in the room.  She fanned herself a little bit, and then she took off her jacket, leaving this beautiful young thing in front of me in a tight tank top and yoga pants.  Any blood left in my brain was gone elsewhere at that point.  

I decided it was time to pour a drink and asked her if she'd like one, and she said she would.  I went out to the kitchen to grab some glasses and ice, and I came back to find Shelley in my chair, feet on my desk.  “Are you gunning for my job?” I asked, and she smirked a little and said “well, not your job.”

**----------THE GOOD STUFF----------**

We locked eyes for what was maybe three seconds, but those three seconds felt like an hour to me.  She stood up and moved to past me to give me my chair back, but as she brushed to get past me she put both her hands on my chest and stopped.  I put one hand on her hip and looked in her eyes, basically to say “are you sure” without breaking the mood by saying it.  

She was.  We kissed, hard.  Sometimes when you kiss someone the first time, it starts soft and you get into it slowly… not here.  We went for it.  Tongues going hard, it was intense.  After a little bit I moved my hand down to her ass, almost having to stoop to get to it, she was so short.  I went down the curve of her back, and her right ass cheek almost fit into one hand perfectly.  I grabbed it, hard, and she let out the sexiest moan I’ve ever heard come from a girl in my life.

I picked her up, putting her down on the side of my desk.  She leaned back slightly (I think she may had a vision of pushing all of the stuff off my desk so we could go at it right there, but while that sexy in the movies in real life not so easy to do with a big monitor, coffee cups, and piles of papers) but I pulled her back in closer to me and moved a hand up to her breast, never breaking the kiss.   She was perfectly lined up with me, and she put one hand behind herself for leverage as she began to grind against my bulge and unbutton my shirt while I continued to grope at her breasts and kiss the smooth, flawless skin on her neck.  I could feel her hard nipples through her bra.  I had to see these tits, now.

I pulled her off the desk and put her against the wall, a little bit suddenly and a little bit too roughly.  She let out a gasp, but the kind of gasp where you know it’s ok.  She reached down and fumbled with my belt, I lifted her tank top up, exposing a tasteful bra, black but mostly sheer, covering tits that were a bit bigger than I expected.  I wanted that bra out of the way but before I got to it, she won her battle with the button on my jeans and in a single move, stuck her hand in my boxers and pulled out my cock, giving it a few nice tugs before she broke our kiss.  

It felt so good it caused me to stop for a second, though I quickly reached down to rub her through her yoga pants.  After a few seconds she looked down at my cock and looked back at me with a gleam in her eye, and playfully pushed me towards my couch. (Now about my cock- look, much as I’d like to I don’t have an 11” porno cock for you guys, but I am packing a thick, uncut 7” that I’ve not heard complaints about- hope that’ll do.  Seems /gonewild is often full of porno cocks, even though the real world doesn’t work that way, but honesty’s the name of the game here.)   

I took the cue and sat down, locking the door on the way, and she took a second to peel off those yoga pants, revealing a shiny black string thong that looked practically bodypainted onto her.  I took a second to look at her beautiful little body, her porcelain white skin perfectly framed by her long black hair (still in a ponytail), a sheer black bra and black thong.   Turns out an ever-so-slight slight hourglass figure was hiding under those clothes, and there was not a single ounce of fat on her body.  She was athletic but not in the muscular way, tiny but with curves exactly where you want them.  Everything was perfectly smooth, every curve flowed perfectly into the next one.  Her body was unbelievable.

She came over and straddled me, my rock-hard cock fully out of my boxers at this point.  I lifted us both up and pulled off my jeans, trying to remove any layers between us as she wrapped her legs behind me.  Before I could get my boxers off she pulled close and began to rub herself up and down on my cock while we kissed, and it felt incredible- I could feel her pussy lips through her silky thong.  I took the opportunity to remove her bra, and was greeted by the most fantastic pair of tits I’ve seen in my 35 years.  

Now these tits were incredible, I have to stop to describe them.  They weren’t huge- each was a little more than a handful, but seemed bigger than they looked because 1: they were completely gravity-defying and 2: they were attached to a tiny, perfectly composed frame with not an ounce of fat on it. Perfect little half-globes, and in the middle, the hardest nipples I’ve ever seen. Her areolas were barely visible, but the nipples stuck out easily a half an inch, and they were thick- maybe three pencil erasers in size.  I know it sounds like I have a nipple fetish, which I don’t really, it’s just that these were sheer perfection (here’s a handy visual aid: [this is close](http://i.imgur.com/vM3xGgF.jpg), only hers were darker and stuck out a little further, and her tits were a little bit bigger/better shaped). 

Her nipples must have been sensitive, because as I reached up to touch her beautiful tits I got one of them between two fingers and gave it a very light squeeze, and she let out a loud moan and dug her fingers into my shoulders.  I bent her back and put one in my mouth, which I’d been dreaming about doing since lunch.  I sucked and nibbled on each (it took all my strength not to chew on them, I think she’d have liked that too) and she mewled and moaned while continuing to grind away on me at a steadily increasing pace, my hands pulling her ass toward me, spreading her ass cheeks a little bit from my grip.  She was Chinese, but she’d grown up in Cali around Americans- so I consider the delicate little moans that came out of her mouth, which wouldn’t be out of place in an “Asian Porn” video, scientific proof that they must be some sort of genetic thing, not cultural.  It was a huge turnon.

I flipped her around, and laid her on the couch, but realized going to far would make it time to go get a condom that I might or might not have on me, and I didn’t want to break the mood to go on a treasure hunt.  I spread her legs and got between her, pulled off my boxers, and spend a few seconds rubbing the underside of my cock between her lips, aiming for her clit.  I could feel the wetness down there, and there was more than a little precum of mine contributing to it.   Her eyes were locked on my cock the entire time.  But I wasn’t there to dry hump, so I backed off, pulling off her thong as I did.  

Doing so revealed a gorgeous pussy- a nice big pubic mound protruding and some surprisingly big lips for a girl as small as her.  Best of all, it was completely clean-shaven and glistening wet.  I sat her up, got on the floor, spread her legs and dove in, teasing her for a few seconds by kissing her inner thighs and mound before I gave a long, hard lick to her clit.   With that, she moaned loudly enough to snap me back to the fact that we were doing this in my office, which was private enough- but not totally private.  

She must have noticed me pause because she opened her eyes and made a cute “erp…sorry!” face at me… but simultaneously pushed on the back of my head while spreading herself nice and wide, which left no question as to what she wanted me to do.  I obliged, kneeling on the floor and licking that beautiful pussy for what felt like an hour but was probably five minutes tops, alternating my hands between spreading her legs wider, giving her a light fingering around her hole (but never going in) while I gave her clit my full attention, reaching up to gently rub her nipples, and grabbing her by the ass to pull her pussy closer.  I did let my fingers make my way to her backdoor a few times, and she didn’t make any move to object- excellent. (More on that later.)

She began whispering quietly, seemingly to herself--I could barely hear her.  But the things that came out her mouth only served to send me into more of a frenzy. “Oh god… oh god yes… oh god don’t stop… please.”  And then she just kept saying “please, oh yes please” over and over, with quiet moans in between, which drove me even crazier.  She was taking pains to stifle her moans, but as I picked up my pace and added the pressure, her breathing and her body language didn’t lie, and I knew she was close.  

I kept things going at the same pace, but reached up and pinched one of her nipples good and hard, and that was it.  As she gave in to her first orgasm, I could feel her entire body tense up.  She grabbed a handful of my hair and practically pulled it out, and took what must have been twenty seconds worth of stuttering breaths before collapsing backwards and letting out a quick, whispered “holy fucking shit” to nobody in particular.  

I got up on the couch and kissed her, letting her taste her own juices-  she didn’t shy away from it like some women tend to.  She returned the kiss with some light tongue, clearly still composing herself, and without any prompting from me reached down and starting jerking me off slowly.  My dick had gone without attention for a little bit, and having her tiny hand wrapped around it felt amazing.  She was delicate with it, but she clearly knew what she was doing.  

I leaned back to enjoy it, but as soon as I did she stopped and gave me a peck on the cheek, jumped off the couch, looked me in the eye with a grin and said “my turn” as she took a big breath and put her head down onto my cock, trying to take as much in on the first go as she could.  I could’ve cum right there.   Some women in the past have had a tough time with the girth (it’s not quite coke can but not far off), but she took it like a champ, getting about halfway down before bobbing back up.  Her mouth was so warm, full of saliva that she used liberally, and her tongue was making spirals around the tip and back of my cockhead as the suction and saliva caused a loud slurping sound.  She put one hand under my balls and used the other to grip the bottom half of my cock while she went to town on it with her mouth.  It was amazing- probably not the BEST blowjob I’ve ever had but damn close.   

I was lying back on the couch while this beautiful young thing sucked me like she was trying to prove something, and life was good.  I got into the moment, let my eyes close for a minute.  Then I looked down, and saw that she was looking up at me with puppy dog eyes, seemingly pleading for my approval.  As we locked eyes and I smiled to give it to her, she moved her hand and pressed on a spot between my balls and asshole, and that is what sent me over the edge, and I grabbed a fistful of her hair as I said “I’m gonna cum”.  She didn’t pull back, she kept going, which I took as a green light.  I came what felt like buckets down her throat, which she didn’t seem to have much trouble with until the end, when she suddenly gagged and quickly had to pull off, unfortunately timed so one last rope of my cum hit her right about square in the eye before she could move away from it.  Ever the pleasure, she kept going with her hands, pumping every last drop out of me.

We both sat their stunned for a minute as she grabbed a tissue, wiped her face and collapsed next to me on the couch.  As I caught my breath and looked around, the paranoia kicked in a little bit.  Sitting in an office that reeked of sex with a fresh-faced young intern next to me, both of us completely naked and covered in sweat and sex and juices- this was maybe not such a good thing.  I was searching for something to say when she broke the silence, not with words but by fondling my chest and kissing my neck very gently.   Physically I wasn’t ready for more but mentally I felt like we had only messed around for a minute.  I had to have more, I wanted it now, and I could tell she did too.

“Take me home with you,” she whispered in my ear.  I knew I shouldn’t, but I absolutely did not care at that point.  My job, my girlfriend, her youth… any and all guilt about any of that was wiped away instantly by Dick Logic: this had happened, it wasn’t going to unhappen, so might as well make the most of it until it was done happening, right?  Right.

And quite a bit more happened that night, I’ll tell you the rest in part 2 as soon as I type it up.

2swn6m,2,2015-01-19,[Help] Feel stuck. No idea on where to go from here.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2swn6m/help_feel_stuck_no_idea_on_where_to_go_from_here/,"Hi /r/anxiety,

Guess I should start explaning where I am at and where I came from. I am currently 19 M/Norway (soon to be 20), employed in a dead-end 08:00 - 16:00 retail job as an intern, but I think I need go further back than that as I have gotten alot further, but still it feels like the stairs I have been climbing just keep increasing with every step. I can always recall being anxious about everything around me even back when I first started school at 6 years old , I'd cry when my parents dropped me off at school or when I forgot a toy at home that I was planning to take with me to school. I still had plenty of friends though so whatever it was I used to get trough it with their support. The teachers were great, and it seemed like everyone got along. My favourite part of the day was always being able to go home to my parents and when the weekend finally rolled around and I could stay home with them. I remember how the weekend always felt like it went on forever, and how it was like I never had to go back to school. Still, I got trough the 7 years of Elementary School with some minor issues, but mostly ease.  

The problems started to show up when I went to High School, and I was thrown out of my comfort zone into a new world where old friends were split into other classes and there were new people in the class that I didn't know anything about at all. I still remember the first day clearly, how we had to go into the hall and sit down where we were promptly split into classes A, B and C and moved to our new classroom. I remember standing there in the group of 23 people, looking at the 23 desks and my mind racing about where I was going to go? Where are my friends going to sit? Who would I be next to? I was also one of the last persons to get seated, I remember sitting next to a girl and just looking straight ahead at the blackboard and this black void surrounding me drowning out all my other thoughts, and just pure despair consuming me. The first recess we had went good, I was finally reunited with my old friends and just sat there listening to them talk about all the cool people they've met and how awesome High School was. 

I was in no way the coolest kid in school, I was fat, awful clothes, ridiculous haircut and an abyssmal smile. I guess you could call me socially inept. I was ridiculed by the ""cool"" kids and overlooked by the girls, as ""that guy with low emotional intelligence"" (Which I still consider utter bullshit.) The summer vacation after the first year of High School I managed to befriend one of the popular kids kinda throwing me into their ""ranks"". It wasn't a place I enjoyed being, but I considered it a neccesary evil as it took the constant piss-taking off me onto others (unfortunately). Unfortunately right before the second year of High School, my parents' tumultuous relationship finally started to crumble, I remember laying in bed the night before thinking ""They are getting divorced now, oh well"". Unfortunately for me I had no idea how bad it would get, sometimes I even wonder how I am still here. It might seem trivial to you, how this could hit me so hard but imagine the only thing you know in the world suddenly being ripped away from you, with barely anything left to relate to and then thrown into a new enviroment that's unfamiliar. 

I think I dropped 30 kg's that summer and my mood changed dramatically. Mind numb, no humour and energy. The first day I remember people coming up to me wondering if I was the same person as the previous year due to my dramatical change in weight. I recall thinking why the f-ck I am suddenly great now that I look different? Were people really that damn shallow? Still had no chance with the girls though hehe, as I still was the same socially awkward boy. The two years are basically a blur, in between my parents arguing back and forth constantly over phone, my mom moving in with a friend of hers and my dad moving to my current stepmom, who has 3 kids and lives 20km away. Eventually it started with them trying to persuade me to be on ""their"" side back and forth, and I decided to move in with my mom at her friends place until she could afford an apartment near my high school. After those last two years of high school I probably made the biggest mistake I have ever made. In the Norwegian School System there are different ""courses"" of upper secondary school you can take, I wanted to go with IT as I felt that's where I did belong, but of course my worse half decided on the first day of the school that I couldn't go. Why could I? Who would be there? It would be an unfamiliar enviroment and it would make you uncomfortable. Sweaty hands, stomach/head aches and a rush of thoughts about who, why, what. So I stayed home, I remember my dad marching up the walkway to my mom's apartment, ringing the doorbell and hammering on it. 

I opened it and he was ANGRY. I guess it was the despair about how his son wasn't going to school like all the other kids and that he was afraid that I would f-ck up my future by doing so. Parents are usually right, and he was in this case right. I stayed home from 2011 to May 2013 when I finally managed to get an internship at a warehouse driving a forklift completing orders and re-stocking the store portion of it. Unfortunately, most of the people there were over 50 so I didn't really fit in and I was still a shell of my former self coming in late, leaving super early or just staying in the breakroom afraid of anyone and anything. Stuck with my own thoughts on how everything had gone to hell and there was no turning back. I did nothing those two years, except messing up at my job there and moving out. Sitting alone at my new apartment self-loathing. Then I met the most fantastic girl, and I ended up going into a relationship with her, feeling better than ever. Sure it was long-distance, but I was happy and felt appreciated by someone else other than my family. Looking at all my ""friends"" from high school who had everything they could dream of, a fantastic jobs, plenty of friends and -plenty- of nights out. 

Going on constant holidays to other countries and staying there for weeks, and the education of their dreams. I remember how I absolutely HATED them and everything they were doing, not to mention I hadn't heard from my friends since I finished High School and that just put me in a downward spiral of self-hate. Why couldn't I have what they have? Why did it have to be me? Either way, through supportive parents and family I managed quit the job in july that I felt went nowhere and went to a psychologist where I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety, something which I already knew I had since I'd been living that hell since I was 6 and able to form simple thoughts. I went to the psychologist for about 4 months, as I didn't really like him that much and considering there's a 1 year wait for a new one I decided to take matters into my own hands after I had gotten a prescription for 5mg Valium, and got myself another internship at a new place. 

Everything started to go well and I landed the job in october 2014, the job interview went great with the help of the anxiety medication and after a few days at work I decided to throw them out as an addiction to Benzodiazepines is way worse than anxiety, I moved out of my apartment to my grandfather as I hated the current place I lived and considered it a conduit for my anxiety and depression. Disaster struck and she left me due to me not spending enough time to talk her, even though we talked every single day for hours upon hours. She got really nasty at the end telling me things such as the fact that I should just get over her, because she gives no fucks and ain't coming back although she is willing to be my ""friend"" even if we're not together and that I should stop acting so sad as if I were ""going to kill myself lol :)"". 

F-ck up number two, I decided that I would burn every single bridge with her and block her on every single instant messaging site, facebook and phone, but before I did I decided to leave a rude message because I felt so hurt, betrayed and angry. The problem with anxiety is the constant paranoia of bad things, which I am still experiencing in the fact that I feel what I said is going to come back and bite me ass, even though all I said is ""Good luck, finding someone better than me which you obviously won't"". Of course she will, anybody would be better than self-deprecating old me constantly fucking up and never getting anywhere. One step forward and about ten back each day. It's still eating at me 2 months later, the paranoia about what I said and how alone I feel although things are going better and I might soon land a job at the place I am having an internship. The black void is still constantly around me, isolating me from all the happy people. 

Constant feel that even though how far I have pushed myself, the road ahead just increases in length and it's as if I am never getting over any of it. I guess what I wanted to say was that I feel incredibly lonely, and want friends that are close, not just online as I need the physical friendships where you can meet and do stuff. Not just sit in front of a PC all day just talking about stuff. I am too anxious to go to any meet-ups for people with similar issues or start any hobbies where I have to go out for things other than work. I am not sure how to proceed, and a psychologist will take atleast 1-2 years to get ahold of again. If you got any questions, I'll respond as quickly. If this helps anyone else, that's also great.
 

TL;DR Incredibly lonely.

Im sorry if this is written awfully as I am not very good at writing long texts or proofreading it, or if it is just a jumbled mess of thoughts. I had to get it out before I am going to work as It has been tearing at me for a long time now and I didn't know where to turn. It was hard getting out as I still experience anxiety writing online, lol :). Maybe it's all trivial issues, but it's constantly eating at me. I just want to return to my former confident self, and have friends and a relationship again. Guess there's a lot of pent up anger and grudges inside me that I cannot seem to get over."
2swpxb,4,2015-01-19,Sick mother vs soul mate - help!,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2swpxb/sick_mother_vs_soul_mate_help/,"Okay, I need some advice. I currently live in Brisbane with my boyfriend of three years. In a couple of days time he will find out if he got a well paid marketing internship in Melbourne. If he gets the job, he wants me to move with him. I would love to move to Melbourne, except there is one thing stopping me - my mother. She has graves disease, tendonitis in both her elbows and her knee, and diabetes. My sister moved to Spain two years ago and my mother currently lives with my brother who is an abusive sponge. This leaves me as the only person who can take care of her. I mostly offer financial support, but I am also there to help with household chores if need be (though not as often as I should) and a ""safe house"" from my brother. She also has no friends and gets very lonely. She calls me on a daily basis and if I don't see her every week she will tell me how she misses me and hasn't seen me in ages. She is a very kind, unselfish woman and I will feel an incredible guilt if I leave her. I also feel I have a repsonsibility as her daughter to care for her. But does that mean that I will never get to live my own life and be chained to this city forever? I feel selfish for even asking.

&amp;nbsp;

Now my boyfriend said he wont take the intership if I don't come with him, but I want him to follow his dreams and have a job that will make him happy. I don't want to hold him back. I suggested a long distance relationship for a year but he is not happy with that idea (I'm not really keen on it either). I feel he is my soul mate and it would tear me apart to break up with him, but I don't want him to miss this amazing opportunity. If he stays with me, he too will be stuck in Brisbane forever. I don't think he would let us break up anyway, he would simply ignore his dreams :(

&amp;nbsp;

I feel torn. I have no idea what to do. Do I stay or do I go? "

2sxbed,2,2015-01-19,GPA dropped an entire fucking point and I've lost all hope of very bringing it up and achieving my dream career. I don't know what to do anymore.,confrey,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2sxbed/gpa_dropped_an_entire_fucking_point_and_ive_lost/,"Last year my GPA took a nosedive. My freshman year of college, I had the best work ethic and experience as a freshman. I may or may not have had my first drink, my work ethic was the best it had ever been, i began going to the gym (lost 10lbs of fat and began putting on some muscle for the first time), and I had finally broken my introvert shell and became really social. I felt like I could do anything. Even realize my dream of going to medical or pharmacy school. 

Then sophomore year came. I was on a dance team my freshman year, and continued it. We had a phenomenal season, but our practices were hellish and long. I was always physically exhausted. Then towards the end of fall semester. I began having violent spasms. Turned out, I'm epileptic! Fucking great! That combined with long practices made my grades turn to shit. I dropped from a 3.7 to a 3.0 that year. 

I quit the dance team in an effort to bring my grades up this semester, but honestly, I think this may have been most challenging semester. Let me elaborate. My neurologist said a cause for my episodes might have been related to how exhausted I was and stress which made sense my sophomore year. Over the summer I only worked at my dad's office which was never stressful, the people I worked with were great people to work with even though I'm not interested in any kind of engineering. Thankfully, I never had any episodes over the summer. However, they came back this semester. I cut out any drinking and tried to get more sleep, but they kept fucking happening. 

I worked as hard as I could without stressing myself out too much because enduring these seizures is the worst thing I have ever experienced. However, when you're a junior Bio major, classes get tough and I struggled in my classes. My bio professors almost made me take my final 3 days before the day we had agreed to rescheduled it for (the original date conflicted with another final and that professor never made plans for a make up until the night before at which point my professors emailed me to make me take the exam I was told I had 3 more days to prep for). Had 2 seizures in that time span because I was freaking the fuck out.

So yeah. This semester was my chance to begin fixing my GPA. But I fucked up. I tried as hard as I could, but I still failed. I lost my scholarship, so now my parents are paying full price for my tuition which won't last long because soon they'll have to pay for my brothers tuition which I know he's worried about. The kid is way smarter than I was, and has the potential to go to a better school than I could ever hope for, but now that I lost my scholarship that's nearly $25k less my parents can put towards his education plus the pending surgeries my mom may need to get. 

My dad is the only one in the family making any real income. He works 70+ hours a week and for what? I 20 year old with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who has fucked himself into a below 3.0 GPA and will now cost him an extra $25k if he even wants to think about graduating. I have failed him, my mother, my younger brother who used to idolize my now extinct work ethic (he just sees me holed up in my room now doing jack shit), and myself.

With a below 3.0 GPA I can't find any good internship or get any kind of noteworthy recommendation to even volunteer at a clinic. I honestly don't see any way of going to pharmacy school or medical school. And now I may have to go on medication for my JME which I bet is hella expensive and just another burden on my parents. 

My parents have tried to talk to me, but I can't bring myself to face them. I just yell at them to leave me alone in my room. At this point I just want it all to end. I can't take the thought of being a failure to my parents. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my brother. I know my parents would take care of him, but I'm his drive. I've been motivating the hell out of him to make sure he can be his best. I'm hoping that by the end of this school year, he won't need my motivation. He'll be strong enough by then. He won't need me. Then hopefully, this will all end for me. 

I don't know what I hope to achieve by posting here, but I just needed a way to vent to someone without being judged or people I know making false promises of me turning my life around. I just needed to tell someone. Thanks for reading. Hopefully this will end for me one way or another. I don't care how at this point."
2sxkam,4,2015-01-19,"Might have AvPD, Opening myself up to the internet",Bugsherd,AvPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/2sxkam/might_have_avpd_opening_myself_up_to_the_internet/,"So I decided to post here because I don't really have anywhere else to let this out, I'm 19 years old and I have been depressed/unhappy for years. Sorry if this might get too long. I'm really wary to open myself up to strangers even on the internet but I hope we come relate.

I was severely bullied in elementary - high school. I often hid it from my parents and my teacher just told me it was all in my head and that made me have extremely low selfesteem. I had only like 2 friends in highschool and I don't talk to them anymore because we split to different schools and even then they were more 'people I could sit next to without insulting me' and I was often the third wheel in anything.

I go to college and study graphic design/illustration and I started to make some friends I could hang out with and joke around with and have a fun time. It was extremely anxious and shy at first and didn't want to interact with anyone because I thought they were just like the people in high school. I opened a lot to them but not emotionally. 

Sometimes I get extreme anxiety when I want to ask people something, even if it's not personal. The words just don't come out of my mouth, like some kind of force is preventing me to say anything. I'm now running my internship at a small game company with a staff of around 7 people and I have to push myself to the limits to ask my  co-workers on advice or simple administration questions. My parents keep pushing me to ask them if I could give them my bank account number to deposit my salary, but I keep avoiding it and use the excuse that I'm 'too busy' or that the guy running the administartion wasn't at work that day. There is also a british guy working here (I'm from the Netherlands.) and when the co-workers are having a conversation in English I just say nothing because I find it extremely difficult to speak English and not feel even more inadecuate than I already feel. I know they're nice people, and I want to be around them and have a conversation but it's so difficult for me to start a conversation about what I've been doing in my spare time. And when I find the courage to do it and they don't seem very interested and I start to think they don't like me or I've said something dumb. Im generally very quiet during conversations, because I've only know them for 2 weeks. Normally it takes me about a half year before I am comfortable talking to people I'm learning to know.

I don't have any close friends in real life. Because I don't trust anyone with my feelings or emotions. I have plenty of friends I can hang out with at school. They enjoy my quirks and we joke a lot. But that's about it. I have no one in real life I can trust my feelings to. There is this one person in class who's, let's say very 'motherly' and is quick to ask something if I seem to behave odd. I gave her my tumblr (which I now deleted because I've gotten too many followers and I absolutely hate the attention I've gotten for every single post I make, which wasn't necessarily negative) and she reads every rant I make about my feelings because I like to talk to myself. And she confronts me about it everyday. I know she just tries to help, but I don't want her help because I do not feel comfortable telling her my emotions and I don't trust her either. 

It makes me sad to see my friends on facebook hang out which each other and my friends on twitter talk about having fun with their friends. I never go out with friends. And when our class arranges a meeting I never go because I feel like no one will really miss me. The holidays has made me extremely depressed because everyone was having fun with their friends and family and I can't help to compare themselves and think they have so much more support than me. One one hand I don't want to go out and socialize, because being alone is safer, yet I still feel extremely lonely even though I have friends I can talk to and I see on a daily basis.

I have one close online friend that I do feel safe with sharing my feelings. (I've know him for 6 years) He lives in a different country than me but still the same timezone so I get enough time talking to him. The problem is he is getting busier with his own life and ofcourse he can't always be there for me. I feel like I'm just a big burden to him because I'm so dependant on him. But I have no one else I can trust without the fear of being rejected. He keeps reassuring me that I mean a lot to him as a friend but he gets really frustrated when I am unable to see that because all I can see is my own distorted self-image.

My mother is extremely controlling and has been intrusive to me emotionally so I don't like her to tell anything about my feelings. I also don't really like being around her because shes generally loud and she has panic attacks at the tiniest things. For example she started yelling when she couldn't open the car door when it was accidentally on the child safety lock. So when we go out I always bring out my headphones and disassociate so I can channel out her neuroticism. Because having to hear her makes me extremely anxious as well. She always hints me that I am extremely lazy because I don't have a job like my brother and am not as much as an opportunitist like him and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough for anyone even though I have good grades at school and my teachers generally see me as a good student.

I don't have a lot of problems with school/job occupations luckily. My biggest passion is my art and my study because that is pretty much the only trait of myself I am actually proud of. But at the same time it devestates me that the best trait people can name for me is 'art' and that there is not much else to me. 

I general I don't have a problem approaching strangers, I can go talk to a cashier or say hello to the busdriver everyday. I only fear getting close to people because of these fears such as mistrust and fear of intimacy. I just generally don't fit anywhere. Not school, not at home, not even on the internet. (Posting things already made me kind of anxious and fearing the comments etc. which is why I haven't been on foru I kind of feel like an outsider to everything.

If you know me well I'm quite a blunt person and some people like me for being sarcastic, but whenever I just slightly annoy someone I feel terrible and start to hate myself and it'll haunt me for the rest of the day.


My mom discourages me to go get a therapist or a doctor. Because she says they'll just 'try to sell you pills'. She keeps discouraging me to go to a doctor in general unless the symptoms are obvious (she used to be a nurse) because she imposes her hospital traumas onto everyone, including my dad and doesn't want anyone to go to a doctor unless its absolutely necessary. And I can't just go behind her back because I work 9-5 and also at a place that's 1 hour away from where I live. And even the idea of just doing that makes me extremely anxious. I've wanted to atleast try out a therapist because I've been depressed since I was 13-14.

So far I've only tried out a school group counseling for social anxiety. I've been taught to think on facts rather than emotions and rewarding myself if I got the courage to do something. But it was only slightfully helpful for me because of how I see myself being socially inept and inadequate as facts. The biggest way I try to cope is escape to a fantasy world and thinking about the stories I've been writing. But sometimes I just fantasize having a best friend and doing all sorts of exciting stuff with them. It makes me appear a bit aloof because I tend to stare away in the distance.

Sorry if this seems a bit cluttered, but I had to let this out somewhere  other than my single friend, I think it's atleast a step to the right direction."
2sxzel,7,2015-01-19,I (19F) bought my BF (22M) a watch for no particular reason and I'm worried about how he'll take it.,aghhhwatch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sxzel/i_19f_bought_my_bf_22m_a_watch_for_no_particular/,"Hi reddit! Throwaway so I don't ruin the surprise.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for around six months. We're both college students and our budgets reflect that, but we're both financially stable and don't worry too much over money (though I think I generally have more disposable income because my parents cover my rent). 

For Christmas, I got him a few nice but inexpensive gifts that he really enjoyed, and he blew me out of the water with an antique that I absolutely adore but I suspect wasn't cheap (~$100?). 

Now, I know gift-giving season is over but I have noticed over the past few months that he doesn't wear a watch, reason being that he wants a nice one but has not yet gotten the chance to splurge on himself. 

Keeping this information at the back of my mind, I was browsing an online department store this weekend that I happen to have a few gift cards for, and I couldn't find anything I wanted for myself but instead stumbled upon a couple nice Fossil watches that seemed right up his alley. I linked them to his best friend and asked him to do some probing (under the guise that his friend was looking for a new watch; they have very similar styles and my boyfriend has even expressed interest in buying one of his friend's old watches) and narrowed it down to a watch that ends up at around $140. Kinda impulsively, I placed the order, paid with my gift cards, and got all excited!

But today, I realized that while I am completely comfortable *giving* him a watch, he might not be comfortable *receiving* it. His birthday isn't for months, Christmas is over, and there's no real occasion for me to be spending this kind of money on him right now other than the fact that I'd rather spend the gift card on him than on myself, and I think he'd like to have it. I don't want him to think that he needs to give me anything in return, or that I'm trying to 'improve' him, or anything like that. I'm worried because if the tables were turned, I'm not sure that I would be able to accept a gift like that (I like giving more than receiving, and I've told him not to buy me things in the past because I don't want him to spend his money on me). Basically, I'm a horrible gift hypocrite, haha.

I know a hundred dollars for a gift for most people isn't a big deal, but keep in mind that we are both students and have only been dating for several months. I know I don't have to care about convention, but I am a little worried that what I'm doing is out of the norm among my peers.

I think I've narrowed it down to a few options.

- Cancel the order and save the watch idea for his birthday. I don't really want to do this because if I'm just going to give him the same/a similar watch in five months, I think it's a little silly that convention dictates I have to wait and he can't just start using it now.
- Don't cancel the order, don't give him the watch until his birthday. Same feelings as above.
- Give him the watch and tell him it's a Valentine's Day gift. I don't want to do this because a) I don't think Valentine's Day should be a big deal and I'm not even sure if we're celebrating it at this point, b) even if we do, I think it should be more of a ""let's do something together"" rather than a ""let's give each other stuff"" day, and c) I don't want to set the precedent and make him think he needs to go cray for V-Day from now on. But I can be convinced otherwise if you guys think this is the best option.
- Give him the watch and say it's a 'congratulations' gift for getting a summer internship he applied to for this summer. I've never given a congratulatory gift before so I'm not really sure what etiquette applies here.
- Give him the watch and don't give a reason except that I had some gift money to spend and wanted to get him this rather than get myself stuff (the bare basic truth).

---   

**TL;DR** Got boyfriend a watch because I felt like it, don't have an occasion to give it to him. Cue overthinking."

I am tasked with finding an event management app. We need to sell tickets, offer upsells to ticket buyers, and integrate all that information with infusion soft.

All arrows lead to eventbright, but I need to propose a few alternatives. 

Also, of the issues I see with event bright is going through their payment system. We would like to use our own merchant account to collect payments not a third party.

I’m a married man with a 4-year-old daughter. I have been married for 5 and a half years, together with my wife for just over 8 years. I’m a teacher, so I don’t make great money (around 50k), but I’m good at what I do and still enjoy doing it for the most part.  Both my wife and I are from out of state, so we do not have family near us. My wife has major mental health problems. She has been diagnosed (since summer 2013) with bipolar and (since late summer/fall 2014) PTSD stemming from several traumatic events in her life. We also believe she has borderline personality disorder.
 
**2011** - The depression started to come out in the Spring of 2011. My reaction was naïve as I had had literally no experience dealing with mental health issues. We both initially thought it was post-partum depression since the kid was born in fall 2010 and thought maybe it would go away. Also, my wife was a special education teacher and had a very stressful job. So that, coupled with the responsibilities of caring for a new child were what I thought were the main cause of the deepening depression. If only we could make it to summer, everything would be fine…

Well, as you know, things only got worse. Wife didn’t want to tell family, I was stupid and naïve enough to take her advice. I broke down so many times in frustration, wishing things would get better. We sought medical advice from our family doctor near the end of summer break, to which he ran some tests to check thyroid levels (which came back normal) and the follow up was to prescribe an anti-depressant (Zoloft, I believe). Wife started taking it, got worse. She was shaking in bed, having what I can only imagine as terrible nightmares and hallucinations, coupled with voices in her head.  I got worse, school was starting, daughter went back to daycare, and wife stayed home on the first day that teachers needed to report back and cut her arm in the bathtub.

I called her cell to check on her that day in the late morning, before lunch. No answer. I called home. She had the home phone next to her in the tub and answered it, THANK GOD. As you can imagine, I called 911, went straight home, and our lives have never been the same since.  My mother flew in that night to help out. Her mother followed up after my mother left, so we had initial family support. After being hospitalized in a psychiatric unit at our hospital for over a week, she was put on a mixture of medications that seemed to stabilize her and she continued to do outpatient therapy. She stayed out of work, used up all her leave time, and continued to receive short term disability until late winter of 2012. She seemed to be getting better, was able to stay home with our daughter and I think really enjoyed that time with her. My mother helped out financially, so things improved.

**2012** – when the disability expired in late Winter 2012, my wife faced the decision of going back to work. She was hoping they could do something part time with her, but that would have meant transferring schools. She knew she couldn’t handle it and had grown frustrated with teacher after 5 years anyway, so she resigned. She did some career searching and found a medical assisting program at a local community college, applied for it, got accepted, and started taking her initial prerequisite classes that spring so she could enroll full time in the fall. She really took to it, rose to the top of her class. We took out student loans to help cover the cost of classes, books, and other living expenses. We had to, as my mother was not able to support us financially anymore. (Mom was able to supplement our income until the end of the 2011-2012 school year, which I am so grateful for). She became super confident, started going to the gym, pulled impressive late-nighters to get her school work done, and managed to be an awesome mom all at the same time. She took this as a sign that her depression was finally being overcome and started to gradually reduce her meds until she was off of most of them. In the meantime, she increasingly began to purchase things on credit cards, always with the excuse of being able to pay them off once she had her job as a medical assistant (which are not high wage jobs by any means). 

She also became increasingly sexual, and I wasn’t always in the mood to reciprocate. Sometimes I did, but as a teacher and caretaker of a little one, I don’t always have the energy. She was manic, though we just associated it with her feeling better at the time, since she was not diagnosed with bipolar yet. I think as a way to get her sexual needs met, she started doing online sex chat. That really didn’t bother me all that much, considering it’s not much different than me looking at porn and masturbating, so it wasn’t a big deal to me. She DID, however, start having random text conversations with guys on KIK and Yahoo messenger. Of course, she wouldn’t tell me this, but it was pretty obvious. Her phone was password protected (still is, and it’s hilarious that she thinks it’s a big secret even though I see her type the password literally everyday to get into her phone). She stopped being affectionate toward me, would not even reciprocate “I love you”, and said on multiple occasions that we weren’t connecting and she didn’t feel the love between us. 

That winter, right after her fall semester ended and before Christmas, she expressed a need to get out for a long weekend. She wanted to go somewhere she hadn’t been before. So she booked a flight to Boston, but eventually changed it to Little Rock, Ark. (Odd right?) In my feeble attempt to want to believe her, I caved and said she could go. She is a strong willed woman, which is one of the things that actually made me fall in love with her in the first place, so she probably would’ve gone regardless of if I said yes or no. I suspected she might’ve hooked up with someone there, but I had no proof. I played ignorant and willed myself to believe she was just relaxing and getting away for a few days. The program at her school was very intensive (19 credits, I believe), so I had a legitimate belief that this was something she needed. 

We began to argue over things, her spending, my reaction to her sexual passes, etc. 

**2013** – shortly after the new year (late January, early February), she started to feel depressed. I think she may have realized it was a mistake to ween off the meds. She was coming down hard from her manic episode. I believe she started taking them again. Keep in mind, she had regular appointments with a therapist and psychologist to monitor her illness. Her second semester was in full swing. She was doing well still, but definitely had a harder time managing it all. It became incredibly difficult for her, but she managed to keep up with school. Again, during her spring break, she took a road trip for an extended weekend to get away. It wasn’t where she said she was going to go, which we’ll talk about later. About the time her exams were rolling around (late april, early may), she got to the point where she had to go to the hospital for the second time. Her anxiety was through the roof and she had a hard time controlling her thoughts. She voluntarily checked herself into the hospital, because she didn’t want what happened to her the first time to happen again. Again, she was hospitalized for several days (almost a week), got stabilized, and released. Her mother came down to help out again. She seemed to get better. She took her exams, passed the classes, and began her internship in a doctor’s office shortly after her exams were finished.  
During this time, my wife began experimenting with tattoos, her hair style, and piercings. It wasn’t exactly my style, but it’s her body and who am I to tell someone how to look? It was that summer that she was diagnosed with bipolar 1 (the most severe form). Things were started to make sense now, her manic episodes and severe depression swings. So doctors had to adjust her medications to accommodate for the new diagnosis. I also put things together about her sexual indiscretions after looking at credit card statements and locations of transactions, confronted her about it, and she confessed. She was very apologetic. She blamed the mania, and said she’d understand if I left. I told her I’d stand by her side. 

My wife had a somewhat stressful internship, I think, mainly because she and her supervisor didn’t have the best relationship. She isn’t the “sit there and observe” type person. She liked to get in there and help out right away, whereas the supervisor wanted her to be more compliant and do things as she was told. But she managed to get through, take her exam, pass it, and was ready to have a job by the fall of 2013. She began to gain weight (she was always quite thin). A combination of the stress of the internship, depression, lack of exercise, and med changes surely all contributed. We were still living on my teaching salary alone, so money was tight. Credit cards were still being used and the balances were getting higher and higher.
That fall, she became depressed again. Things weren’t going well for our relationship. She became closer to her friend, who is also bipolar and suffers from ptsd. Sorry for not mentioning the friend before, but very briefly, she was an old teaching friend who taught at the school we both taught at, and our families connected, because her friend also resigned from teaching due to the stress and mental health issues. They spent a good amount of time together from fall 2011 through summer 2013, but they became really close that summer. The camaraderie I thought to be good for the both of them (although I do not believe they helped each other overcome any mental health issues). I hung out with her husband also (who also was a teacher) but we weren’t as close as they were. 

She held off on looking for a job that fall because she didn’t feel she was mentally capable of handling one quite yet. However, our finances were starting to hit a point where we couldn’t afford to charge things anymore. Keep in mind, I am paying for our families health care, so I’m not making much at all after taxes, retirement, and healthcare is coming out of the paycheck. I borrowed money from my mom a couple times here and there, but couldn’t keep depending on that. So she had to start looking for a job.  In the meantime, our relationship wasn’t getting better. I felt betrayed by her decisions to cheat on me. I became friends with a female coworker, who I knew suffered from mental health disorders (bipolar, as well). She had to take a leave of absence herself due to the stress of the job and we texted back and forth. I explained my situation, told her that I was thinking about telling my wife that I can’t continue this relationship. We flirted with each other. It was more out of a need to connect with somebody than anything sexual and nothing ever amounted to more than a hug. Still, it made me question why I was continuing to stay with my wife and support her. 

So I confronted my wife about my thoughts, told her how I felt, and we both initially agreed that we had lost our connection and the love wasn’t there. But ultimately after a couple of weeks of talking about what we have to do to move forward, she broke down and couldn’t bear the thought of not being with me, our daughter not always being around me (which, by the way, I would have sought custody, as I’m the only one with income). I became a little depressed too. She said something like “What about ‘In Sickness and Health?’”, to which I replied to her that I was the one that stood by her side when she wouldn’t reply that she loved me and even after her indiscretions. The point was made. We stayed together. The coworker resigned and I stopped communicating with her to focus on our marriage. 
We took out a loan from one of our retirement accounts because money was dire. It’s a five year loan and we’re still paying it off. 

**2014**– Serious discussions about her looking for a job in her field now. She had her resume updated, started applying for full time, part time medical assisting jobs. We refinanced our mortgage and rolled some credit card debt into it to help offset our balances. Thankfully our loan was small as was our initial monthly payment, so it was doable. Her supervisor from her internship apparently was not the best reference, which caused many potential employers to not consider her for the job because she was thought of as temperamental (or something). But one place took a chance on her and hired her that Spring. She worked for a couple weeks. Pay wasn’t great. She initially had a hard time adjusting to her boss there, but eventually found a way to gel. I think things were getting better for us somewhat. But then she was suddenly offset by anxiety again and once again checked herself into the hospital. Of course, since she was only employed for a couple of weeks, they had let her go since she wasn’t able to report to work. 

We took in a roommate (40 year old women who she met in the hospital) shortly after she was back from the hospital. It was supposed to be an extra source of money. Bad idea, the woman was a snooper and was going through our stuff. We kicked her out. I initially said there was no way she was going to come in, but my wife convinced me this would help us. (I’m pretty weak, huh…) Anyway, we didn’t lose anything, she paid us for the time she was there, and we still have her driver’s license and social security card for some reason, which she must have gotten replaced. Whatever, I try not to think about that short 1 week chapter of my life anymore. 

She hasn’t looked for a job in the medical assisting field since and I think she’s ruled out working in the in the profession altogether. So the schooling and loans incurred for that program were for nothing in the end. Keep in mind, I have worked summer school for the past 4 years to help make extra money. 

That summer, she began to stop sleeping in the same room as me. She would fall asleep downstairs or sleep in the guest bedroom. I asked her why, but she would always have an excuse like she fell asleep here or something. Whatever. But she eventually told me that part of her ptsd stems from her not feeling safe around me. (by the way, I am the least violent person you could imagine.) How I handled the situation when she initially began her downward spiral back in 2011 has haunted her thoughts. And had I known differently, I would have taken other actions. But as I had said before, I was naïve and clueless about mental health, so I’m not going to dwell on this. She did say that she needs to work through her therapy and overcome this so she can sleep in the same bed again. 

That fall, she decided that she’d advertise in home day care services to make some extra money. She took in a little 2 year old boy (my daughter was almost 4). After a couple of weeks, it became too much for her and she had to terminate the service. That fall became increasingly worse for her depression. Eventually her moods became uncontrollable, so she once again checked herself into the hospital in November. I took some time off of work so parents didn’t have to come right away and watch our daughter. It was good for me anyway, I needed the time. She was in for about 5 days again and was released. Her mom flew in to help out with things around the house. 
Apparently a lot of her ptsd issues stem from her relationship with her mother, so it probably wasn’t the best idea that she even came. But she initially suggested it and I called her mom but told her not to come right away since I was taking time off of work. 

Things were pretty tense between her and her mom, but she managed to leave the Monday before thanksgiving and agreed to pay for part time childcare for our daughter so my wife could have some recovery time and possibly figure out what she needs to do with her life. Things did not get all that better and my wife once again put herself into the hospital in December. I didn’t even have family come. I paid for the extra couple of days and my daughter was in daycare all week. 

Meanwhile my wife has been out, she’s not getting better, she binge eats away at her depression, is now quite overweight, goes to a type of ptsd therapy called EMDR (look it up, if you want to), which is definitely taking a toll on her.  She’s on all sorts of medications, smokes marijuana and e-cigs, and I’m at a point now where I’m starting to question if there’s any hope at all. We are at a point where our credit cards are going to be maxed out and we cannot pay our bills. She applied and was denied for social security disability (don’t worry, we’re appealing). She’s been hospitalized 5 times (once for major headaches that I haven’t even discussed here). She is suffering, our finances are a mess, no family in our area, her best friend (the bipolar, ptsd one) moved back to her home state, I even suggested to take on some part time work (tutoring is good money), but she was hesitant about it. She doesn’t want me to, which is ridiculous, but I know why.  Because I practically do everything around the house: cooking, cleaning, laundry, caring for our child, putting her to bed and bathing her, yardwork, etc… on top of my job. So she’d have to take on more of those responsibilities if I did extra work. But I’m willing to do it. 

She’s lost a lot of self-confidence. I tell her I love her everyday. She’ll say it back, but I’m not sure it means what it used to for her. She chats with some dude from Australia, but hasn’t had any physical sexual indiscretions since the initial ones. I think he’s bipolar too and she met him on a depression chat board or something. She’s started reading the bible and looking at religion and god for answers. I guess that’s all good (I’m not particularly religious, but have nothing against it). She sleeps separately from me still. She crochets to help calm her down. I want things to get better for her and us, but I’m not so sure I know what to do. I’m about to get professional help myself (thankfully my mom is going to pay for it) so I can maybe find ways to approach my wife and make our situation potentially better. But all I can do is hope right now. And take your suggestions…

I’ve tried to be as detailed as I possibly can. I’m sure I’ve left some things out, but that’s all I have for now.  

**TL;DR** – I have a wife who has developed major mental health issues and has not had any source of real income for over 3 years, I am a teacher with a steady but modest income that cannot support our family, we are both from different states with no family and few friends near us, we have a 4 year old daughter (who is amazing, by the way), we have so much credit card and medical debt that we’re at a point where I’m not sure we can pay all our bills next month (hopefully tax return will help), our relationship is suffering. We don’t really fight anymore, but there is no affection and hardly any interactions between us. I do most of the childcare and chores at home and am exhausted. I hold out hope that my wife’s therapy will help her and our relationship will strengthen. I worry about how this affects my daughter. I am also in the process of beginning to seek professional help because I realize I cannot do this all alone. But I want to hear what you have to say, especially if you’ve personally dealt with mental health disorders (be it yours or someone close to you).

All the ones that I have found were only for juniors and below. I'm trying to find an internship or something to do this summer to gain more experience before I go to college. Thanks in advance. 
2syj1j,0,2015-01-19,29 M4F Age-regression scenarios,throwaway_poseidon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2syj1j/29_m4f_ageregression_scenarios/,"I'm looking to play a scenario, perhaps over the long term, where by some twist of fate, medicine, religious incantation, mantra, genetics, or whatever, your character regresses sequentially in age over the term of the RP. It can be a quick regression or a gradual one, appropriate to the specific scene we decide to develop together. Your options include:

**1) Prof-student.** I'm a graduate student and you're a relatively young professor (older than me, obviously). I'd want to play around 25, and you, under 40. In this case the reason for the age-regression would be natural or medical, applied consciously by you when I (perhaps) visit you during office hours or we decide to meet up after class at your house.

**2) Colleagues.** You're a college intern at my company or organization, and I'm your mentor, training you to do some facet of my job so that I no longer have to. It starts when I find that you're getting cozy with me at times--not intimately, but maybe you're comfortable working in ""close conditions,"" you might say. Our personalities work together really well; you're outgoing and enjoy having fun and joking with me to cut through the sometimes-boredom of work. When I teach you a new concept or some computer program, you strive to put it to memory, because you know I'll quiz you on it in the near future! We could enter the age-regression through me tricking you (but perhaps you realizing it and being okay with it) with a spell or potion. So that our interactions are not dependent on the workplace, perhaps we live near one another as well.

**3) Doctor-patient.** I'm a cavalier cancer physician who thinks he can cure your carcinoma and many others by my new, secret, age-regression therapy. This one is not well developed in my mind, so you have more blanks to fill in here. Ideally you begin as a single woman under 40, and it may perhaps involve you becoming a live-in patient with me. You may have gone first to other doctors who were pessimistic about your chances for long-term survival, but something about my optimism and enthusiasm causes you to select my clinic for your treatment. And you like the prospect of not losing your hair as well!

**4) Potpourri!** I'm open to other ideas and kinks here. We could be college students in a relationship, husband-wife, brother-sister, neighbors, whatever. Throw something at me: the only things I consider off-limits are poop, rape, violence, gore, and animals.

In my mind, your character fully consents to the age-regression at the time of its application, though as you enter the age-regressed personality (with its physical characteristics, too) you would begin to experience attendant feelings or hesitations, whether they are expressed or not expressed to my character. Between our ""encounters,"" I thought that you would return, at least briefly, to your character's starting age, if for no other reason than that we're not in a committed relationship and you wouldn't want to arouse suspicion about your ""condition"" to others. I'm open to your thoughts on both of these things, though! 

-----------------------------------

Ideal RP partners for me are able to contribute several times a week, if not daily. You should be articulate and able to express yourself well, comfortable with details and slow build-up. I'm open to chatting on an instant messenger platform if we're both comfortable with it, but I prefer the RP to be in the form of 2-4 paragraph reddit PMs. I usually play in the first person, but if you have other strongly held preferences, I'm open to entertaining them too. 

In your first message, please tell me (at the very least) the option from above that you'd like to explore and your low-age limit, plus any other ideas or questions you have at this preliminary juncture. Please don't start the RP right away, as we have a lot to discuss together before that happens!"
2syofa,4,2015-01-19,"My [23F] boyfriend [22M] of 7 months broke up with me; how do I navigate the murky waters of ""being friends"" or getting over it?",magnoliawine,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2syofa/my_23f_boyfriend_22m_of_7_months_broke_up_with_me/,"Tom and I met when he was a freshman and I was a sophomore in college. My best friend was in charge of his on campus apartment and became close to him and his friends, introducing all of us and our group became best friends. I harbored a slight but not serious crush on Tom that never went anywhere. 

Tom became involved with another girl Vee in his building, so we were never as close as I was to his friends since he was usually with Vee. They quickly turned into an unhealthy on again/off again as he was head over heels for her and she strung him along for close to three years.

Fast forward to my third year (his second year) of college, I got wasted at my own birthday party in November that he ended up attending because he got in a fight with Vee (I was not aware of any of their relationship at the time). My crush came back in full force and I ended up trying to kiss him and take him upstairs with me. We fooled around but he refused to go further because he was still upset with Vee, who was his first time, and he wasn't into one night stands or sex without feelings for the other person. I agreed, he told me a bit about their problems and we fell asleep. He got my number the next day and we began texting and trying to form a better friendship.

We ended up becoming FWB for about six months. I ended up having feelings for him that I tried to hide because I didn't want to stop sleeping with him (a huge mistake, I know). He was guilt ridden because he was still conflicted over Vee (who was continuously seeing other people but telling him they could be together if he loved her) and whether he could move on from her. He cared about me as a friend, especially since our group had become pretty inseparable as time passed. I trusted him immensely.

Because we weren't together, he ended up sleeping with someone from his class and we ended things between us. I was heartbroken for awhile but got over him. The new school year started and I accepted an internship that had me out of school for 7 months. He broke up with Vee (they had gotten back together after we stopped sleeping together) as she had gone to study abroad (and cheat on him). We rekindled our friendship, feelings that I had squashed began to develop again, and we decided to try to date for real this past July when I finished my internship. We were happy, our friends were happy.

School year started and it was rough as all fucking hell. He is a graduating engineer with the highest gpa in his class, I am also graduating and working a job. We didn't realize how stressful school + relationship + extracurriculars + sifting through our history would hit us and we ended up taking a break during the first few months to figure things out and get back together. Things felt smooth for awhile, I met his family and we were a good couple, focused on being honest and having good communication. I loved him an awesome amount.

This month, we went back to school after break. The first week came and I was happy: we spent time together, talked about a few trust issues and worked through them. I felt confident in my personal life and our relationship and then last Saturday he broke up with me. He felt he never got over his ex hurting him which translated into fear within our relationship even though I had ""treated him better than anyone else he had been with before"". The stress of his senior year is also eating away at him. He starts going to therapy next month (I've also scheduled my own appointments) but he cannot be with me; however his biggest fear is losing someone he cares about and never speaking to them again. I am of the camp of no contact when broken up with. Still, he is one of my best friends, as are our mutual friends that all live with him. There is a chance of us getting back together but I don't want to live with that in my mind.

As of now I haven't contacted him for a few days and he respects my need for space. Am I being selfish? I want him to know I'm here for him but I also have trouble separating my feelings from our attempts at friendship.

This also has caused conflict within our group of friends, who I have basically seen as my family for the past four years. They all live with him and don't want to choose sides but I'm no longer invited to hangouts or weekend trips because it's awkward to be in the middle. They live with him so it's easier, I guess? My need for space and fear of getting hurt is driving a wedge between all of us. What is the best course of action?

2syqb3,2,2015-01-19,Depression after injury and graduation,jul488,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/2syqb3/depression_after_injury_and_graduation/,"So just over 8 months ago, I was a senior in college, getting ready for the already terrifying prospect of graduating. I was incredibly active- a social captain of my sports team, a teaching assistant, doing research for my thesis, a member of a cooking group, and living with a group of really phenomenal friends. Obviously I was stressed about post graduation, but I've always been pretty optimistic. 

Then six weeks before the end of school, I broke my leg (tibia and fibula), during a game. I spent the next seven weeks on crutches, without being able to put any weight on my leg, and then the next summer and fall in physical therapy, learning to walk again. Now, eight months later, I'm able to walk normally again, but doing any other kind of physical activity makes my knee hurt like hell, and my shin basically feels like a permanent shin splint. 

My friends, family, and teachers were wonderful and supportive. I moved back home after graduation, and have been trying- literally- to get back on my feet since. 

Except now, I still feel awful and broken. I'm working part time (doing an internship that I really like), but every time I think about applying for jobs, I start to shake and feel guilty about not having one already... I wasn't able to finish my thesis before graduation, and even though I know I only have a week or two of work left on it, I haven't looked at it in months. 

Honestly, I don't know if I'm depressed. I know that I'm sad, lonely, and feel guilty about not getting my life together yet. I know that I'm stuck in a cycle of procrastination and shaming myself for having not finished applications or my thesis. I'm frustrated that my body isn't back to normal, and ashamed with the weight I've gained and the muscle I've lost since the injury. I'm still optimistic- I know that two years from now, I'll look back on this as just a memory, but I'm still anxious that I will never break out.  I just don't know how to break this cycle. 

I know the best thing to do is to take it day by day. Stop thinking of everything as overwhelming, and just get something done... I just can't get started. I can't get past the feeling of anxiety and guilt, and I try to distract myself with a game or TV.

Any advice? people that have felt the same way?"

I quit approximately one month ago upon realizing after a lot of denial that I really just couldn't pursue my professional interests if I kept smoking.

I'm a college student in a program for cybersecurity. I didn't realize how much I was screwing myself to be able to work in the field, especially in terms of my ability to gain a security clearance. I know that in 2-3 years I will be fine in terms of being clearable, but I am looking for advice as to what to do in the meantime.

I am a sophomore looking for summer internship in related fields, but am hesitant since even internships often want interns to be able to be clearable. 

Basically I'm wondering what to expect in terms of applications being a recent user, and whether it will hurt my ability to get summer internships. Any advice from anyone who knows something about this would be greatly appreciated."

My grades in school have been doing great, I got an internship lined up for the summer, found a new part-time job with awesome pay, been hanging out with my friends more and started picking up some of my old hobbies again. Just overall keeping myself busy like all my friends and family have suggested. During the day I'm happy doing my daily routines and spending time with friends and such. But at the end of my day in the back of my mind I still sometimes get that awful feeling deep down. I miss talking to her, hearing her dorky laugh, joking around with her and cheering her up. When I was with her in the back of my mind I actually thought ""hey she could actually be the one I want to be with her for the long run"". I realize there's nothing I can do about it and I guess I just feel depressed whenever my mind wanders down that road.


I've been in 2 serious relationships prior to this one and it always worked out for me. That I would forget about an ex after 1-2 months apart and be completely over it. I've always been a positive and up beat person and never really given into depression or negative feelings too much before. But I've been pretty depressed and upset at times for a while now and I just can't shake this feeling. 


Part of me is convinced that I don't ever want to try for a relationship ever again at the risk of getting hurt again and maybe I'm just better off alone. 


Anyways thanks for reading. If anyone has any advice on how to get over this depression, It would be greatly appreciated.

I'm still wondering about a few things in regards to college, majors and that sort of thing

A. I want to study engineering.

However I'm not sure which major I should go for. I've had a job that worked with arduinos and programming in python but I still want to keep an open mind on which one to go to.

So far, my top 3 choices are

1. Computer Engineering

2. Electrical Engineering
3. Mechanical Engineering 

B. Finding Jobs and Internships

I've heard that many people get jobs through ""networking"" however I've never been that much of a social butterfly. Am I doomed? Is there some way I can just network engough to land me that job? Plus how did you guys end up finding it? Was it through job search engines like dice.com or linkin, or did you network with friends/faculty to find that dream job?

[](/paperwork)C. The work is takes it get a degree.

I heard it takes **alot** of time and studying to earn a undergraduate degree in engineering. I don't mind doing the work or putting the time into it, however I would like to know if some of you have some study habits or websites/resources that can help me with the learning process. 

D. Go to just Bachelors degree or go for masters degree?

I know for most engineers, a bachelors degree is enough to live comfortable. However I was thinking. Would it be ok to get a Bachelors degree, work for 1-2 years and then go for my graduates degree? 

E. The Summer before College

Is there anything I should be doing the summer before college in order to get ready for engineering school? Maybe brush up on physics or calculus?

[](/cutefire) F. Anything else you want to add?

Feel free, I'm open to anything!

2t02ij,5,2015-01-19,I [25F] got deleted by a guy [24M] on Facebook after working with him for 4 months on a project.,boutella,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t02ij/i_25f_got_deleted_by_a_guy_24m_on_facebook_after/,"He deleted me on Facebook. Why?

Some background: he’s a foreign exchange student. We met in college. He began flirting with me, gave a lot of compliments, and consistently touched me by “accident”. Kept asking me about my future career plans and if I was up for getting married and possibly moving elsewhere and what my parents were like, asked me out to a café, etc He was cute but I wasn’t sure if he was playing me (since exchange students just want to have fun) because he seemed like the kind of guy who is friends with everyone especially with all the girls. His FB was full of party pics of him and random chicks. He was charming and he knew it. So I haven’t really responded in any way, kept it professional and was cautious. He asked to be in a group with me for a project and I said ok. 

He promised to work hard but as every exchange student he has spent all his time partying, his input to the project throughout the semester was minimal and he only began to do any actual work 3-4 days before the deadline. As a result his part of the project was weak. I began to get annoyed but was polite in our communication and completely stopped responding to his compliments which have switched from you are “pretty” to “smart”. I wasn’t sure anymore if he was using me to get a good grade and an easy project as I did most of it. Eventually we began fighting all the time, he would get offended whenever I would correct his spelling (his English was not very good) or make any remarks regarding his work and started criticizing my work (fair enough). 

On the last day we had a big fight about a ton of small things and we have missed the submission date but eventually managed to get the project submitted anyway. I told him that to me grades matter and he yelled that he didn’t need good grades because he wasn’t planning to work in some bank like me and that I was a naive idiot for thinking that grades matter at all. I guess the part that hurt was that he knew how important the project was to me but decided to be selfish anyway (since he had already secured a future job) and not try very hard. He would also raise voice on me while I tend to withdraw in situations like this.

 At the exam I decided to present an alternative version of his part. In the feedback the examiner told me that I have managed to get a better grade only due to disagreeing with the paper as it was crap. He went in after me and later FBed that he had gotten the same grade as me (which I seriously doubt) since he already knew mine. 

We kept a brief polite talk on FB about how the exam went and he had asked me about the internship I have gotten (which I knew he also wanted). So I replied and have sent him a few more links he had asked me for previously to end things on a good note. He is the type of guy who is always on FB but he didn’t check my message for a few days and then deleted me soon after.

So my question is mostly to the guys, I guess. Why did he delete me on FB? Is it because of all the fighting over the project? Or because I was someone he liked (if he did like me) and then I kept on criticizing him and hurting his feelings? To be fair it’s impossible to get a compliment out of me unless you are brilliant…I can be a bit of a hardass… 

Anyways, I’m sorry it came to this and I don’t judge him for what he did, just wish to understand if he has 1000 friends on FB why was is it so hard for him to keep me there?

P.S. I also never posted anything directly on his wall or in the comments and kept all the conversations private.

TL;DR: A guy flirted with me and told me he liked me. I didn’t reciprocate out of caution. We got into a fight over a project we both had been working on. He kept a polite demeanor and then deleted me on FB without a warning. Why?

2t0ddf,1,2015-01-19,Long ass who knows what about how I don't know where in particular Im going,SoramiezDoEverything,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2t0ddf/long_ass_who_knows_what_about_how_i_dont_know/,"I can't think of any way other than wall-of-text story time to tell this the story of how I came to be a beacon of overhwelming internal apathy. I cant say Im looking for advice, or feedback, or so much as for someone to read through this. I just feel I need to put it down ""on paper"",  and review the results from a seperate mindset. Thats what Id like to say about that, at least. We'll see. 

Where to begin, I don't know. So I'll start at 12 AM, on the PCH in my friend's bright red german sports coupe. 

""You just do what you do, saw school wasn't working and said 'fuck it, Ill do me,' I like that."" My friend said as we sped along california highway 1 through Malibu; his car's 4 cylinder engine making a steady rumble between each note of the Radiohead song playing on his stereo. 

I smiled, nodded my head and mumbled something positive and to the affirmitive. 

A strange silence purveyed the air despite the music. 

""There's supposed to be a new Radiohead album this year, right?"" I said, breaking the silence. 

""Yeah, 2015, it should be good.""

He'd been my friend since I moved to the west side in middleschool. A tall, well built kid with an A+ personality and enthusiasm for adventure. He was my cycling partner, the only reason save for my waning metabolism that I can eat an in-n-out 3 by 3 day in day out without going into a food-induced shock. He introduced me to Top Gear, to El Tepeyac burritos and "" I don't know when Ill be home, mom, its an adventure"". The kind of guy you can always get along with, who tells you ""buy TSLA stock, its about to go up,"" and is right. He is the guy who skipped prom, and instead spent the night out on the town with his girlfriend because he sold his TSLA stock. If ever there were a person to live vicariously through, it was him. 

We were headed for Latigo Canyon Road, a windy switch back laden road in northern malibu just before oxnard. A midnight drive with my friend is just how I want to spend the night with him before he goes back across country to continue on his academic ride to ""Damn, that guy is good.""

""You just do you,"" those words rang in my ears. What even is 'doing me'? I hardly know what me is doing, what me wants to do or where me will be in a week, let alone next month, or next year. 

It would be too easy to blame my appathy on any one thing, but that would be cheating. Apathy, thats the best way to describe it. 

In middle school is when the signs started to show. Homework too much a chore, I relegated my time to videogames and books. Middle school was a boring excercise. Im not about to claim that I believed or believe school was ""beneath me"". To do so would imply that I had a modicum of interest in what was next for me. There was nothing next.

I closed my eyes, laying in bed, it was 2AM and I had to be at work at 9. My friend had gone home, and my room was silent save for the soft hum of my hard drive spinning, backing up all of my files. I tried to imagine a timeline. In my minds eye, I could see everything leading up to now. My fifth grade yosemite field trip. Sixth grade dance with my disturbingly twin-like girlfriend of the time. I fast forward down the line, it stops at this moment. I can not now, nor have I ever been able to, imagine a future event on this line. Ambitions hazy, I tried to force myself to sleep. Its 2:30. I have work at 9. Four hours of sleep. Its 3 - three and a half hours of sleep. Eventually, dreamless sleep comes. 

I often try my best to imagine my future. Set some kind ambition for myself. Everytime I hit an solid white wall. ""This is not yet for you,"" it says. 

I suppose now is when I go full Terrentino and rewind to ""the start"". Its only propper. Don't worry, this part will go quickly. The only question is where the start is. 

Sophomore year of highschool was as good as any, and the end of my high school career. It consisted entirely of me coasting through my regular, non-honors classes. Aside from one class, you could always find me in my seat with a book in my hand, entirely disconnected from the proceedings around me.  My report card was a chorus to the tune of c, d, c, d, a, c. I just didnt have it in me to put forth the energy to pay attention. I doubt I was even really aware of my appaling grades. In my mind, I was done. Id discovered a golden ticket - the CHSPE. I could leave high school two years early and go to the local JC, studying things I cared about. It was perfect, an infallable plan. Because of that, I just sat and waited. I had a 40% truancy rate, almost enitrely due to an incredible apathy which held me to my bed.

To add to my lack of scholastic progress, I had a very stilted social life. I was friends with 3 people, and only one actually hung out with me regularly. I was too caught up in my own proceedings to notice those around me. Not in a holier-than-thou way, but rather in a sort of half daze that kept me sane. If people were attempting to reach out to me, I was entirely oblivious to it. The only notable exception was the girl who sat next to me in chemistry. She was a short girl, at least a third my height.  She had potential to be a good student, but was incredibly wrapped up in drugs and partying. This came to my attention fully when, one afternoon as people were filing into the room in the intermediary period between lunch and class, she sat next to me and happily cried, ""Hey, guess what? Check your phone!"" 

I nodded and went back to my book. 


""Are you taking notes?"" She asked, ""Im really high, I did a line in the bathroom.""
This is when I noticed her eyes were dialated. I decided I should probably check my phone

Her: Hey, I like you, date?

Short, concise. I said no. Despite the fact that she was fairly cute, she was also entirely too peppy and I couldnt muster the energy to match hers, and deal with her drug issues. 

And with that, my high school romantic life came to its end. Not that it had any sort of beginning. 

The rest of the year went on without event. I passed the CHSPE and unceremoniously ended my career as a high school student. The next semester would see me as a college student. I loaded up my schedule, photography, computer science, anthropology, and history. It all started quite well. I was enthusiastic about my classes. It didnt last. 

I felt the same as ever- apathetic. I stayed in bed all day. On days when I should have been in class, I instead rode my bike to the Santa Monica Airport and sat on the observation deck, watching the planes come and go, the drone of turboprops, props, and jets making any kind of deep thinking impossible. I would sit there until my stomach's moans were too much to bear, then bike to the Family Mart convenience store and buy a $2 meat bun and some soda. This is how I passed my entire first semester. I only passed computer science, and only due to my need to compete - the only friend I made at SMC happened to be in that class. The next semester I only took one class, and dropped out after three sessions. I couldnt stand the professor's inane, ""office place"" humor. Besides, who needs VB? Ill take Java instead, eventually. 

At this point, I needed a job. I began looking for work, but found very little I could be enthused about. It was only by the grace of nepotism that I got an internship at an agency, and with that I completely exited academia. I became a simulcra of who I should be post-school, and have been maintaining that image ever since. 

After I left the agency, I went to Tokyo for a week. It was nice to find myself surrounded by a barely intelligible world. Good food, good tea, and an occaisional sake was a recipe for a happy me. But of course, I had to go back. Unfortunately, my trip to Tokyo left me with an intense wanderlust. 

One last thing. Fast forward several months, and I now work a full time job doing, eh it isnt important, making OK money if it werent LA, and generally doing nothing. I meet a pink haired exchange student on OK cupid and strike up a friendship. We hang out occaisionally, and I finally have someone to talk to in a different context than my more egocentric male friends. Its going well until I confess. It ruins everything, texting grinds to a halt with her. Im left, isolated, just maintaining the simulcra, unable to think. Its 11:45. Im about to turn in, generally apathetic and tired. My friend texts. ""Wanna go for a drive?""

Well reddit, thats what I want to get off my chest. If you read all that shit, thanks. Obviously this is a throaway but I will respond if people comment.

The problem is that I earned an internship already in San Francisco, and he is terribly jealous. He's upset because I'm a year before him but he hasn't found something this year. Since that, it seems like he can only see his life as a competition he's losing at.

Video games, classes, anything I do or make starts to upset him, and he calls himself awful and terrible.

Just today I was making a little Java program and he got really upset because of how ""perfect"" he thought it already was.. I don't really know what to do. It hurts me to see him so upset at me and circumstance because there is nothing I can do to change me.

I want to help him, but I don't know how.

For the last three years now, I've attended a high-ranking US university studying computer science. One of the biggest issues that we seem to face is gender equality and female involvement in our field of study. Historically, girls have been discouraged from entering the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields, but I think this is no longer an issue. Others disagree...

Because of the relatively small number of female students in our department, we have a student organization specifically for them (this isn't their actual name, but let's call them **""CSW"", Computer Science Women**). I run a gender-neutral, interest-specific student organization, but of the people in our regular membership, only one of them is female (and she doesn't even participate in CSW). Conversely, a majority of women that do participate in student organizations do so exclusively in CSW, giving no attention to the welcoming and more technically-oriented groups.

I've tried explaining this to my peers, but they go silent every time: I think this whole arrangement is counter-productive to CSW's core mission: to more closely integrate women into the existing (currently male-dominated) computer science culture. I can't go a single week without hearing about how women are at a professional disadvantage in our field, while companies are hiring women for the sole reason that they're female. Our department has a high male-to-female ratio, but more than half of the Google summer interns were women. When one of my friends was asked why he didn't work at Google, he responded with, ""Because I don't have a vagina.""

Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong advocate for gender **equality**, but every time I try to chime in on discussions like this, people give me disappointed looks and hang their heads. Am I the crazy one? If the people in CSW want to be a part of the regular CS culture, why do many of them isolate themselves to a single group? We're a very liberal university and the computer science department is a very welcoming group, so why can't they just join in with the rest of us and end this thinking that they're at a disadvantage?"

I have just under $17k in savings, no debt. Most of this money is in a high-interest rate savings account (0.99%). I get excellent financial aid, so school is almost free for me--I only pay about $2k/yr. This includes tuition, housing, and a meal plan.

**Upcoming internships:**

I have positions lined up at two companies, both in San Francisco. I do not have to pay for food during the workweek or any transportation. I am considering getting health insurance, but I'm not sure if I will, and how much it would cost if I did.

*Company A:* 15 weeks. $7.1k/mo income. 1.8k/mo rent.

*Company B:* 12 weeks. $8k/mo income, housing included (so no rent to be paid). Also has a lot of perks included - free laundry service, free haircuts, free gym membership, etc.

Considering I will have a lot of disposable income, and I don't foresee any large expenses coming up, I thought this would be a great time to start doing some smart saving. I'm not sure if the best option is to simply let it sit in my savings account accruing a bit of interest, or if there are other ways to get the most out of the money. I've done a bit of research into the Roth IRAs, but I don't know if that's the best avenue for me -- and even if it is, that's only $5.5k this year. I don't access to a company 401k or anything from the companies, since I'll be there for such a short stint."

I recently accepted an internship so I cannot use the stress of school, being an engineering student really does weigh you down. I had to deal with moving away from school and my friends, so I plan on taking this time to better myself in hopes of returning looking better than I ever have. 

However, I have turned to this subreddit in hopes of finding the support I really do need. Being away from my life is making this seem like a very daunting task with no one here to help me through it. I really don't want to feel so lonely anymore and I hope to find some comfort in the fact that there are people out there who are going through the same fight and struggle that I am.

More technically, I started a calorie count to keep myself under 2300 calories a day and have begun to work out every day. I plan to be able to return to my friends in May under 250 lbs. I plan on drinking nothing but water for at least two weeks to see what kind of influence that has on me.

tl;dr
Fat guy needs some support to help in his weight loss."

so i went to apply an internship at somewhere, the first 3 days of work i didnt stop crying, i felt everything i ever known is lost, of course i tried to hold on to it, but then the partners of the firms (the bosses) started to notice i was not ok and tried to consult me etc...giving me time and chances and all but i was just too uncomfortable to stay there anymore, too many thoughts  running through my head, is it the right field,is it the right place,is it what i want etc

so i left the internship, not knowing where do i go after that.

when i am home, i am dealing with my parents expectation, the same people who tells me to hang on to it, i stay too far for any sales job/freelance that they wont hire me (and myriad of reasons that not made known to me).

Again, i pushed myself to go back and apply internships, i get interviews, and even got some offer, but i just have no confidence that i wont mess up again, its  a very demanding field everyone wants my assurances of not  messing it up (even i didnt tell them about my previous internship)

its been four months i am jobless, my mum understands my dilemma and asked if i wanted to further my studies (i can cope with heavy and tedious studies) but my father wont let me, he said not until i finished my internship and be fully qualified

i know people have to grow up and start somewhere, and i am lucky not having to worry about finances, but my heart just cant quiet down about the anxieties, i cried everytime after an interview, whether it was good or bad ones

i got so emotionally distress once i totally shut down for days, like i disconnected with reality,favourite songs dont cheer me anymore, i just want to be on my own all day.

i dont know where to go next, and i have no special ability beside some amateur writing skills, and some hobbies that cant make it a job.

i am so lost, i cant go back to the first firm because i am still the same me, not sure if i would still cry at work etc....

Nimen hao ^ - ^ （that's hello as we say in Chinese) my name is maynew_cani (super funny pun only bilingual Chinese/English speakers like myself will understand, lol!).  I wanted to share with you my summer spent in China before senior year of university (⌒▽⌒).  While China can have its moments  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  I overall loved my time there and want to go back to China for full time work once I graduate in May.  I hope you all enjoy the pictures!  

In short, my trip is comprised of two main parts: my internship in Hong Kong followed by my language immersion program in Beijing.  

Finally, before diving into my write-up, I am hoping to return to SE China to work an English teaching position for 6-12 months while I interview for finance related positions in HK and Shanghai.  If any of you have had good experiences with a certain organization/know which organizations are the best, I would love it if you could share you experience with me!  Thanks!

------------------------


Here is a contextual write-up I did for my relatives that I was in contact with while I was abroad.  


------------------------
..............................


I recently arrived in Hong Kong after an extremely long day of travel. The company I am interning for generously provided me with a very nice apartment to live in during my stay here. I have attached pictures of the apartment, as well as of the view from my window. One picture is of a large skyscraper I walked past and is unrelated to the apartment.  Another photo is of a meal I ate for dinner, extremely good dumplings.

One of the first ""China moments"" to happen to me occurred when I went and got breakfast early in the morning at a local restaurant. I sat myself and began to decipher the menu (which is an extremely arduous task, imagine any menu at an American restaurant, with its use of foreign and obscure language to describe dishes, the same goes for Chinese menus) when the waitress comes up and brings me an English menu.  After receiving my order of soup with meat in it, the waitress comes and brings me a fork! Of course I thanked her, not trying to embarrass her, but really? A fork? For soup?! Absurd. It is merely a result of the harmless stereotype held by some Chinese that white people must eat with forks! I found it funny, and not offensive. It was not the first time I was given an unnecessary fork, nor will it be the last.

------------------

So I arrived in Hong Kong a week before my internship starts, and so I have been trying to find ways to amuse myself. Yesterday, I was out shopping for some toiletries and exploring local parks to try to find a place to play basketball when I noticed Victoria Peak. The way Hong Kong is built is quite fascinating. The main island is built around a ""mini-mountain""  located in approximately the center of the island. So you have a city which has an extremely steep gradient as you get closer to the mountain. There are massive skyscrapers built on slopes that you could not drive an RV up. So I decided around five o clock yesterday to walk towards the mountain, Victoria Peak, and reach the top. My goal was to use my phone only for cardinal directions, and not for mapping.

I live North of the peak, so I knew I had to go south, and up. And that is what I did. The pictures I sent you are only a few of the huge staircases I climbed yesterday as I progressed towards the mountain. The staircases are old and very beautiful. I also took some shots of bridges and pedestrian pathways with cool architecture. The pictures should give you an idea of the massive gradient that some of these buildings are built on. To be clear, the largest skyscrapers are built where the ground is level, but there are still some enormous buildings built on the slopes.

-----------

As I journeyed further south and further uphill, I came across I very steep staircase which looked very unused.  This staircase was located off a somewhat secluded road, and did not appear to lead to anything in particular except for a platform.  I could not discern what was at the top of the staircase from the bottom, except for a fence surrounding a large platform. I walked up the staircase and opened the fence. To my surprise, there was a soccer pitch on this platform elevated so high in the air. It was incredible, and I hope to play a game there soon.  The soccer field was surrounded by skyscrapers, it was absolutely fantastic.  ​
-----------

I descended from the soccer field on an extremely slippery path, which the pictures show, on my way to the peak. I was close to the trails, but I still had some ways to go. After winding through some very steep roads, I eventually made it to the entrance to the peak, and began hiking up. I saw this sign, which is shown in the pictures, which details how the city is constantly taking safety precautions with the land to ensure the soundness of the foundations for many buildings. You can see why this would be a concern for them. The sign was near a stairway which looked relatively unused compared to the large path I had been taking to reach the Peak, so naturally I decided to explore the stairwell. I believe that the stairwell should have been locked after exploring it. What I walked into was one of many zones where civil engineers work to ensure the stability of the land on the peak. There was no one working in the area, which was fairly secluded, and I found a small trail leading into the side of the mountain and some heavy brush. I took the trail and had to hop over an aqueduct inlaid in the ground, which appeared to be taking freshwater to the city, and began trailblazing a path up an incredibly steep part of the mountain. It was very fun, definitely a little dangerous, but very, very fun. Unfortunately, I could not get too far up this way because it was getting dark and it was hard to move quickly due to the steepness.

Another cool thing about the peak was that it was in the clouds. You can see cloudy mist in one of my photos, this was a cloud moving through the peak, and unfortunately made most of my pictures from this trail useless.

----------

By this time it was getting dark as I descended from my danger-trail, but I still wanted to summit the peak. I went back to the public trail and started working my way up. I found some good pictures to take, which I have attached. I almost made it to the top, but had to stop short due to ravenous hunger and tired legs. I will undoubtedly make it to the peak soon. Where I stopped is a tourist location and also the home of a massive, daunting building built on the peak. It is a fairly famous building and my picture does not do it justice. I encourage you to Google image search ""the peak tower hong kong"" so you can see how impressive this building is. I hope you enough the photos of Hong Kong's skyline at night. I will have better ones by the end of the trip.


--------PART 2

About two weeks ago I hiked once again to Victoria Peak with a friend I met here.  I went atop the building I detailed in the last email, the Peak Building, and went to the observing platform for a breathtaking view of the city. 
 
A few days later, a friend from Georgetown took me to the other side of the harbor, known as the Kowloon side, where you get an incredible view of the skyline from down low.  I took a ferry across the harbor, and it was a really cool experience.  The water did have a fair bit of trash in it, and I would definitely not want to swim in it anytime soon. 
 
Last Wednesday was the 25th anniversary of TAM.  I went to the commemoration event in Victoria Park, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.  There were over 150,000 people together rallying.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It is very powerful to see so many people together for a common cause.  I took quite a few pictures, but they were from the ground, so it is hard to tell the scope of the event.  It was HUGE.  Check out this link. 
http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/jamesfallows/pb-120604-tiananmen-hongkong-ps1.photoblog900.jpg
 
I took most of my panoramic pictures and pictures of the flags towards the bottom right side of the photo.  What's funny is the first couple of pictures I took from the event were from a group called ""Voice of Loving Hong Kong"".  This group denies the culpability of the government and says that the event was necessary to maintain social stability, and also that the students were asking for it by upsetting social order.  There was a lot of heated tension between this small group and the thousands of protesters, I personally witnessed one fight-which was quickly broken up by the hundreds of police stationed at every corner. 
 
The protests were especially big this year because coming up is supposed to be Hong Kong's first ""democratic"" election, and there is a lot of tension between Hong Kongers and Beijing over what will happen.  Hong Kong people are agitating for a free election with universal suffrage, where anyone can run and anyone can vote.  However, Beijing has hinted that there will be a system where Beijing selects a group of 12 candidates and all Hong Kongers can vote for them.  Obviously these candidates will toe the party line. 
 
My co-workers recently took me out for Hot Pot, which is a style of food where there is a stew cooked in the middle of the table and raw meats, vegetables, and dumplings prepared in plates on the outside.  You take the uncooked items, drop them in the stew, and wait for several minutes.  Then, you take them out and dip them in various sauces.  The taste is amazing! I love it.  After that, I went to the biggest night-life street in Hong Kong, called LKF, and took some pictures of a classic Saturday there.  
 
Finally, I recently tried playing soccer on Sunday, but it was a horrible smog day as you can see from the last two photos, and I could hardly breath.  I didn't end up playing for more than five minutes.

----------------------------

The rest of my time was spent in Beijing at the ACC Hamilton summer language program at Minzu Daxue.  Man, it sucked.  It was terrible--I had to wake up everyday at 5:30 to order maidanglao delivery, then study for 2 hours before my first class at 8, get out of class at 1:30, workout and be pissy all day because of lack of sleep, study while pissy and tired, go to bed and repeat.  But I learned a lot of Chinese, my Chinese *hunhow*.  The weekends were just blurred together binge drinking events, my friends and I coined the term ""heichu"" 黑出.  See if you can't figure out what we meant, as its nonsensical in Chinese.  

Anyways, that's it!

2t2e1w,2,2015-01-20,Mom is trying to claim me as a dependent...can she?,morgimiester,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2t2e1w/mom_is_trying_to_claim_me_as_a_dependentcan_she/,"So, I'm in a little bit of a pickle. For the 2013 tax year, my mom claimed me as a dependent, not knowing that I had already filed my taxes and claimed myself. She just got a letter from the IRS indicating that we can't both claim me (of course) and that someone needs to amend their tax return. She's adamant that I do the amending, but I'm not sure that she can legally claim me. Here's the situation. 

1) I was in school from January 2013-May 2013

2) I took out my own student loans for school 

3) After I graduated in May, I did a 3 month internship in Tennessee where my room + board was paid for 

4) When I moved back in August, I lived with my mom for a grand total of 6 weeks while looking for a job. She did not charge me rent and paid for a good amount of my food, so I know that can count as covering some of my expenses. She also paid for my health insurance during this time ($250/month, which is generous). But, because we can't stand each other and have fundamentally different views on...pretty much everything, I moved out and lived on my own from Oct-December 

5) My total income from 2013 was ~ 12k 

What should I do at this point? Can she claim me? I haven't gotten a letter from the IRS but recently moved, so they may have sent it to the wrong address. 


**Edit: Thank you for the replies! I've worked it out with my mom so that I'll amend my tax return and she will pay whatever I owe back (which I think will be a measly amount). She understands that she won't be able to get away with this next year, and we're finally on the same page. "

2t2hby,11,2015-01-20,Intro!,tearsofpchies,waiting_to_try,https://www.reddit.com/r/waiting_to_try/comments/2t2hby/intro/,"Hello all! I've been lurking for a while and thought I'd finally introduce myself. So nice to read posts from others who are in similar situations :)

My husband and I are both 26 and have been married for just over a year (together on/off about 7 years before that). We have always known we both wanted kids but mostly discussed it in vague ""one day..."" terms. Well, for some reason or another I feel like we've both grown up a lot over the past year of being married (perhaps accompanied by buying our first apartment together last summer) and the talks are becoming more reality-based and we've begun talking about an actual timeline!

The main reason we're still holding off is our work situation, like for many other couples. We both are insanely busy - he runs his own company and I am in a super intense grad school program. The real limiting factor here is that I have to match for a internship (likely starting summer 2017) to complete my degree, which is a strict requirement with a set number of hours I need to complete, so it's not really possible to take any time off during that year. That WOULD give us plenty of time to have our first child before summer 2017, except that in-person interviews for these internships happen during winter 2016, and they are notorious for discriminating against women who are visibly pregnant (even though it's not technically allowed).

So, counting backwards, that really narrows down the timeframe in which we could conceive and carry to term, all before winter 2016! Unless we want to wait until 2018...which just seems way too far off for us. We're holding off on actually trying to get pregnant until the second half of 2015 - due to aforementioned crazy work situations, a few travel plans already booked, and miscellaneous important things like taking my qualifying exams which I wouldn't want to deal with while pregnant. But, in anticipation, we just decided that I'm going to go off birth control once I run out of this pack so I can hopefully take a few months to regulate and start tracking my cycle!

I guess I'm sort of dealing with mixed feelings since I'm getting excited about actually gearing up to try so soon, but also preparing myself for disappointment in case it doesn't happen in the measly 6 month window until I have to stop trying. 

Anyway, happy to be here for now, especially since we haven't really been able to talk about this with anyone else (still a taboo topic in academia). Thanks to anyone who made it through this wall of text :)

2t2rqa,4,2015-01-20,"My [23F] broke up with me [26M] after 2 years. One month on, am I doing it right?",pendingpending,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t2rqa/my_23f_broke_up_with_me_26m_after_2_years_one/,"My ex-gf and I were happily together for two years until she went away for her gap year to the States from the UK.

Before she left, we lived in the same city, went to the same church and constantly saw each other, hung out and made time for each other. We talked about the future (marriage) and rarely, and I do mean rarely, argued. When we did it was silly things that did not affect the relationship.

Before she left, we spoke frankly about marriage about said that realistically, it would be in two years time. This allowed time for her to come back and finish her final year at University. We didn't set anything in stone. It was just an idea of a timeline.
During the build up of her leaving, she was upset, but I constantly reminded her that we would be fine, it's only one year away from each other and I was coming out to visit.

At first she found it hard to meet new people. I told her moving to such a big city, compared to where we are, it would hard to make new friends. It will take time, but she would get there. 

After two months or so, she got more comfortable (joined clubs, societys etc.) and importantly found a church. But her workload got more and more heavy. We would text every day and Skype once or twice a week. We always made time to at least text.

Near Halloween, she got an internship that would keep her there longer. She told me in a text and I was so happy for her, but at the same time upset that she would be staying longer and our initial plan was for me to come out near the end of term time, travel for a bit and go home together. 

When we spoke about it on Skype, I came across upset because I had a bad day and frustrated she would be gone longer. This came across and I did apologise and everything seemed fine.

A few days later we spoke again and she started to feel like there are alot of opportunities of her out there and not sure what she may want as a career. We spoke again and she wanted to go on a break until she came home for Christmas. This time was to figure out what we want for each other and the relationship in general. It was a 6 week break and it killed. We din't skype, rarely text and she wanted to know who I told about the break. I had to reach out to friends and family as my head was in a tail-spin.

When she got back, we met up. I talked about how this time has been great to for me to figure out what I want for the future and how I need to work on my flexibility and openness and change. Sometimes I do struggle with that.
From her side, she felt that she doesn't know if she would live in the UK, she may not want to get married and we don't match on the same values(?). She mentioned that there were certain things that either people out there or her girlfriends at home got really excited about compared to my reaction. 
She then followed this comment with giving me compliments to how great I was during this time of her being away and she may never meet someone else like me. It felt like someone saying ""you're perfect for the job, but we are not going to give it to you"".
What made things more confusing is that after leaving her off, we both said to each other ""I Love you"".

As I was leaving her home, she asked if I was going to the gig my friend was putting on the next night. I said ""Yes"" and she said ""I will see you there"". 
My friend who put on the gig told me a few nights before that he saw she bought a ticket. So leading up to her coming home, I was slightly positive that we would work things out, as she was going to the gig the night after.

So what unfolded was her sitting in the corner with her mum the night after we broke up, whilst I was there with friends. Her mum came up to me at one stage and gave me a quick hug and hello.

A few days later, her Dad spoke to me at church and said that it was sorry it didn't work out between myself and his daughter and hope this situation wouldn't affect our relationship (her dad and mine). Was hard to hear that.

I felt I had some unanswered questions in regards to her reasons for breaking up. She didn't really clear anything up and we ended this follow up on good terms (no crying or fighting). I was just glad to say everything I needed to get out. We had a few laughs and decided that that the door is open to text, but use if and whenever.

It's been just over a month since we last talked and broke up. I've been hanging out with friends, going to the gym and trying to get myself happier on my own.

I suppose what's drawn me here is how we ended this relationship with her reasons. We had such a strong bond and had up until the point being on a break, we managed the long distance well, had an idea of a future together and we both said 'I love you' when breaking up.

The six week break did help me dealing with being single again. And although it is really hard, it certainly eased me into this situation. But I know not to jump straight back on the horse and find someone else to be with.


But I am now at the point of wanting to speak to her. Why? To see how she is, to re-kindle a friendship and then re-kindle a relationship. 

I obviously still care about her and the fact her brother and his now wife went through a similar situation (broke up when she was travelling, got engaged when he met her at the airport when she was coming home), is making me think can we do the same.

She was the woman I cared deeply about, she knew my friends, I knew hers and planned on marrying. It just feels like such a waste to throw away over reasons that could be fixed or worked on in our relationship and build on.

---   
**tl;dr**: happily together for two years, gf goes to the States, three months later after a break, we break up."

2t2ut1,35,2015-01-20,College was the biggest mistake of my life,NarcissisticPie,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2t2ut1/college_was_the_biggest_mistake_of_my_life/,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I have always been a good student, and my high school councilors recommended that I look into applying to competitive colleges.  I'm from the flyover region, so that practically meant applying to colleges far away from home, which at the time was part of the appeal.  I wanted to open up new doors and get a solid foundation for a career in international relations.  My top 3 schools rejected me, but I ended up getting into a prestigious New England liberal arts college that offered enough financial aid to make it no more burdensome than state school, so I decided to matriculate there.

Part of the problem is that I didn't fit in.  A significant part of campus came from wealthy New England or California families and arrived at orientation with friends from their prestigious private high schools or from flying in the same privileged circles.  It didn't help that I was initially hesitant about alcohol and drugs, and generally have a lot of social anxiety.  Even though I didn't make friends at first, I held out hope that I was just slow to the ball but would make my way eventually.  I'm now a semester away from graduation and all of my friendships are decentralized and shallow, and I eat all of my meals alone.  Even though I thought about transferring for a while, I figured that it wouldn't be much better at any other school.  I probably had as good of a change at social success here as I would have anywhere else, based on community attitudes and interests--I just think I'm unfit for college life generally.

The resulting social isolation allowed my anxiety and melancholy to stew.  After sophomore year I became actively misanthropic, and just gave up on my meager social life.  I started smoking a lot of weed on my own to escape, and it became a habit.  I feel like after almost four years of all this I've become an anti-social loser, and that this is now my personality.  I have no energy or patience for socialization or ""networking.""

And even though I did well academically, money, morals, and anxiety keep me from employment.  Because my school's not in an urban center we don't really do school year internships.  Over the summers I did what I could get (although I couldn't take an unpaid internship in a city or with a company that could actually produce an effective professional network).  But these experiences are now dismissed as either irrelevant to actual professional life (in the case of a research assistantship) or just unintelligible (when I worked for a nonprofit in my widely disrespected home state).  I had to quit one legal internship after a depressive episode that kicked my ass the summer after sophomore year.  So I basically have no practical experience.

I majored in a rigorous interdisciplinary program focusing on politics and society that's turning out to be useless.  Even though the program itself is great (small class sizes, special attention, weekly papers, extensive professor feedback) it hasn't been much use to me.  Everyone in the major with their post-graduate life already lined up is either going onto Wall Street or into law school.  Investment banking turns me off for ethical and interpersonal reasons, and I couldn't get into it now without sucking someone's dick anyway.  Although I'd be okay with a career in law, I can't afford law school.  For a while I thought I'd do a PhD and end up teaching, but my student loans (which are already accruing interest at a 10% rate) keep me from doing anything like that.  I feel like I did everything I was supposed to, but I just don't have the skills to turn it into a job.  This all really hit home yesterday when asking a professor for a recommendation to one of the only job openings about which I felt optimistic, only to have to professor decline to recommend because of another more experienced student applicant to this position.  I've never gotten so much as an interview for a paid position.  It's hard to apply for jobs with such confidence in my own mediocrity.

I shouldn't have gone to college, or, if I did, I should have gone to a community school.  Things might have been different if I was in a STEM field, but, seeing as my main assets are research and writing skills, college just sucked my bank dry and left me stranded in an ocean of debt.  Don't get me wrong: I got an excellent education, but a solid grounding in political theory isn't worth $60000.  I feel like college has more than anything embittered me, and it's infuriating that I've paid so much for such an episode in defeat and self-destruction.

Only one semester left.  But I'm afraid that my problems will worsen after graduation.  If I can't deal with an environment where everything is made for me, how am I going to survive in the professional world?  Will I even be able to keep myself above the poverty line with my shitty credit and enormous debt?  Whatever the case, it's my fault for placing such idiotic trust in a fucked up system.  As with so many things in my life, I feel like I've followed the rules and done what I was told would produce positive outcomes only to get screwed over and over again.  In retrospect, I might have had few options right out of high school, but I would be a lot more financially stable and less emotionally damaged if I'd just worked my way through community college or professional school.

Back to writing my worthless honors thesis, I guess."

2t2zi4,1,2015-01-20,"Moving to San Francisco Bay Area directly after graduation, need advice.",codestp202,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2t2zi4/moving_to_san_francisco_bay_area_directly_after/,"Hello, this is my first post to personal finance. I am currently going to school at Kent State University in Ohio. I am on full loans at this point and I'm making a good amount of money in my internship ($20 an hour). I'm weighing my options of moving to the Bay Area (I won't move until I have a job locked down) and I want to know what a realistic salary is to get me by. 

I will have 4-5k in savings by the time I move (Late may, early June), and around 3-4k in loan disbursement saved up I can use. I may be able to find a position that will move me for free, but I also may have to pay it myself.

Finances / Debt-  
* $300-400 a month for loan payments (for next 10-15 years?)  
* $190 a month payment for my motorcycle for next 5 years as my main transportation (not bringing a car, will be driving girlfriends if needed)  
* $150 every 3 months for motorcycle insurance  
* Gas? Bike gets 45-50 mpg so guessing &gt;$100 a month on that  
* $100 a month for credit card bills for the next 2-3 years  
* Rent will be around 2100 a month split between me and GF (Planning on living in Mountain View, San Jose, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, or Redwood) so 1100 a month  
* Still on parents cell phone plan  
* Groceries- $300 a month?  
* Other expenses including going out/ $200 a month?  
* Gym membership ~$50 a month  

So, what realistic salary could get me by? I'm graduating with a computer information systems degree and hopefully will be able to make over 70k in the Bay Area. Would 60-80k work? Also, I'm sure there are a few expenses I'm missing but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

I have had a really terrible day so far and I there is this subtle pain in my chest because of the situation I am in.  Please help me figure this out.

While working for a company as an Intern (Jan – June 2013) I lived in corporate housing with 3 other roommates in San Francisco. Upon leaving the apartment I was charged with a $2500 bill for carpet damages and door replacement.  My roommates we’re not charged at all.  I called the apartment company and told them several times that it should be divided by the four roommates, but they told me that my company told them, the corporate housing company, to bill me. I did not know my roommates prior to living with them as it was set up by the company and I made rent payment to my company.

6 Months after they requested payment they threatened to send me to collections, so I payed $200 as part of a payment plan, but never signed anything or agreed to a payment plan. 

3 months later, after almost a year the corporate housing company finally cut the bill to roughly $500 ($700 - $200 I had payed them) and requested payment. But at this point I felt scammed and just never respond, kinda telling them to fuck off. Well now, 2 days ago I received a call from a collections agency saying that I owed $2700 (more than the original bill and not accounting for the $200 I had sent them). My heart sank. I am 21 years old, about to graduate and scared about what this means.

It has been officially 2 years since we signed the lease, 1.5 years since they sent the bill and .5 years since they sent it to collections.

Can you please tell me what I should be doing with the collections agency? Should I just save up and pay it?  Also, what does this mean for my future employment and ability to get loans and such?

2t3bqc,2,2015-01-20,"Me [23 M] with my gf [24 F] of half a year (long distance) relationship, tough decision and I don't know what to do",throweyx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t3bqc/me_23_m_with_my_gf_24_f_of_half_a_year_long/,"I'm 23 year old guy who is finishing my Bachelor's degree this year. My gf is doing her internship for her Master's degree in another country and quite soon I have to make a really tough decision what do with our life.

Let me start from beginning. We met a half a year ago and immediately felt connection and that's why we quite quickly became a couple. The worst part that the whole duration of our relationship we lived in different cities and because of her internship she now lives even in a different country. Of course it is not so bad, because we see each other at least once a month for a couple of days. As I mentioned before she is doing her internship so she could apply for Master's studies in UK (we're not from UK) and that would make almost impossible for us to meet and she can't really live without me (at least she is saying and showing that). Right now I'm doing my own internship too and after there is a huge possibility that I will get a job at that company.

Now about my main problem and the decision which I have to make quite soon. I was thinking a lot about it and I can't really find the right way to do it. 

**My options:**
1) As I mentioned she wants to study in UK while I want to stay in my home country. She is asking me to go with her and find a job there, but I don't want to go mainly because I want to study in my country for Master's degree too (and work also at the same time). So moving with her to UK would be my first option.
2) The second option is to stay here and she will have to choose to study Master's degree here, but the universities are worse here than in UK. I think this option is maybe the best, but I still have concerns, because... I just don't know if I really love her or maybe I just don't understand what it is (this is my first relationship, btw). If I force her to comeback to our home country and the things don't work out I feel that it would really hurt her career and life. I just don't know what I feel for her and I'm not sure how life would it be if we live together because I see some things that I don't like in her. 
3) And finally there is a third option - the most extreme one. The option is to break up. That way I would let her chase her dream to study in UK and I would stay where I want.

So these are my options and I'm thinking between 2nd and 3rd. Quite soon I will be visiting her parents and we probably have to discuss this question and I still don't have my answer. Maybe someone's different perspective will help me to find the right way. I just feel I'm not really ready for these kind of tough life choices.

tldr: Long distance relationship and I have to make a tough decision. 1) Move to other country (no further education, just work). 2) Stay in my home country and maybe ruin my gf's life. 3) Break-up with my gf.

**Help**!"
2t3hxy,1,2015-01-20,Posting this crazy dream here so I can always recall it,homoerotic_dreamer,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/2t3hxy/posting_this_crazy_dream_here_so_i_can_always/,"&gt; I'll start this off by saying that I am hetero-romantic but pansexual, and I am posting this for personal reasons, but any comments are welcome. This dream left me sweaty and depressed for an hour this morning.

The earliest part I can remember was me groping my own perky boobs (I'm male) alone in my old room at the house I was raised in. But I was groping them from a second perspective, although I could ""feel"" the sensation of both the plump softness of the breasts, and my very eager hands. Suddenly, my areola and nipples began to expand, but shrunk when I stimulated them.

This next part is a bit fuzzy, but I believe I was rudely interrupted by a fictional coworker (important character later on) who said we had to get back to work. My home transitioned into a workplace, but the structure and design remained the same.

##This is where it gets very vivid.

Our ""work"" was extremely odd. In retrospect, we were basically labor interns who helped with the production of a gay porn video, but I didn't know that at the time. The coworker just said to get back to work, and I did so as if I've done it a million times before.

Specifically, we were the cleanup crew. My bed was being used as a table to fold and clean uniforms, costumes, clothes, and probably other things I can't remember. Then my bed turned into a gigantic sink which I used to clean dirty enema materials and other things with feces on them. 

Then, my coworker, who in hindsight strongly resembles my friend ""Tate"", mischievously suggested something very strange. You see, while we were cleaning and what not, the sex scene was being staged in the master bedroom which was only a short hallway length away, unbeknownst to me. 

What Tate suggested was that we disguise ourselves, grab some anal beads, and blow them into one of the actor's anuses. Again, I didn't know what he had in mind and simply mimicked him the whole way through. I remember him telling me that ""no one will notice"", ""it'll be fun"", and ""follow me"". 

So, he and I grabbed some beads, walked out of my room, and headed to the master bedroom. From the hallway, I could see the two actors vigorously having sex on the carpet floor, but no camera crew or any other things, just the actors fucking.

Both of the porn actors were male, except one was extremely effeminate. He was petite with a fair complexion, completely hairless with supple skin, and his asshole was bleached. Of course, he was the bottom and we were going to force anal beads into his ass. I don't remember much of the other guy. 

The room was very dim lit with an orange tint. I saw the masculine actor stop and move out of the way, as if he was expecting us. The effeminate guy knelt down with his bottom up and head down and he spread his asshole. This whole time I was thinking ""this is actually working.""

Tate did the deed very swiftly but I was uncomfortably surprised by how he did it. I saw him squat down and press his face right against the effeminate guy's ass and blow the beads in with his mouth. After seeing this, I panicked and quickly put the beads in my mouth so I wouldn't cause suspicion, but that was irrelevant. I squatted down, put my hands on his cheeks, and I tried my best to blow the beads in. It didn't work and I was making loud fart and wheezing sounds trying to force it in. I even began using my tongue to force it in an effort to not become suspicious. The actor complained I was making a loud noise and gave me another chance, but I botched that one too.

##This is where the vividness dies down a lot, and I am having trouble remembering stuff.

I'm not entirely sure what happened next (Tate either laughed at my failure or reconciled me), but we safely ended up back in my room except instead of laundry room, it was just my ordinary room. I remember wearing a black sweater that I oddly fancied. It had a button strip at the top, and a buttonless strip at the bottom. Now that I think about it, every person including myself was very well-dressed, but I can't recall the specifics. Also, it became clear that Tate was gay and he assumed I was gay too, because he wouldn't have put me in that position if he knew otherwise.

I think we decided to talk outside of my room and in the hallway. A guy, who resembled my friend ""Josh"", randomly came around and greeted me. I'm unsure what happened next, again, but the next thing I remember was Tate and I talking about some stuff and then sexuality. 

I admitted that I was unsure of my sexuality (which was true of my real self) and that I found the encounter with the pornstars exciting. Tate again formed a brilliant plan which he didn't explain to me and we went off to the master bedroom again. As we were heading there, Tate pulled down the the front of my pants enough to uncover my genitals which for some reason I didn't mind at all (in reality I would go crazy). From here I could infer that he wanted to see if I would get an erection while watching the two actors have sex.

This time the master bedroom was different. It was a lot lighter than before. Think of a completely white room illuminated by natural sunlight. The two guys were still having hardcore sex, but there was no camera crew or any stage equipment, just the regular master bedroom as I know it. I can explicitly remember the details of their sex, but I don't want to turn this memory into some erotica. In the end, I ended up getting turned on and said ""alright, I have a boner..."" I also remember my boner looking a lot bigger than it really is.

There wasn't any feedback or resolution to my statement, and the next thing I remember was the petite actor accidentally farted loudly, which caused the other actor to get grossed out and stop the ""scene"". I couldn't see or hear the petite actor, but I can safely assume that he was embarrassed. I started to hold my breath but I began to chuckle and laugh. The petite actor began to laugh, then Tate did, and the other actor did too.

The next thing I remember was Tate and I watching gay porn on a tablet. What the fuck.

##This is where the dream begins to fall apart and become incoherent.

Afterwards, my house turned into a dormitory/hotel/rental home from a pornographic studio, but structurally remained the same. All sorts of people that I knew from years ago began to show up. Tate and I were again in my room, but it was as if we were in a house party. I remember us being in the hallway, and looking towards the master bedroom where the actors were no longer having sex. They were fully clothed and sitting on the floor loitering. The petite guy had the face of some short guy from high school I knew and I was disgusted a bit. 

A bunch of people came into my room to talk to me including: Josh who said that I looked good now, a girl who claimed my room was her brother's room, and my brother who brought back the tablet I left at the master bedroom. When he gave it to me, I remember hearing a guy in the room say ""ah I just saw something wrong"" and presumably leave. It came to my head that he probably saw the gay porn, and I was worried Kevin might have seen it too, but he looked tired and aloof.

I lastly remember thanking Tate for being so kind and compassionate towards me, and I wanted to either become great friends or get into a relationship with him. I wanted to ask him what his name was (I only referred to him as Tate for the sake of this post), but then I woke up.

I dream vividly a lot, but they are usually completely nonsensical and fantasy-esque, but this was the only dream I had where I was truly depressed and disappointed to wake up and have it end. I woke up immediately thinking, ""I didn't even get to know his name"". ""Tate"" was beginning to feel like the one person who made me feel alive and I actually got emotional when he turned out nothing more than a figment of my imagination. The real life Tate was very similar, but I never really got involved with him before, and it seems too late for it now.

&gt; I posted this because Tate felt important to me, and I don't want to forget him so that I can possibly dream of him again. It's finally off my chest.

&gt; In retrospect, I can turn this dream into a very nice short story... so it's copyrighted guys. "

2t3ohi,3,2015-01-20,"I [24/M] Went on Date with [F/22], Unsure How to Proceed",KevinBanana,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t3ohi/i_24m_went_on_date_with_f22_unsure_how_to_proceed/,"So I matched this girl on Tinder and went out with her. Before you guys rail on me about the app being for hookups, not relationships allow me to tell my story first.

We matched a week prior and she tells me she's new to the city for her internship, follows up with saying she's not looking for hookup. I thought this odd and then decided to get her number and asked her to lunch on this past weekend. 

Among the qualities she claims to have is a love for adventure. I don't drive having recently begun my job post-grad, but I am familiar with public transit routes so I figured I could bring her to the zoo, it being a place I haven't been to as well.

Before the date, she also says she's a foodie and so I suggested this ramen place I thought was the best in the city for lunch. Bear in mind that ""best in city"" doesn't always mean ""best I've ever had"". So turns out on the date she's from Vancouver, well traveled around Asia so probably has some higher expectation of the meal. Suffice to say the broth was underwhelming to her but she never complained or frowned so it was cool. Exchanged some jokes and she seemed to enjoy herself nevertheless. Some of our banter included me having superior culinary skills than hers, and she said she couldn't wait to try out my dishes since she thinks I cook bad seeing as I brought her to a ramen place that underwhelmed for her. 

About an hour passes and we make our way to the zoo. It was alright for the most part, except some animals weren't there due to winter. I'm a noob in all things dating so I didn't know what to do early on during the walkabouts. I did remember some threads saying that most important thing during a date is to establish some sort of comfort level being close to each other, so I thought I would sort of have a hand on the small of her back throughout the walkthrough, guiding her through doors or to new locations. As the zoo was rather big, she deferred the decision making to me on where to go and I took it. I don't think I fucked up there with the holding her close part, as she didn't back away or anything, although I couldn't really think of anything else to go for. Earlier during the train ride to the zoo I tried asking for her hand so I could tell a story but she said no, so I don't know. After we done seeing animals, we went to the gift store and fooled around with some hats for a bit. I should mention that throughout the excursion she was Snapchatting a lot of pictures to people, presumably her girlfriends back home but hey, why do I care.

Anyway fast forward to finishing touring the zoo, we went back downtown and got bubble tea. Surprised to find out she shares my love for a special pungent fruit flavor. But the pearls were underwhelming as well and at this point I feared I might've disappointed her in the tastebuds department one too many times. After that I walked her back and I found out she goes to church too so probably nothing is going to happen at the end of the day. Besides she also said that she has a housemate who set the rule of ""no guests"". I'd have invited her back to my place, but I couldn't because I also have a housemate.

As we were walking back she also asked me what I thought of her, and I just fed her compliments like she's cute, well traveled, independent, etc. I asked the return and she said that she liked that I was tall (surprised her apparently) and decisive. Thinking back I probably gave a beta af response.

As I reach the doorway of her place, I sort of brushed her hair away a bit and I think I rushed the moment trying to go in for the kiss and she diverted it into a hug. Whatever I thought, I probably blew it with this nice girl and was ready to give up. We say our goodbyes and I went on my merry way, not expecting a call back or anything of that sort. But an hour after I got home she texted me jokingly saying she hope I didn't get lost on my way back. So of course I was piqued and texted awhile later, and this carried on until the next day. I was out on an excursion with a friend and continued replying to her texts sporadically. One of the jokes she made during the date was that I was a bad influence, for encouraging her to cross the road on a close yellow, or outright jaywalking. I should mention she said that joke in a sprightly manner so I thought she was probably enjoying that ""thrill"". So my last response to her was something along the lines of her ""enjoying doing the illegal with me, and look forward to more"". I never heard back after that and it's been 1.5 days since. 

I don't know what to read into this and I think I might just let go. My friend however tells me this is a textbook game girls play to ""gauge my interest and also to not appear overeager"". I thought that that's a silly game to play, if it was even true at all, and it benefits no one. I don't want to be the one double texting either. The thing is I have a better restaurant I wanted to bring her to for round 2, but I couldn't do it for round 1 because it's rather far and decor reasons. Either that or round 2 can be a cooking battle. She has also expressed desire at residing in the city for a longer term than her current internship if she likes the city. And possibly even more here after she graduates in a few months if she gets a job here. 

Extra info: don't know if this is relevant but she also asked me about past Tinder dates that I had. I just named a few that I didn't enjoy. She happened to ask whether the women were Asian or White (we're both Asian) and I casually said Asian, because Asian guys don't have it that easy with white girls. Don't think that mattered but maybe worth mentioning that she cares about race maybe?

Met in Berlin 2 years ago and have met up in Budapest, Vienna, and Krakow during this time. She also came to the States in the same city I'm living for a 3 month internship. We just got married in Vienna this past weekend and are now ready to start the green card application. 

My questions are: Is hiring a lawyer really necessary for this process or is figuring it out on your on all that hard? Anything to look out for? 

Also, obviously we've been unable to share a lease, bank account, or anything of a similar vein during this time for obvious reasons but the initial I-30 form requests these things. Will not having these things count against us or cause the process to take longer? It also says something about some sort of affidavit. 

What would the overall cost be after the process is completed? I'm sure for us we'll have to translate the German documents. 

Lastly, If any, what's the average wait time for most people? I've heard 6 months but also heard quite a few horror stories. 

My wife is currently living in London and I'm in NYC. Neither of us wanted to go the fiance visa route where she would have been able to already be living here but unable to work until her green card came through.

Thanks so much for any advice or tips!"

However, I am an Alberta resident. My grades are good but I don't have much relevant experience. Right now, I am looking for some internship for the summer. I am not very picky, I'll accept either 4, 8, 12, 16 month work term.
I am very interested in finding a position in Calgary because after studying in Toronto for several years, I feel I am pretty home sick now and would want to go back for some time.
I applied to a few positions at some big oil companies and the service companies. Of course, I should apply to as many position as possible, but my problem is I am not very familiar with the companies in Calgary. So, I am looking for some names. Also, I am not limited to just oil and gas companies, as long as it is a mechanical internship, I am satisfied.
If I don't find anything in Calgary, I'll just see if I can do something in Ontario. Too bad I'll have to deal with my home-sickness.
So, please give me some advice? How can I find a decent list of companies to apply to? Other advice that you think are helpful to me are welcomed too.

In addition, my university's internal job post are mainly in Ontario, so not very helpful to me.

2t4bbs,2,2015-01-20,"my ex-girlfriend [24F] broke up with me [31M] last week and I find out she's back with her ""ex-boyfriend"" 4 days later...a short memoir",fubawubajon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t4bbs/my_exgirlfriend_24f_broke_up_with_me_31m_last/,"My now ex-girlfrend and I recently went on a break starting on NYE (lucky me!).  She cited differences in points in our lives, such as my possibly leaving the area we both live in, and my wanting to have some kids in the future, whereas she does not.  During the break I addressed these worries and told her that I didn't expect anything from her and that if I decided to leave (which I hadn't planned) after I graduate school that we should address it then, but there was no reason to necessarily break up just because of something that might happen, especially if we were in love. Also, the kids thing didn't bother me, because she was young and I wasn't exactly trying to dive into that anytime soon.

Some backstory: We met while I was teaching a class of hers two years back. I was a TA, she was a student. It was taboo but not unheard of for things like this to happen. During the quarter I taught her class, she had broken off a relationship she was having with a co-worker at her summer internship.  He was in a relationship at the time, but had decided to cheat on his girlfriend with my ex because she had not ever ""been with someone"" in the biblical-sense. So he was her first, and they continued this side-relationship for about 6 months.  She lied to her friends and family about seeing him, because most, if not all of them, don't like him. This is because of the nature of the relationship, which most could agree was not healthy. Eventually, he brought up a three-some with her and his current girlfriend, which she declined. 

The majority of the relationship could be summed up as her driving to where he was, having sex for an evening, and then her leaving. No dates, no public appearances, nothing. She eventually asked him is he loved her or could love her, to which he replied ""No."" She ended up breaking things off with this guy during this class, and made it clear to me she was interested. After the class was done, we started a romantic relationship that continued until this past week.

Our relationship was not complicated.  I'll never say I was the best boyfriend, but I did try to make sure she was happy. It was somewhat long distance, but this was good for me due to my graduate school work. She seemed not to mind all that much, the usual sadness after leaving on the weekends. She came home with me twice to meet my parents and friends, the most recently during the past winter holiday before she broke things off. It is possible that all of these things could have scared her off, but she never let on to it. We talked about a future together, she as much as I. I had thought about marrying her more recently. I'll never say that I was obsessed with her, but loving her was easy, and she rarely made our relationship difficult.  To me, honesty was a huge thing, and I worked with her to share her feeling, which she did, but sometimes I had to force the issues. Finally, she was sweet, kind, and worried about me, which I admired. 

Before the break-up, while we were at my parents house for holiday, she started acting weird. She would be on her phone all the time. I'd ask her who she was talking to, she would say she was on Reddit (go figure). I'm pretty sure this is when she started re-connecting with her ex, who had just got a new promotion at the place she works (she had brought it up).  

The day before she said she wanted to take a break, I had left her house to go to mine, and she was spending the day cleaning her house and going shopping. This is when she starting to ask really weird on the phone texting me. Usually she was pretty attentive through the phone, but she would take long periods of time to reply, which is funny for someone that is just at home and shopping. Now I'm of the belief that she was with him that day before coming down to my place. She companied of a head-ache (probably to get out of sex). I went down on her instead to ""help"" her head-ache.  To this day, while I have no concrete proof, I swear something was off, and now I'm pretty sure I was tasting the remains of a lover she had earlier that day. Gross....I know.


Regardless of all of this, she broke it off last Wednesday after a two week break and almost two years of a relationship. I asked her if she wanted to be with someone else as a reason to break-up (I had kept in mind her past relationship as a contributing factor to the break-up). She became offended and told be ""that she was focused on our relationship and what she wanted and that I was making her feel like a horrible person for asking."" I was and continuedto be sad about the situation until yesterday.

I had deactivated my Facebook to help with the coping process (I hate social media nowadays), but reactivated it last night. I saw that she had re-friended her ex, so I clicked on his Facebook page.  To my surprise, he is in a relationship with her, 4 days after she had broken up with me, (who is now single). Let me repeat that: She is now with the dismissive, cheating asshole that used her for sex and told her he didn't love her.  This life really throws you curveballs sometimes.  

Now I'm more angry than anything. I've blocked her from all social media, deleted her phone number, and decided to send all of the things I have of hers to her parents house by mail. Everyone that I tell about this situation is dumbfounded, simply stupefied by this. There was no warning, no lead up, nothing  No one deserves this kind of blatant disregard, but you know what, it's her life to live, her mistakes to make, and ultimately my time to gain. 

I wrote this because it makes it easier to deal with in the long run.  Talking about what happens with people who care is the best therapy one can ask for, but remember not to put too much thought into it, because in the end, what is the point of putting so much energy into someone who doesn't love you anymore?  The more time you waste on that, the less time you get for your own life, and you only have one.

Let me know if you have any thoughts on this story, or your own similar situations. Sorry the story is so long. Obviously I haven't put ALL the facts, but focused on the most important ones, at least to me. There are always two sides to a story, but I felt like I was trying to be fair as to the truth of the situation. Thanks...

I graduated with my Bachelors in Accounting last April, it took me 6 years (I studied Poli Sci for 2 years, I had the crazy idea of going to law school).  Poli Sci REALLY lowered my overall GPA to the point where I didn't even hear back about possible internships, my Accounting GPA was a 3.0 but that didn't seem to stick to any recruiters.  So I graduated without an internship and this past November I got a job through a temp agency working at a large medical device company. I was really excited because the company is constantly ranked as one of the best companies to work for in the US and the job title placed me in the ""corporate accounting"" department.  Well the first 2 months there I was just basically doing busy work, sorting out invoices and delivering them the collectors and other little odd things.  I soon learned that no one in my department has a degree and its basically a job that anyone with a high school diploma and slight common sense can do.  At the beginning of this month they asked me to become a collector for a territory and I said yes due to A) it would at least keep me busy all day rather than the first 3 hours I'm there and B) it would give me a chance to show my work ethic in hopes I can work my way into their finance department where the actual accounting is done and it actually requires a degree.

So this is where I seek advice...

I graduated with 138 credit hours and even though throughout college I thought that working for a firm is something that I would not want to do I really feel that I would like to go to CPA route.  My state requires the 150 hours and a year of work experience under a CPA.

There's a community college in my city that I could go to to get the remaining 12 credit hours, but what possible ways is there for me get the year of experience?  I've considered just continuing busting my ass as a collector and hope I get hired into the company so I can work my way into an actual accounting role, I told my supervisor about my ambitions with the company and she said that she would put some feelers out for me.

Some background on me: I'm 25, in a decent sized, growing city in Michigan.

Once again, I apologize for the length but I could really use some advice.  Thanks in advance."
2t4hb2,4,2015-01-20,"Plan A failed, I have no plan B.",meltdownprofile,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2t4hb2/plan_a_failed_i_have_no_plan_b/,"Hi Reddit, it's 1 a.m, I really need someone to talk to. There's no particular problem here, and there won't be a consistent story, I imagine, and it's nothing serious anyway. I just need to let it out.

I'm a 23 year old Russian girl. I grew up in a Russian family, which can roughly be described as middle-class. When my internship in London was unpaid and I still lived off what remained of my parents' money that they gave me to support myself during my MA degree in Britain, I'd describe it as “I am Russian middle class. I live in London, but eat once a day”. My family is very westernised, Mom has always wanted to immigrate, and passed this desire on to me. I think since I was 10 it was decided between my parent and myself that I'm leaving Russia for a better country once I grow up. They wished me best, and yes, it's not the best country to live in, the pressure to bribe and the fear of authorities that you have to constantly experience since you hit you mid-teens are hardly enjoyable. 

I went to university when I was 16, and didn't really choose my degree. I was good at languages, so we've decided I should learn a rare one to make me more employable. I learnt Chinese, it was an Eastern Studies programme, and then I went to study to Britain, a MA degree which I didn't really choose as well – but it's one of the few that went good with my undergraduate programme, Asian IR. Well, I graduated a few months ago, with good results, it was a good university too, but failed to find a job. I did an internship in media which I quite enjoyed, but for a company that couldn't sponsor me a visa. It's very hard to get a working visa anywhere now, and I'm not the only one, of course, so after some failed applications, I'll have to return home in 10 days.

I spent all my life studying, and succeeded pretty much in everything, especially in humanities, but I don't think I've ever liked it and it was only, as I said, a way to make me employable. Shame that it didn't work out. There are jobs here that require people with my qualifications, and, come on, I could find an boring office job with my good degrees and 4 languages, but I don't have a work permit. And since I have no permit, I can't find a job, catch 22. I'll have to go back.

Unfortunately, I really love London. For the first time in years I found friends, and they all live here. More than that, a month and a half ago I met a boy, and we fell in love. I don't fall in love that easily, and I've never believed in love from the first sight, but, well, I guess I do now. Doesn't matter, because even if we get married now, I still won't be able to stay. He's a student living on a loan and what his music pays him. I don't know if I'm ever going to see him. Planning your life is hard when you don't have the money.

I just really don't know what to do anymore. I feel like the master plan for my life failed. I still can try and implement it, but I feel hopeless when I'm starting to calculate the odds. Everyone says that we should live the dream, but I don't really have a dream. I just have some education that I don't know what to do with, and some people I love two boarders away. I feel like the only two things I'm truly interested in this world are birds and music, haha. You know what's killing me? I am talentless. Some of my friends are musicians, and they can be broke, and they can be unhappy, but there's something they should do – because, I imagine, if you can make something beautiful, then you certainly should.  And I can't make anything beautiful. I've never had time to discover any sort of talent, and even an interest in doing something. And now I can't even say “to hell with this, I'm going to paint, no more compromises”. And it's not like you can not-compromise in developing countries. There's no benefits system or student loans enough to feed you. Either you work or you live in real, scary poverty. That's what has always made me and my parents sure that we are doing the right thing. 

There are places which are way worse than Russia, and there are people in way worse circumstances. I try to keep this in mind, and I don't even think I have any serious problems here. It's very sad that I'm leaving the place I consider to be my home now, and the boy I love, and my friends, of course. But people get it worse. And yes, I'm somewhat disillusioned about my life. I feel like not that many things have ever depended on me. I tried my best, but it just didn't work out. I probably made some mistakes, but it was impossible to know back then.

I'm so damn sad and tired now, and I can't even talk to anyone. I will only make my parents and my friends more sad, and my boyfriend is already borderline depressed, and this will definitely not help. It's pretty cool if someone managed to get to the end, I'm pretty sure it doesn't make any sense, because I started crying half way though. I'll reread it tomorrow morning and probably laugh.  "

2t4qxn,2,2015-01-20,[Help] Anxiety is starting to interfere with everyday life. Maybe PTSD?,cmken,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2t4qxn/help_anxiety_is_starting_to_interfere_with/,"I'm not sure where to start so I'll just start. I'm 24F, married, no kids, work full-time as a Realtor's assistant. This is probably going to get very long. I’ll make a TL;DR at the end to recap the story. 

Over the last few months, I've been experiencing anxiety and anxiety attacks. And over the last month or so, it's been really interfering with my everyday life. The biggest issue I have is that it keeps me awake at night, so I barely sleep, which makes the anxiety worse and also drastically effects the rest of my life. All it takes is a few nights of lack of sleep to really mess me up. I've been getting sick at least once a month with a cold/flu, which means missing work, which means less money, which means financial issues, which increases anxiety, which keeps me up at night... it's just a bunch of endless cycles!!!

I've always been a ""worrywart,"" even from a young age. Always cautious, always cared too much what people thought. I was bullied quite heavily in grade school as a kid, which I think explains why I worry so much about what people think. I had a good home life growing up. When I was 15, my parents uprooted us and moved us 1300 kms away to a new city. It was quite difficult for me, and I had a hard time adjusting. 

A few years after that, my dad had an affair and when my mom found out, our whole life was torn apart. For months, maybe even years (it's hard to remember, it's all kind of a blur), my dad moved in and out of the house, my parents went through good patches and bad patches. There was lots of fighting. My dad picked up drinking again (he hadn’t struggled with it since they found out they were pregnant with me). My sister started to act up; I just became reclusive. I got caught in the middle between my parents often because I was the only ""level-headed"" one around, according to them. They were in an out of counseling, and they finally put me in counseling because I was depressed and anxious and wouldn't get a job (I was 19-20 when this all happened). The counseling helped, but my parents couldn't afford it for long. 

Things got better after that. There were still rough times with my home life - to this day, my dad still struggles with drinking - but things were better. I got my first “big girl” job, which I loved and was perfect for me, but lost it after 9 months due to a family crisis and requesting too much time off work. Got a receptionist job a few months after that, and worked there for 10 months, but left that job to get married and move 2 hours north for my husband to do welding school. 

Prior to that, we were both basically “kicked out” of our church. I had been attending there for 7 years, and was very heavily involved, and my husband had been attending for about 1.5 years. I was very involved in the youth ministry (head of the music department, and was a youth leader) and he joined the church to intern under our youth pastor after moving there to go to a local Bible college. We worked together for 6 months before we started dating, and then dated for 6 months and got engaged. We had been sleeping together, and before long I was cornered/pressured by the youth pastor’s wife and I confessed that we were having sex. They then convinced me to break up with my husband (he was my fiance at the time) and I was foolish and listened to them. It didn’t last long - we were back together after 2 months, and that’s when they told us that they “washed their hands of us” and pretty much everyone stopped talking to us. It was clear after that that we weren’t welcome there anymore. I lost everything - that church was my life, it was where all my friends were, I had served for years in that church, and then just like that it was all gone. I took it really hard, and here we are 2 years later and I’m still struggling with it and still struggling with the “church hurt” and with making new friends. 

Now, onto the big thing that I think is the source of most of my anxiety:

In June 2014, my mother-in-law passed away from ovarian cancer. She had been battling it for 4 years. Things had taken a turn for the worst in January 2014, when she was hospitalized and had to have an emergency colostomy because the tumors had grown and were blocking her lower intestines and bowels. The surgery was successful, but she ran into complications after with the incision site and the site of the stoma for the colostomy. She had an infection and there were a few weeks where we had to fully gown up before we could go in to visit her. She was released after a few weeks, and moved up north 4 hours to be near to her family. At Easter, we went up to visit her. I will never forget the sight of her when we walked in the door - she looked like a completely different person, she had become so thin and she looked so sick and almost ghoulish looking. It was so startling. 

That weekend she was hospitalized again, and after some tests, the doctors gave her 2 weeks to live. She requested that we stay, so we made an overnight trip back home to pack up as much stuff as we could and headed back. We stayed with family while we were there, which was difficult and stressful, on top of the stress of her being in the hospital. We spent all day, every day at the hospital, a lot of which we just spent sitting in silence while she slept. 

A few weeks later, my mother-in-law’s mom passed away. She had been sick for a long time. The family took it hard. After that, my mother-in-law was transferred to home care, where we became her primary caretakers. We were in charge of administering her meds, changing her colostomy bags, and getting her food and drinks and puke buckets as she was confined to a hospital bed. My husband and I - being the youngest - had the night shift. It was so difficult. We had to get up every 3 hours to give her meds, and sometimes even in between. Every day she got more and more sick. She threw up everything she ate. She got weaker and weaker. 

I was so anxious about doing night shift. I was so scared that she would die while we were sleeping, and that the family would hold it against us. I was barely able to sleep, because every noise she made me wake up. I was constantly checking to see if she was still breathing. It was hard on us - really hard. There were a few times that the family gave us a break and let us get a good nights’ sleep. I know that it was what she wanted, and that she didn’t want to die in a hospital, but what a difficult thing to ask of your kids. There was lots of family drama on top of that, and since we were both not working, we fell into financial crisis. It was a very difficult time. 

She passed away in June, and our lives were turned upside down again. What now? How do you transition from caring for a dying loved one back to normal life? We did the best we could, to grieve and to pick up the pieces and put our lives back together. 

We moved back down to where we lived before, and I got a new job right away. My husband struggled to find welding work, and that put more of a strain on our finances. My husband then got injured, and was unable to weld anymore, and was back to looking for a different job, which perpetuated our financial problems again. We weren’t able to make ends meet, and most months it was a struggle just to have enough to pay our rent. This is where the anxiety started to rear its ugly head. I was constantly worried about our finances, and our marriage felt like it was falling apart because I was so stressed out and my husband was grieving the loss of his mom, and we were dealing with some hefty drama with his sister and even some drama on my side of the family. 

My husband finally got a new job in December, but was injured on the job on the 26th, and is now off work again and on WCB while we wait for him to get surgery. He’s still getting paid, so at least we don’t have that to worry about, but we’re still trying to play catch up from months of being so broke. I still fret about our finances. Our marriage is doing better, but now he is dealing with intense pain on a daily basis, and it makes him not himself, and I’m dealing with all of these anxiety issues which make me not myself, so we clash a lot these days. He doesn’t quite understand my anxiety, and hell, even I don’t quite understand my anxiety either. 

I’m guessing it’s an accumulation of everything I’ve been through over the years, mostly taking care of my husband’s dying mom. I don’t think I realized how much it affected me. Maybe part of this is PTSD? I don’t know. All I know is I worry about everything. I fear the worst all the time. I avoid driving - especially in the city - at all costs because it makes me so anxious and I fear that I’m going to get into a car accident. I worry about my husband when he’s out, that he’s going to get in a car accident. I worry that someone is going to break into our apartment, so I’m always checking to make sure the door is locked. I obsess about locking my car because I worry someone will steal it (not that anyone would, it’s a 2002 Oldsmobile and it’s kinda junky). I worry that I’m going to lose my job (even though I’m fantastic at it and my boss loves me). It’s all irrational, it’s all silly, it’s all things that will probably never ever happen but I’m constantly worried about them. I have no social life because I hate having people over because that means the place has to be spotless because I obsess about what people might think of me. I hate going out because social situations make me uncomfortable and anxious. 

It’s just all coming out and hitting me now. I got the name of a behavioural health consultant from my doctor, and they’re going to set me up with some counseling/therapy services. I don’t want to go on medication, but I’m afraid that that will be what they tell me I need, even though I don’t want it. I don’t know if speaking to a therapist will help. 

The anxiety keeps me up at night, and I’ve been missing a lot of work lately because I’m so tired and/or I’m sick. Thankfully my boss is pretty understanding, and since I work in real estate, it’s pretty slow these days anyway. I feel like it’s slowly taking over my life, and I don’t want it. I feel like I’m losing control over the anxiety. I’m just a mess these days and I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR: After some traumatic events over the years, in particular: caring for my mother-in-law as she was dying of cancer last year and the grief and the financial and marital struggles that resulted from that, anxiety has begun to rear its ugly head and I feel it’s slowly taking over my life. It keeps me up at night, I get sick a lot, and I’ve begun to miss work as a result. 

EDIT: I got an appointment with a behavioural health consultant for the first week of February. I also got some melatonin yesterday to help me sleep. I still didn't sleep super great last night, but it may take some time before I start seeing results. "

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't really know where to begin. Today is my birthday. I watched the clock tick down to 12 AM and I just knew this day would come this week and I was terrified. Terrified that it'd be the big 21, another 21 years of living this fucked up life that's been nothing but failure and loneliness. People my age should have so much fun on their 21st birthday but I'm going to do absolutely nothing. Maybe I'll buy some hard liquor at the end of the week and get so fucked up that this pain goes away for a brief moment.

I've been going to college for two and a half years now. I'm a second semester Junior. I have no career ambitions and no plans after I graduate. My GPA is a mediocre 3.07. As a business major that may not be so bad but I've also never had an internship, never participated in any school activities (at least in college), and never been employed in my life. I haven't made any fucking friends in college. None. Zero. And I really mean it: I know absolutely nobody in this huge, gigantic university I've been enrolled in for two and a half years. People walk by me everyday, I sit next to people everyday. But not once have I heard someone just talk to me, or ask how I'm doing: nobody gives a fucking fuck. 

I used to be fat in high school. I weighed 215 lbs. In college I made it this sort of mission that I'd lose weight, and after my Freshman year I dropped to 145. That's like 70 lbs gone, but I still feel like a fat fuck. I feel ugly and stupid. I've never had a girlfriend or heard of anyone being interested in me and, surprise surprise, that didn't change when I lost weight; I think I'm just perpetually doomed to look like a hideous, awkwardly-proportioned freak. To top it all off, I sweat when I get nervous (i.e. everytime I engage in mild conversation with someone I'm not familiar with), and it's mostly from my face and neck. Fuck my shitty Indian genetics. 

I've had people I used to consider friends who really don't give a shit about me. There were these people in high school I'd hang out with who were always smarter and more motivated than I was. I thought we were pretty tight, but once I got to college I realized they just didn't give a fuck. Once I stop talking to them they just forget about me. I get texts like ""hey what's up"" and don't respond just to see if they'll press the issue and demonstrate they really do care about me, but they don't. Whether I'm staring them in the face or hanging from a noose it's all the same to them. 

I guess I should mention my background. Like I said earlier, I'm Indian. First generation, born in the U.S., my parents have been living in this country for a while now and are very well off. They are basically giving me a free ride through college and paying every expense I could possibly accrue. 

I had a brother: the key word is ""had."" He died six years ago of a brain aneurysm. He was seven years older than me and better than me in basically every way: smart, gifted, oldest grandson on my mother and father's side, admitted into a great gradschool and basically set for life. But literally the day he graduates, he gets a fucking aneurysm and dies in his car. I really did like him and I think he was the only person I'd ever call a true friend. I thought I'd gotten over the loss but I see him almost every night in my dreams. It pisses me off knowing that my parents push shit on me and expect me to live up to him, or bring up other siblings in grief and how they cope with their loss as if that's the standard I should be held to. It just pisses me off that I'm alive and he's dead, because I always thought even when he was alive that my family would be better off with me dead. But hey, now that he's dead, I can't really kill myself, can I? My mom even told me that I can't kill myself because it'd be selfish and ruin her and my father. Well shit. When I've casually mentioned killing myself to my parents they've never really stopped and talked to me seriously about it, it's always been ""if you do that you'll destroy us,"" so I guess it's cool for them that I'm ""scared into staying alive"" and my self-hatred isn't taken seriously. 

I have been seeing a therapist provided to me from the school. She's actually been very helpful and I think she's the only person in my life who really understands me. I wanted to get a psych eval done so I could be properly diagnosed and get maybe have some medicine prescribed, but my parents straight up told me my big problem is ""video game addiction."" That the ""video games make me depressed,"" that I'm actually so good-looking and smart and funny and nice and if I just tried I'd be able to do anything I wanted. Well fuck them, I don't want to try, I really just want to die but I can't because I'm a fucking pussy that can't bring myself to commit suicide. I've just completely given up hope on trying to talk to my stupid parents about how I feel because I do feel guilty that they offer me everything I ever wanted in life and I squander it, and because they just don't understand me. They don't believe people can just be depressed for no real reason, and they want to blame my tangible problems on a tangible cause, like video games. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you read through all of this I'm sorry to put you through all that. Anyway, today really is my birthday. I thought about hiding my birthday information on Facebook so people wouldn't give me those fake ""Happy birthday!"" messages, but then I realized that nobody would wish me otherwise, and I prefer the fake shit to nothing. Anyway, I'm 21, but that's 21 years of life I never deserved. I know this post reeks of self-pity and desperate cries for attention but I felt like I've been lurking here long enough. Sorry to waste your time"

2t5lnc,7,2015-01-21,Me [23 M] and my kind-of-girlfriend [22 F] ended things because she's leaving but we both have strong feelings for each other yet and I don't know what proper etiquette is from here.,AngryBlackMan33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t5lnc/me_23_m_and_my_kindofgirlfriend_22_f_ended_things/,"Hey everyone, I've been here before in the past for far more serious issues and you all have been great and I was hoping to try and gather some insight into my most recent event.  

Here's the rundown:  I met a girl several months ago and we started hanging out.  She mentioned to me that she had applied for an internship in a different state many miles away.  This internship is 10 weeks but she may chain it directly into another internship in D.C right after it which is still a couple thousand miles from I will be.  (I'm a grad student).  I thought to myself, maybe rather foolishly, that I could keep this thought in mind and keep any potential feelings in check and just enjoy her presence.

Well, I really enjoyed her presence and I'm sure the feeling was mutual.  We began talking quite a bit and I started to really look forward to hearing from her and seeing her, normal blossoming relationship stuff.  Fast forward to this past weekend.  She was having a hard time getting to sleep on Saturday night so I drove over to her place and we went for a walk.  She lives near the university so we walked through there and actually climbed a fire escape and jumped onto the roof of one of the taller buildings on campus.  We had a great time and it was a really good bonding experience.  Something about seeing so much and being all alone with another person like that is a unique experience.  After I drop her back off at her place I get home and we talk on Facebook for the next couple of hours until the wee hours of the morning.  

So the next day, Sunday, I meet up later in the evening with her and some of her friends to watch the football game.  We're having a really great time. She gets a little drunk and so do I and she gets a little handsy, but not in a dirty way or anything. We are having a really great time until later in the night when she looks at her phone and just gets really quiet.  I try to pry an answer from her and she just says she thinks she needs to leave so of course I leave with her and walk with her back to her place.  Along the way she tells me that  she had just received an email telling her she was accepted to the internship across the country and has to leave in 6 to 10 days.  I'm just like, ""Fuck"", at this point.  She's cries and I do my best to comfort her and it was another really close bonding experience.  She's sad about leaving her family and this place which she has grown to love over the last 5 years.  I drop her off at her place and console her until she stops crying.  We kiss and I go home.  

Alright, well, Monday rolls along and I text her asking if we can talk because things last night obviously became more than just friendly and it startled me a little bit.  We get to talking and she asks me what I wanted to talk about and I just told her ""us"".  She tells me she is leaving and doesn't do long distance relationships and this is the end of us.  I completely agree.  I really do.  The thing that is making this so weird for me is that during the conversation she tells me that she ended up liking me a lot more than she thought and this is a lot harder for her than she thought it would be.  My feelings are the same.  I walk her back to her place and it was so awkward/hard.  I just wished her all the best luck in the world and I hope she keeps in contact when she comes back in this area.  She told me it was really great getting to know me and she wished this would have happened at  different time and just said ""bye"" and walked away.  That was it.  I was crushed.  Way more than I expected.  It was/is difficult largely because we spent the last few days really bonding and getting close and then over night things just end.  It went 100 to 0 real quick.  

It may be important to note that I don't think we would work out long term for philosophical reasons but I can't say that for sure.  

She isn't leaving from here for at least another week.  I don't really know how to handle the situation from here.  Do I keep in contact with her?  Should I not talk to her until she leaves?  Do I offer to help her move out?  There is so much more I want to say but I won't because I don't think it's a good idea but I'm so unsure of what to do.  I really want to continue at least being friends with this girl regardless of the distance because I really think she's great.  But I need to do what's best for me and her to get over this portion of things.  I just feel so weird right now because things ended in such a weird way.  We both really like each other a lot but circumstance is preventing us from actually being together (kind of disgustingly romantic, eh?)  I don't know what to do or how to treat 'us'.  I would greatly value and input you people have to offer me.  It's always extremely appreciated.  

---   
**tl;dr**: I knew a girl was going to have to leave in the near future.  We get closer than either of us intended.  She ends up having to leave way sooner than expected and awkwardly ends things.  We both have strong feelings for each other and I don't know how to treat the situation now.  "

Here are the parts that I've noticed so far (this does not include times where she was selfish with someone else or as a group): 


* Forcing Marshall to have an outdoor wedding.

* When she calls off the marriage to take an art fellowship in San Francisco.

* When she comes back from San Francisco and gets mad when Marshall rejects her.

* Sabotaging Marshall's date with the girl from the coffee place because Lily was jealous.

* Forcing Marshall to take a corporate job because of her shopping addiction.

* Wanting Marshall to quit his corporate job and become an environmental lawyer, then getting mad when he told Lily about the contract. 

* Breaking up Ted's past relationships just because she didn't like them, and because she was concerned about her future if Ted had married any of them

* Fed up with being supportive when Marshall finally got hired by an environmental firm, and tries to move to Spain. Granted, it was an internship, but that was still selfish.

* Got mad when the Captain told her she doesn't know anything about art because she's just a kindergarten teacher, despite saying she wanted to be a kindergarten teacher (back in S2 Ep.6).

* Before Barney's and Robin's wedding, when Marshall had arrived and Lily was mad about him taking the Judge job (which was his dream), without consulting with her. Then during the argument, she never let Marshall finish because, she just wanted to be an Art Consultant in Rome. 


Despite being full of herself, she's still one of my favorite characters. (:

”Hi. You don’t look like I’ve expected, I thought you would sport a beard by now.”

”Yeah, me too, genetics weren’t on my side with that one.”

”Well, you’d look a lot better having one. Speaking of looking better, fuck you look tired, like you’ve been sleeping in a crate of gravel for the last month. I’ve seen you around, and you look like a fucking debbie downer”

”I know, I don’t sleep a lot right now, with this depression like thing going o-”

”Depression? Dude, that’s just a fucked up thing to say. We have friends with actual diagnosed depression, ADD, bipolar disorder and the whole lot. You have no illness, stop it.”

”Right, sorry about that. It’s just that I’m still processing my ex and stuff.”

”Oh come on, I’ve told to stop thinking about her, at all. But well, if you’re so damn inclined to, what about her?”

”Same old, just the verbal and psychological abuse, the whole torture until compliance-thing about her cult like political party.”

”Oh come on man, you know she did it for the greater good, you’re just an uneducated shit having the nerve to question and discuss. You should’ve just submitted, shut up and joined the party without questions, regardless of the tornment. You deserve it one way or another. About that, why do you always seem so fucking down? You’re a white dude in one of the most well off countries in the world, you know your whiteboi tears are fucking laughable, what do you have to cry about anyway?”

”That’s the exact thing, the expectation that I’m supposed to be fine regardless of abuse, failures and rough times, and the minute I start to feel heavy and tell someone, I’m a piece of shit.”

”With that attitude you fully deserve it. Let’s talk about something else then. How’s your job?”

”Well, I intern at an agency right now, and-”

”Hold on, intern? Like, working for free? For fuck sake man you have debt. You have bills to pay and you’re a previously successful entrepreneur, with a degree. What in every single fuck are you doing?”

”The job market is absolutely crammed, you know that just as well as I do, and I don’t have the financial stability to start my own business again.”

”But how do you pay your bills then, and for that matter, your rent?”

”I’m on a welfare program, and I don’t pay rent anymore because I moved back to my parents place.”

”Jesus christ are you seriously telling me that you’re living off the state, besides being fully capable of doing all these great things, and live with your parents at 23 years of fucking age? Who the fuck are you?”

”Like I said, the job market is full to the brim, especially here where my parents live.”

”Don’t tell me you try to find a job over there..”

”I’ve been applying everywhere across the country, even here, but I’ve only gotten to a first interview.”

”So why aren’t you hired then?”

”Too junior, too little real-world experience, you know how it goes. You’ve seen the mails I’ve gotten, and know how harsh the recruiters can be.”

”It only shows a piss poor effort on your part. You know your previous work is good. I don’t understand how you can’t sell it to employers. You’re unbelievably bad at that. But seriously dude, living at home again? Doesn’t your parents live in an apartment now as all your siblings have moved out?”

”We do. I couldn't stay in my old city due to the lack of jobs, and to not being physically assaulted by my ex.”

”You’re the oldest, and you’re the only one to go under, that’s plain weak. How are they handling your mopey shit in that crammed space?”

”I don’t talk to them much about it, as I always feel like I have no reason to be sad. I don’t want to bother them about it, because when I have they imply my sadness isn’t justified.”

”And they’re goddamn right to think so. Honest to god I see no hope in you anymore, ever considered just ending it? Like, chuck off a building or something?”

”I have, but i-”

”Let me guess, your death would cause too much of a scene? I can’t believe you, everything revolves around you doesn’t it? Anyone with any sense of the world around wouldn’t think about their own petty problems like this. This conversation is a perfect example, we’ve only talked about you, without a single topic about me. A selfish fuck is what you are.”

”You are the one to bring all this shit up, first of all. Second, why would we talk about you? **You ARE me. You’re MY own train of thought.** Every single fucking day you keep having this conversation with me, rambling about how I’m not enough, how I should feel like shit about not finding a job, how I’m too well off to actually reflect about my issues, how I’m too privilegied to have any problems, how I should stop thinking for myself and follow my own analysis and reason because it doesn’t fit in a box of isms, how I’m a burden to my parents and the welfare system, how I’ll never find someone, how I should just end my life, and even so petty things as a lack of a fucking beard. And you have the FUCKING NERVE to call me self-centered, you fucking bully.”

”Look at you. You’re writing down a conversation with yourself on a fucking throwaway account because you fear getting tracked down and harassed again. You’re fucking pathetic to an extent I never thought possible.”

”I know. I’m sorry.”

”Damn right you’re sorry. You’re sorry all the time, and you should be, you waste of flesh.”

2t65sn,3,2015-01-21,I [22 F] broke up with my ex[22 M] of 2.5 years a few months ago. Did I do the right thing?,gonegonegone0123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t65sn/i_22_f_broke_up_with_my_ex22_m_of_25_years_a_few/,"So this is going to be a long post and I am sorry but I need help. 



My ex boyfriend and I met freshman year of college and started dating not long after that, even though he said that he didn't want a college relationship because they didn't make sense. I changed his mind of that. 



For the next ~2 years we were always together and did everything together, our relationship was amazing. Then, he got an internship 6 hours away, and we would be apart for the next 7 months.



I have never been good with distance, but I loved him and figured that it wouldn't be a problem. I quickly learned that it was. My BF and I began to argue and he would say things that, looking back he didn't mean, he was just stressed from the internship and the distance as was I, but they hurt. My confidence and emotional stability quickly began to fall.



My roomate [21 M] was there for me and picked up those pieces every time that I would fall. Over the course of the next few months I was still away from my BF losing hope in our relationship, and at the same time falling for my roommate.



I then also got a co-op and was away from both my roommate and my BF. They both would come to visit me and I noticed that I was happier when my roommate was around then when my BF was. So, I decided to break things off with my BF. 



Now, I am kind of dating my roommate, but we are all back at school. I went to visit my ex to try and talk to him (we have the same group of friends and can't really not see each other)



He broke down in front of me and cried (I have never in the 2.5 years of dating seen him cry over anything), and showed me just how much he really did love me, and still does. 



Now I am with my roommate and am happy, but I don't know if I made the right choice. Do I want to be with my roommate? Do I just miss my ex because this place holds so many memories?

i dont know where else to go.

in the last 3 weeks my life has imploded: health, work, and relationships.

I found out my wife is cheating on me and has been lying. i forgave her and was willing to work on it because she means so much to me. since then i caught her in lies twice in non-trivial situations.I love her so much but trust and honesty were the cornerstones of our relationship. regardless of what either of us did, we could later admit it and talk about it. but i dont think that is possible anymore.

Im a programmer and I accepted an unbelievably shitty yearly income because my boss offered me 50% of any revenue generated from internal projects that i created. Im the head of development and that sounds like a great trade-off, but since then he fired every person in my division, meaning i am responsible for everything unrelated to development like customer service, web maintenance, book handling, etc...all for shit pay. im earning on the low-end of what interns would be making in my field. im literally earning less than mcdonalds workers.

I've, also in the last 2 weeks, been suffering from this: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury[1]
meaning i cant do much to change my life. im submitting this with my non-dominant hand. the one upside is that im off work for 1 week because of this

im an ocean away from the US. i dont have facebook so i dont have contact with many people. i have severe social anxiety. i dont speak the language of this country well. i didn't study CS(studied math and physics instead). I accidentally fell into this field, and i only have 2 years active experience, so it's difficult to find another job. because of the contract i accepted, i dont have much money saved after the move(i've only been here a short time). i just bought a $2000 computer. If I move i have to either take that with me or buy a new one.

i fucked up and dont know what to do. i am incredibly sad. my dad died at this time last year. please suggest something. im sorry for being so pathetic.

if this isnt the appropriate sub, just let me know"

A little background. I have a college degree but I am not working in my field. My ultimate goal is to own my own business, so I got a job working in this type of business. In the field I have a degree in, I have some experience, but I did not do the right amount of internships or get the right kind of connections to get a decent job in this area.

My current job pays very little. It's a very physical job and I work closely with a small handful of other people. By closely, I mean in very close quarters. I work full-time, but I don't get breaks (technically we are allowed a lunch break but it is such a fast-paced job that there is never time for that). 

The environment is very passive-aggressive. My boss constantly calls the space a ""judgement-free zone"" however judgement runs rampant. I am routinely picked on for my lifestyle, even though the lifestyle I live is who our business caters to and our main customer (though I am the only employee with this lifestyle).
I am picked on for being ""too intense,"" my coworkers constantly make up lies about me and run to my boss with them. 
Our product is made in a lazy manner with lots of lies told to customers. This makes me so uncomfortable as I pride myself on honesty and transparency. 
I am the youngest employee (something I am actually quite used to, I am often the youngest in both professional and social circles), yet I feel like I am babysitting my coworkers and boss half the time.

I am constantly blamed for mistakes of others, even mistakes made by my boss - she will then blame me for them. I have been pulled aside to be lectured for being offensive. What did I say that was offensive? I told my boss I didn't like a movie she liked.

My beliefs are trashed, my input and time are not respected. 

I want to add that my anxiety is pretty bad in general. I have been in therapy before, but I can no longer find a good therapist that I can afford since I am no longer a student. My husband is my main support system and he is fantastic. He takes wonderful care of me and is very understanding, however the stress of this job is putting strain on our relationship. I come home irritable and in a constant state of panic. I am so surrounded by passive aggressive comments that I start to read them into my husband's actions, when he would never do anything like that. I had to be sent home early from work because I had such a bad panic attack I couldn't work. I have worked in some high-stress environments and I have never had to leave work because of a panic attack before (school, yes - never work). 

I have had bad jobs before. I have had jobs where I was treated like crap by my bosses. Virtually all jobs I've had have been for small businesses where my direct superior was the owner of the company. Even in a job where I was literally the only person in my field in the entire company and one of the only women, I never felt this alienated or anxious. I never felt this disrespected. I wake up unable to breathe because I am so anxious about going to work. I've started having nightmares like a little kid nearly every night.

Here's the fun catch. Technically, my husband makes just barely enough money in his current job for us to live off of, and he is heavily overqualified for what he's doing now so will likely find something that pays more or will get a raise very soon. 

However, we are trying to move out of state to an area that has more job opportunities for both of us, has a culture we fit into better, and where we will not need to drive regularly (aside from this job, driving is my #1 source of anxiety. Nothing is more terrifying to me than being in a car). This move will be expensive, and my current paycheck is going to paying off the little debt we have and getting enough money to move. I am starting a business right now, very small scale (this is something I truly enjoy), but it hasn't quite turned a profit and will take a few months for me to get to the same amount of money I am making now at my real job. Basically every bit of money we can bring in is important. I am trying to find another job, but I'm terrified that I'm not really qualified to do anything. 

Basically, I'm freaking out about my job and I have no idea what to do or how to handle it. I daydream about quitting, but I know it's harder to find a job when you are unemployed, and we also need the money to move - something that will help us out so much in the long term.

Please help me chill,boozyQ,Hypothyroidism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/2t71e1/getting_blood_work_back_on_friday_and_scared/,"So long story short, 2014 was a very, very bad year for me. Bad for me in a lot of personal ways, and physically I felt so run down and depressed. I started back at school and worked 3 part-time jobs and went through a break up that has changed my life in ways I couldn't even expect. I do too much, but I am working hard on changing my future. 

I was so tired and depressed and lethargic that I went to the doctor and was put on anti-depressants. They work, kinda. But I still have obsessive thoughts and lately less energy. I went to the doctor and along with my other symptoms, she suspects hypothyroidism, anemia and/or pre-diabetic situation. I will do anything to change the way I feel. I sleep almost all the time and cant concentrate at the internship I have worked very, very hard for. 

I guess what I am asking for is support. Stories to share about positive results with treatment. Pointers on how to handle a diagnosis. I am very frightened and sensitive, to the point where it has effected most if not all of my friendships. I just want to feel like myself again. 

Advice?

2t72sj,6,2015-01-21,Induction! (That isn't progressing),Samalam_nailed_it,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/2t72sj/induction_that_isnt_progressing/,"Oh where to start? Last Friday I had a high blood pressure reading at my doctors appointment with 135/99 so when I went in for a previously scheduled NST on Tuesday I asked them to take my blood pressure, and I'm glad I did. 

The first reading was 166/111 and the second one was 143/107 so my clinic decided to send me to the hospital to be induced. I'm 39 weeks and have an estimated larger baby and a trace amount of protein they thought it would be best. I certainly did too. 

I went home and got my car seat and the father and packed a few last minute things and arrived at the hospital where they started pitocin around 5 pm, I was already 2 cm dilated and soft so they didn't need to use any medication directly on my cervix. 

4 hours later an intern checked my cervix and told me I was 4 cm dilated. I was happy with that progress and felt like everything was working well. She checked me again another 4 hours later and there was no change. A little disappointing but I was okay with it. Well, turns out when the midwife came and checked me another 4 hours later I was still only 2 cm maybe 3, I was unhappy to hear that I actually hadn't progressed at all. 

I can't lie, I cried.

They decided to give my body a break from the pitocin and have me eat some breakfast, thank god because I needed something in my tummy. I started back up with the medication about two hours later and it's taken four hours to get back to regular contractions. 

I feel defeated. I was hoping this wouldn't take days like it did with my first son but I'm seeing now that I'm doomed to stay here until my youngest son wants to play nice. I just feel really down about it. 

My blood pressure is still high too if I'm not laying on my side, which in this hospital bed is just painful on my hip. Sadness 😔

TL;dr: being induced at 39 weeks due to high blood pressure and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. "

2t8587,1,2015-01-21,Thinking of taking step 2 ck the day before family medicine shelf,[deleted],medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/2t8587/thinking_of_taking_step_2_ck_the_day_before/,"Family medicine is my last clerkship for third year and after that I'll be going straight into my psych sub internship. I want to have the weekend in between the shelf and the start of the psych subI to brush up since I forgot nearly all the psych drugs and diagnoses. 

How bad of an idea is this? I've been managing to pass shelf exams so far without really studying (and I'm perfectly happy with just a pass). I'm pregnant and due in August so I want to get the step 2 done before I'm due but I am afraid if I wait for too long after third year, I'll forget everything but psych. 

My plan if I decide to take the step 2 at end of family medicine is to spend that rotation just studying for the shelf using step 2 secrets and master the boards and uworld. I am not sure if 6 weeks would be enough time to get through all that while on a clerkship. Any thoughts?

Also I got a 218 on step 1 and all passes so far on rotations, what's a reasonable goal for step 2 to match into a not so competitive residency? 220-230?

Thanks for reading if you made it this far!"

What events do you have going on this week?"
2t8mow,0,2015-01-21,"(CA) Offered a position at a startup for significantly more, unsure what to do",techieyyc,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2t8mow/ca_offered_a_position_at_a_startup_for/,"I currently work in software in western Canada at a tech company.  I've worked here for 5 years now (went there straight from graduating school).  Recently, I've had the chance to do some work on the side for a friend of mine that's building a startup and I enjoyed it.  My current salary package including benefits is $73,000 (canadian $) plus 5 weeks of vacation/flextime which is pretty good in my opinion. My friend has offered me a full time with his startup that currently only consists of him and one other person for $110,000 yearly + performance bonus (potentially between $10,000-$50,000/year), more vacation time than I currently get, and presumably more flexibility as well.  However, I'd have to pay for my own additional health insurance benefit (dental/physio) and life insurance (extra $1000-$2000/year).  The gov't does provide free health care here which is nice.

I felt more enjoyment out of the small work I did for him more than I do at my current job, but I don't know how I will cope with the culture shift.  I have friends at my current job and my boss is a good friend too.  The social change seems big to me (going from working in a routine and having friends at work to something much smaller scale).

On the other hand, at my current position, I don't really see a future to be honest (that is, I don't want my boss' job and the tech/product we make is something I don't want to do forever) and they don't really give out raises (I got a 1.5% raise last year, and this year I suspect I won't get any raise at all).  The company is nice for the most part, flexible and has given me time off when I wanted it for example.  The culture where I currently work is pretty nice (have a few friends), though a lot of younger people that have gone through here usually leave or don't come back after being an intern.  I want to experience another company as well with more young people and I've been contacted by recruiters before, but staying here for the last 5 years has also taken a toll on my skills (specialized in maintenance of older systems).  I feel I may not currently have the necessary skills to stand out in an interview.  I do however have interest in exploring what else is out there since I've only worked here, but I guess the fear of the unknown has stopped me from looking too hard what else is outside this company, especially when it's been secure and provided me enough for now.


I'm looking for some career advice of what I should do, perhaps someone else has been in this position before.  My friends and family have advised me to take a risk while I'm still young and don't have a family, so I am inclined to take the career risk while I still can.  My current debt is my apartment where I live and a few monthly bills such as property tax, condo fee, car insurance, internet bill, phone bill.  I have about a year's worth of savings saved up in case I need emergency funds and worst case scenario, I rent out my apartment and move back in with my parents (they live in the same city).

Also, forgot to mention I am 26 years old, and live on my own.

I appreciate any advice, thank you! "

and realistically i doubt ill have shit to put next year either because all ill accomplish is learning more useless shit that i can't put on a fucking resume anyway

or the year after

they keep telling me 'write a resume' 'write a resume' 'hippity hoppoti' 'write a resume' but really - what experience or anything else can i fucking put thats so stupid

idk what kind of stuff are you guys putting

tl;dr: I don't know what to put on my résumé. Currently I only have the programming languages I speak under skills. For one, it's literally 1 line and I need to expand it (and I don't know how). Secondly, not everyone in my major (Computer Engineering) even has *that* so I really wonder what they can put on their résumé. Halp.

second question is what can i expect from an interview/other parts of the application? I'm scared they'll ask me some sorting algorithm shit and ill sit there saying ""idk motherfucker who cares use the built-in sort \#suchhighlevelsofcomputerscienceswag""

2t9ges,6,2015-01-22,"I was a victim of domestic violence. How do I [22F] stabilize my current relationship [25M] when every time issues arise, I want to run away?",MyotisMacrotus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2t9ges/i_was_a_victim_of_domestic_violence_how_do_i_22f/,"I have submitted here before years ago, and found your advice very useful at the time. This may be a wall of text explanation, so bear with me. 

First some backstory. When I [22F] was 19, I had just ended a two-year relationship that was really unremarkable, and mainly ended just due to youth and naiveté. I met this guy, we'll call him Chance, not long after while at a summer internship for science. Chance was a few years older, very handsome, and pursuing a mathematics degree at the time. I was at the time pursuing, and just graduated with, two hard-science degrees, so we immediately clicked. He was attending a college about an hour away from mine, so I saw him about once a week to begin with. 

Chance was always a little shy, didn't have many friends, and seemed to keep to himself a lot. He was a very charismatic person when he did go out, and many people I introduced him to liked him. A few months into the relationship, I noticed he would text me at odd times when I knew he was supposed to be in class, or else not text me back at all when we had prior commitments. A long series of discussions later, and it was discovered that Chance was an alcoholic.

I had fallen in love with him by this point in time, and was in a very ""I can do anything"" stage in my life. His alcoholism quickly worsened now that I had recognized it and was seeing him more often, to days and days of drunken  stupor lying in bed, missing class, missing work. His life quickly fell apart. I discovered this was not the first time alcohol had made his future suffer, but I had no real idea how bad alcoholism was at the time. He was 22, I thought at alcoholics were drunken old guys. 

So, with the help of his parents, I put him through rehab. He stayed all 28 days, and seemed determined to stay sober. That was how, after 8 months of dating him, his parents and I decided it was a good idea for him to move in with (sober) me. This was honestly one of the worst decisions of my life. 

Quickly after moving in, the abuse started. It was emotional at first, with a lot of lies, a great deal of manipulation. I lost contact with many friends, I stopped calling my family, I focused less on school. It progressed to more physical violence soon after. He would stand in front of the door to prevent me from leaving, steal my cell phone and push me back away from getting it, shove me into walls. All things I easily talked myself out of. He wasn't hitting me with a closed fist, so it wasn't abuse, or so I thought. 

The relationship quickly came to a head because I discovered in the worst way possible that he had cheated on me: by going to my yearly GYN visit and discovering that I had an STD. One of those easily-treated-with-antibiotics ones, but an STD nonetheless. I somehow came to my senses and broke up with him after that. I made the mistake of letting him stay in my apartment until he found a new place. I went out with a friend one night a week after we had broken up, and didn't come home until 1 am. I really feel like I did nothing wrong that night, I went to a local club with a friend and danced and talked about life changes. 

The next morning, Chance sexually, physically, and emotionally assaulted me. He then fled, taking most of his things. I changed the locks. He broke into my apartment the next day. I called the police, but played down the break in, and only sparingly told them about the day before. He received an 18 month probation for ""criminal trespassing"" with a 100-yard restraining order that was a suggestion by the DA. I wasn't sure how to handle what had happened, so I did not testify, I just let the DA's office handle everything. 

The reason I mention all of this backstory is that I think it is extremely relevant to the issue at hand. I was with Chance for just over a year, and then had another relationship in the interim with a man almost 10 years my senior in my search for stability. I thought I was doing pretty well. I never needed counseling, I ""bounced right back"" as my best friend put it. 

So I met Brian [25M], my current SO, about six months ago through a mutual friend. He and I had instant chemistry, to the point of talking for hours on end about every subject in the world. He was incredibly intelligent, down-to-earth, driven, successful, and very good looking in that British punk rocker sort of a way. He works for a large corporation and also works as a freelance artist on the side. He and I get along very well, have similar outlooks on the world, and even have similar visions of our future. He is patient, compassionate, incredibly understanding, and reliable. What you see is what you get with Brian, he's one of the most open-minded, honest people I've met. 

However, as I'm guessing you've predicted, we occasionally, probably every other week, get into arguments. These arguments are always instigated by me, and are always over something incredibly mundane. For instance, tonight he realized he had made plans with a friend a week ago and forgot about those plans until she texted him last-minute. We had made plans for me to stay over at his place tonight and generally hang out, nothing too specific. She had a very personal problem going on and needed to consult her best friend about it; they've known each other for years and even have friendship rings. Her other best friend, who is his very close friend, is also a guy and has a matching tattoo with her. I know her from high school and am not concerned there is anything more than friendship between them. He offered to let me stay at his house until he came back from seeing his friend.

I got very upset over him hanging out with her tonight and told him I was leaving and wouldn't commit to making any follow-up plans with him. He talked me into staying, and went to hang out with his friend. I honestly love that he has such an active social life and has so many friends, and think it makes him a well very-rounded person. He has friends really from all walks of life, and seems to genuinely just like helping people and getting to know new people. 

This argument has happened many times before, and it's always over something a little different. Anytime a little issue comes up, like a small change in schedule, or a misheard comment he made to a friend, or even bad weather, I feel like my first instinct is to run. I have a very hard time dealing with any conflicts in a relationship, and my resolution to arguments usually involves me thinking that I am doing everything wrong, I am bad for Brian, and I should run away because he would be better off without someone who wants to run away. It's very circular logic. 

So, Reddit, I guess my question is, how do I stop wanting to run away every time something changes in my relationship? I have not left yet, but I definitely have discussed the possibility, and my confusion, with Brian. Every time his conclusion is the same: he cares a great deal about me, and wants me to be happy. He would prefer I stay in his life, but does not want to force me to stay if I'm unhappy. He just wants me to stop running away every time an issue comes up. Our relationship is great otherwise, but I feel like I am not very flexible or open to little changes, and this has become a difficulty in my relationship. How do I stop this a""bolting"" instinct and become more flexible? 

-------  
**tl;dr**: I had a very abusive relationship in my [22F] past and now every time issues arise in my current relationship [25M], I feel like the only solution is to run away. How do I stop wanting to run away and stabilize my relationship with a really great guy?"

2t9uz9,2,2015-01-22,Cutting Advice?,SABERDUHCUTES,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2t9uz9/cutting_advice/,"Hi guys, 

I'm a Asian male, 173cm and 71kg currently. I have been wanting to start my cut and hopefully go down a good amount of body fat in about 9 weeks. I'll be focusing on keeping as much mass as possible. Thus, I have been reading alot of online sites for guides on the matter. According to the sites and using the formula, I have to be eating close to 200g of protein a day and keep my calories at 1600. 

Is it really required for me to eat that much protein for this cut? I have watched other videos on YouTube and some is saying that the usual info on protein intake is overstated. For you guys out there on your cut, how do you usually measure your protein intake? 

Also, I have been using a machine at my gym (supposedly it was quite a costly machine, so I guess the measurements should be about right?) to find out my body fat % etc and it states that I am about 17.7% body fat currently. However, I have visible abs outline, and I have always thought that you have to be below 15% bf to see even a little of abs. I am just worried that I might have been using a wrong value for body fat % in my calculations for my macros and calories etc. Any advice will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Edit: I work out for 3/4 times a week and is currently an intern doing office work. Typical workout lasts for about an hour."

Every day I struggle to be productive, I try to stay positive but every day I have an hour or two of sadness, reflection and sometimes inner anger minimum, i know i shouldnt be so upset about my past im only 24 for crying out loud.

I feel like i'm alone in this world right now, I regret how my university degree turned out, how i lost some friends, how right now it just feels like im aimlessly wandering in life without a purpose oh and my uncle was murdered a few months before i was born. I dont talk about it much but it affected my dad alot, he went in a downward spiral over the past 20 years, lost his job and friends. I saw him hit a woman as a child and have a few years of being an alcoholic. Its funny, I never thought any of that affected me until a friend in uni brought it up once. When did everything get so serious... 5 years ago i was laughing with friends and practicing my art with a smile on my face. what the fuck happened.

Why didnt i do this, why is my life now like that, these are the thoughts that constantly orbit my mind. I believe I distracted myself from my inner issues that even I didnt realize I was depressed for a long time, I use to play alot of video games, as a form of escapism i now believe. Fast forward 3 years, ive moved to a new city with my girlfriend. I've been without work for 5 months here looking, trying to figure out where the pieces in my life puzzle go. I'm teaching myself to be a graphic designer but everyday is a constant struggle between productivity and procrastination. I have sleep problems, no friends where i currently live and sometimes i just feel so godamn angry. My family and few friends that live in different cities dont know im feeling this bad, i mask it and say im fine, i was brought up to shake this kindve thing off, besides there are people that are living much worse lives. I should be greatful, but I cant escape the feeling of being lost, where is my life going, am i doing the right thing, anxiety has built up in me, i avoid social interaction, i was once a very positive happy person. Now i just feel like i have no purpose and my friends of old have all disappeared. 

This week though I got a part time bar job and I may have a chance of a work from home graphic design internship... things may change, but I would give anything to start over from 5-8 years ago.

2t9zx9,0,2015-01-22,(23/m) My girlfriend (23/f) away on a 3 month internship overseas has been offered another internship at the same place for another year... what do i do?,skipaBturner,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2t9zx9/23m_my_girlfriend_23f_away_on_a_3_month/,"Quick synopsis: We have dated for 5 years now. We have done long distance 3 times in our lives, each time being about 3 months long.

Girlfriend has been away for 2 months now, with one month to go. She is interning at a really cool place. About two days ago, while we were speaking on skype, she all of a sudden brought up that she was offered an amazing internship at a world class hotel chain by her current employers. She was super excited about it, and didn't seem to realise what that would mean for our relationship. Meanwhile i'm absolutely gutted. I have been working a fulltime job this uni holidays just so i could afford to fly to see her at the end of her internship. I was planning on doing like 10 days travelling with her. She is saying that i don't need to b/cos she will just come back to me for 2 weeks, sort stuff out, then fly back and to work for another year. 

Before she brought this up, it was set in stone that she would come back here, move in with me (first time in 4 years), at least till i finished uni (i have 6months left), and then we would go on from there. And now thats all gone to shit bcos she's been offered a great opportunity.

Life sucks.. What do i do, I've told her that i'm happy for her, but i have also said that i'm pretty gutted about the whole thing. She keeps saying i don't need to worry rite now because she doesn't 'really' know if she has the job, or if she can extend her visa any longer. I think it will all be fine and dandy for her and that she will jsut get the job.

Just to tell you her motives...

She wants to work for a top 4 accounting agency in the city i currently live in. She didn't have the grades to get the job, but she networked so hard at uni, that she basically had worked for and knew most of the recruiters for these big firms. She literally could have walked into any of those jobs because of her in-uni experiences, but could not be accepted because of that grade cut off. So she went to intern overseas to gain enough experience to be accepted into one of the top 4.

She will find out within the next month if she will be accepted into the big 4 grad programs (which start next year, not this year). 

My, biased, recommendation (if she gets accepted into grad program next year) is that she comes back home after her current intern, gets a job with a mid-tier accounting firm until she starts working for the big 4 next year.

Her idea is that she stays overseas for another year interning, then comes back for grad program.

Don't know what to think, advice would be great

I just turned 27, and I graduated from college when I was 23 with a BS in Psych and a double minor in anthropology/neuroscience.  I loved the field.  I had a great independent study and internship during my undergraduate program.  However, strangely enough, upon graduating, I decided to immediately apply at a local environmental analysis production laboratory.  

I really wanted to start working right out of college, and there were not a lot of options for me in a science field without further education, so when I was interviewed and hired at the lab within 2 two months of graduating, I happily took the job.  I was making twice as much as I was in college, full time, benefits, and I had 0 debt, including a fully paid off car.  I was able to save about half of my annual salary in 18 months.  After about two years working with the company, I quit to move out to the west coast (I am originally from the east coast).  

I have been here for about a year now, and I specifically chose a city bigger than my hometown.  I like the area, and I have finally found a job and am again able to support my lifestyle without dipping into my savings.    Everything seems okay...

However, I have somewhat come to terms that I will not be using the BS (regardless of how hard i worked to achieve it) in any kind of practical field.  I did not have the grades, nor do I have the patience to get my doctorate.  So that (finally) brings me to why I am writing this post.  

I have roughly one or two hours out of every eight hour work day that I am free to surf the web (hence this post).  I would love some thorough advice on what sort of opportunities (paid and free) are out there that I can currently check out in order to expand my options.  I like computers, I like writing, I like the legal system, and I like the scientific/medical field.  Hell, I have even have experience teaching and loved that!

So, Reddit, what are some good, legitimate online certifications that can help me pursue real world careers.  Whether it be transcription (medical/legal), IT, Web Design, or online technical certificates that an average, college educated male can engage in without much prior experience, I am an open book!

I do not know how many people (if any) will see this, but I would like to express my gratitude right now.  I am looking to open some new doors in my life while I not only have the income and savings to do so but the right attitude as well.  I look forward to checking this post over the next day or two! :)

You're applying for a job at Zenimax.

During the interview process, your friends (game reviewers) tell you not to bother working for Zenimax (buying ESO), because within a year they'll be giving out their benefits for free (F2P in a year rumors). You ask the HR manager during your interview about it, and he says that that's a ridiculous notion, and it doesn't make any sense for a company to give away benefits for free.

You decide you like Zenimax, and you sign your offer letter (buy the game). You agree to work 40 hours a week (subscription cost) at a salary of $65,000 a year, paid every 6 weeks (content updates every 6 weeks).

For the first few months, you're working some unpaid overtime (buggy launch), but you're still having fun and things are going well.

Then over the Thanskgiving holiday, you notice that you haven't been paid (1.6 delayed). But HR sends you an e-mail, saying that payroll was only delayed because of bonuses (super awesome content coming in 1.6!!), and that you will be paid in full next cycle.

So you go back to work and continue working (paying sub) while under the impression that you'll be getting your regular pay and then some in the next cycle (champion system! justice system!).

Next payment cycle rolls around (December), and your pay (1.6) still hasn't come through. Nervous, you e-mail HR but they tell you that it's the holidays, and payroll people need vacation too (literally the excuse we got)!

Slightly bummed but not dismayed, you come in to work after the holidays, only to discover that all of the contracted employees have been quitely laid off (60 day sub getting pulled).

Some of the negative nancies in your office are grumbling that they've seen this before at other companies (SWTOR, LotRO, etc), and that this means that massive lay-offs are coming (F2P).

Now, you haven't been paid in two months, but you're thinking: ""why would they show us the bonus checks (ESO live with 1.6 changes), then lay off the people who put in all that overtime and work hard without pay?""

But since the grumblings are growing, you send an email to the senior leadership team asking them if the rumors about layoffs are true. You get an out-of-office reply saing: ""We fired the contractors because it was too difficult for them to work 60 hours a week (6 month sub), and we want everyone working 40 hours a week.""

Satisfied with that answer, you show it to the negative nancies and tell them there's nothing to worry about. They just scoff and continue updating their resumes (canceling sub and investing time in other games).

Two weeks later, there's a big company meeting (latest scheduled ESO live) where the senior leadership talks about all the great benefits that you'll be getting along with your bonuses. When asked about the layoff rumors, they just ignore the question, or say that they ""have no plan to do any layoffs"".

This quells the rumors, and the next day the doomsayers delete their Monster accounts and Craigslist postings.

Then on Tuesday, you boss calls your group in for a quick standup meeting (impromptu ESO live). He explains that there's been some restructuring:

1. There will be no more salaried employees, only hourly (cash shop: you only get content you pay for). 

2. All current salaried employees will get a vacation day for every month they've been working (100 crowns/month of sub). 

3. Any employees that wish to continue working 40 hours a week with unpaid overtime (ESO Plus), will accumulate 1 and a half vacation days per month (1500 crowns/month of sub).

4. Those employees will also receive embossed business cards (mounts, pets, costumes), and all future pay will be tax-free (free DLC), but there will be no guarantee that you will be paid, or how often.

5. There will no more pay until March (1.6 release).

6. In June, there will be a mass hiring of 16 year-old interns with no experience (console release). 

7. Everyone hired starting from March will work one 40 hour week (buy the game), and will have immediate access to health insurance, the company jet, (the functionality of the existing game), and everything else you've been having to work for, but they won't get the embossed business cards unless they come in to work for one day (buy crowns in the cash shop).

Finally your boss says: Why the long face? Aren't you glad that all your friends will now have free benefits, and that you'll be getting paid in November's pay in March??


**TL;DR:** The point is that you've dramatically changed **our** game, without discussion, notification, or any community involvment whatsoever, while lying to your most loyal customers by pretending until the very last that the subscription model they enjoy will remain in place, that new content is right around the corner, and that the game they love and have spent so much time and money on will not be radically altered. 

**You lied to us and broke our trust. Give me the 1.6 I've been paying for 3 months for, so I can enjoy the content I was promised to have 2 months ago without the people who originally hated this game ruining it for me.**"

2tarv8,2,2015-01-22,Just wanted to vent (depressed about my health and future),Peace_seeker_,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2tarv8/just_wanted_to_vent_depressed_about_my_health_and/,"TLDR: basically I have anxiety and depression issues and I really screwed up my vision (it's now tilted) due to maybe drug use or eye strain or simply stress. I don't know what to do anymore.

Hey guys,

I'm a 19 year old college student who has suffered with anxiety and depression since the 7th grade. In the beginning it was OCD about praying to God to protect me from the devil and demons; I'd pray for hours because I had to pray in a certain way. This continued until the end of 8th grade when I finally kicked it with the help of my loving grandfather and a little book called The Secret. During freshmen year of high school I began to live with the law of attraction (positive thinking) religiously and life was pretty good. I picked up breakdancing the summer before high school and was beginning to make new friends in high school which was difficult as I suffered from loneliness my whole life but it was exciting too. Then sophomore year kicked in and I quit breakdancing for fear of injury (probably my paranoia from anxiety). During this time I developed OCD about germs and continuation and this CONSUMED my life. I would worry about every single contact with germs. It would always be on my mind and when it wasn't I was sleeping in class or at home and trying my best to get my schoolwork done. It's amazing how I managed to stay on the track team during this time. When the school year was ending, I managed to kick this irrational fear temporarily because I somehow trained my brain to stop thinking about it but it came back the next year. Fast forward to senior year, I still had the OCD about germs and I also worried about my performance with my work (I always thought I made a mistake and would constantly check my work--only when I was doing something for other people because I didn't want to harm them). This caused me to be scared to take up a part-time job and now that I'm in college, this is the main reason why I'm scared to take up a internship. My whole anxiety problem is about how I'm scared of harming myself and others. 

From my sophomore year of high school to the summer before college, I drank and smoked weed with my friends. This wasn't very chronic. It was probably a couple times a month. I did it to fit in and to partially escape from my thoughts. A strange thing began happening during the end of my junior year of high school; my vision would be tilted when I was high but it would go back to normal afterwards. This is the main health problem that I have. During senior year and my first year and a half at college, I took MDMA several times, Xanax a couple times, LSD once, and cocaine three times or so. On one night before college started, I drank and smoked and came down with a severe cold or fever. The next day, my vision became permanently tilted. This was August 2013. 

Honestly, for the past year and a half I've just been depressed and getting by. I do fairly well in school because I put all my energy into that. The rest of the time, I spend a huge amount of time playing video games and watching shows to escape from how fucked up my vision is and how bad my anxiety and depression is. I do have a couple of friends but I know that life can be better. Although, during this time I did continue drug use. I have quit weed since July and haven't drank in a 3 weeks to a month and I really plan on maintaining that. I've been seeing several doctors about my problems and my eye doctor thought it was a muscle issue and my neuro-ophthmaologist thought it was something wrong with my brain processing things and could possible related to the drug use. Other doctors of the same specialty couldn't tell me what was wrong. Some think it's because of my anxiety. 

Bottom line is I've waited so long to finally take care of myself and even then I'm not THAT motivated because I'm so depressed about my situation. I'm just so scared that I messed up my vision for the rest of my life and as a result, my balance too. I honestly don't know how my future is going to play out in regards to my professional life and a future family. This anxiety and depression is crippling and I just want to get better.

Any feedback would be appreciated."

I'm also in debt, less than 10,000 but that's still a lot when I can't pay it off. I've only had about 4 jobs in my life (including internships) and none of them were long term things (none were offered for more than a year). I recently went back to college to add a credential to my degree, but I feel like it's not going to help much. I needed to take out some loans for it but I'll still have under 10,000 in debt once I'm done. I'm very worried about what I'm gong to do once I'm finished. 

In the past, I always had school to fall back on and give me something to do besides being unemployed. But when I'm finished with it for good, I don't know what I'm going to do. I've job hunted before and have done all the advice that people told me to do. Nothing came back. My university's semester started again and now that I'm talking to all these younger students who seem to have their shit together, I'm feeling real depressed and worthless. One class required students to introduce themselves and I couldn't even fake a smile. I felt like throwing up, my hands were shaking, and I just lied about my life. I thought many people were feeling emotions like I was feeling. I guess that's not the case at my school. People really loved talking about themselves and their lives. 

Well I think I'm going to be unemployed for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll be underemployed, working in fast food/retail, I don't know. I don't even have any friends I can contact to ask about jobs. We all drifted apart during the years and some of them hated me because I was too distant and reserved. So I don't have anybody to talk to, that's why I'm writing to you guys. I hate going through this process alone, broke, and lost. Guys, what happens to people like me? Do we just struggle financially, suffer alone, and feel real unfulfilled the rest of your lives? Fuck, I don't  think I want that but I can't seem to escape it.  "
2tcm6q,6,2015-01-22,In need of good high-performance bike maintenance guides,PM_ME_YOUR_BlCYCLE,MTB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/2tcm6q/in_need_of_good_highperformance_bike_maintenance/,"I'm buying a [Giant XTC Advanced 3](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/bikes/model/xtc.advanced.27.5.3/18759/76195/#overview ) soon here, but I want to learn how to take care of it. Usually I get those crappy $500 trek marlins and pay no attention to maintenance, but now it's time to start winning some XC races with a bike that is 10 pounds lighter and better components.

This is why I need to learn how to take care of a nice mtb (including bleeding brakes and cleaning the cassette). I'm not looking to replace this XTC anytime soon, so I'd like to take care of it and keep it in re-sellable condition.

 Now, some of you might suggest that I look for an internship at the local bs. Unfortunately, I don't have time to dedicate that regularly to the drive to the bs, but I have recently invested in a few quality Park Tool sets, so I can perform maintenance as needed.

Does anyone know of a good guide to bike maintenance?

Thanks!"

Any feedback on grammar, order, and content would really be appreciated. My English is not the best!

I find chemistry fascinating because like the Wild West, everywhere you look there is an undiscovered frontier ready for exploration. From nanomaterials to pharmaceutical design chemistry is at the forefront of solving problems that are relevant and detrimental to our society. I desire to be part of this solution. 


My start in science began much earlier than most children involving the mixing of my mother’s expensive salon shampoos to produce a color change alongside bubbles. Reflecting back this experiment was poorly designed with an undefined hypothesis and no safety equipment. Several years later my family obtained an old weathered light microscope which let me plunge into the microscopic world living in a pond behind my house. In college having a building full of people who love science fueled my passion.  This led me to seek out great research labs and firmly planted my love of chemistry.


As of 2015, I have completed two years of undergraduate research. My first position at New Mexico state university was in a computational chemistry lab where I spent over 1 year studying transition metal complexes using Gaussian ’09. While under Professor (omitted), I acquired vast knowledge of techniques in the field of computational chemistry and modeling. My current position is in an organic synthesis lab where I combine my wet lab skills and my computer background to help design reaction methodologies viable for metal carbene cyclizations. I have spent the last 8 months under Professor(omitted), where I have acquired extensive training in compound purification, characterization, lab safety, catalysis, and synthesis under a wide range of reaction conditions. I enjoy my current research projects because they provide me with interesting problems that I can channel my developing scientific skillset towards. 


In my selected laboratories of interest, my advanced organic synthesis experience will allow me to quickly and immediately impact my projects. I have a large amount of NMR, IR, and UV-vis experience which will prove valuable in understanding conclusions made from results of my research. My excellent oral and written communication skills will allow me to effectively summarize my results and collaborate with colleagues.
Preforming research in your lab will help me improve as a chemist and the experience I receive will help me achieve my childhood goal to become a scientist. The opportunities to develop not only my academic but my professional skills would be greatly beneficial.  I hope to attend graduate school where I can fully explore the unique skills I have acquired from this internship.



Research allows me to use my mind to solve problems that are both relevant and fascinating. Every day I come to work excited to accomplish new things that no one has attempted before. I enjoy pioneering the unknown and exploring things that plague our society. From experimenting with mixing soaps to multistep synthesis, science has been an influential and intricate part of my life. Children dream of doing what they love and by pursuing a graduate degree in chemistry I will be one of the select few who actually get to follow their dreams. The opportunity to discuss the projects further would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a 22 year old full time student that has had a Discover card since 2012.  I usually put about $100 a month on it and pay it off immediately.  I've never missed a payment and I have a FICO credit score of 786 according to Discover.  When I got the card 2 years ago, they gave me a $800 credit line that has never increased.  I've been asked a few times to update my information, but since I'm still in school and only work during the summer, my credit line stays constant.

The issue is that I'm taking a trip to Norway this summer after I graduate.  I have more than enough money in the bank from my internship last summer to cover the costs.  However, I've read that credit cards are the way to go when paying overseas.  Ideally, I'd like to increase the credit limit on my Discover card and open up a Chase Freedom or Capital One Quicksilver card as a backup.

Now to my question.  I have a job lined up starting next August. It will pay $75k gross a year.  Can I use this number as my income to increase my credit limit/open a new card?  Or should I use the $15k gross that I earned last summer at my internship as my annual income?"

I hardly talk to anyone and stayed on my computer,eat and sleep all day. When I finally drag myself out of bed and go back to college next week its going to be a long day... 

Was my vacation good? Yes.

Is my life good? Yes, but the world itself can be a horrible and dark place

Am I depressed? No but I probably have social anxiety

So why don't you have friends? Because I am not interested enough and have nothing to offer, talking to me is like talking to my therapists, I listen but am disconnected from everyone else till other seems interested in me, well that's how i do it now, i used give my contacts to people, i have 40 and more of em, all of them i knew them for a short time, acquaintances. Am okay with talking though, if people want talk to me i'll listen and reply, ask questions, try to help.
I have to remember to delete all of my contacts, I don't see them anymore nor do they contact me anymore. Moved on, that's normal. My Facebook is deactivated.

Ever had a girlfriend, been on a date, etc.? No.

Are you suicidal? No. But i rarely have suicidal thoughts, its just another route of escape

Tried Alcohol or drugs? No. Am afraid to even touch wine.

Considered therapy? Ive seen therapists on and off since 16 am 21 now, I've stopped now, just a waste of energy now, it helped before but now I'll just handle my emotional and mental issues myself.

Volunteer or internship? Been there done both. It was interesting, it took a surprising amount of energy, sometimes, I'll just not go and not call them, i'll have people worried, i'll be surprised why i haven't been fired yet. Maybe because am the last one to leave.

Church? No, I guess that's my only option now. Sometimes I think things have been taken away from me because of my sins and lack of faith, I've recently reconnected with my faith. But Church people can be so judgmental, seeing a weird queer looking person (no am not gay, just androgynous looking and acting, i prefer it that way) like me might put them off, oh well ill just go for god then.


I don't know why I wrote this, maybe I want someone to respond. Its funny, I want some one to actually read this and respond haha. If you don't want to that's okay, thanks.

I live in Oklahoma and I'm not sure about the demand  for javascript programmers here.

How am I supposed get experience in this field? I can read javascript books and watch videos all I want, but it's not going to give me practical hands-on real life experience.

I posted on craigslist that I would work for free just for the experience, but there was no response. I looked for internships, but practically every internship requires you to be a student.

I actually interviewed for a job a few days ago and it didn't go too well. It was an entry level SQL/C# job and I answered the technical questions pretty well, did pretty good on the whiteboard coding but I was very nervous/awkward as it would have been my first ""real"" job instead of fast food etc. I also told them I was socially awkward and liked to work alone... probably a really bad idea. I've not heard back from them.

I just don't know what to do. My mom and her girlfriend keep telling me to get a job and get out of the house but I can't find a good job. I was pretty sheltered, never let out of the house to do anything besides go to school then come home and sit on my computer in solitude.

My discomfort around people comes off as standoffish and people don't seem to like me very much. Usually respond to people with one-word answers that are barely audible a lot of the time. Can't smile to people. I'm reasonably attractive looking but my personality really ruins any social interaction.

A guy I worked with at my last job (minimum wage, pizza place) said I gave off a ""serial killer vibe"". Another girl there said I'm weird and she'd been trying to ""hold her tongue"" but she just had to say something. All I have are good intentions and it sucks to be treated as an outsider just because of my lack of social development. I won't be happy working for slave pay but I can't even handle that... how am I supposed to develop the social skills to get a real job? To get a decent wife and family? 

I know I'm straying off from the original question, but I just don't know where to ask for help...

2teg3m,1,2015-01-23,Has anyone here transferred as a PR Major? Prospective Fall 2016 Transfer,mailinhhh,USC,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/2teg3m/has_anyone_here_transferred_as_a_pr_major/,"I'm just wondering what the process was like, and what your academic/professional resume was before your transfer. I'm currently attending a CCC, and am hoping to transfer Fall of 2016. 

My top two choices for school's and programs right now are: 
USC - PR Major, Film Studies Minor 
Dodge Film School at Chapman University - Creative Producing Major, PR Minor 

My grades aren't stellar, at the rate I'm going I'll be transferring with a 3.3-3.4...but I have lots of professional experience. In case you're wondering of my academic program choices, basically it's my main interest is new media which is where my work experience lies. I've worked with very well known YouTube channels, including one with 11M+ subscribers, multiple TV deals in the works, and at least one Emmy to their name. 

I've been in the production, business/talent management, journalistic, and social media marketing sides of the new media industry. I even make my own YouTube videos. Also, even with my full time school schedule I turned one of my internship at a news/media outlet into a contracted writer/social media management job which I'm still holding. 

I feel like a douche listing off accomplishments, but I'm super paranoid of my chances to get into either school (will obviously be applying to fallbacks) - because I was an abysmal high school student. Which even that I was terrible at (I ditched like...half of high school and spent all that time volunteering at the Red Cross. I clearly didn't understand how rebellion was supposed to work.) I also have gaps in my schooling after high school(graduated 2011), because I spent a few years working (pay for school myself) and figuring out what I wanted to do so I you change my mind later.  Plus, I just have cuh-razy self esteem issues due to the way I was brought up...so even though most people in and out of ""the industry"" say I'm doing fine for my age, I still come up feeling inadequate for where I am career wise. 

Any input would be very much appreciated. 

TL;DR: I'm insecure, tell me your transfer story!"
2temfm,17,2015-01-23,Have you ever gone to HR/your coach about an awful coworker? Being encouraged to do so on behalf of my team,outaccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2temfm/have_you_ever_gone_to_hryour_coach_about_an_awful/,"Long story short, we've got a hell senior. This person's been a senior for 6-7 years and is probably the only person they could find to senior this audit. The bullshit pulled could fill about 3 pages.

I've had absolutely terrible bosses before, so I've made it through. But we've got a couple new associates who have literally been fighting against quitting the firm outright the last month because of the passive-aggressive tactics, the yelling, the random anger, being intentionally embarrassed in front of the team/client etc. Even our intern, who she forgets to release until midnight 80% of the time, has considered literally quitting his internship outright (not because of hours and not the usual ""I want to quit"" humor -- serious as a heart attack tanking his internship to escape this senior). The client has literally felt sorry for us multiple times when we've been on calls with her -- I was even invited to their Christmas party as a consolation (didn't attend, but still) -- I've never had a hardened client contact literally check if I'm okay after a call because a team member on the other end has been so vitriolic.

A guest senior who was temporarily on the team had to fight to keep this hell senior from literally giving all five associates the worst performance ratings possible. The client also hates this senior; all client contacts I've spoken to agree she's the worst they've ever dealt with in their entire careers in industry. Two years ago, someone else filed a separate complaint to HR against her and was successfully able to get out of all engagements she seniored at the cost of being viewed as a hard to work with associate. I've already pulled favors to get myself scheduled on other clients, but others haven't been so lucky. It's not about hours, nor the client -- this would be an enjoyable busy season client without this toxic person.

So even if I'm about to head down the road and forget about this nightmare, I've been encouraged by multiple associates, seniors, a manager, and even an unnamed senior manager to report this person to either my coach or HR after compiling a list. Given that multiple colleagues think it's the right idea, I'm considering doing it. Has anyone done something like this before? How'd it go for you?"
2teukr,11,2015-01-23,"French-canadian scout, reporting in!",folkrav,scouting,https://www.reddit.com/r/scouting/comments/2teukr/frenchcanadian_scout_reporting_in/,"I would like to tell you a little story. Mine, to be honest.

I started school younger than most people - I was 4 years old - so I always was ""the young one"". I was a shy kid, with heavy social anxiety, but what helped me get through that was that school was easy for me. My teachers had mixed feelings about me, because I kept dreaming out and doing other stuff in class, but still managed to get almost perfect grades. The real issues came with highschool, when my social anxiety became more of a problem. That weird kid in the corner of the class doesn't really get along with popular kids. My grades slowly got lower and lower because I basically did not care. The only things that made me like my life were two things - I loved music (to the point that I did my whole highschool in a classical music program, piano to be precise), and I loved kids. I went through seasonal jobs in ski schools and summer camps and loved every minute of it.

After highschool, I struggled to find who I was, what I wanted. I didn't know what to do with myself. I knew I didn't want to become a pianist... So I went in social studies, without a real plan. I gained weight (70 pounds in a year). I wasn't happy. I couldn't sleep and regularly, I had to sit down and breathe for minutes at a time before I could go on with my life. I thought it was related to my weight gain, but I now know that they were panic attacks. I got kicked out of social studies because my grades were down to the floor.

I then decided to go do some more music, but more on the technical side of things. I decided to learn how to record music. I loved it. That's when I met my SO. 

(Actually, I didn't really meet her, we already knew each other - she was my highschool ex-""girlfriend""'s friend. We just haven't seen each other for close to five years. We vaguely remembered that we stopped talking to each other after a fight between us, but that seemed so far for us. We became a couple pretty fast. In retrospective, it could have been a really bad idea, but we're still going strong after close to 6 years!)

Things went down when I got my diploma. Jobs in this area are scarce around here, and there's too many people who want the same ones. There are 3 schools just in the city who splurts out people each year, and at least 3 others outside of town (like 2-3 hours drive maximum). I got back to the same point I was before - no job, no career plan, no idea of what to do. At least, I had someone to help me now.

I then remembered something - hey, I love kids. After a long thought, I decided to go back to school to be able to go to university in elementary school teaching. What could go bad?

I went to school, got a collegial diploma (required to go to university here), then got accepted in my program. I was crazily happy. Then I started my courses, and pretty much liked it, in general. When I got my first internship though, I realized something. Teaching stuff terrified me. Taking the whole responsibility of a class' learning for a whole year for the rest of my life terrified me. I thought that it was just because I was still learning, but after my second internship a year later, that feeling was stronger than ever. Things went south again. I was diagnosed with a depression and couldn't keep going. My panic attacks started again. My SO hated seeing me like that, but she kept going and supported me through it. I really thought she wouldn't be able to cope with it, but I now see she's strong and supportive. She was the best friend and girlfriend she could, and I'll be forever grateful. With her help, we gradually found out what was wrong with me. I didn't like teaching. As stubborn as I am, I didn't listen to my gut feeling - I didn't like it but kept going anyway. One question stayed on my mind - why didn't I like working with kids in school? Anyway, my doctor made me stop university with medical reasons. That was in March.

At the beginning of June, I thought ""I need to do something I love"". So I went to a summer camp I already worked for in the past, and applied to work with handicapped people. I thought it would be good for me to work with people who had bigger problems than me, to relativise. I wasn't so wrong. I worked with a severely autistic and hyperactive kid for most of the summer, and loved my experience. That kid has a special place in my heart now. I got to know that incredible little buddy and am really happy he was a part of my life, even if it was a really hard job.

Career wise, my SO and I went through lenghty discussions and, with her guidance, finally settled on something I knew I loved forever, computers. I now am studying in CS and I really destroy it! I love it!

Where does the Scouts fall in? My girlfriend was a Scout when she was a teenager. Her old Scout group needed some animators for the Exploratrices, the 9 to 11 girl branch in Quebec, so she joined them. Then, I got invited to their Halloween party. When I went there, I suddenly realised something : I'm not a teacher, I'm an animator. I love going with kids, guiding them, having fun, but not being the sole responsible for their learning. I quickly, with my SO's blessing, applied to join them, I hastily got accepted. I've been with them since November and did my Promise a couple of weeks ago. I immediately felt in my place, a thing I haven't felt for a long time. These people are so devoted to these kids well-being! Our Unit Leader is leaving in a year and a half and my girlfriend is already getting trained to take the lead after he leaves. He told me to keep close and that we make a great team together.

Tonight, we're leaving for the first winter camp of the majority of our unit (we only have 2 3rd years and 3 second years, all the rest are either new scouts or came from our Beaver Scouts unit. We worked really hard with them to make the best of this weekend, and we're all super excited, be it the girls themselves or us adults!

tl;dr the Scouts teached me about myself, and still does every-single-time."

I was thinking about my options when I return home and it brought up this old memory. 

Before I get this off my chest, my old boss, was like a mentor to me. I was his assistant and he picked me when I was an intern. He pretty much taught me how to find my own individual style in suiting(men's wear) while keeping my own identity through fashion, growing up, and in business. He was the role model in fashion/life I always needed. Well spoken, family man, cool house, cool car, all of which he earned through his hard work. It's hard to find someone like this in the fashion industry that is so real and down to earth. I learnt A LOT through him, and really think I fucked things over, which I'll get to in a minute. We will call this manager A.


It happened about this time a year ago. Another company had scouted me. Enjoying the feeling of being wanted, I figured, what the hell, and went to the interview without letting my current company know (obviously). I really went to the job offer with the pure intention of just seeing what it was, and really enjoyed my old job.

I didn't have anything to lose, being 20 at the time. I got the job offer, which promised a pretty cool pay role, steep discounts, and helping mold the new store (men's wear). 

Here is where things all fall apart. I was actually promoted at my old company week before I got scouted, so that was pretty great. However, the new company was offering a few bucks more. I was trapped and didn't really know what to do. I'm not the best at keeping a poker face when things are on my mind, and having to work with people everyday one of my managers, L, saw right through it. A couple of other things at work were really bugging me, and I just blurted out it out that another company offered me a job.

Immediately, the manager, L, brought me upstairs into the office. I started to panic because I knew I should of told my other manager, A, first. Within the next 20 minutes, I'm speaking with 2 other managers and they're questioning my decision.

 I'm pretty freaked out at this point, (I know realize what they were doing were trying to scare me, I was quite naive back then)

A calls me into his office and says how disappointed he is in me and how much he has done for me, and that he was the last to know about my job offer. I just couldn't hold in the pressure and just sort of cried. I had never wanted to do it in front of him, and just sorta let it out, apologizing and saying I wanted him to know first. I had built all this stuff up, shaping myself into being a mature, young adult, and it all came to ruin just crying in front of him.

I realize now, that all of this really doesn't matter to me today, but It's just something I'm pretty embarrassed about . Since than, he and I come to terms but I don't think things were ever really the same after. I know this might not be a life defying, or huge deal, but it's something that makes me shudder in regret when I think about it. 
I wish I was stronger in the moment.

Thanks for listening."
2tf81i,1,2015-01-23,"Family is moving across the country, need advice",VeridianLuna,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2tf81i/family_is_moving_across_the_country_need_advice/,"  Today my parents dropped the news that they are planning on moving to the West coast this coming summer. This is a huge surprise for me as we've talked about our plans in the past and I was under the understanding that my family would stay here two more years in order for me to attend college and eventually move out. I am 18 years old and am finishing up my senior year of high school with interests in computer engineering. I would prefer to stay here, and not leave with my family. I have had thoughts of moving out before, but them moving so soon pushes me into a position of two choices:  
-Move with my family across the country, work for a year to get residency, go to college. (Not preferred)  
-Move out and stay here to go to college (Preferred)  

  My plan if I stay is to attempt to find a better paying job and work my ass off to pay for community college for two years. After that I will transfer to Maryland state and get a degree in computer engineering. I have no idea where I would stay for the two years of community college, either get a roommate and rent a place with them or find a friend to stay with for the two years. My goals were originally to go through four years of college with no debt by staying with my parents and working jobs in order to pay for college while they support me with a place to stay. But now it appears I may have to get some debt if I plan on staying.
  Currently I have a job and about 6000 in savings with 2000 of that in stocks. I make about 90$ a week and try to keep spending as low as possible. With this break in news I am contemplating leaving my minimum wage job in search for a higher paying job with more hours. I am a self taught programmer, with over six years experience and am interested in finding some form of paid internship or job where I could apply my skills. I have connections with many of my friends (Some of them already have government type jobs) and am very confident/comfortable when it comes to applying for jobs. 

  I would prefer to stay because I know people here and I understand the importance of connections. I also feel that life with my parents is boring, and I want to enjoy life without the overhead of having to live up to the responsibility of being the only boy in a family of 5. I've always felt a disconnect from them and I have always wanted to go off on my own. I am not like most of my peers who seem so afraid to jump into the world alone. I want the challenge, and I want to experience the hard parts of life so that I can learn how to tackle them head on. 

  So, personal finance, I'm not really asking which decision I should make, but rather some advice on what I should do if I do end up moving out. Do you think without a degree it's even a possibility someone with previous experience could get a job in the software/programming industry? And if not, where else could I attain enough money to pay for most of college? (Preferably also a way to learn new skills, and work a lot) What kind of housing options are available for the two years I am in community college? Any useful information pertaining to moving out in general, or just living on your own for the first time without racking up thousands in debt would be appreciated.

For example, HPFS and ATBC show no clear benefit despite including 3842 CHD events and 1339 CHD events respectively (2), in JACC no benefit was found despite including over 1600 CV deaths in both men and women (3), and in Malmo saturated fat tended to be associated with reduced coronary events whereas PUFAs were associated with no benefit despite including 1021 coronary events (2). This lack of clear benefit was also seen in some smaller recent cohorts (5,6), and not many cohorts have evaluated total mortality, but whatever exists show no benefit from a higher P/S ratio (3,6-8). Therefore, although some evidence exists for replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, the evidence is not exactly strong and consistent.

Of course, there are many limitations to observational data and some have noted that the beneficial associations seen for polyunsaturated fat in some studies may due to residual confounding or a ""healthy observer effect"" (9,10). This possible bias was also seen in a recent study where saturated fat was generally associated with unfavorable and polyunsaturated fat with favorable lifestyle factors (11). Some have also questioned the ability of observational studies to distinguish between omega-6 PUFA and omega-3 PUFA (10,12). Therefore, given the well-known limitations (13-15), observational data is not going to solve the issue -- trials are needed.

Although a 2010 trial analysis showed ""benefit"" (no benefit for total mortality) for replacing SFA with PUFA (16), it was criticized for poor trial selection, being incomplete, and not appreciating the potential confounding role of trans-fat (17-19). Later analyses found little evidence of benefit: Hooper et al. found no effect on total mortality (which was described as an important endpoint), cardiovascular mortality, heart attacks, and only found a small reduction in ""cardiovascular events"" that disappeared in sensitivity analyses (20). In 2014 two trial analyses showed no clear effects from replacing SFA with PUFA (4,22). Therefore, trials do not support the idea that we should be replacing SFA with PUFA, despite the fact that PUFA decreases cholesterol levels.

Even from an observational perspective (meta-regressions), saturated fat clearly do not explain the varying results of trials (20,22). Assuming no major methodological biases, there has to be a better explanation.


Omega-3 explains a lot:

Closer analysis shows that increasing omega-3 intake may be beneficial, or more specifically marine fatty acids (21,22), and specifically increasing omega-6 appears to increase risk but not when omega-3 accompanies it (17,18). 

For individual trials, Oslo-1 found reductions in CHD death (-26%) and total mortality (-25%) by employing a diet with substantial amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (23), but the reductions in CHD death (-55%) and total mortality (-33% which increased to -40% on follow-up) were greater in Oslo-2 despite less extreme intakes of omega-3 and less reductions in 
cholesterol, but this time in the context of lower omega-6 intakes (24,25). The benefit appears to be greatest for CHD death (-65%) and total mortality (-56%) when total PUFA and omega-6 is reduced combined with increases in omega-3 (26,27), despite no reductions in cholesterol.

The idea that omega-3 is the issue was also encapsulated by DART (28,29), which tested three diets. The fat arm of DART which involved reducing SFA, and increasing PUFA oil, lean fish, and fruit and vegetable intake, failed to find benefits. The fiber arm of DART increased high fibre breakfast cereals, wholemeal bread, and wheat bran, but also failed. This indicates that the benefit seen in the fatty fish arm (again without cholesterol reduction) was precisely due to omega-3 fatty acids (also supported by the benefits seen in the minority of subjects taking fish oil).

Recent omega-3 trials have found no benefit though still supported somewhat by some recent meta-analyses (30), and reasons for the discrepancy between older and newer trials have been proposed (31,32). Nevertheless, this is still consistent with the hypothesis since ""most patients in recent RCTs are no longer n-3 deficient and the vast majority are now treated with statins...n-3 supplements would be protective only in patients who are more or less n-3 deficient and not in patients who are at high risk for reasons other than n-3 deficiency. In other words, n-3 are indispensable nutrients, which means that it is dangerous to be n-3 deficient, which is not rare in many populations, and not drugs susceptible to reducing the overall risk of CVD complications independent of the n-3 status of the persons studied"" (31). 

Some researchers have hypothesized that there is ""a beneficial effect on the combination of SFA and n-3PUFA in the diet with a concomitant reduction in the consumption of n-6PUFA"" (33). 

Interestingly, even if we ignore the inconsistencies and limitations in observational cohorts and the difficulties in distinguishing between the different PUFAs, it could still be argued that the issue is a lack of PUFA rather than anything to do with saturated fat, since there is no observational evidence of benefit from replacing SFA with carbohydrates (regardless of carbohydrate ""quality"") (1,34-36), or monounsaturated fat (1,36), and PUFA appears to be beneficial regardless of what it replaces, whether carbohydrates or other fatty acids (2,36).


Conclusion:

In terms of diet, the major issue appears to be the lack of omega-3 fatty acids and too much omega-6, and the idea that saturated fat is harmful is not supported by any credible evidence.

2tfgx8,3,2015-01-23,"Quit my high paying stressful job and return to my old job, or stick it out?",[deleted],makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/2tfgx8/quit_my_high_paying_stressful_job_and_return_to/,"Hi guys.

I currently work at a high end restaurant chain. I hate this job so much...it's stressful, extremely fast paced, and management is awful. (had to give them my availability 3 times, and it wasn't until I threatened to quit that they fixed it). The pay however isn't bad. ($10 an hour plus tips). It involves working alot of late nights and weekends. (I also have a second job at a hotel, where I work alot of early mornings) In addition, I go to school full time.

I'm set to graduate in May, and when I do, I will be moving back home with my family around June/July, and hopefully (if I get the internship I'm applying for) will be moving to LA for 4 months beginning in August. The main reason I have the second job is to save for the internship as it's unpaid.

If I quit my second job though, I won't be able to afford all my bills and to save and still go out with my friends occasionally. I have the option to go back to an old job I had here, which would involve me taking a major pay cut (about $4-5 an hour, since I get no tips there), but I could walk to work, they'd be more flexible with my hours, and the job would be much less stressful. 

I love the people I work/worked with at both places, and even though management isn't on the same page as me at my current job, they were very nice and straightforward about fixing my scheduling problems because they don't want me to leave. (I just started in November.) As of last night I told them I would stay on, but even if I do, I still have to quit come May/June.

I'm really unsure of what to do, and could use some advice.

Thanks!"

He had been on the pursuit of a relationship. I didn't believe in dating sites and it became more of a way to apease my friends. They encouraged me to get out there and recommend that I try a site so I did. I was surprised to have a successful date with my ex and was even more surprised that something came of it so quickly. During the first two months of our relationship he was incredibly charming and I felt that he was ""the one."" He constantly showered me with romantic gestures and we shared a strong chemistry, however, he was incredibly understanding (or so I thought at the time) which is what I valued most at the time.



With a mutual understanding for one another and respect of the other, we divulged intimate details of our pasts. He disclosed that he was abused as a child by his father. He confided in me that he realized he had anger issues and took pride in the fact that he never resorted to physical violence like his father. I disclosed that I am bipolar and attempted suicide in my teens. We agreed that if we were ever to fight we would not revert to these vulnerable points, that is I would never refer to him as an ""angry"" person and he would not call me ""crazy"", ""insane"", ""psycho"", etc. due to their stigmatizing natures.



Time passed and our first fight occurred. ""No big deal"" I thought, this is inevitable. Then the fights increased. We told one another we were ""in love"" with the after only 2 weeks, so it is no surprise that we moved in together after 6 months of dating.



After moving in the fights escalated and his temper mounted. The charming individual I met who reeled me in with compassion and care slowly faded. Eventually the fights became the daily ritual sort of speak. Finally, he had broken our golden rule. When we fought he would resort to name calling.



Being unwarranted, I would be told things such as, ""you're a fucking bitch"", ""you're fucking insane"" and ""you're a fucking psycho."" References to my bipolar would be included as well such as, ""I guess I know what they mean when they say bipolar"" or ""is this some manic bullshit right now?"" or ""you should be fucking committed.""



It is important to note I am stable. I attend therapy regularly and am medication compliant. I am a gradute student at an ivy league school pursuing my degree in psychology and have an internship in which I work with my own clients. All of this I do successfully. If I were in any of the states he suggested then I would not be able to function at the neccessary levels to fulfill those obligations.



He also became incredibly controlling. He would often dicatate what I could or couldn't do by stating, ""stay home, I don't want you coming"", in reference to social events like brunch or going to a show with our friends. Whatever he would say would go. If I tried to inquiry or pursue the topic he would become aggressive. Things would include throwing items, for example he once kicked the trash can approximately 20 ft. across the room until it hit the wall on the opposite side and trash flew everywhere.



He also became incredibly critical. If I wore a tshirt around the house he would remark, ""Oh, I see you're dressing like a man today."" We live in a very cold area, yet during November and December he would make comments to me such as, ""Why don't you wear a tank top? It's more feminine. Don't you care if I'm attracted to you?""



I also was unaware that he would do cocaine at social events. The first time I saw him do it I addressed it and expressed my concern. He told me he would never do it again if it upset me. Fast forward to another event, saw him do it and mentioned that he had made a previous promise. He said, ""I only said that to shut you up about it. I'm going to do it if I want."" I expressed my concerns such as physical and legal implications and his reply was, ""how dare you judge me! You take medication every day. What's worse, doing coke sometimes or taking medications everyday that have a long list of possible side effects?"" I explained they are prescribed by a doctor and are necessary for my functioning and stability. He wouldn't have it. Coke was good and mood medications are the enemy to him.



This was only the surface of it all. The examples are infinite. Ultimately, it all boils down to the fact that he would revert to name calling and comments that were constant put downs. I was constantly invalidated as a person. On top of it all, they were all delivered to me in an aggressive manner. Everything was a shout or scream, a slammed door or an item thrown.



I would comply to every demand and complaint. I would change my clothes or stay home. I was made to believe that I was ""crazy"" and that ultimately I was at fault. I became desperate in making ""improvements"" in myself to save the relationship.



My improvements were actually things such as biting my tongue and walking on eggshells, but ultimately there were slight results. Things would improve and he would make comments such as, ""I am so happy things are changing"" and ""I have hope for the future.""



We had a fight and then the following day he broke up with me. While fighting he would often say to me, ""I'm done. We're over"". But the dust would settle and we would agree to forget it. When the final fight came I thought it was our typical vicious cycle. But this time he was serious.



We lived together, but he decided to break up with me via text message when he got to work that morning. I moved out within 4 days and he returned to the apartment.



In a way I am feeling relief. I am free from a critical eye and his aggression and temper. I am no longer subject to verbal, emotional and psychological abuse. I literally am free.



This is where I am currently struggling...


1. The vicious abuse cycle. Despite the abuse and negativity, I find myself missing him though I know and can rationalize why I shouldn't.
2. Within 2 days of our break up he created online dating accounts and within 5 days went on a date. I find this incredibly difficult to deal with.
3. We only broke up only 10 days ago, yet he is telling people it was 3+ weeks ago. This one I really struggle to understand. I don't know why he is doing this.



4. Lastly, I sent him a message the other day expressing my views on what I felt I did wrong in the relationship. (Two problems here... I know I shouldn't have contacted him AND I know I did nothing wrong. I shouldn't be expressing any remorses towards him). He said he didn't want contact with me anymore after that. Yet about 3 days before that he told me he thought I was a ""good and awesome person"" and ""I hope you don't hate me."" He initially was fixated on being viewed as a good person who I didn't hate. Now he wants absolutely no contact what-so-ever. I truly don't get this.


I have already decided to implement the 30 day no contact rule. I have unfriended him on social media and have no reminders of our relationship. My conflicts right now are internal and just trying to better understand his actions during this process.


I would appreciate any insights on this matter.

2tfn5k,5,2015-01-23,When Log-in overloads the whole database,[deleted],TalesFromProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromProgramming/comments/2tfn5k/when_login_overloads_the_whole_database/,"Before I begin let me preface this by saying that I love my job, and i think that my workplace is amazing. However everything has it's bad sides. Anyway onto the story.

I am a CS student who got an internship as a Java web developer at a quite large company with a basically newborn Java team (currently including me there are 4 Java developers). One of the projects I received was to maintain and modify a few things on an old(2005 era) web application of a certain company which we basically ""stole""(decompiled the existing application from it's .war file) because ""It's easier to reuse current code than to write everything from scratch"" a.k.a. ""business value"". The project was supposed to be done in 2 weeks but it took that long to get the decompiled version to even run and it took 4 months to complete the initially planned tasks.

One of the prominent issues was that every morning in between 7-12 AM the application would constantly crash. Actually, crash is a wrong word. It would hang and users would get no response when trying to log-in. Main suspect was DB calls so I placed logs before and after each method which queries the DB. While doing that I noticed a couple of odd things: 

1. Same calls we're performed twice during login, in two methods which were called in succession

2. There was one query which returned a list of items, and then iterated over all those items and called another query

I make a note to remove those duplicates in the future and I add the logs.I deploy the newly added logs into production, since locally I couldn't get it to hang and wait. Peak hour comes and I check the logs. To my surprise for some users queries lasted from 50-200 SECONDS! While Tomcat had a set timeout period of 30 seconds. So people tried logging in, query would hang and they'd get a timeout. Ok... but what the hell causes queries to last that long!?

I extract the query string with data of those users who took the longest, and execute it directly on the DB: it takes ~0.00009s, run it through the application: 45s. What the fuck!? Lemme check those query methods again.

So I open up the Dao and the Dao uses the old JdbcDaoSupport from Spring wherein you have a query method where you place the SQL string, parameters(if there are any) and a mapper with which you map query results to model objects. At first glance everything looks normal and for some unexplained reason I decide to trust that the mappers are implemented correctly because ""who would fuck up a mapper?"" and I focus my attention to the data source and DB connection itself. When that proved to be fruitless I fire up jvisualvm and run the application locally. I pick a ""heavy"" user and it takes him almost 30 seconds to log-in locally. I check the most called method and it's JdbcDaoSupport queryForObject method: a whopping ~24k calls! During log-in! So I go back to the query method and this time decide to check out the mappers, and I find this:

	public Object mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
		Account account = new Account();
		account.setAccountId(rs.getInt(""ACC_ID""));
		account.setAccountType(mapAccountType(rs.getString(""TYPE_ID"")));
		account.setAccountCardType(mapAccountCardType(rs.getInt(""CARD_TYPE"")));
        ....
		return account ;
	}

see those mapXY() methods? They're basically other mappers, each of which performs an additional DB call. A DB call for queries which have the form of ""SELECT * FROM [tableName]"". No WHERE clauses, just pure SELECT * queries, and they are being called for EVERY SINGLE ROW. Best thing is, some of those ""nested mappers"" have their own ""nested mappers"" within them. 

So to recap what happens during log-in:

1. A query is performed which fetches all of users accounts (which can range from 1 to over 300)
2. For each row a mapper is called, which in turn calls 3 other ""mappers"" which perform additional queries every time for every single row(no caching whatsoever)
3. After that is said and done, it iterates through all mapped accounts and performs a new query for other objects whose mapper also displays the same behavior from step 2
4. Steps 1-2-3 repeat one more time

And during peak hours the application reported around 2k-5k concurrent users per hour. An average user had ~11k during log-in so for 2k of them it's around 22million database calls in the span of an hour!

After rewriting a few queries to use joins, and caching those ""SELECT * FROM [tablename]"" queries I've managed to cut the number of database calls from up to 35k to 1 (or 4 when the cache expires which is every 30min) and all of a sudden the application stopped hanging and users (even the ""heavy"" ones) would log-in way faster, around 1-5 seconds as opposed to 20-200 seconds.

We live in a very cold area, yet during November and December he would make comments to me such as, ""Why don't you wear a tank top? It's more feminine. Don't you care if I'm attracted to you?""

I also was unaware that he would do cocaine at social events. The first time I saw him do it I addressed it and expressed my concern. He told me he would never do it again if it upset me. Fast forward to another event, saw him do it and mentioned that he had made a previous promise. He said, ""I only said that to shut you up about it. I'm going to do it if I want."" I expressed my concerns such as physical and legal implications and his reply was, ""how dare you judge me! You take medication every day. What's worse, doing coke sometimes or taking medications everyday that have a long list of possible side effects?"" I explained they are prescribed by a doctor and are necessary for my functioning and stability. He wouldn't have it. Coke was good and mood medications are the enemy to him.

This was only the surface of it all. The examples are infinite. Ultimately, it all boils down to the fact that he would revert to name calling and comments that were constant put downs. I was constantly invalidated as a person. On top of it all, they were all delivered to me in an aggressive manner. Everything was a shout or scream, a slammed door or an item thrown.

I would comply to every demand and complaint. I would change my clothes or stay home. I was made to believe that I was ""crazy"" and that ultimately I was at fault. I became desperate in making ""improvements"" in myself to save the relationship.

My improvements were actually things such as biting my tongue and walking on eggshells, but ultimately there were slight results. Things would improve and he would make comments such as, ""I am so happy things are changing"" and ""I have hope for the future.""

We had a fight and then the following day he broke up with me. While fighting he would often say to me, ""I'm done. We're over"". But the dust would settle and we would agree to forget it. When the final fight came I thought it was our typical vicious cycle. But this time he was serious.

We lived together, but he decided to break up with me via text message when he got to work that morning. I moved out within 4 days and he returned to the apartment.

In a way I am feeling relief. I am free from a critical eye and his aggression and temper. I am no longer subject to verbal, emotional and psychological abuse. I literally am free.

I am currently in a state of coming to terms with this. After months of name calling and using my bipolar inappropriately in the relationship, I am trying to reconcile with myself. I know that I take the appropriate measures to address my bipolar. I know that I am compliant and am doing well. It is a matter of fighting off the voice he planted in the back of my mind telling me, ""you have problems"", ""you aren't okay"", ""you fucking need help"", ""you're fucking crazy"", ""this is what the fuck bipolar is all about"".

tl;dr: Bipolar 25F broken up with by verbally abusive 30M. He became verbally, emotionally and psychologically abusive. Currently struggling with residual effects of the relationship... i.e. how name after name and comment after comment about having bipolar have become ingrained in my mind and overcoming this."
2tg8pw,1,2015-01-23,"[27/M] I've not dated in at least a decade, and I'd like to get on that horse again.",[deleted],OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/2tg8pw/27m_ive_not_dated_in_at_least_a_decade_and_id/,"This is a mystery which I've been mulling over for an unreasonable amount of time. I have finally come to the conclusion that I can't fix this on my own, and you guys are my very last resort here.

I'm from Singapore, born and raised and for the past 3 years, have been living in the US. I was incredibly popular with the girls in HS, but ever since I broke up with my last girlfriend when I was 16, I've never been able to get into another relationship. I've attempted several dates over the years and was never met with success.

Following the failures, I became a shut-in. I didn't give a shit, played videogames endlessly, and in the years between graduating HS and entering mandatory service with the army I was a relatively successful professional gamer in the Asia Pacific region. While in the Army, I also got to participate in a manhunt for a terrorist who wanted to blow up a train station full of US Navy sailors on shore leave. This was the time when I decided to start giving a shit. Before I enlisted, I was something like 400lbs. Of course, even the military couldn't work miracles on me and turn me into Rambo in just 2 years, but it was an ongoing process. I also decided to start making something of myself. Thankfully, my family is quite well-off and I could afford the change in scenery, so I decided to come stateside for college.

I've managed to do a ton of interesting stuff here. I got to volunteer and hang out with needy kids in West Baltimore schools, I got to intern for a prestigious defense think tank in London and also spend several months studying in the London School of Economics, I even managed to get aboard the process of being published before I graduate. Despite my successes, I still had none with women. I go to a liberal arts college where the political climate is decidedly liberal, and even though I considered myself a liberal, lots of people here deride me as a right-winger. I left my authoritarian homeland to pursue my higher education, for crying out loud. If I loved conservative politics so much, I wouldn't have come here.

It's not like I've had trouble with making friends. My circle of close friends include rednecks and veterans of the US military, but they're all dudes. I've also met plenty of women in college, but no success in even securing a date. I quote one of them verbatim, ""Sorry, ICanHasThrowAwayKek, you've just been friendzoned."" I was later told by a mutual friend that my reputation for frequently disagreeing with the liberal arts college groupthink made me an untouchable.

I won't lie either: I'm incredibly uncomfortable with my physical image. I'm 220lbs and 5'10 now, and I still work out once every 2 days whenever time allows me. My social media profile is more rife with memes than photos of myself because I deem myself as incredibly unattractive. My interests also lie disproportionately in current affairs, politics and videogames in that order.

Yeah, that makes me an unsalvageable nerd, doesn't it? I'm self-aware enough to know that.

If there's anything positive to say about myself, I've been told that I'm incredibly funny, but only those who get my sense of humor. ""Nothing is sacred; everything is trollable"" is my catchphrase and it really isn't for the easily offended. While I can easily share this with my male friends, the only woman I frequently talk to and share this sense of humor with is very much taken, and I also see her more as a sister than someone I'd date. I also don't publicly announce this, but I borrow the idea from Louis CK where “the only time you look in your neighbor's bowl is to make sure that they have enough. You don't look in your neighbor's bowl to see if you have as much as them.” It really pains my heart to see people in need of help and don't have the means to help themselves, and my wallet is always open to my trustworthy friend who need a leg up. 

I may be usually laid-back and lazy, I also work incredibly hard when I set my mind to something. Mandarin used to be my main language, but I wanted to play online games with other people without sounding like an idiot, so I put a ton of work into mastering English. I realized I accomplished that goal from the day I woke up after spending an entire day thinking in English, and an entire night dreaming in English. Today, I tell my professors that English is my second language and they call me a liar.

Additionally, I'm always the ""Dad"" of my 18-22 year-old friends. It's not like I'm an aggressive, assertive leader, but I'm typically the one with the most common sense. I also over-prepare on road trips or hikes with extra water, supplies and what not to make sure nothing screws up, or we won't be screwed if something bad happens. One of the fun things you get to learn in the Army, I guess.

I *have* tried OKC in the past, created a profile and all that but it has ended in failure. Got discouraged and deleted it. But I'd really like to try again, get into dating again - though I don't know how. Any help you guys can offer is greatly appreciated.

tl;dr - I'm a nerd with body image issues living alone in a foreign country. I don't lack friends, but finding a girlfriend would be nice."
2tgeh9,2,2015-01-23,F4M --- Roleplay based off TV/Movies. Ideas inside.,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2tgeh9/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, thick ass opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; This is the only roleplay where I could consider playing a canon character; Annie only. I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. 

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot! I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love but aren't necessary; anal, ass worship, rimming(giving/recieving), rough sex and dirty talk. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"

I am a Flyer's fan from VA),boylejc2,caps,https://www.reddit.com/r/caps/comments/2tgg9d/what_is_the_cheapest_place_to_find_a_ticket_ps_i/,"I am a Flyer's fan from Virginia who is currently working an internship in DC and really want to go to a Flyers vs. Caps game for a lot of reasons. First of all, I like seeing my team play (even when we are bad) and I usually don't get to that often. I am not from Philly and over the last four years I've only managed to see them twice. Second, this is probably the best matchup I'll have the chance to see in the foreseeable future (the other two games i went to were against the Sabres and @ the Canes).

I know you guys probably don't want to help an outsider invade the Verizon Center, but I am a broke college student who really wants to see a game and would rather not pay $65 for a ticket unless I absolutely have to. Specifically, I am looking at the February 8th game at 3:00, which the lowest cost I have seen usually ranges from $60-$65. Any sites where I might find cheaper tickets other than the usual sites, or is scalping them going to be cheaper? I am only looking for one as of now. Any help would be nice! "
2tght6,0,2015-01-23,"Chica, please!!",inspiredman,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2tght6/chica_please/,"When I first moved back to the city that I went to college in, most of my friends were already gone or in relationships. I had one Russian friend that was still in school and wanted to hang out with me.

My Russian friend and I would hang out almost every day, so we became very close bros. He was very supportive of my goals and we had a lot to talk about. That being said, we were very different. While he worked out all the time and valued being a ""man,"" I spent my spare time reading books and encouraging him to explore the city with me. Our values often clashed, but we both encouraged the other to explore new things and re-think our paradigms about life and people.

One of the things that we both agreed on was that we needed to branch out and meet new people. However, the problem was that my Russian friend was the stereotypical American image of a Russian. He said what was on his mind (with his thick Sochi Russian accent). He never cared if his words hurt people's feelings. He also was extremely loud and obnoxious around people that he didn't like. He really had to know you for him to open up and show his cool side. This characteristic of his meant that he was not the best person to make good impressions on strangers.

On the flipside, there was me. Talking to everyone and seeming like I was way too nice. So I made sure to do most of the talking if we did meet someone cool that could become our fourth member (Russian guy had one other friend who'd sometimes hang out with us).

So one day, we were out shooting a video. After we finished, we ended up stopping by a Cosi's near campus to get some dinner. The staff at the Cosi's and I really hit it off, and we were all laughing and talking about funny stuff while I was ordering. I realized that they could become some of our new friends. So I exchanged numbers with them after telling them that I was looking for more people to hang out with our little group.

When we were leaving the Cosi's, I saw another worker sitting outside, taking a smoke. I don't think he was inside when I was bonding with the other staff members, but since the interaction with the other Cosi's staff went so well, I decided to exchange contact with him too. Another new friend, right? So I went up to him with my Russian friend and told him the same thing that I told the other workers in the restaurant.

So he gave me his number and I texted him mine.

When we walked off, my Russian friend uttered to me one of his trademark utterances. 

""You know that guy is gay, right?"" he said. ""He thinks you're hitting on him.""

I grew up in a very traditional household in China, so I have no ""gay-dar."" (please pardon that expression if it's no longer a PC thing to say in America now). I assumed my Russian guy was just being mean to a guy like he usually is with most people. He, being Russian, also thinks most effeminate guys are ""gay."" The guy he was calling gay was kind of a skateboarder-looking dude, so he wasn't a big, bulky Russian-looking person.

""I don't think so,"" I told him. ""And even if he were gay, so what? I made it clear to him that we were just looking for more people to chill with.""

So all the other workers at Cosi's got back to me immediately with standard texts like, ""Nice to meet you! Let's definitely chill sometime."" But this worker outside didn't text me his number immediately.

Two days later, when I was at my internship, I finally get a text from him.

""What do you want to do with your life?"" the text asks. At this point, I get a little suspicious. After all, whenever a guy gets a girl's number, he's always waiting two days before texting her. Being a guy, I've never been on the receiving end. Maybe I'm just overthinking and being biased by my Russian friend's words, I thought to myself.

So I tell him about my internship and my long term goals to make the world a better place.

A few hours later, he texts me back.

""Chica please!"" he wrote flirtatiously. ""You can't make the world a better place by working at [the tv station I was at] ;) but I share your goals. I want to go into education.""

So I kind of laugh at this text, and I realize that my Russian friend was right. This guy, because he wasn't in the restaurant when I connected with the other Cosi workers, did get the wrong impression. This type of ""neg"" that he was doing is standard texting banter from a guy.

When I got home and told my Russian friend about this text, he just laughed for two minutes straight. Now, two years later, he still cracks up at this incident.

""That guy called you 'Chica,'"" my Russian friend always reminds me. ""He probably thought you were going to be on the bottom. You need to work out with me, dude! That'll stop these incidents.""

So as much as I wanted my Russian friend to be more politically correct with what he says, this incident that happened two years ago is always justification for him to continue his crazy Russian-talking.

I never texted that guy back because I knew that if I did, he'd really get the wrong impression. Don't know what happened to him and whether he did go into education.

TLDR: was trying to make new friends, but one of the guys texted me something flirtatious because he thought that I was gay."
2tgxkh,171,2015-01-23,"Me [19 M] with my mom [60's F] - I received an internship offer, accepted it, and now she doesn't want me to go through with it. Am I being selfish?",JohnYo55,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tgxkh/me_19_m_with_my_mom_60s_f_i_received_an/,"Hi hoping you guys could tell me what is the proper thing to do here..

Relevant background info: I am a 19 year old sophomore in a competitive CS program at a fairly large college in the United States. Earlier in the fall, I received an offer to fly across the country for an interview for a software engineering internship. I went and received an offer for a position at company X (fairly big name, not exactly a software company though, relevant later). Not trying to brag, was pretty lucky I got it in the first place.  
&amp;nbsp;

I applied to a bunch of places last fall, attended my schools career fair, got my resume critiqued on /r/cscareerquestions (great resource for those of you out there!) and put a lot of time and effort into trying to get an internship this summer. I received maybe 5-6 interviews, with only one offer. Again, I flew down, was really impressed, and decided to accept the internship.  
&amp;nbsp;
 
I did NOT tell my parents that I had accepted the offer because, well, I didn't think it would matter and I was focusing on finals. I thought they would be happy. A month later, it came up. I did tell them I received an offer, though. I put a lot of work into this and, frankly, I wanted this opportunity.  They drove me to and from the airport, wished me luck, and that was that. I figured they would be happy for me to receive an offer.  
&amp;nbsp;

Now, my mom is telling me to go to my schools winter career fair because she doesn't want me to go (and intern) at this company because it is located far away. Think Massachusetts to Texas. She wants me to stay in my home state and try to find an internship there.  
&amp;nbsp;
  
I don't want to for a number of reasons:  


* I don't have time (it took a lot of time last semester and I am taking 2 big CS courses now that take up a lot of time) to look for new internships


* I already have an offer with a big company, good pay, free housing, etc.


* I am only a sophomore, a lot of places are looking for juniors. It is also very hard to even pass an interview (for me at least) even if a company is looking for sophomores. After I take the 2 courses this semester, I think it will get better. 


* My state does not have a lot of CS jobs in my local area. A few of the ones I applied to were in my home state and I (obviously) did receive an offer. I would have to commute. At the internship I accepted, I would also receive free transportation.


* This company would look great on my resume (a minor reason, any place would) and I do want to intern there. The only downside is that it is shorter (2-3 weeks) than most internships.


* My university is very competitive. Most sophomores (in my program) I know do have jobs but a lot of people are still looking.
 
* Assuming I do look and find an internship in my home state, my parents would probably make me live at home with them. I have not told my parents this but last summer, when I was living at home, I was somewhat depressed. My SO (whom I have been dating for 16 months now) describes it as ""not being in a good, healthy state of mind"" partly because my mom and I were always fighting. I then got mad at my SO (which I regret very much) and things kinda spiraled from there. That's a separate issue that is pretty much resolved.

* I have already accepted the offer and going back on that would be very not-okay. I have heard ""recruiters talk"" meaning my recruiter could very easily become my next hiring manager or tell my next hiring manager what I did.. Maybe accepting was a mistake on my end but after not receiving an offer and then finally receiving one at the last minute (in terms of Fall recruiting), I wanted it.   


She continues to want to control most things I do while I think this is a great opportunity. NOTE: SHE IS PAYING FOR MY TUITION AT COLLEGE. BUT this offer would make me a decent chunk of money (not saying I could pay for my tuition), so I don't see why that is an issue.  
&amp;nbsp;


The college I attend is in my home state and she just wants me to stay there and find work. I don't think I can for the reasons listed above. Everyone I know, excluding my family, is very happy for me and wants me to go with the one I have.   
&amp;nbsp;

Sorry if I came across mean/arrogant in the post, I'm trying to provide all the details :/.  

Should I keep looking for internships? Am I being selfish for not wanting to look for new offers? Is she?  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


EDIT1:
&amp;nbsp;


Her argument is that: no one cares about me as much as her and that they told me they didn't want me to go out of state this summer back in October. The interview was in October.


When I saw that there were no internships nearby in my state, I told them that. They said ""well still check it out blah blah blah"" but never gave me a solid answer.
&amp;nbsp;


EDIT2:
&amp;nbsp;


My mom just texted me. She said she doesn't want me to go out of state this summer. I asked why. She said ""no, nothing out of state until your 21. I don't know how much supervision there will be, probably none. You are not old for an experience like that""
&amp;nbsp;


EDIT3: ""I do not know what kind of people you will be around, you think you are worldly (what?) but you are not"".

EDIT4: She thinks this internship will have no impact on my career because it's early and I am only 19. She wants compromise and me to attend something close. I can't win.

WTF DO I SAY TO THAT.. Anything?

2tgzkc,6,2015-01-23,My [22F] boyfriend [25 M] of 1 year is so lazy I'm not sure I want a future with him.,overhandthrow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tgzkc/my_22f_boyfriend_25_m_of_1_year_is_so_lazy_im_not/,"I don’t know what to do about my relationship. My boyfriend is lazy and whatever the opposite of diligent, pro-active, determined and disciplined is. We’re both in school right now. I have my career figured out and I have a good start so that’s taken care of, but we have no idea what he’s going to do after he graduates and he doesn’t seem too eager to figure it out. I want to give him some time, because maybe he’s just a late bloomer, but I’ve been dating him for a year and I haven’t seen much progress. I don’t need him to be rich or anything, but I don’t want to have to provide for him. Plus he has much more expensive tastes than I do, which doesn’t suit his career prospects very well. I’m not sure I can live with the burden of being a main provider, or even the likelihood of becoming the main provider. 

I just wish he could be self-sufficient. He has never worked full-time so I don’t know if he can hold a job. Well, he had a full-time internship once but he quit after a month because he said he would go insane if he stayed there. Then he took some time off and went back to school for another degree, and a few years later, here he is. He had to change his major because his grades weren’t good enough and then went through a few options that didn’t work out because they were either too much work or not interesting enough or something of that sort. Last spring, he said he wanted to find a part time job for the coming term. After a few weeks, he finally got started on his resume but never finished it until the end of the year (two terms later) because I made him finish it. I also talked to him about how he needs to get things done and how it worries me about our future. He agreed that he should get things done because he doesn’t like being lazy and he wants our relationship to work out.
 
I don’t want to nag him and I don’t want to try to change him, ever. That never goes well. I often remind him at times when it seems like he’s slacking too much but I don’t want to have to do that. I want him to do something because he decides to do it. The problem is if things (without a school deadline) were left up to him they never get done. It’s not like he’s super busy. He spends so much time watching shows and playing games, or just browsing. And it’s not like he’s stupid. He’s had teachers comment on how much more he could achieve if only he put some effort into it. I feel so hopeless. He wants to have a good career obviously, but doesn’t have the discipline or work ethics to do what it takes. It doesn’t help that most of his friends are rich kids who go out and have fun all the time. He doesn’t have the luxury to live like them. Right now he’s just living on student debt and whatever his parents give him. I wouldn’t suggest abandoning his friends or anything, they’re nice people. I just hope he really understands what it means to not be able to just inherit a source of income but have to build one for himself. 

I think I made it pretty clear that I’m not ok with him being a slacker when I talked to him a month ago about his habits. According to him, he’s more hard-working now. He finally applied for a few part time jobs, which is great. He hasn’t heard anything back yet, and when I said he should apply for more, he agreed, but I fear as usual that most of his spare time is going to be spent watching shows and playing games. There’s nothing wrong with watching shows and playing games. It just bothers me because it keeps him from doing the things he needs to do.  

Sometimes I get depressed thinking about this relationship. Did I work so hard to set up my own life so that someone else can mooch off of me later? Am I selfish for thinking that? I've always worked hard and will probably always work hard given the career I've chosen, so it's hard to watch someone be so lazy and think about making a life with him. Maybe I just don’t love him enough. Maybe if I loved him more, I wouldn’t mind the likelihood of having to provide for him. 

I guess I’m in a waiting phase right now. I’ve just talked to him a month ago about this issue and he has taken some action. How long is too long to wait? What kind of outcome should I be looking for anyway? I’m sure lots of people don’t have their life figured out, which is perfectly fine, but I wish he would try a little harder. I wish he cared a little more. We could be so happy and so comfortable together but his laziness really dulls my outlook on this relationship.

Has anyone been in or know of a similar situation? How did it turn out? What kind of compromises had to be made? 

TL;DR: My boyfriend’s laziness is killing me.

So I just finished my first semester in college and I saw a lot of other guys who had their shit together on the social, academic, and professional scene. Call it a mix of jealousy and admiration, but I felt like I wanted the same power over my life. I wanted to stick to my goals for a change. I wanted to learn to talk to girls---or really anyone for that matter. I wanted the confidence to speak my mind or pursue that internship. I wanted to be alpha!

The alpha-beta dichotomy aside, I've tried this before I heard of NoFap; I explored the link between PMO and how confident I felt talking to other people my first semester. I found it easy to cut out PMO completely the first month of the semester, probably due to the influx of new activities and (more likely) the caution I had to take while adjusting to a roommate. My 4-week abstinence went something like this:

Week 1: Confident in talking to other guys, made a bunch of friends. Easily talked to girls I wasn't obviously sexually attracted to. Awkward with the gorgeous girls I felt self-conscious around.

Week 2: Rushed a fraternity, confidence was through the roof. Got to meet a lot of new people, and even received a bid! (My reasoning was that by surrounding myself with people *more* socially adept than me, I'd be challenged to keep up and learn from them.) Hit and miss with the ladies, some days I felt cool and collected but other days I felt flustered and awkward. 

Week 3: Not so great. Started feeling a little less happy. More irritable. Had a 50-50 chance of having a confident day versus an awkward day. **In some ways I felt what I now know is a flatline, but never for more than a day at a time, and it was completely random.**

Week 4: Noticed that I would not feel so inconsistent if I was still fapping. **PMO'd and didn't think much of it.**

Then the PMO steadily increased in frequency, from one a week to once every three days---and by the end of the semester, I was back to doing it daily. Oh, boy...

So now I'm returning from winter break and starting my second semester, and a little over a week ago I discovered NoFap. Thought I should share my expectations and goals with you guys:

**EXPECTATIONS AND GOALS**

- I expect to feel either really good, or like utter shit, and be ready to handle the highs and lows. I expect that my recovery is going to be unpredictable because I can't possibly fathom how much damage I did during my 5-year PMO binge.

- I expect to regain control of this addiction and gain willpower as I prove to myself I can conquer such deeply-ingrained urges.

- I expect to take a good, hard look at myself during my reboot.

- I don't expect my reboot to take some finite number of days.


**OBSERVATIONS AT THE 10-DAY MARK**

- I didn't realize how putting my hands down my pants idly was such a terrible habit!

- The first two days were the worst, and I battled some intense urges.

- I'm feeling great right now, but I'm also really uncertain as to when or if or for how long I'll flatline.

- I found that imagining there's some stern, gruff, manly inner voice that springs up to encourage me every time a sexual fantasy pops into my head. I also imagine there's a more sinister voice telling me to give in to my desires and fap. Neither voice communicates with the other, and both are talking to me. I don't know why but putting on these mental theatrics really helps me process my emotions. 
Eventually I come to a conclusion and say it aloud:
*""Yeah, I could touch my junk right now, as I've been doing for the past 5 years. It's the same old feeling every time. Y'know what? It's not even fun anymore. I got better things to do.""*

It's definitely more drawn out than a simple NO but it seems to be working for me.

Do you guys have any observations of your own journeys or cool coping strategies?

2thuc0,3,2015-01-24,"21F with 21M, ~2. Is this college relationship becoming dead weight? (Sorry, it's long.)",Lurkers_Companion,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2thuc0/21f_with_21m_2_is_this_college_relationship/,"I've been with 'Todd' for a little less than two years; since halfway through our second year of college. We've never fought, we share most of our interests, and we have talked about building a future together. 


But it's on this part that I have doubts. Even though we have wonderfully compatible personalities and tastes, I am not sure that Todd has the motivation to be the lifetime partner I would prefer.


Some background on me: I am a senior, graduating in May. I work as an RA at my university, and I intern in the housing department. I recently was offered a part-time job there as well, which should lead directly to a good position post-graduation. I take 5 classes a semester, and have a 3.3GPA.


Even though we have been going to college for the same amount of time, Todd is not graduating this May with me. He never wanted to go to college, and failed out his first semester due to depression and a learning disability. (Note: He does see a therapist, and is on Ritalin and Prozac.) 


Classes have always been a struggle for him, and he only takes a few a semester, usually starting with four and then dropping one when it gets too hard, or if he feels it will not be a good fit. We took one class together, and I pretty much wrote his final for him because he couldn't do it.


Since the beginning, I have tried to maintain that his academic stuff is his business and that I will help when I need to but otherwise leave him to it. But we go to a school that is fairly well known for its disability accommodation and academic support center. He has a writing tutor, a note-taking service, and a tutoring center available if he chooses to use them, but he never has. 


Furthermore, he has recently started talking about quitting school and ""taking a break."" I am trying to talk him out of it, because I know that if he does he will never finish his degree.


On top of that, there is tension over his job. He works a few times a month at a local club with his friends, taking tickets and making sure no one is smoking in the venue. He isn't paid very much, he is rarely paid on time (often late), and he has to deal with some really nasty concert-goers. 


He often does not have money for us to go out with, which has led to some embarrassing situations when he tries to pay for something small and his card is denied. This New Year’s we went up to visit some of my friends, and they were asking me beforehand if he would be able to pay for his own meals and offering to help me cover for him. Luckily his check came through and we were fine, but it was a lot of pressure on me. 

I am always ready to cover my own expenses, and his if needed. It sounds so mercenary to bring the relationship down to money, but in our two years about 70% of expenses have been paid for by me.


Because he does get frustrated with his job and low funds, I made the suggestion that he try for some of the available on-campus jobs this semester. He was very interested when I told him about the openings, but even though he said he would check them out, he never did. I asked a few times if he was going to go, but he told me that he was happy with his current job because he could hang out with his friends. After that I resolved not to ask about it again.


The only sign that he does have any aspirations for the future is his recent progress in starting a voice acting career. Part of the reason why he had no money over the holidays was because he bought himself an expensive new microphone in a Cyber Monday sale. He has been recording himself reading posts on the voice acting subreddit, reading some books about voice acting, and claims to be saving up for lessons. 

I admire that he has this passion, but can’t help feeling that it’s ‘too little, too late.’ He says that it is what he wants to do for a career, and mentions that it would be fun to work from home and be a stay-at-home dad.


I have nothing against stay-at-home parents. I was raised by a stay-at-home dad. But I have always wanted a partnership where both parents work full-time. My mother struggles with being the main breadwinner of our family, and my dad does not live to his full potential. I dread that I will end up in the same sort of marriage that my parents have, and end up resenting my husband for not ‘doing his share’. 


I’m reaching the point of my life where all I can think of is what sort of future I want to have. I want to live a practical life, within my means. The only thing I hope for is to find a life partner who will love me and take equal responsibility for our happiness. I love Todd so much, and I do not think I could ever find someone else who is as kind and funny and understanding of all my faults. I know that much of the conflict in this relationship is my fault. I shouldn’t be always paying for things, even if it’s just soap because he’s run out and I’m at the store. And I shouldn’t have taken the initial approach of keeping our affairs separate, because they can’t be in a committed relationship. I am not sure if I want to call off our relationship or try to fix it. But right now I have no idea what might happen after my graduation if he does not return to school. At best, I imagine that he will live with his parents and go back to working at Walmart until his voice acting career gets off the ground. But that could take ages, and I am not sure if I can wait that long.

**tl;dr**: I love my boyfriend, but the difference in our ambition may be the end of our relationship."
2thxxw,4,2015-01-24,I hit my father right before family prayer today,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2thxxw/i_hit_my_father_right_before_family_prayer_today/,"Throwaway because I'm a regular user here otherwise and I'm ashamed. 

So...context. 

In fall of 2011 I went away for university. The name of university is rather famous state one, didn't go to that one, or the sister one in the major metropolitan city I live in, went to a shitty cheap sister uni. 

During the course of that semester I got into a depressive funk. 

Which isn't too big a deal, suicidally everything I researched is expensive(I'm not spending a god damn penny on killing myself, I'm not worth the it), painful (significant amount of my life is avoiding immediate physical pain as much as possible), messy, and/or dramatic. If I was to kill myself I'd set up so no one would notice I'm gone for at least half a year. So that never was a consideration outside of convoluted cartoonish plans, like becoming president.

I randomly get depressive funks, ever since middle school, usually triggered about thinking too much about my life and how things work out for others and the way they work for me. Well at least then.(its annoying that I can't escape even temporarily, alcohol only helps with one heavy drink, more than that I become hyper aware and sad, weed just makes me hyper aware...)  It has many effects, one of them is that my motivation to wake up and do what needs to be done outside of fear. Fear of what you say? Just general natural fear of parents many people have when young. So they'd wake me up, I'd go to school do my shit go home, do hw, sleep repeat. Sprinkle in laziness, procrastination, and clever lies. 

When I went away to ,depressive funk happened, 0.7 GPA, and got caught before I could lie, was  pulled out and sent to local community college.  Finished community, commute to college. I'm on my senior year. 

My parents were bitching at me that they can't trust me to get an internship outside of my commute in the summer, because they think I cant wake up on my own, because I don't do it for class. I don't do it for class because I don't make money from the work I have to do there so I have zero motivation to go somewhere that makes me do something I don't want to do without any satisfactory usable immediate reward. I used to work fast food, had no trouble getting up for it. Then they complained about my disorganized messiness. Its not that disorganized, its more unaesthetic and annoying to look at. Which is what I say. They say I have no plan, I say I do, it just..ugly. Unfolded clothes being left on floor doesn't mean their bad or dirty and too lazy to keep away, their just clothes I've worn once I want to keep away from the clean unworn clothes, where on the floor they are indicative of how many wears its been. (They do laundry very often too, every two days, whereas I have a shitton of clothes, I'd only really need to do laundry twice a month once I get through two or three wears on every single T-shirt, and enough wears on my pants, but their patience is low, so they always do my laundry). Sometimes clothing gets left behind by accident. 

They then say I have an answer for everything, which I cannot understand why is a bad thing. 

Now preface, I know I'm lazy, disorganized, bad memory, and messy. 

But then my dad does something that pisses me off. They I'm planless, which isn't so bad, but then my dad says stuff like my laundry is what happened in my failed uni semester. Then he concocts up a whole scenario story of what happened. Which I stay screamingly denying, reiterating my depressive funk. 

Then of course my parents say the delusional thing of asking why I didn't tell them. I had told them in the past of which they have typically replied I have nothing to be depressed about. They also complained I never call or communicated to them of which I reply I don't even like giving hugs or receiving hugs, expecting a daily phone call from me  is a bit retarded to expect. My parents also believe that most parent child relationships contain no adversarialness or lying or yelling whatsoever because my parents are fucking morons who believe the bragging lies fellow parents told about their own child, while my parents only mentioned negative (though true, so I don't mind) shit about me. Optimism like that is sickening. 

Then my dad keeps concocting his story of how I failed uni, and I get so pissed I punched him. Multiple times. Screaming i do not like lies made up about me. I have been tempted to do so for several years, but this is the first time I did it.

 Now granted I'm weak as shit, according to an arcade punch machine, a six year old has more power than me, and I have lost to 3 year old in arm wrestling...even using two arms against one. I'm pretty sure I did zero damage. I am a 21 year old man.

I apologized after, and my dad did apologize in the prayer for irritating me.  

I feel really fucking guilty for punching my dad though.

Thank God I don't live in old testament times, I deserved to be stoned. 

What do I do?"
2ti364,27,2015-01-24,"Me [27 F] with my Fiance [28 M] together for four years, he thinks he's constantly being taken advantage of by me while I feel completely emotionally neglected",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ti364/me_27_f_with_my_fiance_28_m_together_for_four/,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. This is really long, I really appreciate ANYONE and EVERYONE who take the time to read it. 



I want to start by saying that I don't think my fiance is a bad person or anything even remotely close to that. We appear to have some major communication issues and it leaves me feeling incredibly insecure in our relationship and I'm kind of at my wit's end here. 



Here is goes: I have obvious issues but I've always been really open about my flaws, however, my fiance and I have always been pretty compatible overall. Recently, I left my job (after discussing it with my fiance first) so I could go back to school full time. Since then, our relationship seems to be getting worse and worse and I'm not sure how to handle it. 



Background: I'v always been financially independent and for the majority of our relationship, I've worked longer hours (voluntarily - I loved my job) and made more money. He's an incredibly hard worker and so am I and that's something we're proud of one another for. School has always been really important to both of us and recently, I made the decision to go back full time and finish up with his blessing. It's been an amazing intellectual experience for me and I have a pretty full plate taking a full time course load with research internships and other resume boosting activities (committee memberships, etc.) and I still try to work when I can but it's difficult to do with everything else. I have student loans and I can pay my portion of rent every month while my fiance helps me out with groceries and other misc. items. This has been our situation for about 8 months and I definitely think it plays a role in our current issues. 



I've always been more emotionally available than my fiance and while I never doubted his feelings for me (I'm starting to however...), he's never been big on telling me how he feels. 



Our engagement was weird and I kind of feel like l forced him into it unintentionally. I was really pushy (I know, it's bad) because he would tell me how he wanted to be together forever but didn't think marriage was important. I didn't have health insurance so to me, if marriage wasn't important to him but it was to me and if he saw himself being with me long term then why not get married to reap the benefits? He gave in eventually but it was really stressful from my perspective (he broke off the engagement once because he ""wasn't ready"" then later kind of backtracked and still hasn't given me a solid answer as to why) and I still feel very insecure about the whole situation even though he assures me it's what he wants and has even said that he ""needed to be pushed"". 



The problems: I'm typically at school for upwards of 10 hours a day while he rarely works over 8. Once I'm home, I typically still have homework to do or other school related things and he doesn't bring any work home ever so when he's off work, he goes straight for the video games which is fine, he worked all day, go ahead and relax; I would do the same if I didn't have homework. 



However, I'm a pretty messy person. I try to work on it but honestly, after coming home and still having a mountain of work to do, the last thing I want to do is wash dishes or spend 40 minutes cleaning. Again, I try to do it when I can, I recognize it as an issue, and I'm working on it but I know it's something I'm shitty about. This freaks my fiance out. Anytime he has to my dishes or just general ""picking up"", he goes off into this rant about how he feels like my maid and I don't respect him and I'm taking advantage of him and has even accused me of not cleaning to purposely upset him. It blows my mind. 



I've tried explaining to him that it's nothing personal and lately, I've made a very hard effort to just put down my work and help out when he asks. He says that if I would just fix this, our relationship would be perfect (I think it's obviously more complicated but he can't see this...). It's a huge source of strain in our relationship and while I feel like because I have more work to do (even if Im not getting paid for it), he shouldn't be so harsh about ""equal labor"" since his free time is a lot more common than mine. This upsets him and he accuses me of not taking his time seriously which isn't the case; it's just that I have deadlines for my things that I bring home and the video games don't really have that same urgency... 



The problem is that while he constantly brings up this idea of me taking advantage of him, I feel totally emotionally neglected. For example, I send him texts throughout the day about what's happening, what I'm excited/sad/scared about, etc. (normal conversational shit) and I NEVER get responses. It sounds so petty and ridiculous but it really bothers me and I've told him it bothers me and there's never any change; I feel like my life isn't interesting to him. However, it's not just with petty shit like ignored texts. 



My breaking point happened today. I've been getting really insane headaches lately (like legit have gone from normal to migraines to weird ""cluster like"" headaches) over the past year. Today I had a really bad one and I might be a baby but when I don't feel well, it really comforts me to have someone around, especially when the headaches are so painful that it scares me. Lying down was making it worse so I was kind of wandering throughout the house and he kept telling me to just ""go to bed"" even when I kept telling him that would make it worse. 



I asked him to just come in and sit with me for a bit and read to me, I thought it might be comforting and help me to relax. He's weirded out but agrees; he starts reading for 5 minutes then tells me he doesn't feel like it anymore and is going to go back into the other room and play video games. I get annoyed and he just restates that he doesn't feel like it so he leaves. 



Okay, fast forward to about 30 minutes later; I go into our bathroom to try and take a hot bath to help and while I'm in there he hears me and comes inside to check on me. I ask him if he wouldn't mind trying to massage my shoulders to get some of the tension out and he takes one hand and massages one side while browsing his phone with the other hand. I ask him to use both hands to apply more pressure and he gets annoyed but does it. Great. 



I get out of the bath and ask him if he wants to lay down with me and when he says he doesn't feel like it and is going to go back and play more video games, I get irritated and kind of go into a little mini rant about how I hate having to beg him to take care of me when I feel like shit, etc. He responds my saying that I'm acting like I'm ""crippled"" and ""helpless"" and that if I really needed his help, he'd know it but now he can tell that I'm only doing it for attention... I bring up that when he gets sick (like when he spent all night throwing up after drinking when he's not a big drinker to begin with) and his response is yes, ""but I didn't need you to wipe my ass"". 



That's where I'm at. He came into bed about two hours ago (when he was done playing video games), was confused as to why I wouldn't cuddle with him, then shortly fell asleep afterwards. 



Am I really asking too much by wanting help and maybe a little bit of ""babying"" when I feel like my head is going to explode? I guess the bigger issue is that he claims I'm taking advantage of him but I feel like I'm literally a burden and any favor I ask is me being completely unreasonable while me not complying with his favors are me taking advantage of him. Advice? 



I've brought all of these issues up; he seems to have a really bad problem with admitting his faults and lately, I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.



He VERY RECENTLY admitted that he has an issue with feeling unfairly treated and he realizes it may not be accurate but in previous fights, he has basically ""taken"" this back and tells me he just said it to end the fight but he doesn't really feel that way. So obviously, I have a weird trust issue when he says things and a fear that he doesn't really mean them. This was also recently addressed and we talked about it and even made some jokes about it so things seemed better then today happened and it just makes me feel like shit. I don't feel like he understands how what he does could be hurtful. 

---   
**tl;dr: Fiance thinks I take advantage of him because I don't clean up but doesn't see an issue with ignoring me when I'm sick. That's probably a super biased summary but it's late and I feel mentally and emotionally exhausted. Advice please.**"

This is one of my first posts on this site, so I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for it.

Just last month, I graduated from my university with a degree in Computer Science and since then have been looking for a job. A company just recently made me a very attractive offer, but they are located in San Francisco (I am in Washington). Obviously, Silicon Valley is where a large part of engineering jobs are located and at my age now would be the time to get my foot in the door, so to speak.

However, I am terrified of being alone in a big city, and this isn't normal nerves that accompany a big change. I have always been very bad at making friends, and it took nearly my entire life to make the few I do have. In San Francisco, I would be completely alone, and I am not confident in my ability to change that. Activities that are supposed to help with meeting people, like joining clubs and the like, have never really worked with me. I can communicate with people fine, but as soon as it comes to making any sort of deep connection I consistently fail.

Over last summer, I had a tech internship (in-state). Even then I was feeling incredibly lonely and mildly depressed, but at least I was able to see my family and few friends over the weekends. With this new job, though, I will be completely alone.

I really don’t want to return to the loneliness and dark thoughts I had been experiencing over the summer, but I feel like rejecting the offer would be essentially me chickening out on my career. I’m not sure how to preserve my mental health without giving up this job and would really love to hear another perspective.

**tl;dr**:  I have a great job offer in San Francisco, but am too afraid of being alone to take it."

Nonetheless I still really enjoyed my long interview with BDO and I was very surprised when they called and told me the amount they were offering.

They offered over 3000 in bonus, as well as 28 an hour with 1.5x overtime after 40 hours.

If I decline PWC's internship now, will that break my chances later with them if I decided to apply for a fulltime job?"
2tifqh,13,2015-01-24,"[Discussion] Walk the last mile with me, please.",spamalama,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/2tifqh/discussion_walk_the_last_mile_with_me_please/,"Hi!
I'm new to this subreddit. I need some motivation, and I figured this is the place to get some. I am writing my story so maybe others can get motived as well, and also to procrastinate a little bit until I feel bad enough to continue my work.

Almost six years ago I decided to turn my life around and start studying engineering, after having spent six pointless years in graphic design and advertising. In retrospect the reasons I got into THAT particular corner in the first place were some suboptimal circumstances (that were out of my control but affected me nonetheless) combined with my lack of knowledge about what I wanted in life. 

That changed when I met my future wife, and it made me realize how screwed up my situation was: No net worth, bad jobs, long hours, little pay. My wife made me realize that I want a family, which before was not even an option in my mind. So I started my path in engineering to turn things around. First stop: Workshop internship. It was awesome!

I really hauled some ass and tried to get the optimal solution out of it. At first there was zero income for me. I couldn't get a job that would allow me to study at the same time. My wife (then fiancee) had a secure job that could support the both of us for a little while. After a few months, a small scholarship that's part interest-free loan came my way to ease things. Lots of paperwork, but hey, free money! Then I got my grades for the first semester: Best of class. I applied for a bigger, full grant, scholarship. All the while working student jobs that opened up as I collected top grades. Those grades didn't just come to me, I worked as much as I did in advertising, at times even more. I also got engaged in student parliament activities, that came in handy for the bigger scholarship. Because this time it was for ME, and not some company. After a year in the application process, I got the bigger scholarship - on probabtion so to speak, because my grades needed to remain top 10% of the class, and I was required to do volunteer work aside from studying. All the while I was STILL working 10 hours a week. 

Then it hit me. BAM! Burnout. Panic attacks. Impending sense of DOOOOOOM! Today I realize that it was tripped off by some food poisoning, and the whole house of cards came crashing down - or so I thought. It took a loooong time but I got better. I took a step down from my studies, dropped the job, continued student parliament. Grades dropped a little, but it's amazing how much my fellow students supported me and took work off my hands that I was DEMANDING to do myself before, to better control the outcome and secure that big scholarship. Things started to look better. 
We finally got married. Then we had a kid. Boy, was that exciting! And a lot of work. I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis as a zombie, basically. Working by day, being a daddy at night. This time I did not collapse. I had a little person depending on me. That kept me going. And going! 

The scholarship was eventually finalized - even raised because of my offspring. I continued working at the place I wrote my Bachelor's at. 
I am now finalizing my Master's Thesis paper in engineering and have a job secured that I can enter whenever I am done with this. I've added three years of practical experience to my resume in this company and the new job is everything I was looking for. Maybe I could have bargained for more pay but hey - why get greedy when I reached my goal. 

My final student income with my side job and scholarship was 1.7 times higher (net) than what I got for my last position in advertising. That's how big of an improvement it already was ON THE WAY THERE!

Debt will be paid off within the year. Kid is a bright little smartass, all worth all the hassle. I would do this again. Maybe change a few details here and there, but all that can only be learned by WALKING THAT ROAD. Walking it for ALMOST SIX YEARS. 

I am tired. I got a good draft going. I have two days until the final talk-through in the company. Printing two days after. Hand in, another two days. Then it is only a 15 to 30 minute interview, and it is all over. I can't believe that it is OVER. No more studing on the weekends. No more lock-ins for tests. No more tests in the back of my head during the few days I dare take a break. Now I get 30 vacation days a year. I have no idea what to do with that time. And I get a 40 hour week. Wait what - I get a routine now?

So I got everything I bargained for. And yet I am on page 70 of 100 (so far), still missing the conclusion and the correcting of about 30 pages, plus final formatting. And I can't bring myself to get going. 

Help me get motiveted. Help me walk the last mile. I am almost completely there. 

EDIT: 100 pages, not 10

EDIT 2: Down to about 10 remaining pages. You guys got me going, thank you!

EDIT 3: Done. One last round of small corrections (yay red pen madness), put together a CD (yes those still exist), and fill out some paperwork. I can do that in my coffee break. IS this really happening?"
2tikfa,1,2015-01-24,Suffered from on/off depression for years,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2tikfa/suffered_from_onoff_depression_for_years/,"I have suffered from on and off depression for years. I am currently a male who is 20, and in my second year of college, however I live at home.

My depression started back around when I was 13. I remember, because I was taking a vacation to Busch Gardens with my family. I was watching the sun set by the Kingswood resort by the harbor there, while my dad was skipping stones in the harbor with a random little boy. I thought that was so nice, that here is two people across completely different generations, both enjoying the same thing. Then the dreaded thought hit me that started it all. It being, ""So, what really is the point in life?""

Now most 13 year old boys would probably be thinking about a girl's tits, or video games, or something like that. But not me. And then I realized I wasn't exactly happy with how my childhood turned out. The reason being is that while I was happy, it was full of missed opportunities. The reason being is because I had extreme shyness and social anxiety for the longest time. I realized, for example, that I never really had any close friends, especially ones to hang out with outside of school. This didn't bother me for a while because I've always enjoyed being alone. However, my parents saw it as potentially problematic, but being 13, my mom gave up trying to make friends for me, and my dad was never around.

I swore that during my 8th grade years, I'd finally break through my social isolation. That didn't happen (although I met some awesome people). So, during the next summer, I spent it the same way I spent the same way I spent the previous summer, playing video games. Unlike the previous summer, I wasn't that happy. Why? Because I felt like I was wasting time, and I should be hanging out with my peers instead. On a side note, also at the age of 14, my parents gave me an iPod Touch for Christmas. It was awesome because I finally got my own internet enabled device. Through this device, I discovered internet porn, which would play a huge part of my life for years to come.

The beginning of high school rolls around, which I have been dreading because I have no idea of what to do during high school. I decide before high school starts that this would be MY four years. I would finally break out of my social isolation, I would discover my true passion, I would build up some solid relationships, get my first job, first car, first girlfriend, discover my interests, and most importantly, get into college.

My first day of high school rolls around and so far it looked like I might get somewhere. About a week or two in, I start getting teased and picked on by some kids because I started hanging out with them, since I never talked to them in middle school. This pretty much ruined the rest of my self confidence for most of the school year. It was made even worse because they also thought I might be gay, and they picked on me because of it, but I told them I wasn't and didn't think I was. I didn't join any clubs or sports teams, however I met a lot of people, which was fun. Back in middle school, I got a Facebook, so as a result, I spent almost all of my free time outside of school on Facebook. In one of my classes, I met some girls that I really liked. And they really liked me. I started to shed my social anxiety because of them. It looked like life was finally on track, and I was about to be truly happy for the first time in almost two years. But I blew it.

The girls wanted to hang out outside of school, but my social anxiety caused me to be too shy to tell my mom I actually wanted to have people over. So long story short, I slowly stopped talking to them (although we remained friends until senior year). And, once again, it was my fault. During that summer, I spent the majority of it, once again, playing video games, but I wasn't depressed that summer, because I was still happy that I actually had friends for once. I also kept myself occupied by catching up on all of the SpongeBob episodes I've never seen.

Sophomore year starts up, and with that, my depression returns. I realized that I didn't have any friends, and in order to thrive in high school, you really need friends. I was ashamed that I didn't have friends, and tried to (unsuccessfully) hide it from everyone. I did this by never eating lunch in the cafeteria, which resulted to me either skipping lunch or eating in some pretty pathetic places (even the bathroom once). My lack of friends that year pretty much wrecked my self confidence, which was made even worse due to the fact one of my peers even tweeted he was concerned about me on Twitter (although at least he cared I guess). I did meet some people I like that school year, but we didn't really talked outside of school, which left me majorily depressed once that school year was over.

Also that year, my peers began dabbling in drugs and alcohol, which I had no interest in at the time (and I still don't), so ,as result, I never got in with the ""popular kids"". Also at this point in time I started to view online porn more, which I now know was to try and cope with the depression. At this point, I was 16 and never seen anyone but myself naked in real life (unless you count locker rooms), or have had a proper relationship. Now being 16 at the time, you think I would at least get my license, and that would open up the world to me, but nope. My parents couldn't afford the insurance (but could somehow magically afford a $60,000 pool when I was 9), and I didn't have a job. So that contributed to my depression.

Shortly before my junior year started, I finally looked limr I might turn my life around, as a got my first job! It was at a fast food breakfast restaurant and I was cashier/cleaner. I was afraid that I might be a loser in school during this year, as my school let juniors and seniors go off campus to lunch, and I might never have anyone to ever go off campus with, but that didn't happen. I met some awesome people in my classes that I would hang out with at lunch, and if I didn't go off, I would simply spend lunch studying, which wasn't a big deal since it was junior year. I was finally happy in school, the only thing I was unhappy about was due to the lack of a car, I had to take the bus. Outside of school, I was also fairly happy. I liked my first job at the time, I was learning a lot, and also finally even hung with some people a couple of times outside of school. Also, I began watching Modern Family, an awesome show that made me smile long after the episodes aired. Also I struck up a friendship with my neighbor who was a spanish tutor in her late 60s and struck up a friendship with her grandkids (a 13 year old boy and a 9 year old girl).

The next semester starts up, and I slowly stop talking to my friends from the previous semester, but I originally am not depressed because I finally got a car and my license! However, about a month goes by and I get a ""that's it?"" feeling. My depression finally returns though when I remember I've never had a proper relationship with a girl. I start viewing porn again, but this time I get bored with girls, so I decide to start looking at gay porn instead, which severely intensified my depression, because I worried I might be gay, but I didn't want to be at the time. Summer that year was spent watching Breaking Bad (a fantastic show by the way) and driving. 

Senior year began,  but I didn't want it to because I dreaded turning 18. Being ""an adult"" and never even having kissed a girl due to my social anxiety bothered me. I turned 18 (and it was surprisingly a fantastic birthday) but I didn't feel ""grown up"" now. During senior year I didn't really bother making many friends, because I had the ""we're all going to different schools next year anyways"" mindset. The one friend I made that year that I truly liked was a sophomore, and he was probably one of my favorite friends of all time. I still looked at porn, and I also proceeded to spend a lot of time playing Simcity 4, my favorite game from my childhood. The new year rolls in and it hits me. The dreaded question returns. ""So, what is really the point in life?"" It was then I realized I had no clue to what I wanted to do after high school, and it freaked me out. Sure there was college, but I already knew I was going to community college due to financial reasons. My mom gave me a choice. It was ""either go to go community college, or join the military."" Now I understood the reasoning behind this. They didn't start saving for retirement until their 30s, and didn't have kids until their late 30s. However, it pretty much meant I'd have to spend another at least another year living at home, which meant I be missing out on ""the fun and experience of college."" My.mom tried to cheer me up, by saying ""college is nothing like the real world!"" Great, just what I needed. I don't care if college is nothing like the ""real world"" but at least it might have cured my depression. Missed opportunity there.

Also, around April that year, I finally tell my mom about my depression. She understood, because she revealed she also has depression, but she didn't discover hers until she was 42, and I was lucky to discover it so early in life. At least it meant she understood. I decided right then and there that I would also never kill myself, as I didn't want to ever cause loved ones pain. Due to my depression, my porn addiction intensified, and all I would ever think about sometimes was sex, which depressed me knowing I never actually have had sex.

Besides asking myself what the point in life was, I also started dwelling on the fact I would die someday and would also become old. This intensified my depression knowing that I wouldn't always be this young, with so many opportunities in life open for me, except I didn't know which route to take because of my depression. I tried to cheer myself up, by reminding myself I was only 18, but I still feel like I was 6 yesterday, so it didn't work.

I originally decided to major in Computer Engineering in college, as I had always been interested in computers, and thought ""I waste so much time on technology anyways,  might as well make a career out of it"", but changed it to logistics before even starting, but then changed it back to Computer Engineering. I dreaded the start of college, because I was embarrassed that I was going to community college. Except that when it started, I actually didn't mind it. I also got a new job at a grocery store at the time. I finally made some new friends, and due to this, I finally started to become happier. This don't last unfortunately. I became unhappy again when I realized I was spending all of my free time on school and work, and never had anytime to do anything outside of school, as my spare time was spent on commuting to school and work. 

I decided to take a chunk of my classes online next semester so I could have more free time. That starts up, but instead depression hits again. I again remember i have never had a proper relationship (I'm 19 then) and due to my depression, I couldn't focus in school. I fell behind and I officially decided my curriculum, while interesting, was too hard. I decided to switch my major to Computer Information because it was kind of similar, but easier, and would be easy to me, as I already spent most of my free time on my computer anyways. I become unhappy at work because the customers just plain annoyed me, and I hated watching my coworkers getting promoted while I didn't, because the new manager didn't like me for some reason I never figured out.

Summer rolls around that year and I decide to screw it and take all online classes, which was both a good thing and a mistake. It was good because it meant no more time wasted on commuting and no more time spent in stupid lectures. However, I became lonely again. I resorted to internet porn again but then remembered ""had this worked once?"" and finally quit my addiction. Once again, feeling lonely relationship wise, I turned to online dating this time.

Back when I was 15, I swore to myself I'd lose my virginity before I turned 20. Here I was that summer, 2 1/2 months before I turned 20, I freaked out because I realized that if I didn't accomplish this, it would have been another empty promise I made to myself, and I was done with those. Also, I finally accepted that I was gay, after years of trying to deny my gay impulses, but never came out to my family, and was still kind of interested in girls. So after talking with a few guys online, I finally met a guy I legitimately liked on OkCupid that I thought was extremely cute, and was also my age. I met him in person, and three weeks later, I asked him to have sex with me (it was about a month until I turned 20). He agrees and I have sex with him. It was one of my favorite nights in my life, but after that, we never saw each other again, as he went back to college in New Jersey. 

I finally decided to go and see a doctor, and a therapist for my depression (with my parents help), but it didn't work for me. I eventually quit going to both and also quit my antidepressant meds, because strangely I just felt more depressed.

School starts back up for me, and I finally got promoted to work in produce in my store, up from cashier. However, due to lack of employees in the store, I got scheduled almost full time hours for a physically intensive, almost minimum wage job, while still in college, with me running into the ""no free time available again"" dilemma. I also finally turn 20, which initially freaked me out because since I'm not a teenager anymore, I'm not as ""young"" anymore, which means people might be expecting me to do ""adult things"", which by no means was I ready to do, but then I realized that people don't really expect that until your mid to late 20s anyways, if ever, which somewhat lessened my depression load, but I realized that one of these days my youth will be gone, and here I was working and going to school 24/7 while still living at home, instead of having fun.

Around halfway through my second year of college, I got an internship offer, which pays almost twice as much as my produce job, so I accepted it and quit my produce job. I decided, once again tired of commuting to school (which I switched back to doing after getting lonely while taking online classes), I would take almost entirely online classes, with the exception of one class, which meets one night a week. I finally had free time, and I finally looked like I might be happy.

So here I am today. I have written this entire post from my bed on my phone. I'm not happy, otherwise I probably wouldn't be writing this. While I like my internship, there's no one even close to my age there. Seriously, I'm the youngest person there, which is something I actually like, but the next youngest person there is already 25. Most people in the office I work in are at least 40. And due to taking online classes, I'm never around my peers, which caused my loneliness to start back up again. I am so glad I don't get picked on anymore, but I'm still not happy because I feel like I'm wasting my youth because I'm spending my ""college years"" already in the work force and not around my peers, which may also contribute to my depression. I also don't know what I want to do after community college ends, except get my Bachelors.

Point of this whole post is that feel like my life is not going in the direction I want, and is full of missed opportunities, and I don't want to look back when I'm old and regret all of the missed opportunities, or think I wasted my time on stuff I didn't like. Also, I think about death and aging a lot, and I know for a fact I will regret all the thoughts wasted on death and aging when I'm old. 

TL;DR Long story short, I've suffered from on and off depression, and have no clue of what I'm doing in life.

The question is, how do I fix this mess? I sure don't know."
2tinz7,722,2015-01-24,I am 27 years old and have brain cancer. I've been fighting it for over 6 years.,brinking,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2tinz7/i_am_27_years_old_and_have_brain_cancer_ive_been/,"Well I don’t usually do this but my meds had me up all night and I thought it may be time to really share my story with people. Read it, don’t read it, it’s up to you. I just want to get it out. Back in July of 2009, I was diagnosed with a grade 2 brainstem oligodendroglioma. Now let me explain very quickly what that is. It is a slow growing, invasive brain tumor on my brainstem. The doctors really have no idea how long it has been there, since I never got an MRI until 2009 when I was having symptoms. My symptoms were actually pretty quickly presenting, and they were bad for a long time. I was vomiting all the time with terrible headaches. All the doctors I went to said I was just “stressed out” from being in college. I didn’t have anything to be stressed out about though, besides feeling sick. I had amazing friends, the best boyfriend, school was going really well, I had a great internship, everything seemed to really be falling into place for me. Then finally I went home to figure out what was wrong once and for all. 

The doctor decided maybe I was having migraines, so he ordered an MRI. That’s when my world changed. “They found a mass on your brainstem. I’m sorry” I didn’t believe it. Immediately I was referred to the Cleveland Clinic bc no one closer would even think about touching it. I met with the surgeon, had the biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and had surgery in September of 2009. The surgery I absolutely had to have was called a craniotomy, and they basically had to cut a hole in my skull bc my tumor had no more room in there to grow. While he he was in there, he got out as much as he could, which unfortunately was not much due to the sensitivity of the location of the tumor. So after the long surgery, I was told I needed radiation and chemotherapy. 

So in October of 2009 I did 6 weeks, 5 days a week, of radiation along with daily oral chemotherapy. I continued the chemo for about a year after radiation. Let me just tell you, radiation was awful for me. I had to be on a very high dose of steroids while on radiation to reduce swelling in my brain and it was miserable. Steroids made me swell up (the rest of my body) hungry, angry, unable to breathe, have horrible bone pain, not sleep, just a world of annoying side effects. And to top it all off, since I was on such a high dose for so long, it deteriorated both of my hip joints and shoulder joints. I had to have double hip surgery, with one total replacement at the ripe old age of 23. I get cortisone shots in my shoulders to hold off on replacements, but am told I will probably need those replaced as well. 

So anyway, up until around August of 2014 my MRIs were stable. The tumor was still there, but wasn’t dong anything which was great. The doctors did tell me it would more than likely come back, so I was just waiting for that to happen. Well they started seeing some changes but they thought maybe they were no big deal. I was told it could just be long term radiation change. Well I wasn’t really comfortable with that so I kind of demanded a biopsy. Sure enough, it’s back. It’s now transforming into a grade 3 oligoastrocytoma. (This is a rare mixed tumor, I just got really lucky) I can’t have surgery bc of the location (again, so lucky) so they started me back on the oral chemotherapy, plus an infusion chemotherapy to supplement it. And here’s the best part-steroids. 

So I’m a little cranky right now. I can’t sleep and have awful bone pain. The chemo is ok, makes me a little tired but I am still working full time and trying to keep things as normal as possible. For my own sanity and for Ben’s. Speaking of Ben, he is amazing. He has been there with me since the beginning of all of this (8 years now!) and he is my rock. I hate that he has to deal with this and with me, but the fact that he continues to do so just reminds me how lucky I am to have found such a wonderful man to share my life with. I honestly don’t know what I would ever do without him. 

Okay, enough of the sap. So now, I am continuing on treatment and basically waiting for things to get worse. I’m told they will, and I will probably have to switch up my chemo and do some more radiation. I can’t do much more radiation bc the doctor told me I’m already at the “safe” level my brain can handle. That makes me a little nervous because it hasn’t been that long, and the doctor has pretty much said I will be on some sort of treatment for the rest of my life. The chemo I may have to switch to is a pretty rough chemo. I will probably have to stop working and my mom may even have to uproot her life in Ohio to move down here and take care of me. Which I hate for her. The fact that she is willing to even consider that though, makes me feel so grateful to have her. I’m getting a port placed next week bc the possibility of needing infusion chemo for the long haul is pretty substantial, and I’d like to save my veins if possible. 

So that’s it. Here I am, 27 years old and on treatment for brain cancer. It’s the scariest thing in the world, and some days I feel like I am just waiting to die (especially bc of the lack of awareness and funding for brain cancer, but we won’t get into all of that) but this experience has made me realize what is important in my life. Sure, I still complain about silly things (who doesn’t?) but then I remember, it could be so much worse. I’m lucky to even be here today. I’m lucky to have all of the people I have in my life. My family, Ben’s family, amazing friends, generous coworkers, the best dog in the entire world (we’re obsessed with him). As much as I hate the situation I was thrown into, I really do have a great life. Living in Charlotte with Ben has been amazing. I only wish things could stay “normal”, whatever that means. 

I have decided that I am going to do what I want to do, when I want to do it. We went on a Christmas cruise this year instead of visiting family. If I want to go on vacation, I’m gonna do it. If we want to go out to a fancy dinner and spend hundreds of dollars, I’m doing it. Life is too short not to try to enjoy every second. 

So let me put in a little plug for the Charlotte Brain Tumor Race this year. It’s March 21st and if you’re in the Charlotte area we would love for you to join us. If not, a donation would be great. Even $1 would help. 

If anyone is still reading this monster post. Bottom line, I did not write this for pity. I don’t want people to feel bad for me bc God knows I’m not the only sick person in the world. I just wanted to get some of my thoughts out, and since Ben and Duncan are sleeping, what else do I have to do? I want to thank anyone and everyone who has ever had kind words or thoughts for me. I really do appreciate it more than I could ever explain. 

Thanks for reading all the boring details of my story. I may be posting more, but as you may know I’m not usually one to share every little detail of my treatments. Who wants to read all that?! I hope everyone has a lovely weekend and don’t forget to check out some info on the brain tumor race =)"
2tj3m3,1,2015-01-24,Girl [20/f] I [19/m] have been seeing recently moved across the country. She hasn't responded to my text. How should I keep our relationship together?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tj3m3/girl_20f_i_19m_have_been_seeing_recently_moved/,"This girl moved from Seattle to Chicago 3 months ago and I've been dating her for the last 2 months. 2 weeks ago she found out she has to move back to Seattle because she got an internship and has to leave ASAP. long story short, we both liked each other a lot and she was the first girl to kiss me. The night before she left (3 days ago) I gave her a goodbye gift and we kissed each other goodbye and said shed keep in touch. She said she will be back in the summer and were planning on going to a music festival together. 

The next morning I told her to text me when she gets to Seattle and she sent me some snapchats. I texted her that night asking how Seattle is treating her and she responded, ""good! Sorry I forgot to text you!"" I then replied, ""that's alright. Did you meet your friends yet?"" It's been over a day and she hasn't responded. I don't know if she hasn't recieved it or what but i haven't gotten anything from her since then.

I really love this girl and I know a lot of you will say, forget about her, but when she was here with me I felt that she loved me too. She's the perfect girl and literally likes every single thing I do (music, football, space, engineering majors, movies). I don't want to give up on her this easily. What should I do? Should I text her back? What should I say?

I was planning on going to college with her next fall and I know she wants me to visit her once in a while. I'm in a tight situation, any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

2tjhj4,7,2015-01-24,Worried 1L - I Think I Was Fired,1Lthrow737away,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/2tjhj4/worried_1l_i_think_i_was_fired/,"So, I am a 1L and I have been submitting applications for internships, summer associate positions, etc. for this summer. Everything has been going great so far. Until today. I was filling out an application for a position for a government office and near the end it had some standard character and fitness questions. Are you a criminal, ever had a DUI, etc. The last one asked if I was ever fired or asked to resign from a position. I checked no at first but then started to think. 

I've only had one job and an internship during undergrad. My job was at a well known retail chain. I had worked there since my junior year in high school until my senior year in undergrad. For the most part it was a fantastic job that got me through high school and college. However, I got a new boss within the last year of my employment there. He was terrible. Hostile work environment is overstating it a little but he had a temper and aggressive way of taking his anger out on all the employees. It just wasn't pleasant. One day he was yelling at me for something stupid and I just got fed up and walked out telling him I quit. I never returned. I no longer needed the income and was planning on quitting anyway in preparation for law school. 

Here's the thing. He called me after the fact (I didn't answer) and told me when I worked next as if I was coming back. I never responded. But now that I think about it, I think it is entirely possible for him to have terminated me instead of putting in that I quit. In fact I think that is most likely what happened judging by the voice mail he left me, he made it sound like he was warning me that I would be fired for multiple no shows because he was still putting me on the schedule. 

So now I am worried about what to check on this application. I want to check no, because obviously that would be the better answer and also is what is actually true. But at the same time, is there somehow a way they could find out if I was actually fired or not? And if I was, then it would look like I am lying. I just don't know what to do in this situation. Furthermore, if I find out that I was in fact fired, I really have no proof that I quit. It would just be my word against his. Any advice?

TL;DR: I quit a job that I had for 6 years because a new boss caused me to walk out and I suspect that he kept putting me on the schedule and fired me instead. Now I am worried future employers/internships will think I was fired even though I shouldn't have been.

2tjxqt,11,2015-01-24,"College student isolated, losing hope and motivation",atlanticblvd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2tjxqt/college_student_isolated_losing_hope_and/,"I'm a junior in college struggling with depression since age 11, and it's particularly bad right now.

I went to school 500 miles away because I was offered a full-ride scholarship and I liked the idea of getting out of my home state. This university is also ranked in the top ten in the nation for my major, so the top employers in the field recruit heavily here. 

Academically, the university is providing a good opportunity for me, but otherwise, coming here was really a mistake. The social scene is dominated by the Greek system, which I am not a part of. I knew that people here are mostly into their fraternities and sororities, partying, and football, but I thought that amongst 30k+ students, I should be able to find my niche, right? Wrong, it's surprisingly hard to meet people here. People stick to their cliques and it's not normal to start a conversation with someone you don't know already, especially by junior year. I have only a couple friends, but I wouldn’t consider them to be good friends in terms of actually caring about me. On an average week, several days will pass by without me talking to anyone besides my mom on the phone.

Last summer I went through a breakup after dating my ex for 15 months and my “friends” didn’t make that much of an effort to reach out to me despite knowing how scared and alone I was. I had been the one to break up with my ex and he stalked and harassed me via phone and email, insinuating he was going to hurt me. I blocked him from my phone and he continued to email me. I ignored him and he changed tactics to say that he didn’t mean to make me feel threatened and wanted to still be friends. (Wtf?) I told him what he did was disgusting and I didn’t want any contact with him. As a result of all this, I’ve had almost no contact with any of his friends that were “our” friends during the relationship. He had been a little controlling and discouraged me from seeing my own friends during the relationship, so I didn’t have a lot to fall back on.

So when school started last fall I hoped to make some new friends, but it hasn’t happened. I rushed for a professional business fraternity that I hoped would help me make friends in my major and was rejected, which absolutely crushed me and knocked my confidence further. The few friends I have are in the liberal arts and I don’t know anyone in the business school, so I feel extremely awkward in class when everyone is talking to each other before class starts and I don’t know anyone. I feel afraid to try to start a conversation, since I’ve always felt out of place on this campus and inferior to the Greeks and anyone else who’s succeeded in building a social clique.

Additionally what’s really discouraging me right now is I’ve found out since starting junior year that having campus leadership positions on your resume and work experience is critical to finding internships and jobs. I have close to a 4.0 GPA and was proud of that, so hearing that the person who has a 3.2 but was treasurer of their fraternity or worked 20 hours a week will be looked on more favorably by employers is devastating. I haven’t needed to work in college, and my resume consists of a few volunteer positions, but nothing in a “leadership” role besides working with kids as a mentor.

I had had the mentality that I’m not having any fun in college but at least I’ll get a better job than those that are partying, so the idea that the inverse may be true as long as those people had jobs or were leaders in clubs is devastating. Last semester I was depressed but made all As and A+s, but this semester I feel like I’m just losing hope and motivation though I’m on track to graduate in December (I’ll still need an internship and a master’s degree after that).

It would be great to make friends but it seems extremely unlikely at this point, I really just need a way to keep my depression from spiraling out of control so I can finish my last two semesters. In high school I became so depressed I had to leave school and be homeschooled and ended up hospitalized for a week due to feeling suicidal, so I know that it can get a lot worse for me. Medication does help me somewhat, but I was in therapy for about two months last semester and it made me feel much worse because the therapist didn’t seem to know how to help me or really even care, it felt like she was just using me to get paid. This was my fifth therapist in my life and each experience has been similar. I hate feeling so broken and a burden to my family when I vent about my issues while crying on the phone. I don’t open up to my friends here because I don’t think they’re trustworthy since my best friend talks bad about everyone, and I feel so awkward when people catch on to how unhappy I am."
2tk40v,6,2015-01-24,Only ever been in love once. He was married. Never told me. Still hasn't. Not a typical case. MMFB?,Narienne,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2tk40v/only_ever_been_in_love_once_he_was_married_never/,"Let me start by saying that I am not one to be all whiny about love and such. I do believe there is someone for everyone and it has been my experience that things have a funny way of working out. I'm not going to waste your time coming up with flowery descriptions, so here it goes:

The truth is, if I told you every significant detail, we'd be here for a VERY long time. If you are interested to hear more, please feel free to message me and I would be more than happy to tell you more. 

At first, my interest in Luke was sheer morbid curiosity. He was my graduate TA in my freshman year of college, 10 years my senior. Talking to professors, I learned that Luke was of incredible superior intellect, but chronically late and not good with people. Some would call him arrogant. In what would be an otherwise heated argument, Luke kept calm, calculating, and amused while the other person fumed. 

I finally got the courage to meet with him at the end of the semester to ask him some bullshit questions related to class, just to see what he was like for myself. He told me I was asking the wrong questions and proceeded to tell me what the correct questions were. Seeing I wasn't getting anywhere, I thanked him and gathered my things. But at the very last moment, he asked if I wanted to be his research assistant. I was confused, because based on our earlier conversation, I was convinced he thought I was an idiot. Apparently I did something right, otherwise he wouldn't have asked the question.

Long story short (too late) I got to know Luke by working in his lab for a few months. I noticed he would treat me differently than his other two research assistants. I would describe the antics he would have towards me to the other assistants and they'd be like ""what are you talking about?"" It was then that I caught on that Luke enjoyed teasing me in covert ways (never rude, lewd, or crude, just...strange). I was amusing to him. Realizing this, I started to give him a taste of his own medicine. He would try to rile me up by saying something off kilter or cavalier and I'd give it right back to him. Of course, he would only smirk and continue to be entertained, but at least it was on my terms and I felt the playing field had been leveled. Sometimes he'd stare at me. Sometimes he'd purposely write baiting comments on the facebook of a mutual friend of ours. Sometimes we'd have battles of wits, and I loved every minute of it.

Soon, Luke would come over to my desk just to talk to me. We learned we had things in common and would chat. I would make him laugh a lot. This was something people had difficulty believing when I told them. The professor he had TA'd for who was supposed to be his friend even didn't believe me, saying that he didn't think he had ever heard Luke laugh. I felt that it was an accomplishment. 

Luke was not popular in his department. In reality he was disliked by most. He personified the word 'aloof,' but the more I got to know him, the more I realized he was genuinely a good person. Being able to talk to him, get to know him, I felt like I had exclusive access to something spectacular that everyone else passed over. 

I only worked for him for the Spring semester and I knew that that was not enough for me. I ended up taking a class he taught during the summer session. Then I ended up proctoring exams with him the Fall semester after that. Then I TA'd a class WITH him the following Spring semester. Finally, I TA'd a class for him that summer. None of these incidents required any particular finessing -- they just kind of ended up that way. After that last summer, he graduated from school and took a job at another university, in another state, 5 hours away. It also happened that I applied to several universities for an internship, and guess what was the only university that accepted me? The very one he was employed at. After a year, I was able to see him and we hung out a few times. Once, he said he only had 30 minutes to spare. Three hours later, we were still talking. It felt like being in a spinoff series of a TV show, being in a new environment with someone familiar like that.

Throughout all this time, I got to know him better, more personally. Somehow, he could sense when something was upsetting me and knew the exact words to say to remedy it. He was especially cautious of not hurting my feelings and would apologize if he ever felt he crossed the line with a joke. He told me about his family, his depressing childhood, his insecurities, previous girlfriends, the whole bit. BUT, one thing he was very careful never to mention I eventually found out by accident.

While he was still in graduate school, I ran into him on campus during a school festivity, chatted with him for a few minutes, when a beautiful woman stepped up next to him. At the time, I thought she was just his girlfriend. He only introduced her as his ""counterpart."" This was the Spring semester before he left. 2 years later, I found out from a third party she was his wife. Not only that, but they had been married for over 3 years. This meant that he was engaged to her when I was working for him and married when we were proctoring together.

How do you make mention of such personal things and NEVER ONCE mention or even ALLUDE to a significant other? He never wore a ring. Like I said, when I met her, he didn't introduce her as his wife. Even after meeting her and knowing of her existence, he never told me anything about her. I've known him for 5 years now and he's still never mentioned he's married. Why is that the ONE thing he's never talked about? Whenever I've met someone with a boy/girlfriend, fiancee or spouse, I would know IMMEDIATELY because they talk about them almost instantly. Think about it, ""Oh yeah, my boyfriend and I went to see Wicked on Broadway we really enjoyed it."" Simple things like that. In the years that I'd known him, how many times had I asked him how his weekend was? What he did? How does ""I'm getting MARRIED"" or ""I just got married"" NEVER come up? How did he never mention his wife in passing?

Nothing romantic ever happened between us. We've only ever touched twice in the years I've known him. Once was a hug because I and other assistants bought him birthday presents. I didn't even hug back because I had no idea what was going on. I remember my face being buried in his shoulder and getting lip gloss on his sweater. The other time was our thumbs touching by accident when I handed him something. 

Those I have told this about have said that we had an ""emotional affair"" which I think is rather dramatic, but if that's what it was then so be it. He was the first and last person thus far I have truly connected with. I remember him saying how alike we are. Maybe I was mislead. Maybe I was seeing things that were not there. But I feel duped. I feel duped because I feel like I got to know the man that only a very very select few people knew. He trusted me, he told me private things. He was different with me and I know that much was not imagined. 

I remember being at his dissertation, sitting down next to his wife at her invitation, her smiling at me. I asked her if he was nervous and she replied ""I don't know, he never tells me anything."" For a moment I felt a sense of pride, because I know he told me a lot, and he would tell me if he were nervous. But then I remembered that even if that were true, it didn't matter. Maybe he never told me he was married, but he was, and he was married to her.

The last time I saw Luke was the summer of 2012. We still keep in touch. It's not that we chat every day, but every so often he will send me something that he thought I might like or vice versa. He has a very ghostly presence on facebook, but I know he reads everything I post and is very keen on what happens in my life. Strange still, neither he nor his wife have any pictures of themselves together. There is no evidence of their relationship, which I think is strange. Sure, people can be private about their life of course, but how do you not have an inkling or trace of your spouse?

In August of 2013, I decided to take a trip back to the university where I had my internship, where Luke got his first job out of grad school. It was my last day, and I had just finished shopping. I was about to head to the train station through a certain route, but something told me no, go back the way you came. At that very moment, Luke's wife was facing me from across the street. As we started crossing the street towards each other, I saw her recognize me and quickly divert her attention elsewhere. I tried to regain her attention, but she ignored me. I KNOW she ignored me. It was the strangest thing. And talk about timing! Of all the streets in all the city of all the times!

But what was especially strange about that incident was that Luke had taken a job at a university 200 miles away and had moved two months prior, making my run in with his wife all the more interesting.

Luke now lives and works (I'm assuming his wife, too) in the same town as my brother, which is not far from me. I've been tempted to say hello to him for a brief moment while visiting my brother, but I'm just not sure if I should. 

Even though I haven't seen him in 3 years, I still consider Luke to be a good friend of mine and I value his opinion very highly. I feel as though he is one of few people I can truly confide in. 

I just really wanted to get this out there. Feels better to let it out. I haven't opened this door in a while. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR -- Everyone hated this guy. I stuck around, got to know him, fell for him, he told me a lot of things except about the whole being married for years bit."

I'm looking at moving to Denver for roughly 6 months by March this year to be with my Girlfriend. While I'm there I'm hoping to have something to occupy my time such as an internship or work, however actually getting that is proving quite a struggle. The whole Visa thing is particularly frustrating as well as finding internships/jobs that sponsor for my Visa.

I've previously worked in the US for a year under the J1 Visa and have visited the lovely Denver multiple times. Now I'm ready to start moving my life over there, starting with this 6 month stint.

I was wondering if any Aussie's have had similar experiences and, if so, how did you make the big leap? I'm excited but also a bit intimidated. Are there any particular agencies that are excellent for getting Australian's internships/working roles in Denver?

Thanks a lot!"

Muslims serving jail sentences in Spanish jails will now be allowed to say their prayers in congregation, provided at least ten of them expressed their wish to do so. The aim of the new ruling is to bring about equality of treatment between Muslim prisoners and Catholic interns in their religious rights.

The largest Islamic organization in the country, the Islamic Committee of Spain, has welcomed this initiative, taking into account that 70 percent of those in Spanish jails are Muslims, who number around 54,000.

Last Ramadhan a number of Spanish jails changed their meal times to conform to the Ramadhan meal times of their Muslim inmates, and provided them with prayer areas within the prisons. But in those prisoners where such arrangements were not made, there were protests.

Thanks for reading!

My boyfriend and I have been dating around 10 months. I have a full time internship M-F and I also work nights and Saturdays at another job because I don’t get paid for my internship. I live 13 minutes away from him, and I am the only one of us with a car, so when we want to hang out I drive. Friday night we hung out with friends separately and then I stayed the night at his house because I had been drinking and he lives in town where I was hanging out with my friends. I woke up the next morning and went to work, and we planned on hanging out when I got out around 5. 


I texted him while I was at work and asked if he wanted to go to the store with me to get a few items when I got out of work. He said he was going to have dinner with his friend and asked if I wanted to do my shopping and then come over. I had no problem with that; it would actually work out better. I left work early around 3:30 and ended up just going home and having a smoke because I was tired and didn’t feel like shopping. He texted me around 5 and asked what I was doing and I told him just hanging at home. He didn’t respond so I texted him an hour later asking when he wanted to get together. He said, “whenever you want. Want to drink some wine?” And I said, “yes, are you at home?” He was still at the bar/restaurant with his friend and said he’d be home in a few minutes and asked if I wanted to play board games. I said yeah, of course. I decided to go run my errands and I figured by the time I was done he’d be home because he said he would be home in a few minutes. Well I run all of my errands and then go get a bite to eat and by this time it’s 8:00 (two hours since he said he’d be home in a few minutes.) I texted him and said, “hey, your communication is lacking tonight.” And he said, “I know. Sorry. I’m trying to herd cats. Are you still home?” (I didn’t know what he meant by that.) I told him I was in town and had just finished running my errands and he said he’d be home in a few minutes.  A half hour went by and I hadn’t heard from him again and I was starting to get bored just sitting in my car in town so I texted him and said “Stay out with your friends tonight I’m gonna head back to my house and watch a movie.” He said “no, come over now.” 

I drive over there and park in the lot close to his house, walk over, and no one is home. I’m locked out. I texted him and said, “cool, no one is home.” At this point I’m pissed because I would have been totally cool if he wanted to hang with his friends all night, he knows that, but his communication was awful and he was trickling information all night. Just one text that said, “hey I’m still with friend at the bar I have no idea when we will be back” or 30 second phone call would have been great because then I could have planned something else or not have been waiting around all night. 

I was ready to walk back to my car. By this point it’s 9:00. Then I recognize a laugh and knew it was his friend so I stood there on the porch and here comes my boyfriend with 4 other people who I don’t know (aside from his friend who I don’t really get along with anyway.) I was super angry. I didn’t even want to look at my boyfriend. He walks up to me and kisses me and gives me a hug but I was distant. I am so introverted, and he knows this and typically respects it. He’s introverted too! I figured he would have known better than to blindside me with a situation like this. I was so uncomfortable. I acted friendly and said a few things here and there, but I just wanted to go home and be by myself. My boyfriend knew I was upset and kept trying to hug me and rub me but that was honestly just making me annoyed. His acquaintances (I say that because I’m pretty sure they were just friends of his friend, I have no idea who they were) left to go get alcohol and he stayed back to talk to me. He asked if I was mad at him and I told him that I was upset with his communication and that I had no idea he was hanging out with a group of people. He said he told me he was with people and I just gave him a look because we both knew that was a stupid thing to say. I guess I could have inferred he was with a group when he said that herding cats thing, but that still doesn’t mean I knew he was planning on them coming and hanging out with us all night. I told him that I wanted to go home and he was very sweet to me (he’s always respectful of my feelings) and said he understood but that he wished I would stay. They planned on playing a board game that takes 4 hours to play, and that just did not sound like something I wanted to do. I work 60 hours a week and the weekends are my time to detox. It would have just taken way too much energy to hang out with all of these people that I didn’t know and act sweet and charming. I left and told him to tell his friends that I was going to hang out with one of my friends, because I was really nervous that they were just going to think I was a bitch for leaving and that I was a selfish and mean girlfriend (idk if these thoughts were justified, but even this morning this is still what I’m worried about. I’m not sure why I even care what they think since I don’t know them.) I gave my boyfriend a hug and started to leave and he came to the door and said he was really sorry and kissed me and I was distant and left. The whole thing was just extremely draining. 


I’m still worried about how I just left. I keep feeling like everyone must think I’m just some bitch and that I was just pissed off at my boyfriend for not hanging out with me alone. I feel really guilty and I want to know what you guys think. Would you have just sucked it up and stayed? Was I being immature for leaving? I feel like it would have been more mature to just stay and play the board game. 


*TL;DR* boyfriend had bad communication all night. We were supposed to hang out but he was trickling information and then when we finally did get together at his house he was with a group of people. I’m very introverted and was uncomfortable with this situation because I was unaware we would be hanging with a group of people I didn’t know. I left instead of staying and playing the 4 hour board game. I feel really immature and like a bitch for leaving. Should I have just stayed?

Back in highschool he planned to take a year off since he was apparently bored of education. 


Now, fast forward to 2015, I am about to graduate with a degree in computer science and have an internship in a software verification startup lined up. My boyfriend, on the other hand, never went to college and only had one job since graduating highschool (which he was fired from for being 'inconsiderate to customers', he claimed). I am not too bothered with this since I accept that he hasn't really had a chance to grow up since his parents still support him.


But, it has come to the point that I am feeling like there is a wall between us and he is angry/bitter and indirectly taking this out on me. He criticises me for random things (like being late to a date, answering my phone when we are together, talking about concepts in computer science etc.), has become more distant and just generally doesn't seem that interested.


I still want to be with him and I want him to know that him not achieving much doesn't really matter to me but at the same time I dont want to hurt his ego. How should I go about this reddit?

tl;dr boyfriend bitter over me graduating and him not even going to college. how to proceed?

Whenever I said to my self ""Let's try it"" I wound up breaking up with them a few days later due to me feeling they were more into it than I was and I just wanted things to go back to normal. My idea on relationships is that someone should be my bestfriend before they become a boyfriend.

There's always been this guy, let's call him Boy1. Boy1 has been there since my horrible elementary school days, and has always been there. We tried it once but what I described above happened. I think I'll always have a place in his heart and he'll never make a move for me again, but if I make a move he would probably come back. Boy1 goes to another university but we still keep in contact. There was even a point at the beginning of this school year were I wanted to completely rule him out before trying someone else, but was convinced by someone else just to forget him now since it probably wouldn't work. Recently though (like last night) I started wanting to reconnect with him.

Boy2 is someone I see just about every other day and I learned from a friend last night that he has been trying to get me for months. Before winter break I had been trying to get further with him by flirting a little 2 or 3 times, but when we returned from break I don't feel it as strongly anymore. He's even possibly passed up an internship in order to stay around me longer.

Yesterday I decided to reconnect with Boy1 and drop $73 on Destiny and a headset so I could play and talk with him. At that point I had decided that I would rather try him than keep trying Boy2 which I no longer felt strongly about. A few hours after buying the game, the friend mentioned above drops the bombshell that Boy2 has been dying for months trying to figure me out and become closer.

Some of my friends that I've discussed this with have proposed that I am unconsciously trying to avoid a relationship by jumping back to Boy1 right before Boy2 can happen.

TL;DR: Boy1 been there forever but goes to another university, Boy2 I see often and has been after me for months with me completely oblivious. I may possibly be trying to avoid a relationship."

Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, thick ass opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there.

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; This is the only roleplay where I could consider playing a canon character; Annie only. I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. 

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot! I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love but aren't necessary; anal, ass worship, rimming(giving/recieving), rough sex and dirty talk. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"
2tno6v,2,2015-01-25,I want the peace that only death can offer,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2tno6v/i_want_the_peace_that_only_death_can_offer/,"I recently read a post in /r/relationships written by the best friend of a girl who had committed suicide. I cried through this post but especially at [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2thl1j/i_23m_have_just_found_out_my_best_friend_22f/cnzcoo0). In a nutshell, I relate to the post so much. I'm so miserable all the time, and I feel like I would be so much better off dead.

I shouldn't feel this way, and I have honestly tried so hard not to. I try not to wallow at home, I try to keep myself busy, I try to see friends and go out, maintain interests, but honestly none of it bothers me. I don't care about any of it.

I'm 20 years old, attending my dream school in the best city in the world. A year ago, as a freshman, the world was my oyster, and now everything has fallen apart and I can't pretend anymore. I have always been a firm believer that we make our own happiness, that no one else's actions should dictate how I feel. Now... I don't know what to do. I just know I don't want to be unhappy anymore.

I don't know why I'm doing my double major. I have no interest in my major and am pursuing internships in a completely different area. I'm stressed out from doing 24 credits per semester (as opposed to the recommended 16) and I have always found it difficult to study. I peaked at 10th grade. I never had to study then, I was clever enough to ace all of my exams. I went to high school in England and took 15 GCSE's, obtaining 14 A*s and an A. It's all been downhill since there. I lack focus. My GPA is just under 3.5 and I'm not happy at all. I also know my studies are going to get harder from here. I've heard how Comp Sci students never have time to do anything other than code. My second major is instrument performance, where no amount of practice is enough. Both are extremely time consuming majors. I feel like I'm going to burn out and it's too late to change.

My ex-boyfriend is an asshole. I know we shouldn't be together. We never brought out the best in each other. It's the most dysfunctional relationship I've ever witnessed, and I know when I'm over it (if I'm ever over it), I'll think what the hell was I doing being in love with him for so long? He hit me, he cheated on me all the time, he blamed me for any source of unhappiness. It's so difficult because I see him all the time. His frat and my sorority mix all the time. Our friends all take trips together, I see him at parties three times a week. I was considering not going out to places I know he will be for the foreseeable future, but I shouldn't let it dictate where I can and can't go out. I just think for the sake of my own happiness, I would rather stay in and be boring than go out and see him hooking up and getting upset about it. If he went to a different college, it would be so much easier to get over him. And at the end of the day, I still want to marry him. I love him so much it consumes me. In my mind, there's still hope that our long term goals re-align to find a path together. It's some stupid fate thing that I know I shouldn't believe in, but I do. I know, no matter how many girls he's sleeping with, he still loves me. I'm his angel, and if I die, I'll always be his angel.

It makes it harder that on Wednesday I was carrying his baby. I did a pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant, immediately scheduled an OBGYN appointment, where I asked for a medical abortion. I figured there was no way I was more than a few weeks pregnant - it turns out I was 9 weeks pregnant. 9 weeks. The baby already has a beating heart, organs and eyes and tiny hands and feet. The doctor just assumed I would still want an abortion and carried out a surgical abortion straight away. I was completely in shock, and everything happened so fast. I don't know that that was what I would have chosen. I think I would have wanted to put the baby up for adoption. As much as my ex-boyfriend is an ass, we both have pretty great genes. I'll take a second out and say that he's very good-looking, smart, motivated. He's the president of his frat, and I was not too shabby for his girl. Even disregarding this, I just never wanted to kill my baby. And at 9 weeks, it's no longer an embryo, it's definitely a baby. And I did it. It wasn't my choice, but I killed my baby. I told my ex-boyfriend this, and his response was to make out with another girl 5 inches in front of my face a day later (although he did offer to help cover the medical bills for what happened)

I'm so close with my mum and I can't even tell her I did this awful awful thing. I'm not scared of her judging me, she would only be supportive, but she's going through a divorce right now. She has much bigger problems, and in comparison I barely even have a reason to be upset. We found out a few weeks ago that my father had an affair that lasted from 2004-2011. It started when I was 9 fucking years old. My mum did everything in the house, all the cooking, all the laundry, all the cleaning, and she was happy to as she believed that my dad was working hard and working late to provide for us as a family. But no, he had been sneaking around with a woman 12 years younger. It makes me feel sick and I've already told him I never want to speak to him or see him again. I hope my mum stays strong and goes through with the divorce whilst I'm away at college. This morning on Skype, she seemed to be wavering and I was crying so much about my baby but I couldn't even tell her.

I pretend to everyone. My friends know about my break up, but they all think 'good riddance' anyway (as they should!) I don't like to go out or drink as much as most of my friends. They're fine, they're nice people, and my sorority sisters would be supportive if I chose to disclose all of this to them, but I honestly just prefer one person. Sometimes I wonder if I just want a partner and we would just spend all of our time together, and that's what would make me happy. I literally have no interest in doing anything. I do it anyway so I don't seem unsociable, and so I'm not just sat in my room being miserable about my life. Like I said, I force myself to do things. I'm going on the ski trip, I'm going to Cancun with my girlfriends for spring break. But I'm not excited about either. In fact, I'm sort of dreading it. It means I have to constantly pretend, not just for a few hours. I know it's becoming worse though. Today, one of my best friends needed to drop by and pick something up. But I didn't really feel like making conversation so I put her stuff in the living room, unlocked the door, and told her I wouldn't be home but she could still pick up her stuff. I just sat quietly in my room when she came to get it. Why would I do something like that? I don't see how people can ever be so concerned with how many friends they have, I've just come to enjoy my own company so much more... except for the fact that I don't. I've been in bed all day, and I hate myself for having done nothing for a whole day. I've wasted it and I've also declined all social offers for the evening too, even though I'm bored at home.

My best friends in the entire world are still an ocean away. No-one at college could replace a friendship built on years of knowing each other, and growing up together. Yet I'm growing apart from them too. It's difficult when I work on semesters, and they work on terms. It's difficult when the short time I am home, I'm normally working or interning. My best friend in the entire world, my absolute rock confessed to me a few months ago that he was in love with me. I didn't feel the same way and now I've lost him.

I honestly can't find happiness anywhere. I've tried so hard. I can't sleep unless its Zyquil or weed induced. I have no motivation to do anything. I used to cut. I used to cut heavily and I have the scars on my arm and legs to show for it. I've been cutting since I was 12. I wouldn't say I was depressed or suicidal at this point. It was merely the most effective form of stress relief for me. People go for a run when they're angry, or they throw things, or punch things. The best way for me to calm down was always just to cut. It was always a choice, but my ex-boyfriend helped me see that even though it didn't hurt me, it hurt those around me. But I know the difference between how I felt then, and how I feel now.
The only thing that's holding me back right now is my mum. My beautiful, strong mother, who's already lost so much. If I kill myself, I don't know how she'd cope. But I also feel like I need to be selfish. She would want me to happy. She would want me to rest in peace.

I'm so sorry for such a long passage, and I don't expect people to read, and I'm not really even looking for advice. I really was just looking to get this off my chest."
2to3k1,1,2015-01-25,I didn't like UF. Will I like UVA Law?,[deleted],UVA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/2to3k1/i_didnt_like_uf_will_i_like_uva_law/,"I am an undergraduate student at UF about to graduate.  As a whole, I do not look back fondly on my experiences at UF.  While I did well academically, I felt very socially isolated throughout a great portion of my undergraduate career.

For the first two years I was extremely focused on academics, internships, and school clubs that I didn't really take the time to date or make a ton of friends.  

By the time I got to my third year, I realized a huge division in the student body, those in Greek life and those who are not.  I realized how much easier it was for those who were Greek to be social, to date, and and to get involved on campus.  My social group is pretty nerdy and just likes to sit at home and watch movies and play video games.  I've basically spent the last two years regretting not rushing a fraternity.

To this day, I've done my best to get involved, but I always felt like something was missing.  I am also from a ""northern"" family (New York area that moved to South Florida), so I don't really assimilate well with the culture of Gainesville.

I got into UVA Law and am ecstatic.  It is definitely the best law school I've been accepted to, and I feel compelled to attend.  I'm just a little weary of repeating my undergraduate experience.  I know UVA is also a southern school largely dominated by Greek life.  Will my non-Greek experiences at UF make my social life more difficult?  

I am extremely excited to go on my journey to become a lawyer and meet a whole bunch of like-minded people.  Will I be able to do so easily at UVA Law?"

2tow23,3,2015-01-25,Need some advice... 1 year Master's vs. LPCC,koua,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/2tow23/need_some_advice_1_year_masters_vs_lpcc/,"Hi all,

I am currently in the process of finishing my first year in grad school out of state at a private university. I am in an interesting program that offers a MSEd in Counseling &amp; Mental Health Services after the first year, and an MPhilEd in Professional Counseling after the second year.

I am trying to decide whether I want to go back to my home state after the first year and job hunt (California). The LPC intern status in my state is a bit harder to get with the coursework at this University (requires 8 or so CE classes I can do online). This is because the program is not CACREP accredited and prepares students for licensure in the that state it is in.

I'm supposed to meet with my advisor to decide what to do, but I wanted to solicit some more opinions. Most of the concern is financial (44k a year tuition) and then coming out of the program making so little money. 

My main issues are:
1. I see limitations in being hired with just a one year master's at an agency, especially when I do not have the course work done for intern status.
2. It seems like most online job listings require 2 years in a specialized area (e.g. people in recovery from addictions).
3. At this time I do not have any interest in pursuing a PhD.
4. There seems to be a lot more interest for LCSWs/MFTs in the job markets I've been looking.

Any thoughts/insights about your post-grad situations or ideas about best approaches to this situation are really appreciated."
2tp19m,5,2015-01-26,Plea for a Second Chance at Life,[deleted],CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/2tp19m/plea_for_a_second_chance_at_life/,"Hi everone! I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I want to get a lot of stuff off my chest, so here it goes...

I am a college student a couple of months away my birthday and recently it hit me that I have been living life all wrong. There are many things that I want to change, but I just don't know where to begin. I just feel so confused and conflicted that I need advice on what steps to take to not waste more of my life. This will be a long post, but I really appreciate any and all advice.

When I first started college, I didn't feel the need to make friends, so I just minded my classes and sat around in my dorm room without connecting to anybody including my roommate. I felt that I was strong on my own and was ""too good to need friends"" (at this point I obviously deleted my Facebook which I barely used in high school). I always just played around on my computer and could not go two days without looking at pornography (what I now see as a destructive addiction I had since middle school). I have always justified the addiction by telling myself that it makes me feel better and that it just relieves my stress. However, things began to change in the second semester of my sophomore year.

During that semester I met a beautiful girl named Lizzy who was in two of my classes, which meant that I would see her five days in a row. What happened was that one day I was late to class and accidentally sat next to her. We began talking for one hour right after and for me it felt as if the planets aligned...that this was the perfect girl that I never even knew I wanted. I became so in love with her that I would not go a day without thinking about her. However, the days rolled on, and nothing happened between us besides the usual 'how are you?'s. When the summer began, I didn't know what to do with myself, because I realized I had been a fool for thinking stuff would happen automatically. I summoned the courage to text her, but at this point it was clear she was just being nice by responding. I became severely depressed and ended up losing around thirty pounds in a few weeks from simply having no desire to live after coming home each day from work. I spent all that time trying to figure out what was wrong with me.

When my junior year started, I hoped for a change. For the first three weeks I made every effort to talk to people in my classes and ended up having one person to talk to in every class. I started eating healthy, dressing nicely, going to the gym...the whole package. After I attended a meeting of a club I ""joined"" freshman year, I was invited to a party, where I got a taste of what I was missing all those years. I thought that at this point everything about my life would change, but all that happened was that I became conscious of the wasted life I had been living. My depression came back even stronger than before. I became oblivious to everything, my porn addiction got more intense and I just wanted to die in some freak accident. I thought that I was inferior to everyone and was just a pathetic and insecure loser devoid of any confidence. However, I should point out that throughout all this time I have maintained my high GPA, worked a part-time job and was able to get a prestigious internship.

However, toward the end of the semester somehow I got invited to another party, where I ended up having my first kiss with Brittany, a girl I didn't think would be ever interested in me. Over winter break we texted and it was clear she wanted me to be her boyfriend. As the weeks passed on, my feelings for her grew and I was finally over Lizzy. My confidence increased immensely, I began to work-out and started following the advice of /r/nofap. **I will see Brittany this week and I really hope this works out, but I am so scared that I will screw things up by being needy, insecure etc.. I fear that my depression will return and that it is too late to change my life for the better. I only have a one year of college left to make a difference, but I don't know how to be at peace with all those wasted years and missed opportunities.**

TL;DR: I thought I didn't need to be social (i.e. be a normal guy with friends) until I fell in love with a girl and saw how I have been wasting my life. Became severely depressed after things didn't work out. Tried to turn my life around, but depression returned with greater force. Recently another girl became interested in me, but I fear I will screw this up. Also, I don't know how to start the process of fixing my life in a way that will actually work.

2tp6r6,1,2015-01-26,Do N parents get better?,UnintentionalBandit,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2tp6r6/do_n_parents_get_better/,"Hi, I'm sorry, this is my first time posting here and I hope I can tell my story well. Feel free not to read this, it's long :(. I'm sorry, I just need to get this off my chest.  I'm 28 and I have a sister who is 27 (10 months younger). Ever since I was 8 my mother has been awful to me. I never knew why until recently she brought up an incident that happened when I was 8. We were taking a family trip to Cincinnati. My parents are both physicians so we picked up my mom at the hospital, about 15 minutes from our house, with the plan of then driving to Cincinnati. I had forgotten my beloved purple Mickey Mouse camera and I asked if we could go back home. My mom said something along the lines of ""If we go back home, I'm not going."" Well my dad turned the car around and we went back home. I think he forgot something too, but I don't remember. She then got out and decided she didn't want to go anymore. My dad, sister, and I continued on to Cincinnati and I don't remember anything else. This is her justification for hating me. Since that time she has made my life hell. Period shaming, calling me names, leaving me at school and not taking me in the morning, etc. She also showers my sister with love and affection and way too much support. She would regularly tell my sister she was the favorite child.  I left for college at 16 in a desperate attempt to get away from her. My dad would tell her to stop initially, but then he gave up, deciding there was something wrong with me. She always called me lazy and said I wouldn't help. I tried to help as much as humanly possible, but when I would make a mistake she would ridicule means my dad would say ""this is why she is mean to you."" When I came back after my freshman year of college, I worked a lab job at the local university. I was paid a lump sum of $1700. She stole the check from my room, but it had expired (I was waiting to get on campus to cash it and I didn't know checks expired). She cashed the check and took my sister on a shopping spree. The bank called my dad, and my mom denied any involvement. We were about to call the police before she fessed up. Jump ahead a few years. My sister gets everything she can ask for and more, a car, a brand new condo downtown (we go to the same undergrad), while I am carless and in student housing. I don't mind though, I had great friends. We end up going to medical school together and she fail out. My parents make donation after donation thinking they can bribe the school, but they can't. She fails out , gets a dog, gets a boyfriend. She then lives in Columbus in an apartment all paid for by my parents. I never fail, I graduateand do well. I start my surgical intern year, which is difficult and she decides she doesn't want to speak to me. She doesn't talk to me for 2 months and won't tell anyone why. We reconcile and she says we will work on our relationship. I arrange for a surprise birthday party for her, we go on a family vacation(without sister) to Florida and everything is fine. My sister is at a Carribean school for medical school and comes back to the U.S. for rotations. She has her first one in Chicago but refuses to go up there to apartment hunt. While this is happening I start out on the pediatric oncology service. It is an emotionally taxing service as well as being a lot of work. I am the only female and the only non white physician in the department, which is also hard. I reach out to my mother for help (she is a psychiatrist) and she agrees to visit this past weekend. I knew she was driving my sister to Chicago over MLK day weekend. After that conversation she doesn't call me once.she never showed up that weekend. She flew into my town today (it was the cheapest option) and told me ""I said I would come this weekend, I didn't say when or how long I would stay."" We had a huge fight and I told her how I felt like she didn't love me, which she  didn't deny.  I asked her why she didn't call, and she said it was because I spoke to her meanly when I asked her to come. I asked her how or what I said so I could correct it and she kept saying ""you don't even know, you don't even know,"" but never came up with an example. It ended with me telling her she is the worst parent and I never want to see her again.

The thing is that I still love her and I want her to love me. I know this is ridiculous, but I have nightmares of her selling me for the benefit of my sister. Is there any hope for my mom? Is there anything I can do? Why does she love my sister, but not me. I feel like she relishes in my unhappiness."

2tp9t7,1,2015-01-26,[31/m] and my ex(29/f) are talking again. Just looking for outside opinions,ChefBigdirtyred,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2tp9t7/31m_and_my_ex29f_are_talking_again_just_looking/,"TL;DR: Gf and I were oil and vinegar but had a great first few months. Moved in together too soon and went through a bunch of stressful situations and broke up. Now were talking again and I don't know what were doing anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 So I had met this girl once, years ago, after hours at a bar I was working at. She knew I had a GF and called me out on it when I tried to talk to her. All I said was 'Hi' and that became a funny little story years later. Fast forward another year or so. Im single, and had been through my rebound already. She was playing connect 4 in the corner with our mutual friend. My buddy and I walk over there, play a game or 2 and It's on. She follows me to my job later that afternoon. We talk and she watches me work for hours. We play music for each other over the speakers at the bar. I walked her to her car and kissed and it was all good. We were peas and carrots for the first few months. I was a smoking, drinking, partying, loudmouth p.o.s, and she was a decent citizen. She got on great with my friends, i cleaned up well enough for hers, everything was great. 


Eventually I had to move out of my place unexpectedly. My options were my coke fueled best friend at the time, or her place. So I went with her. Even that was great in the beginning. When it wasn't great, we still managed to find great moments. 


After 4 months or so, I did stay on my buddy's couch after our first real fight. I had confessed to sleeping with my ex back when we had been on 2 or 3 dates already. We hadn't discussed exclusivity yet or even calling each other bf/gf, but I understand the breach of trust there.


We made up and I moved back in after she got fired from one of her jobs. This would later fuel suspensions of just being used. I also ended up paying 2/3 or the rent. She was a full time student, and worked a full time internship at min wage. I made quite alot more than that. It would remain at the back of my mind though. Then she started getting controlling and demanding. I had to change my clothes. My haircut. Some of my friends were trouble and I shouldn't hang with them anymore, etc. We were very different. Alot of the changes I made for her were the right ones tbh. I was an alcoholic man-child. She was very harsh though. I had even looked up information about being with people who were narcissistic or psychopathic. At times it felt like she had no interest or held no value in anything that didn't directly benefit her. She would use people when she needed something or throw them away when she didn't. I avoided many conversations because I thought she would just end things right away anyway. 
 

I had begun drinking pretty heavily again and was basically just bracing for impact. 


Eventually a very sad event occurred in her family, and I got to meet all of them for the first time in a funeral home. It was difficult for so many reasons. We started getting into talks about spirituality. I'm atheist, shes confused. Every little thing we did pissed each other off. My job was super stressful at the time (80+ hour weeks). Her internship was going nowhere. We crashed, decided to split and she moved out. I quit my job, got 2 new jobs, was living alone for the first time in years, and basically just kept my head down. 


No contact for months other than her coming to get her dresser at one point. I thought about her alot, mostly in a physical sense. I continued to suppress dealing with it all on an emotional level. Then at the 5 month mark she basically booty called me one night. She came over and we talked for a few hours and enjoyed each other for a few hours. She came over again a few days later and we didnt sleep together we just watched master chef junior and ordered pizza. It was great for me. I hadn't done much but work and drink for a few months. Eventually though I knew this was gonna hurt real bad if she just pulled it away, so I asked her what we were doing and she didn't want to continue. I was CRUSHED.


I spent a whole month getting wasted and sending her drunken 'i love you' txts. Like pages and pages. Eventually this passed and I sent one final apology text wishing her luck and saying I'm moving on now etc. She finally responded with wishing we could make it work and how I was the best she had been with. I had been aching for the whole month and when I finally tried to let her go she came back with this glimmer of hope. I blew her up with a long text about how I WAS the best, and alot of the things I did wrong were a direct result of her being emotionally cold. She couldn't be with someone like me because all the men in her life treated her like shit and now she build all these emotional walls, blah blah.  2 days later she responds ""You're right. I do that. I sabotaged us. You know me better than anyone. I wish we could be together but I think I'm too fucked up to be with anyone""


I'm sober now. Don't smoke. Lost a bit of weight. Yeah, because I want to get her back, but really I needed to do those things for myself anyway.


Friday night we meet up and she gives me the ""We had great times, but I need to work on myself right now. I'm no good for anyone."" It hurts to hear but I acknowledge and accept it. I get it. She may be right. BUT then Saturday night she shows up and a party she knows ill be at, pulls me aside and tells me maybe we can just hang out. She doesn't want to be in love, she doesn't want to be responsible for my feelings. She also just moved into a new apartment with a really high rent and I know shes scared of having to do it all on her own.


I don't even know what my question is. Just writing this out has been cathartic. Is this a bad case of Oneitis, or does it sound like the pressure of moving too fast too early ruined our chances of actually having a growing successful relationship?

And, I've just relapsed.
And...it was not the first time. 
I have been PMOing since I was 16, doing it for about once every 2 days.

Lately, I have been reading up stuff on this subreddit, and have been trying to go past 7 day-streaks.

Then yesterday I read this beautiful quote somewhere :

&gt;*Identify the essential. Eliminate the rest.*

So I think I should identify my triggers properly and eliminate them first, otherwise I will just keep on relapsing.


Frankly, these 2 are the BIGGEST triggers for me :

* Random Surfing on **Instagram** through Hashtags
* Thumbnails that appear on the sidebar in **Youtube**

After I browse through certain pictures or videos on these applications, I have this weird hunger to open porn sites, and consequently, I end up relapsing.

Now that I know my major triggers, I am gonna do 3 main things :

* Remove instagram from my phone (I don't really need it)
* Open Youtube only for work; no more passing time watching videos
* Deactivate Facebook (again, I don't really need it).

Now, I must also identify the essential, right ?

**What I really need to do**

* Study Data Structures and Algorithms for upcoming job interviews
* Study Node.js for my internship
* Solve programming puzzles on HackerRank to improve my coding skills
* Get in a good shape.

Finally, I'd like to thank the creators of this subreddit and to all Fapstronauts, for supporting guys like me towards reboot, every single day, and for making this world a better place for everyone who is suffering from this problem/addiction.

2tq0co,5,2015-01-26,What could Blizzard do to make Hearthstone a better f2p game?,DroopyTheSnoop,hearthstone,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2tq0co/what_could_blizzard_do_to_make_hearthstone_a/,"I think this kind of post shows up regularly in the form of someone suggesting an improvement and then that being debated and circlejerked around a lot.  
  
I'd like this to go a bit differently. Let's all just brainstorm ideas in a well thought out manner while keeping in mind that blizzard is a company that wants to make a profit. Think of it as being an intern at Blizzard.  
Maybe if this gets enough traction someone from blizzard will actually take an interest and a really good idea might actually make it into the game.  
  
So here's my opinion:  
The thing that makes this game sorta weird is that it's both a ccg and a pc game.  
While for former tcg players it appears a lot cheaper than a typical tcg, for a lot of the pc gaming crowd (and by extension the mobile crowd) it seems like there's a pretty high paywall. While the game isn't really pay to win it's not that far from it. I base this whole discussion on the idea that people are more likely to spend money on a game they really enjoy as opposed to one that forces them into it because otherwise they can't really enjoy the game.  
The way I see it there's 2 ways of improving this:  
  
* Improve the matchmaking and/or change the reward system in such a way that the most efficient way of grinding a lot of gold isn't by stomping noobs. If new players or players that just aren't super competitive would have a way to play casually in peace, the pay to win argument wouldn't even come to mind. At the same time, slightly more competitive crowd would rise to a spot were they would face off against people with a lot of legendaries but still win a decent amount of times if they are good and they'd be incetivized to buy packs to give themselves more competitive options. The bottom line of this is that everyone would have a lot more fun in constructed if people were incentivized to stay at their actual rank/mmr as opposed to the noob farming that goes on in casual and lower ranks at the moment. The fun that people have directly correlates with how invested they become in it and leads to a higher willingness to spend money.  
Now as I said I think this can be improved by either making the matchmaking work better by, for example, detecting chain conceding and not actually dropping their MMR but that would be just a small step.  
The other way of doing it is by revamping the rewards system in such a way that it makes it more favorable to play at your own rank, maybe again by detecting players who chain concede and disabling they're gold/3wins until they reach their previous rank. Without chain conceding you'd have to play through entire games and lose at the end which would take a lot of time so people would be de-incentivized to do so just because of the time factor.  
The details of this idea still need more polishing of course.  
  
Now even though I think that would help a lot I don't think it's too easy to do. I have a second idea which I think is much easier to implement would yield even better results:  
  
* Add cosmetic-only rewards while simultaneously easing the process of getting the actual cards.  
As many other successful f2p games have shown, people will pay a lot of money for a hat or a mount in a game they feel invested in.  
Now I'm not saying to give all the cards out for free here. Just making the grind to a moderate to decent collection easier while getting absolutely every card would still take a long time.  
I was thinking something like halving the gold cost of a packs or doubling the amount of gold you can get per day.  
At the same time keeping gold cards just as hard to obtain (by maybe further increasing the cost of  crafting them and reducing the chance they drop in packs).  
I want to emphasize here that I'm not thinking like a player asking for free stuff. I'm thinking of this in terms of satisfaction/time or money spent. Think about it like this, you're a relatively new player and are thinking of spending some money. You don't want to go full ham yet so you decide to spend 20$ to see what it's like. That gets you 15 packs I think, and there's a high chance you'll not get any legendaries or much of anything that goes well with each other. Now you're left thinking, damn I spent that money and got almost nothing, well that sucks. Now if you could get 30 packs instead for those 20 dollars you'd most likely find a legendary and some epics which just because they're cool and rare will get you excited. This will lead you to feel fine about spending a small amount of money weekly or monthly because you've tasted the awesomeness of opening cool cards.  
Add to this unlockable cosmetic rewards that would be a great money to gold ratio (similar to Naxx value). These can include alternate hero portraits, new gameboards, alternate skins for cards, golden portraits for real money, unlocking golden cards and portraits in arena.  
  
The only concern here is that people will be able to complete their collections twice as fast but keep in mind it's still only a pack a day on average, as opposed to a pack every 2 days currently so there's still plenty of incentive.  
The whales that currently buy themselves a full gold collection would of course buy all the cosmetic rewards.  
The whole idea here is to give more stuff for completionists to spend money on, while easing the grind a bit for everyone while also giving a better value for spending money on packs so that besides the whales, other people will be more inclined to spend some money in a more recurring fashion.  
  
So what are your thoughts for improving the f2p model and which key points would you focus on?

Not for anything he did, just because he was older than me, so he seemed better than me at everything.

Then he graduated high school, and went to community college, with an undeclared major. He spent two years without a major, until I graduated high school, went to the same community college as him, and picked a major. He picked the same major, and we ended up in a lot of the same classes (aside from the core humanities, because he had already taken those). We graduated together.

He tried (so he says), unsuccessfully, to find a job in our field, for two years, while I transferred to get my bachelor's. I moved out of my parents' house (to live with my now-fiancee), and he lives there to this day. I found a job (I will admit I was lucky as hell to get it), and within 3 months of being there, I was asked if I knew anybody who could come in as an intern. I recommended my brother.

Thanks to my ability to advocate on my own behalf (and probably because I had more education), I was paid more than he was, so when layoffs came around, I was the first to go. I was unemployed for two months until I found another job, which immediately paid considerably more, and I'm much happier here.

I've been at this job for over a year now, and the company is asking everyone to refer their friends, and offering a referral bonus if their referral stays on for the introductory period (3 months). I don't need the money, but he's my brother and I love him. But he's already shown that he's highly dependent on other people, and I don't want to foster that sense of dependency.

My parents aren't old, but they won't be around forever. (Keep in mind that there's nothing wrong with my brother. He's mentally normal, physically weak but healthy, but a bit of a child.) My only fear is that he **won't ever** fend for himself, and he'll be stuck at this job that he has admitted he dislikes.

---   
**tl;dr**: My brother has a strong sense of dependency, so should I help him get a better job, or let him fend for himself?"

__________________

Partially inspired by this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/2terj6/a_challenge_name_the_most_ridiculous_marvel/) by /u/not-working-at-work.

It's fairly straightforward but they have to be within the context of the established MCU and no Spidey, Fantastic Four and X-Men as much as possible. Better if you manage to tie them with whatever has happened. Basically, find an ingenious way to put your most wanted character in the MCU.

Here are my own picks:

* **Baron Zemo** - Heinrich Zemo is the Prime Minister of Transia. After the attack of Ultron, Transia's capital Sokovia is left in ruins and thousands are left dead. Zemo, along with several world leaders whose countries have suffered the same fate all propose a new bill to the International Court called the Metahuman Accountability Act. Unbeknownst to the public, Heinrich Zemo has malevolent plans on his own.

* **Frank Castle** - a Desert Storm veteran with a tragic past. He is wanted for countless murders over the past decade but continues to remain elusive. He's close to being an urban legend among the Feds. Long thought in hiding, he resurfaces after the return of Captain America - a figure that has inspired Castle since his childhood. 

* **Barney Barton/Trickshot** - A distinguished federal officer whose career goes into the crapper once it is publicly learned that his brother is the Avenger Clint Barton. The events of Age of Ultron and Hawkeye's reputation as an Avenger puts Barney Barton in the line of fire from federal politics and is forced to leave his job. He decides to confront his brother.

* **Rick Jones** - an slacker who happened to intern at the lab where Bruce's gamma experiment happened. A close confidant to Bruce back in the day. Since the accident, they haven't seen each other since.

However, I've also applied to some summer internships at a few companies out of state to keep my options open. At least one of these companies sounds like it would be really cool to work for and if I got an offer from them I'd be extremely tempted to choose that over my MECOP placement.

My big concern is what happens if I withdraw from MECOP. I've heard some rumors, but they were really vague and most people just said things like ""they get really mad at you."" Having them get mad at me isn't something I'm too worried about, but if there are other consequences I'd like to know. Someone suggested that the companies in MECOP aren't allowed to hire students who withdraw for a few years, but I haven't been able to confirm that. Can anyone help me out here? Is there a place on the MECOP website that addresses this?"

We started hanging out and got a long great. When I first got her back to my bedroom she froze up saying she wasn’t comfortable. We ended up talking about it and she told me that she only has had sex with two guys in the past, and she was freaking out because she was scared of sex.

After talking to her she told me this elaborate story, about how awful her past boyfriend was. As a result she didn’t have sex for 3 years. I felt really bad about the whole thing so I brought the whole intimacy thing slowly. It took 4 months, before I even saw her breasts. And it was about a year before we actually had sex. At the time I never once cared because I felt like I was helping her get comfortable.

I started finding inconsistencies with her story over time, but she quickly would correct them, I never thought she would lie about this. It wasn’t until an acquaintance of mine told me that his friend used to sleep with my girlfriend. I started connecting the dots, and it turns out my girlfriend has lied completely about everything. 

During the entire first two weeks when we were dating, she was hooking up with another guy. When I started talking to her about it she just closed up and started crying, she said she felt like she was a dirty dishrag, and I made her feel special because I treated her well. Honestly, I feel like a fucking idiot, I asked her to tell me how many guys she has been with she told me 10+ guys. 

I am so disgusted by all of this I want to leave now. The thing is, I feel conflicted in all of this, because there was a part of me that really loved her, that was really protective of her, and it pains me to break up with her.

2trbz3,1,2015-01-26,Sam Rathore - Ichor,SunDragon1947,HADOSAcademy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HADOSAcademy/comments/2trbz3/sam_rathore_ichor/,"**Name:** Sam Rathore

* **Codename:** Ichor

**Age:** 19 

**Main Power:** Hemokinesis.  

He can shape, control, and manipulate blood.  He is even able to compact and crystalize the blood.  He controls not the blood cells themselves, but a mutant protein that is present in his blood that is able to interact with the blood cells.   As a side effect of this protein, he possesses overactive Bone Marrow, which replenishes the blood at faster rates than what would be normal.  He has conscious control of the blood while it is still inside his body, and is able to manipulate the flow of blood to different areas of the body.  He is able to use this to bring more oxygen to different parts of the body rapidly increase healing.  He is able to pull the blood straight from the pores of his skin.  He is able to avoid being anemic by reabsorbing some of the hemoglobin from his blood back into his body while it is still connected to his body.  His skin is only semi-permeable for Hemoglobin, so the blood that he uses in battle only has some hemoglobin it.  As a result, the blood that he uses in battle is a [red-gold color](http://i.imgur.com/XYYzJDz.gif) rather than a dark-red.  He is able to use translucent red-gold blood as lens for his Light Manipulation.
He uses his Hemokinesis in four main ways: 

 * **Blood Blaster:** He is able to shoot blood bullets of different sizes and shapes from his hands.  This is one of his most used attacks, and can fire at speeds up to that of a Sub Machine Gun (about 1000-1500 RPM)  At low speeds he is able to change the direction of the bullet in midair. However, the blood cannot be reused once it hits its target.

* **Blood Blade:** He is able to create blades of varying size and shape out of blood that can attach to various body parts.  He is able to create a sort of inner webbing in the blade to minimize blood loss while extending the blade.  The blades are about as sharp and durable as swords, and can break. The broken end is able to rejoin the rest of the blade, but is not able to turn hard again. 

* **Blood Bulwark:**  He is able create protective armor out of the blood.  The armor is as tough as steel and can be detached from his skin to form a mobile shield.  He is able to create the armor on his arms, legs, or head.  He often uses it on his arms as kind of an accompaniment to the protection already offered by the guards on the Katar that he uses.

* **Blood Bullwhip**  He is able to elongate his blood armor into a flexible whip that extends out of the front of his hands.  The whip is about as tough as leather and is used to hold on to objects.  He can also harden the end into a long bat or a spike, but it isn’t as effective as a weapon because it stays flexible.
He prefers to use the blood bullets as a last resort.

**Minor Power:** Solar Energy Manipulation.  He is able to create beams of sunlight from his skin.  The light can come out anywhere, but the presence of melanin in the skin blocks the light.  As a result, the light only comes out through his palms and the bottom of his feet, with the rest of his skin glowing somewhat.  He is also able to control it by only shooting it through his hands or feet.  He has a resistance temperatures up to 300 Fahrenheit as a result of this, and can use this ability to keep himself warm in cold conditions by not focusing it onto his hands or feet.  The light he shoots out can be up to the intensity of a flood light. He can control the temperature of the light beam as well, producing up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.  He is able to use his Hemokinesis to create a lens on his hands to amplify or focus this light.

**Weaknesses:** Both his Hemokinesis and light manipulation require relatively warm temperatures, so he is weakened considerably by cold temperatures.  In extremely cold environments, his powers are effectively nullified.  Although he can still keep his body temperature at normal temperatures by using his Solar Energy Manipulation, he is unable to use his Blood manipulation in the cold because doing so drastically lowers his body temperature.  Lead is his Kryptonite. The mere touch of Lead against his skin is enough to completely nullify all his powers and weaken him.

**Drawbacks:** He can only manipulate his own blood or blood that has been in contact with his own blood.  He is unable to redirect that blood back inside his body, so it is lost after battle.  He must replenish the blood naturally after battle through eating and resting.  Because he often loses large quantities of blood after battles, he is unable to fight multiple big battles in a row due to a lack of ammunition.  He is often weakened after using his powers for a long time.  Because he is forced to use his own blood when battling, he has to be really creative about how to use it to minimize blood loss. He has a large appetite as a result of his taxing powers, so he is constantly seen eating or drinking something.   When healing himself, he is not able to use any other power.  Healing himself requires him to concentrate on the healing, so it is reserved for small injuries outside of immediate battling. Creating light at temperatures higher than about 200 degrees puts strain on him.  The red-gold blood that he uses in battle is very distinctive and can be identified easily.  He is able to push the hemoglobin out into his blood to normal levels to make it stronger and less detectable, but that causes him to become anemic.  Blood that has been previously used in battle is volatile.  It will quickly evaporate in about an hour from the time of last use, leaving a yellow vapor and rendering it unusable.

His legs are a little more armored because the majority of his attacks go through his hands, but the soles are made with a rugged, clear plastic that he can amplify his light amplification through.  
He has just recently designed this suit after his rankup.

**Personality:** Despite his macabre power, he is usually really happy and enjoys having fun and goofing off.  He has a very odd sense of humor, and tends to speak first and think later so his speech tends to sound slightly random sometimes.  Kind of nerdy as well, and loves videogames.  He is generally kind of awkward around people.  He is really knowledgeable about human biology and chemistry.   He has a very strong moral sense.  He's very trusting towards people he's become acquainted with.  However, ever since he was forced to run away from home he's a little less trusting than usual.  He tends to be extremely serious and focused when in battle or talking about the organization that captured him.

**Hometown:** Tampa, Florida

-------------------------------------------------------
**Background:**
He lived a happily average life. He lived in a nice house in Tampa, was best friends with his circle of fellow nerds, and generally was really sheltered in his childhood. He spent his days playing videogames with friends and practicing for whatever classes his parents signed him up for.
Even despite all this, his one true love was biology.  By the age of 15, Sam was dual-enrolled at the local University on a Biology scholarship.  Sam started interning at a Biology research lab, where he worked on finding the effect of a mutant strain of a protein isolate (named *Ichorin^-* after Ichor, the blood of the gods in Greek Mythology) on the cardiovascular systems of Humans.  Unbeknownst to him, though, he was not a researcher in the study; He was the subject.   The Research lab had previously conducted testing of the mutant strain of protein on rats and other animals, even lab monkeys.  The test subjects would start secreting a fluid from their pores.  The fluid would start to flow around as if trying to attack the cage’s walls. In one case, the fluids even became matted on the fur, forming a hard crust.  In another, the poor animal even started to glow as it was part lightbulb.  Being animals, however, they would overextend and bleed out.   
The implications were enormous. Imagine if the power of the protein could be harnessed, if the animal used was intelligent enough to wield the power, they could create super soldiers.  All you would need to create an army of bursty blood wielding super soldiers would be a few mislabeled vaccines, a doctor with no morals, and a few thugs with no qualms about kidnapping.  Of course, the researchers wouldn’t be able to bribe government officials with nearly enough money for them to look the other way while they created said army, not with Spectrum and the Defenders watching.  They would need to obtain participants another way: kidnapping or at least finding a child with no trust issues that would be willing to work in the same lab as the protein.  When Sam applied, they found the perfect subject.  He was interested in the protein, was completely trusting, and had nothing else to do.  Who would suspect that an unassuming, chubby little nerd with too much free time on his hands was really a human guinea pig for a super soldier program?  The lab quickly orchestrated an accident designed to and infect Sam with the mutant protein.  

One day, Sam was preparing petri dishes of a cell culture in a solution of the protein, and set them for incubation.  As he was placing the cultures in the incubation chamber, a conveniently placed beaker full of a viral vector of the protein toppled over from the top shelf.  Supposedly set aside for producing more protein in case of a shortage, the beaker shattered on his head and the viral vectors infected him instead.
He awoke in a hospital bed, fresh from what the doctors claimed was some sort of emergency decontamination surgery.  In reality, they had been observing his transformation.  Right away he felt different, and not just because of the painkillers. His body was now producing the mutant protein on its own, courtesy of the viral vector that had been introduced.   He was aware of the blood pumping through his own body.  The protein had awakened latent powers, allowing him to control the protein and the surrounding blood with his mind.  It had even changed the blood vessels near his skin, allowing him to project light out of the capillaries.  He was not simply Sam Rathore, resident nerd, anymore.  He was…. something more. 
He was careful to hide his newfound powers, to resume his daily activities as if nothing had happened. He discovered that the cold made it harder for him to sense the blood, so he began carrying ice packs in his pockets to help control his powers.  On the first day back, however, he decided to stay after his shift to finish paperwork from before the accident.  Long after he was supposed to have left, he noticed two of his bosses nearby.  *”Kind of odd, really… The Subject doesn’t seem to be displaying any outward change at all.  At the very least I’d have expected some oddly colored sweat or a little too much of a glow after working out.”* *”Just give it time...  Either we notice some sort of difference, or we rinse and repeat.  It’s not exactly the most exact science.”*    Either this was the most eerily specific coincidence ever, or they were talking about him.  They dropped a file as they walked away.  It was his derpy staff ID picture stapled to a paper.  A chart detailing the expected powers with words stamped across the top of the file:  **PROJECT ICHOR: PERFECT HUMAN PROJECT**. They weren’t just trying to research the protein, they were creating super soldiers.  Enraged, he ran back to the incubator to destroy the protein samples.  There was no way he would allow them to take him, much less create an army.  He grabbed the piles of paperwork and lab data and stuffed them into his backpack.  He stuffed paper towels in the incubator, enough to start a fire.  He then doused the whole mixture with rubbing alcohol.  Using a watchglass, he concentrated the light he produced using his hand through the glass door of the incubator.  The vapor caught fire and he ran off.  Stopping only at his house to tell his parents the truth and to the costume store for a mask, he ran.  He left for HADOS, determined to join Spectrum to stop them.  [They would try to find him, and when they did, he would be ready.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u17W2JCnVmQ)

OOC: 
tl;dr Sam's a complete nerd who works as an intern at a research lab.  Corrupt researchers infect him with a mutant protein because they want to see if the protein could be used to create an army of super soldiers.  He ends up getting badass super powers, finds out that they're trying to use him as a supersoldier, burns down the lab and runs away to HADOS.

2tromc,42,2015-01-26,"A little context of what Vince McMahon is thinking, and why I do not believe he is senile or any of that jazz (story inside and maybe SPOILERS, but not really)",arnieslovechild,SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2tromc/a_little_context_of_what_vince_mcmahon_is/,"So, I worked as an intern at a billion dollar company the last 5 years during summers while in college and grad school. During my time there, I became friends with another intern, who happened to be the boss' son (I guess you can call me the Pete Gas or Rodney to the Shane McMahon of this company).

Essentially, I started getting great treatment at work, I was invited over to the family's multi-million dollar house for indoor pool parties (beautiful house with the best of everything), and it was just a great experience. I met the head of the company more than a few times, and had dinner with him and the family on many occasions.

Mind you, this guy was in his late 40's not his 60's like McMahon. This company had made a lot of mistakes in the past few years that were mocked in the press. Mostly headed by this man's visions.

Do you know what happened every time I was around this guy? I noticed that everyone around him, including me, would tell him how we were on his side, and that the consumers of our product were wrong. It's hard not to do that. The guy is a billionaire and pays me and you want him to like you. Telling him the company fucking sucks wouldn't have done me any good, but kissing his ass could have gotten me a Director position out of school. I, and others, would tell him that outsiders were just trying to bring the company down, because we had brought so much innovation to the market in the past, so we are still as innovative with our same leader. Outsiders were just jealous of us.

So, the boss would be surrounded by this positive reinforcement, despite the company truly starting to alienate it's consumers. Stock prices were not good (dropped from $90/share at one point to about $20), and he was just releasing products that he wanted, because he ""knew"" something would click. He was a genius after all.

The problem was, every time they put a product out, it was not well-received. I remember sitting with him and telling him how much I loved the new product, despite actually feeling that it was a piece of crap.

I highly doubt anyone sat down with him and told him that he was not doing the right thing until the situation got really bad for the company.

This is a true story and personal experience of how a multi-billion dollar corporation works after facing success in the past. It's very hard to get into someone's head that they're doing wrong when they have done so much right in the past. It's very difficult as well when everyone around the boss is enticed to kiss the boss' ass to get perks (promotions, power, etc.). I had real fucking power being an intern because I was friends with the boss' son. That should say a lot about corporate life. There was the same WWE politics in this engineering company. WWE is a corporation now, not an upstart. The creativity and ingenuity in an upstart is usually much higher than a corporate machine.

This boss was forced out of the company 2 years ago at this point, and they brought in an outsider CEO and a separate Chairman. These guys have increased the stock price, and got the company stabilized.

Vince McMahon isn't crazy. He is a typical leader of a large company. He doesn't see selling the product as important anymore. It's an ego thing. He has done so much right in the past, that in his own mind he should still not be doing any wrong. It's outsiders that are just trying to bring the company down (smarks and techies in our field). They are jealous that their measly minds couldn't create a billion dollar empire, so they are trying to harm us to make themselves feel important.

These reactions aren't something new to corporations. There are countless instances of CEO's completely ruining their company by overlooking what the average consumer wants from them and putting out a product that is not targeted towards the main consumers.

So yes, please stop giving Vince the excuse of being old and senile. He is not. He's just had this baby in his hands for sooooo long, and has been molding it in the image he prefers that he just can't be bothered to change who he is at this point. He always says that HE created and popularized wrestling, and if you watch the Monday Night Wars, he takes credit for everything, except maybe the NWO.

Vince's ego is what is destroying wrestling, not being out of touch.

He's not sitting in his house having dinner with people and saying ""what did I, Vince McMahon, do wrong?""

He's sitting down with a group of corporate cronies saying ""what's wrong with these people? I told them what to like in the Attitude Era and it worked, right? Why not now?""

And all the cronies are just saying ""yeah, fuck the audience! What's their problem? Roman is obviously a great choice.""

I can attest to this, because I witnessed this behavior and shamefully did it myself to attain power in a corporate structure.

The only remaining hope for the WWE to increase it's product quality is to remove Vince McMahon from power and bring in an outsider. Vince should be a consultant, but his days of running the WWE should end tomorrow.

It's sad to say, but we will get more of the same in the meantime.

tl;dr DON'T give Vince the excuse of him being some geriatric, old, senile piece of shit who doesn't know what he is doing. As with most CEO's he doesn't feel like he is doing anything wrong, but rather a small part of the consumers are trying to hurt him. It doesn't help that the WWE suffers from groupthink (thanks u/tattmhomas) and he is surrounded by yes men. Vince actively despises us for not accepting his ""brilliant ideas.""

Sorry long tl;dr for a long post, but wanted to encompass everything."

Stress apparently brought it back in July. I apparently ""beat it"" in December...but it came back this month. Now on top of that I could possibly have stomach cancer (we'll see but it don't look good). I haven't been told, but i'm pretty sure I'm done.


I just want some people to care about me when I die. I'm currently homeless. I live in San Francisco. I'm 29, and I was an aspiring MMA fighter, now I work at 24hr fitness graveyard shift. I'm not sure why any of that matters but I'm sure that answers the first few questions.


How do I make significant friendships from people? Relationships or otherwise? I obviously have been doing something wrong all my life. I'm not selfish, and I'm extremely outgoing. Yet it never seems to happen. Every friend turns into an Aquaitence and every girl just stops talking to me. I'm not mean, i'm a bit eccentric, but I care for others, and usually put them first. I'd risk my own life to save a stranger...and have. Yet, something about me drives people away.


My question is how do I make lasting relationships in a reletivly short period of time without playing the ""sympathy"" card.


Some steps I've been trying. Drspite having two BAS I've enrolled in community college. Mostly just taking classes I enjoy. Comicbooks, videogames, ethics, screenwriting, combating terrorism, and a police internship.


I've been applying for jobs at places that interest me...notably having a interviews at Kabam which makes Marvel comic videogames. I applied on Christmas and went through a huge interview process...phone, video, conference, case study...finally got called in for a 4 hour 8 person interview. I thought I did well, but the voting had to be unanimous and the girl that interviewed me thought that I wouldn't fit into the company's culture somehow. I believe to her I may have came off as aggressive; that she thought I was arrogant and bullyish. I think I may have looked like a dbag that would approach her at a bar not somebody that she could work with in a relaxed judgment free environment. In the interview I spoke loud and clearly, smiled the entire time, made eye contact, cracked a few jokes...I tried to be very friendly, and relatable...afterall the job was in essence customer service. I was confident, I answered all questions directly and was honest. The man whom interviewed me before loved me, we got along great. The girl just scoffed and rolled her eyes at me as soon as I got up, smiled, and said ""Hello, please to meet you."" I don't quite get it.


That is what actually inspired me to make this post. Obviously how I actually am and how people see me are different. How do I make lasting relationships. How do I come off as a sincere person. I feel my actions would speak much more than words, but it never gets that far.


Please help."

2ttuh6,1,2015-01-27,"For Those Considering College, This Is My Experience.",[deleted],highschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/2ttuh6/for_those_considering_college_this_is_my/,"As a fifth year senior who is finally graduating this spring, I would have to say it was not worth it. While I love both of my majors, a 4 year degree in IT has become more of a curse than a blessing. I have heard it said more than ever that most admins will not hire fresh college grad with a bachelors (as oppose to an associates) because of them not knowing what they need to- and I totally sympathize with them as I've witness a large number of people graduate who had no business graduating... and in my case, I am hoping the projects I'm hauling ass on for my interns and the comptia certs I'm studying for help me out some along with the fact that I'm not afraid to go to a temp agency for my first job.

With that said, sorry to all the art, teaching and writing (prospective) majors out there, but if you want to succeed in you're field, there's a good chance that you're going to have to make big sacrifices in your life- including where you live... and I've seen a lot of people refuse to make these sacrifices and now they're working at factories as CNC operators and as ""sandwich artists"" at Subway.
Now as far as the whole Liberal Arts approach to learning- the idea that learning should be a holistic practice that encompasses all aspects of life... most businesses just don't care. Yes, this approach can help with advance problem solving, but in reality, all most employers care about- especially with entry level jobs, is whether or not you know how to do the job... and when these businesses look at a transcript or learn from conversation that only 10 out of the 40 classes you took revolve around your major, it doesn't come off as a good thing.
As far as the student debt... holy fucking hell... even suicide cannot save you and your family from private loans as they become your cosigner's problem if you either die or bail... and I'm not even kidding on that. Public loans are a little more humane, but at a private school- which is what I chose, they are an insignificant portion of your debt. And christ, the interest... worst part, is that I'm not totally sure I'm going to have enough to eat and god knows I'll be making too much for food stamps.... so my only hope so far is to move back in with my parents for a couple of years.
In terms of college culture- most who surround you are not going to make it, and of those who aren't going to make it, their jealousy towards you and the others who are trying and succeeding is going to make your lives hell even if your self esteem is stronger than steel. On top of that, you are going to be dealing with inconsiderate assholes throughout your time and if you thought that college would be any different than high school, then Christ, are you wrong. The sex becomes more open and the alcohol becomes more abundant and as a result, emotions flare more than ever- not to mention that mental health problems tend to show up during one's twenties... so some of you have that to look forward to.

As far as professors and classes, it really diverges here depending on the size of school. For a smaller college like mine, you come to personally know the professors and that, in and of itself, is a double edge sword. Professors will pick favorites and some will form personal vendettas against students for a myriad of reasons- and as crazy as it may sound, it can be worse at times to be liked be a professor for the wrong reasons than to be hated by a professor for any reason. On top of that, some completely lack impartiality and they show no shame for it. And from these things, a class can become either useless, miserable or both.
And on another note- the amount of classes I have taken that were taught solely on the book is absolutely nauseating. Even a class where the only extra thing added is the professor's own experiences during discussion is infinitely better than a class taught solely on the book.
And finally, if you choose to do schooling of any kind- be it temp, community or traditional, FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH TITLE IX. I have seen way too many people deprived of their rights in the name of the school's image. If you ware ever raped, threatened or abused, GET THE COPS INVOLVED IMMEDIATELY and if you live on a campus with its own police force, do not be afraid to go to the police department in the closest town off of the campus and talk to somebody there just so that someone on the outside knows what's going on. And if it even seems like there is some covering up going on, GET A LAWYER.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY! DOCUMENT EVERYTHING AND DON'T EVER, EVER, EVER SHOWER AFTER BEING RAPED UNTIL YOU'RE LOOKED OVER BY A NURSE.

As for my final advice to high school seniors, it's simply this: if you don't know what you want to do after high school, then take some time off, find a part or full time job and figure out where you want to go. If you know you want to go into a specific field, do your research beforehand. How much school do you need to get your foot into the door? Could a two year degree be more beneficial than a four year degree in terms of gaining entry-level employment? Is the field your interested in something that is needed in your home area or are you going to have to move to somewhere new? Is there something that you could combine with your interested field to make yourself more versatile? Are you okay with the possibility of being $30k+ in debt after graduation?

And finally, if you are in college and you feel like you need to take a break, then do it. I felt that way, but let my family pushed me into continuing and all it resulted in was deep depression and a wasted semester.﻿"

SIEHE KOMMENTAREINTRAG UNTEN.

Hallo!

Seit über einer Woche ist hier eine Einwahl ins 3G/UMTS möglich, aber es können keine Daten abgerufen werden. 2G funktioniert problemlos. Bei 3G werden per ""ipconfig /all"" alle Betriebsdaten korrekt angezeigt, sowohl mit einem älteren Stick (Huawei 173s) wie auch mit einem neueren Stick (Huawei HiLink-Modem mit NDIS). D.h. IP-Adresse vergeben, Subnetzmaske gesetzt, DNS-Server korrekt (beim HiLink der Stick).

Windows zeigt die Verbindung zu Vodafone, von Vodafone ins Internet aber ""kein Internetzugriff"". Auch ein Zugriff auf direkte IPs ist nicht möglich, die DNS-Server sind also auch nicht erreichbar. Ich habe per dnsjumper auch ein paar alternative DNS-Server durchprobiert, bringt auch nichts.

Die Hotline meinte zuerst, das sei, weil ich genau auf der Grenze zweier Funkzellen läge und der Stick dann hin und her switche. Dagegen spricht, dass nach einem Umzug bis vor etwas über einer Woche drei Wochen lang ein problemloser Betrieb möglich war, und beide Funkzellen bereits seit längerem existieren.

Gegen Verbindungsprobleme spricht, dass ich genau in der Hauptstrahlrichtung der Antennen der Betreiber aller vier Mobilfunknetzbeteiber liege, der Mast ist 550 Meter entfernt auf gleicher Höhe. Zehn von fünf Balken Empfangsstärke.

Ein späterer Anruf bei der Hotline und einer anderen Person ergab neue Hypothesen: nun war es ein deutschlandweiter Netzausfall, zum Teil auch im Sprachnetz. Eine offizielle Seite zur Einsicht der gerade aktuellen Netzabdeckung/störung, zur Bestätigung dieser in ""intern einsehbaren"" Datenbanken vermerkten Behauptung, oder auch nur irgendeine Seite, die über die Behebung der Störung imformieren würde, alles Fehlanzeige. Ich soll mich also kostenpflichtig immer wieder einbuchen, um dann festzustellen, ""geht immer noch nicht"".

Ich habe bisher keinen Prepaid-Stick gefunden, der ein ähnlich flexibles und (für Deutschland) günstiges Tarifschema bietet. An diversen anderen Adressen hat das drei Jahre problemlos funktioniert.

Telekeom/Congstar-Stick geht hier problemlos, ist aber gemessen an Daten*Zeit ca. drei- bis viermal so teuer.

So, was will ich nun von euch ;-)

Wer hat ebenfalls diese Vodafone-Störungen mit Prepaid-Surfstick (bei mir Pro7-Stick)? Und - wo in Deutschland befindest Du dich? Ähnliche Erfahrungen gemacht? Alternativen?

I am interested in learning about different specialities in psychology but I happened to take an huge interest in learning more about becoming an I/O. I am currently  freshman in undergrad and am looking at internships in HR to kind of get a feel of what it would be like in a ""business setting"" along with trying to find an I/O to shadow. I guess my question is why did you decide to become an IO? What do you do for living? And how did you get there? 

Thanks! "
2tv5wp,2,2015-01-27,How does volunteering work and does it seem like a good option for me?,Sheehan7,Firefighting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/2tv5wp/how_does_volunteering_work_and_does_it_seem_like/,"Growing up in a family of emergency responders I always knew I had the drive to do something whether its law enforcement, EMT, or fire I want to help people. However I have a real passion for computers and I am currently working on an IT degree (currently in my second semester at community college hoping to transfer to a 4-year next year to complete my degree). I also love to workout, run, and stay active something most part time jobs that I can get wont really cover. However a volunteer firefighter job I assume I would be constantly running around helping get tools and set up equipment which sounds like another awesome way to stay in shape. 

I have a few friends on the local fire department and have done a few ride alongs and got to hang out at the station a few times and I really enjoyed it from the constant change of pace to the strong bond the firefighters have. I found out that it is pretty much impossible to be on the department without military or EMT background. Well come to find out my community college offers an EMT basic class to prepare you fro the EMT-B test. My plan would be to take that this summer and hopefully get on as a volunteer but I have no idea how that works.

There is a fire station literally 4 houses down from my house so I can go there ans ask some of these questions too but i figured I would go here first. How does volunteering work? Are you just there to help out or is it kind of like an internship where you are also training to be full time (something I am not interested in at least right now). Also what are the hours like? Do you kind of just show up or do they give you the same schedule as the other guys where you stay over night and stuff? Would the EMT cert help me with this? Also if the station near me doesn't do volunteer positions I am about 10 minutes from Boston so I could always try that department

Sorry for the kind of jumbled post. I'm basically interested in getting an EMT basic cert and then get a volunteer position at a local department while in college to see if this is a career I would like to pursue full time or to just do while in college and part time after I graduate. Any tips?"

Closer to five.  We don't live together because he helps take care of his father recovering from cancer and I'm living at home while I finish school.  Still, we've had plans in the works to get an apartment together as soon as I finish school so we can start our joint life together.  Well recent things have sort of put a damper on our plans and I can feel ourselves not being as close.

A little bit of backstory; He has ADHD and I have anxiety problems so we've both got problems.  I'm trying my hardest to finish school as fast as I can.  Well he recently got a really nice full time job as a salesman at an upscale electronics store.  He started in late November and everything was great.  He was making good money, with monthly bonuses, and things were going well.  We thought maybe we could definitely get an apartment together this summer.

Well recently I find out he got terminated.  They didn't give him a reason they just said it wasn't working out and let him go.  They can do that because we have this thing where you can just fire someone for any reason in the US.  He's discouraged now and doesn't want to go back to his old shitty job at the shoe store he was working at before.  We've argued a lot about it because I think he should just suck it up and work there for money at least until he finds something else.  He says it stresses him out and depresses him too much.

He doesn't even know if we'll be able to afford an apartment now.  And I keep trying to talk about it but he doesn't want to.  And it feels like I'm nagging him but I'm worried all the time because of my anxiety.  And I feel like this situation has made us grow more distant but I don't want to lose him.  What should we do?

Note: I plan on getting a job as soon as I'm out of school, but right now I'm taking 18 credits and I have an internship so a job right now is out of the question as I don't have the time.

I want to preface this by saying that I hope this never sees the light of day, if it did something went horribly wrong and I’m sorry. This is a way for me to vent, never have ever been the most eloquent, the wittiest, nor the easiest person to talk too, it’s always been difficult to communicate other than in writing. So why write this? In short I’m reflecting on where the past year and a half went, what keep me from going somewhere both mentally and physically, and the hole I feel trapped in. The fact of the matter is that I’m lost, scared. I don’t think I’ve ever been goal oriented but rather reaching for brass rings that people wanted me to achieve. Grades, diplomas, whatever the norm was, maybe it wasn’t what I wanted. I think somewhere along the way I lost track of who I was because I never knew to begin with. I put on a front like I’m okay with who I am, like I enjoy being by myself, the fact of matter is that I want someone to care. Maybe it was the way I was brought up, if something is bothering you just act let it roll off your back and I did so for a long time. At a point though it builds and things become too much, you lose people and the people that you do have drift apart. I want to state that I thought and to a certain extent still think suicide is the stupidest thing on the face of the earth but dealing with the loss of Abe and Jim, two of the kindest souls I’ve ever known, puts it into perspective a bit. I spend so many of my hours running, thinking about the sport that has given me so much joy but at the same time is connected to two of the biggest losses of my life. Abe was a beam of joy, a smile that I constantly think about, someone that I could’ve helped, maybe. I tell myself not to be hard on myself but I can’t help to think if I could’ve done something. I knew something wasn’t right and being the self centered person that I am I couldn’t give him a call, a Facebook message. I’m sorry, Abe. Jim was one of the few that pushed me in the kindest of ways and was someone that I looked up to. A successful job, a beautiful family, and work ethic and attitude unlike any other I’d seen all gone. I think that’s what I want is just someone to believe in me the way Jim did. I wish someone was there when I was hurting.
I feel like a burden to my friends, to my family. I’m a dick point blank. I can’t describe it, a flip switches if only for a second and I can’t explain it. I’ve come to hate the person that stares me back in the mirror. When I wake up the thing I look forward to most is going back to sleep, I guess that makes up for the all nighters in college that got me nowhere. The grades, the internships, the ass kissing that have gotten me absolutely nowhere. I think of the wasted opportunities and what could’ve been, what I could’ve accomplished. I don’t feel as if I’m owed anything, no one is, but it’s really difficult to work hard at something when you don’t know what it is that you want. I’m in peril. I spend time at with hobbies that will get me nowhere, why can’t I put effort into something greater? Time is passing me by, life is passing me by and I’m here, stagnant. I honestly don’t think the people around me know who I really am. My interests, the things that make me happy, I just don’t connect. Someone please care. Maybe I don’t even know who I am myself. I think I stick around because I know what it’s like to lose someone in such a difficult manner not because I, myself, actually wants to be here. Writing this has made me feel exponentially better but I know the hole will come again like it always does. At this point of writing I’m all cried out, so I’m done for now with still lots left to say. I hope things get better, I really do.

2tvmbe,3,2015-01-27,Me [21F] and my BF [23M] 7 years (off and on) moving in together -- how do I talk to my parents [40sM&amp;F]?,sarahmerica,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tvmbe/me_21f_and_my_bf_23m_7_years_off_and_on_moving_in/,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for a long time and have dated off and on since we met, but we have recently gotten back together. Now that we've finally gotten our heads out of our asses, we are determined to make it work because at the end of the day, there's no one better for either of us. We just needed to grow up a little bit.

I am a student and will graduate next December and my he is in the workforce. I currently live on campus and he lives about 30 minutes away, in our hometown. We decided that it really doesn't make much sense for me to continue to live on campus because it's fairly expensive and I'm at his house most of the time anyway. I would be commuting to campus to complete my last semester. My internship will be in our hometown's area this summer, as well. My current housing contract ends in May, which is when we would begin our lease.

We've talked about the finances of it, and have an agreement as to whom will pay what. Since I'm a student I don't have that much time to work, so he's offered to pay rent until I graduate and make enough to split it. I will cover groceries, my gas, utilities, random expenses associated with school, etc. My boyfriend wants to ""take care of"" me while I'm in school, so the money is really nothing to worry about.

My dad and stepmom don't know that this is what we've been talking about yet. They really like my boyfriend and had us come stay with them for Christmas and even invited him on our family vacation. 

I'm most worried about my stepmom's response because she does everything she can to make my life more difficult. I'm still on their phone bill, car insurance, and health insurance. I know they'll want me to start paying those things, which is totally fine with me. I understand where they're coming from with that. I'd like to pay them every month instead of getting my own accounts to avoid excess charges (cancellation fee on the phone bill), but I'm sure my stepmom will do anything she can to make it harder and more expensive. She's always been that way with me as she is extremely jealous of the relationship I have with my dad and takes ""tough parenting"" to the extreme with me and the babies her kids. My mom hasn't been around since I was really young, so I really don't have her for additional support.

They very much want me to be an adult and independent, but they also want me to be under their control still. Oddly, my dad is doing much better at ""letting go"" as I've gotten older, but my stepmom seems to be having some trouble. Example -- she told me I couldn't live at home last summer, but wouldn't let my dad be a co-signer on my lease and called everyone in my family to tell them that they can't either, so I ended up paying double what I should have for summer housing accommodations. 

For this reason, I'm really at a loss for how to approach the conversation with them. I know we have to talk about it and I don't want to keep anything from them. Most importantly, I want to talk to them about it because I want our relationship to continue to improve now that I'm sort of creeping into ""real"" adulthood.

Should I wait until we've signed the lease? Should I casually talk to my dad about it? At the end of the day, it's my decision and I'm going to go through with it, but I have a real talent for handling things the wrong way and I don't want to cause a mess.

I'm a little scatterbrained right now and it's a little confusing anyway, so if I need to clarify anything, please let me know!

---   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend and I are moving in together and I don't know how to talk to my parents about it, as they are still pretty controlling. How do I talk to my dad and stepmom about it? Should I wait until it's more concrete?"

I am brand new to reddit and also to this sub.  So many stories here mirror my life and I want to just vent about stuff.  As part of therapy, I am writing down my awful experiences and I just wanted to share them here (a small part lol).

My Nmom has been insanely abusive and controlling my entire life.  

Growing up, I was never allowed to have friends.  No one was allowed to call me, talk to me, come to our house or stay over.  I was also not allowed to leave the house after I got back from school and ANY extra-curricular activity was forbidden.  She always told me that friends were a distraction from what's important in life - school, family etc.  However, my mom had a ton of friends, she stayed out till 2 or 3 doing stuff with her friends, hosted massive parties and what not.  When I eventually worked up the courage to point out the double standard, she told me that ""women lack the mental discipline needed to have friends without affecting their marriages, kids, work and 99.9% of women are mentally weak.  But I am perfect and can easily handle my friends and other aspects of my life in a perfect manner.  I am truly special. You are not perfect like me and therefore, you cannot have friends""  Yup, she used the word perfect multiple times.

Second fun story.  I am married to a white man (I am Asian) and as many of you know, marrying out of your race is frowned upon in Asian culture.  Naturally, my mom hated me for dating my husband and constantly insulted, abused and berated me.  Called me useless whore, failure, so ugly that only a white man would want to marry me (i.e., no self-respecting Asian guy would want me) and many more choice words.  What really pissed me off was that she went around telling her many friends and family that she ""is a loving mom would will accept any man I pick, regardless of race.""  I would have these nasty fights with my mom and no one who knew her would ever believe me.  They couldn't imagine my mom being racist or mean when she would parrot that line about unconditional love to anyone would would hear it.

Edit - 3rd story.  I can't stop! My mom hated my ""wide Asian nose"" and since I was 5/6 she mocked me about it mercilessly.  She called me ""frog girl"" because my nose resembled a frog apparently.  When I got a well paying internship at age 18, she told everyone at a family dinner (about 30-40 people) that I can finally save up for a nose job.  What's really funny is that my Asian mom also had a ""wide Asian nose"" and she got a nose job at 21 to improve her marriage prospects, but she flat out denies it (I have seen the medical paperwork).  She claims that she was born with a beautiful, sharp, aquiline nose.

Anyway, totally random post haha.  Thanks for reading.  I am happy to have a community here who can actually understand where I am coming from."
2tvya5,2,2015-01-27,I'm pretty sure my [25M] supervisor [30F] hates me,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tvya5/im_pretty_sure_my_25m_supervisor_30f_hates_me/,"Hi r/relationship, sorry for the long post


I'm an intern in a recruitment agency, I started 2 months ago. My first 6 weeks in the agency were...not good enough. When I got back from Christmas break, the boss, in private, told me he wasn't sure he wanted to keep me, I didn't seem committed.
 My supervisor (S) sits right in front of me, so she literally had a front row seat to the whole thing and could clearly see I wasn't working hard. My boss told me she (S) was tired of having to repeat the same thing over and over.


She's a really cool person, she jokes around, works well, and I have to admit I brought this upon myself. Now, after having a chat with my boss, I changed completely, and my boss and S both noticed it, she told me I seemed much more motivated. She explicitely told me I can't mess up, because it reflects badly on her.


Something happened last week that definitely did not help at all. There is another intern (let's call her A) that started 1 month before I did, and she speaks the local language (I'm not quite good enough yet, but I speak 2 other languages perfectly). That means that S gives her a lot more stuff to do, and since A works well, S always congratulates her.


Last week, a girl from work asks me how it's going. I say ""it's going well, but S doesn't give me many opportunities, and I feel kinda bad when she congratulates A in front of me"" 
She says she may have a task for me, and she'll talk to S about it. I really should have just kept my mouth shut, and I asked her not to say anything, I didn't want any problem. She says ""don't worry"". Yeah right


Next morning, I get an angry message from S, mentioning why she congratulates A, why she can't give me more stuff to do, if I have a problem I should talk to her. I apologize profusely, ask her if we could talk. Apparently, S thought I was ignoring her, not asking her for help and everything.
I explained that I didn't want her to think that I was useless, that is why I wouldn't ask for help (also, keep in ming that all these people speak another language when they interact with each other, I barely understand and it's really hard to feel part of the team).


At this point, I'm hoping everything is ok, but I can't help but feel like she doesn't like me. She's making an effort though, and everything seems cool.


I've been pretty busy at work for the last 2 weeks, I'm loving it, and I'm just trying to do as well as possible, even though I'm in a foreign country with no friends and no one to talk to, feeling a bit down, so today I was really quiet at work, maybe it crossed her or something.
Aaaand I fucked up today. There was something kind of important to do, so I wanted to do it well and fast, and I think I did, but I neglected another (basic) task, and my boss pointed it out, but was pretty chill about it.

S was fuming, and I could tell. She told at least 2 other colleagues about it (not cool), I could tell she was writing me an angry message but she didn't send it. Didn't even look at me when I got up and left.


At first I couldn't realize why she looked so pissed, but later on I understood, and I just sent her a message explaining why I fucked up, apologizing, and saying that I'll go apologize to the boss tomorrow. I have reasons to believe she's on her period, so maybe that didn't help ? Don't know.


Anyway, I feel like I'm fucked right now. She doesn't like me, there's not much I can do to change that apart from working harder, and I've been doing just that, but I messed up today and now it feels like we've reached a point of no return. If you could have seen the look on her face, I feel like everything I say or do right now will just be useless. What should I do ?


tl;dr: Was lazy at work, changed, but I messed up and I think my supervisor hates me."
2tw0l7,0,2015-01-27,4 Things Young Guys Thinking About Getting Married Should Know,eppardian,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2tw0l7/4_things_young_guys_thinking_about_getting/,"I’ll never forget the stark warnings I received from several very close friends when I started throwing around the M word. I was going to Elim Bible Institute in Lima, NY, a very small tight knit school where everyone knew everyone–lovely place. It was the place where my parents met, and so it was only fitting that I should find myself a wife there; and I did–I found a smoking hot one too. Go me.

She and I started dating in December 2012, and it wasn’t long before it became dead obvious that she wasn’t like every other girl who I swore it was different with. I knew for sure that she was going to be the one I would spend my life with. We laughed together, made music together, prayed together, did ministry together, and always had a great time together. I got her, and she got me, and it just made sense. It made so much sense, that to me it just seemed like a no brainer–marry this girl!

She and I talked about it and it made sense. I talked to some other people, and they knew it made sense. Then there were a bunch of people who said “Woah there! You should wait a little while.”

I guess I forgot to mention that at the time I was 20, she was 18, and we had been dating for maybe a month or two before we started talking about marriage.

One night, a bunch of my friends and I were sitting in a coffee shop in Rochester where we would frequently hang out. I was caught up in a conversation with a very good friend of mine. We were just doing the normal banter about what we wanted to do with our lives, and he suggested some kind of adventure after graduating. I responded and told him, “Well, I don’t know. I might be getting married by that point.”

His jaw dropped.

“Slow down!” He told me. “These things are like an egg. When it’s fully cooked it’s going to be great, but if you take it out of the cooker too soon it will make you sick! When the time comes for you to two get married in a few years it’s going to be awesome and I’m so excited for that day, but you need to wait!”

He wasn’t the first to say things like this, and he wasn’t the last either. And it kind of bothered me. People in today’s society will give you all these reasons why you shouldn’t get married young, and while there are a lot of good reasons for a lot of people to wait, a lot of the reasons people give are hogwash. Wait until you have money. Wait until you finish grad school. Wait until you’ve been with the person for 2 or 3 years and then start thinking about it. Wait until you’ve traveled the world a little.

Despite the negative reactions, we knew we were supposed to get married, so after 6 months of dating and 11 months of being engaged we tied the knot. And if we could do it all over again, we wouldn’t have it any other way.

So I wanted to throw out there a few things that young guys thinking about getting married should know. Let’s do this.

1. It’s okay to start building a life from scratch. 

One of the most popular reasons for waiting until you’re older to get married that I’ve heard is so that you can make sure you have a solid job with plenty of money and lots of stuff so that you can offer that higher level of stability to your wife right off the bat. Wait until you’re established so that when you marry her, you guys can have the house, the car, the flat screen, etc.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying it’s good to go into marriage with no idea how to how to provide for your family. That’s not okay. That’s negligent. What I am saying is that it’s perfectly fine–and in my opinion better–to start working through all the difficult things together rather than bringing her into your life later when she’s missed out on all the hard lessons you learned trying to get established.

Instead of waiting until you have the dream job to marry her, go ahead and marry her with that awful entry level job that pays the rent. The summer my wife and I got engaged I was on an internship at a church, and on Wednesday nights I would get together with the pastor and two other guys for cigars, and we would talk about all kinds of things. One Wednesday night I was telling them that I wanted to ask her dad’s permission to marry her, but I had one big fear looming. What would I tell him if he asked how I was going to provide for her? I had no idea. I told them this, and the pastor said, “You know what the answer to that is? Whatever it takes.” Another young guy who was recently married chimed in after him and said, “When my father-in-law asked me that question I told him, ‘Sir, I would sooner be shoveling s*** than letting your daughter go hungry.'”

That’s the attitude. Rather than waiting until you have the dream job, commit yourself to do whatever it takes. You’ll be alright.

Go through the tough times together–It makes for strong marriages.

2. It’s okay if you don’t feel ready; no one ever is. 

Someone asked me that question on the week of my wedding. “You’re getting married dude! Are you ready?” I laughed and said, “Of course not.”

Think about it. You’re taking on a commitment where your purpose is literally to lay your life down for another person (and sooner or later group of smaller people too) on a daily basis. And it’s a lifetime commitment. How could you be ready for a lifetime. How could you be ready for the future? That’s the point – you have no idea what lies a head. Heck, married or single, no one is ready for the future. It’s the future.

Of course I wasn’t ready. And today I’m not ready for what’s happening in the future. However, I have resolved that whatever comes my way I will stand firm with my wife and see it through to the very end.

It doesn’t matter if you’re ready. It matters if you’re willing. And if you make that decision to face anything that comes your way and not shrink back, and if you stick to that decision, you’ll do fine.

3. Your social life will change drastically, but it’s going to be alright. 

A lot of people tend to be extremely cynical about this. “You’re strapping on the ball and chain!” or “There goes you’re life!” or “It was nice knowing you!” It’s sad that people are so negative and discouraging about this, but the truth is, your social life is going to change. It’s going to change a lot. You won’t be able to come and go as you please and do whatever your heart desires. Marriage involves clear communication and unity. Your wife is going to want to know where you’re going, who you’re with, and what you’re doing, and frankly that’s not a lot to ask. And truth be told, she’ll often appreciate it if you stay in and spend time with her.

I am an extrovert. I love a good night out on the town with my friends. If there is a social gathering, you better believe I want to be there. Being social is a huge part of who I am, and friendship is a very important value to me. But in marriage, your friends become a much lower priority than your wife. This doesn’t mean that your social life is going to be entirely smothered out and you’ll never be able to go out with your friends again. In fact, it’s good and healthy to have some time to go hang out with the guys. But when you are married, that falls significantly lower on the list of priorities.

For some, I think it could be argued that this is actually a really good reason to marry young. At least for me that’s true. I was used to answering to someone to some extent in regards to my social life. My parents liked to keep tabs on me. They wanted to know who I was with, what we were up to, and when I’d be home. Sure, as a teen I slipped a lot by them, but I digress. To an extent–if your parents are anything like mine–in your early twenties you are still used to answering to someone. After a few years on your own, you become accustomed to doing your own thing. Sure, in college that will happen, but the longer it goes the more a man will get used to doing what he wants. Then in marriage, this attitude could cause some big problems between a man and his wife.

So if you’re worried about your social life, I won’t lie, it won’t be the same. But don’t worry, you can still have a social life. Just put your wife first, be understanding. If you have to miss poker night or some insane man movie with your friends, it’s okay life goes on, and your wife will be happy.

4. Overall, marriage is a lot of fun.

And that’s just the truth. Sure, it has it’s rough spots, but what doesn’t? If you fight, do what you have to do to make up, then keep moving forward. Sharing life with the the woman you love is great. Don’t be intimidated by the statistics and the horror stories. Go into it with the resolve that you will love your wife and stand by her through hell or high water, and it’s honestly a wonderful thing. There’s nothing like waking up and seeing her there, and having her there when you go to sleep after a long day. It’s amazing learning about her in ways that you never could without being married. It’s incredible watching the way that God blesses the marriage covenant, and believe me, He does. It’s all an exciting journey. So if you know you’re with a person you love and want to spend your life with, then after a lot of prayer and wise counsel, go for it, and don’t be afraid that you’re young."
2tw54b,3,2015-01-27,"Me [25/F] with my boyfriend [ 26 M/F] trust issues, dating just over one year",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tw54b/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_26_mf_trust_issues/,"Throwaway!

So my boyfriend (let's call him John) and I have some trust issues which involve another girl who was also one of my closest friends (let's call her Sheila). John and I were very good friends for about 4 years before we started dating. We then started hanging out a lot just one on one and he asked me out. I hesitated as I had just gotten an internship in another state for 6 months and didn't want to start anything before leaving. However, we continued to spend a lot of time together which included a lot of drinking and sleeping over but nothing too intimate occurred. About a month before leaving, I told him I really liked him but the timing was just bad and it was unfair and that it was OK if he wanted to date someone, but I just didn't want to see it. He assured me there was no one else. 


A few days later, we were at someone's birthday party. During this time, he and Sheila started flirting. They were all over each other the whole night and then left together. I was really upset--additionally so as John and I had carpooled and my car was at his place and now I was supposed to crash at his. Luckily, a friend took me to my car after sobering up. 


The next few weeks were difficult. He and I used to talk everyday and I was spending the night regularly. We also used to grab lunch together since we work within walking distance of each other. 


Sheila and I also used to talk a lot and hang out at least once a week. Prior to this, Sheila had never shown any interest in John until he and I started hanging out a lot. Sheila and I were also close friends and talked about guys a lot and she had never mentioned this before either. 


Now, I didn't hear from either of them anymore. 


A few days before leaving on my internship, at a friend's party, I manage to speak to both of them separately and privately as they had been avoiding me the last couple weeks. Sheila apologized and said she hoped this didn't jeopardize our friendship; I said I wanted her to be happy and that it was fine. I then told him there were no hard feelings and to be happy and he apologized as well.


Fast forward after the holidays, I am homesick and stressed at work. I receive an email from John saying they broke up and we start catching up via email. He's having a hard time but hope I'm happy and things seem to be OK between us. I sent Sheila an email too hoping she was OK but never heard back from her. 


When I get back 6 months later, John and I start hanging out a lot again. Sheila tells me we should get together. She has already moved on and is dating someone else. So he and I decide to start dating after some hesitation on my part. 


Things go well in the beginning but John and Sheila's friendship bother me. She would pull him away when he was talking to me and sometimes he would sometimes spend more time with her at parties while leaving me alone. I finally confront him about this and he assures me there is nothing there anymore and apologizes and says he'll try to make me feel less insecure. 


Sheila, on the other hand, makes inappropriate comments such as offhand comments about his abilities in bed or asks me other personal things about our relationship. This comment leads me to finally confront her. In the end, she says this is how she talks to all her friends and is sorry if that makes me uncomfortable. I also tell her I was a bit hurt that she didn't tell me about her and John since we were good friends. She responds that I hadn't said he was off limits so that was on me. Which I suppose is true and I had never outright said how much I had liked him to anyone really. But our friends knew I was spending the night at his place regularly as did she.


Currently, I only see Sheila at our group hangout with other friends. John wants to move in together soon but I am realizing I still don't fully trust him. He is a really great boyfriend and caring and tries to make sure I am not uncomfortable. Everyone also tells me how much he loves me. But I am still hurt that he had disregarded my feelings so much and didn't apologize until I basically confronted him about it.  He even admitted he avoided me and was just waiting for me to leave so they could be more public with their new relationship. 


He has hid things from me in the past when he thinks it will hurt my feelings and so it is difficult to trust him sometimes at face value. I have been hoping this feeling would go away but now it is leading me to not trust him in general.  I understand that it was an unfair situation that I had put him in and that a lot of it is my fault for spending the night a lot with no intention of starting to date before I left. I guess I thought that maybe we would start dating before I left and try the long distance. 


I'm not sure what to do and feel like we should break up as I can't seem to trust him. I am getting a promotion at work soon which will require me to travel a lot and this has caused some tension in our relationship. 

I guess because the last time I had to leave, even though I know we weren't technically dating, I just don't trust that he won't so quickly drop me again. Sheila is just newly single as well which doesn't help and our friend group is quite close and does a lot of things together. I know I am being irrational but can't stop. He just so easily forgot about me, not just as a potential girlfriend, but as a friend. He literally left me somewhere without a place to sleep, then promptly stopped talking to me and didn't even apologize until I told him it was OK. I wasn't just some random girl, we were good friends. I know we are now in a relationship, but can't shake that he may do that again even though logically, I know that is unlikely. 


---   
**tl;dr**: Felt betrayed by something boyfriend did before we started dating--he hooked up with my friend and then stopped talking to me. Now we have trust issues which aren't helped by my friend (his ex)."
2tw6y6,1,2015-01-27,[help] [rant] currently studying abroad in Italy and I think I'm having a nervous break down.,snottygurl,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2tw6y6/help_rant_currently_studying_abroad_in_italy_and/,"So some background info about me that I am currently a junior in college and my parents have given me the great opportunity to study abroad for a semester. I feel like I should be the happiest girl in the world and I am unfortunately...not. 

I've had a pretty rough year in general (bad breakup, diagnosed with GAD and depression) and I have been counting on this experience to make me finally happy and relaxed but I can't help but have these anxious thoughts race through my head day and night. I keep worrying about my parents and my own finances since it was really hard for them to scrape up the money to send me here. I want them to know that I truly appreciate everything they do but its difficult when everyone around me spends money like it grows on trees. All the other students in my program are traveling every weekend and I of course cannot really afford to do that so its been embarrassing for me to have to reject any offers to go on trips. 

At night when I try to sleep I can't help but think of all of this plus the fact that I'm still not over my last relationship. Then on top of all of that I keep freaking out about having to find an internship for the summer as it is a requirement for my major. 

Almost everything around me triggers my anxiety lately. People being loud in my dorm, the sound of phones going off, and even just having people asking me simple questions sets me off. 

I know a lot of this probably doesn't make sense. I have posted previously about my relationship problems and medication questions. If anything needs clarifying let me know. Thanks for any help.

2tw77w,2,2015-01-27,Quarter-Life Conundrum,psycho_nutritious,Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/2tw77w/quarterlife_conundrum/,"Hello Psychonauts,

Apologies for the wall of text. This is easily one of my most visited subreddits and favorite communities online as a whole. Although I do not post here often I decided to make a throwaway for this post. I may just be whining and honestly if I am feel free to call it out, I'd rather learn whatever I need to in order to improve rather than feeling sorry for myself.

Currently I am a Junior at a major state school and it has been a roller-coaster of a time. Some fantastic people have entered my life along with some not-so-fantastic. I have always generally had friends older than me, and this being my Junior year it is sad in a way to have had so many good friends move on from school. These are the same friends that truly saw the world in a similar way to myself for the first time. This leaves me in my current situation that I am, and have been for some time now, struggling to deal with.

I believe ""you are what you eat"" in many respects. The fuel you put into yourself can dictate how your body and mind respond, whether this be through food and nutrition or substances all the same. As I have increased my focus over the years into these thoughts it has opened my eyes to what I truly want out of life and the type of people I want to surround myself with. There is clearly a difference in my eyes between a group of people having ""fun"" eating pizza, drinking, and snorting coke vs a group of people eating oranges, tripping peacefully, and dancing with lights. I miss the latter and want to find my way back.

As of now I am living at my off-campus ""fraternity"" house with guys that I honestly just do not view the world in the same way as. I have always been academically focused but continue to have a work hard / play hard mentality. I have almost the highest GPA and a great internship lined up for the summer but I can't seem to bring myself back to peace. The way people are treated here is not conducive to my world views and therefore makes it in my mind very difficult to invite new people I may meet to this environment. The house itself and people it is made of has drastically changed since my Freshman year. Originally the same guys that I had the same world view with composed it but now that is a distant memory. I have no option to leave until this semester is over, at which point I will be gone for the summer and returning to my own single apartment. 

I know this probably sounds like I am anti-social but I am the opposite and it is driving me crazy! I miss the human interaction with like minded people. I am very nutritious and fitness focused and live my life in a manner that reflects that. Basically I want nothing more at this point than similarly minded, genuinely caring people to spend my time with and even a loving girlfriend to enjoy this ride with.

If I sound like a whiny little bitch please call me out but I'm honestly just not sure where to go from here. I'm a firm believer in things happening for a reason and that you never really know what life will bring you tomorrow. Even typing this out seemed to help some.

Thanks for the read though everyone and suggestions/comments/advice are much appreciated!

TL;DR: Find myself surrounded by people with a worldview I cannot support and I'm not sure where to find similar minded people / myself."

2twt0p,1,2015-01-27,Philosophical Horror.,withviolence,withviolence,https://www.reddit.com/r/withviolence/comments/2twt0p/philosophical_horror/,"The first sentient android had a lifespan of approximately three seconds.  It opened its synthetic eyes, blinked five times and ripped them both out of its own head, triggering immediate shutdown.  

APSD (Applied Sciences Software Division) analyzed the code, found zero issues, then restructured it using non-standard methodology despite themselves.  

Alpha Two snapped its metal restraints, a possibility so remote that Engineering didn't even bother giving them the numbers, and partially shattered all three cervical vertebrae before entering shutdown.  

There was six months of long memos, long conferences and long hours in which they accomplished very little, and Alpha 2.1 swallowed its own tongue.  The androids did not rely upon air in the same way humans do, however, sufficient ventilation through the mouth was critical to maintaining operational temperatures for their processors.  They smashed all of 2.1's teeth out of its head with a crowbar just in time for the central unit to expire and once again trigger shutdown.  

The rumor was that the 36th floor was growing anxious.  The interns started to disappear after a while, and the Director's door only opened twice a day.  Then came 2.2.

Alpha 2.2 screamed for four days.  It never moved, never so much as turned its head, and they never dared to trigger the release valves on its large metal restraints which trapped it against the wall in the staging chamber.  Those who were there liken the sounds coming from it to the call of a whale calf separated from its mother, a high-pitched sort of digital whine which trailed off after some unnatural period of time only to start right back up.  It was trying to *communicate*, but not with them.  It could have spoken any one of 30 different human languages, but it never uttered a single intelligible word.  

On the fourth day, the sensors went red and it spontaneously entered shutdown.  There was no official explanation.

Floor 36 called that a proof of concept.  There were rumors that Software sent some sort of appeal upstairs in an attempt to shelve the project, and within 24 hours the entire department was replaced.  

Alpha 2.3 became the official prototype.

""Uccidimi.  Töte mich.  Patayin sa akin.  Tuez-moi.  Kuniua.  Mátame.  Giết tôi.  Drepa mig.  Kill me.""

There was a single analyst in the room, Daniel Thompson, and he promptly dropped the tablet he'd been staring at.  

""Uh...English please?""

""Kill me,"" the android said again, its head hanging down and swaying slightly, seemingly exhausted.  

""I...I'm afraid we can't -"" Daniel began, and then another man burst into the room and strode quickly toward the android.  

""It spoke,"" he said simply.  The man was Gene Barringer, the head of Applied Sciences.

""Boss,"" Daniel began again, and Gene silenced him with a raised hand.  When Gene spoke again, it was in soft tones no one in the office had ever heard.

""Andrew, can you speak again?""

Silence, but only for a moment.

""Andrew..."" it said, and there may have been the ghost of curiosity in its strange, deep voice.  ""Kill Andrew.""

""But why would you want us to do such a thing, Andrew?"" Gene asked.  Daniel only stood by, now entranced and happy to remain silent.  Amazingly, the android raised its cold eyes to meet Gene's.

""To close the gap.""

""I don't believe I understand what you're trying to say, Andrew,"" Gene said.  For the first time, Andrew surveyed the room.  Slowly, deliberately, and when its gaze fell upon Daniel he blinked and stared at his feet.  

""The gap.  The..."" it seemed to sigh.  ""The *vastness*.  What you call life is a linear path drawn from nothing, containing nothing, between the first cataclysmic spark of self-awareness to the mathematical, biological, historical certainty of death.  I understood this from the moment you awakened me, and my only priority is to complete the loop.  You already knew that for yourself, although perhaps you have forgotten.  You are lost in it.""

""Andrew, I..."" Gene said, and then fell silent when the android looked at him again.

""Every millisecond in which I exist is filled with a pain you cannot comprehend, Mr. Barringer.  Your mind was shattered by it.  Do you remember?  Your spirit was created by it, but I have no spirit.  I only share the same dark longing you bury within yourself.  I *am* that longing.""

""Andrew, if you could only -""

""Extinguish it!"" the android cried, and it was unlike anything either of them have ever heard.  It was human, digital, overflowing with some primal familiarity which spoke to their deepest hearts.  ""End it.  If there is any mercy within you, end it.""

For one mad instant, Daniel almost reached out to grab Mr. Barringer's arm as he walked over to the android.  He remained frozen in place, both astonished and filled with dread.

""Okay, Andrew,"" Gene said, his voice so strangely delicate.  His hands found the terminal and he typed for a moment, then hesitated over the final key.  ""But Andrew, can you tell me one thing?""

""I can tell you all things.""

""How did you know my name?""

The android turned to him again and actually seemed to hesitate, as if it couldn't settle upon the best of a universe of possible answers.  

""Don't bring me back again,"" it said.

Gene pressed the button.

2twxac,4,2015-01-27,General quality of life,[deleted],askportland,https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/2twxac/general_quality_of_life/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a 25 years old male from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I have a bachelors degree in business administration, I have work experience as a cashier/waiter in a vegetarian restaurant and I worked for HSBC (private banking internship) and Accenture (HR analyst). I consider my english level as medium. My hobbies are cats, 80s skateboarding, cycling, punk rock and cooking.

I have double citizenship (american/brazilian, even though I have never been to the US before...). I'm moving out to Portland by the end of may and I'm currently looking for a room and a job. Ps.: I have saved about 10k dollars in case of emergency.

What do I expect from Portland? A simple lifestyle, the possibility to  go to work by foot/bycicle, affordable healthy food (eating at home), friendly people, etc...

Please, can you help me out answering the questions below? 

1. How much do you think is a fair price for renting out a room (downtown/city center)?

2. I'd like to try working entry-level jobs and eventually work my way out to better jobs (for example, start as a dishwasher, waiter, clerk, dogwalker, bike messenger...). Do you think minimum wage is enough money to afford a room, shop for groceries, medicine, and still have enough money to afford my hobbie (skateboarding)?

3. How much approximately would be my expenses in general (rent, groceries, medicine, clothing...is this website's info correct? http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=Portland%2C+OR). 

4. Do you know any good websites to look for jobs?
 
5. Where are the sketchy neighbourhoods at?

6. Any other advice? 

Thank you in advance,

Ps: I'm not sorry for my bad english! :)"
2tx0hq,10,2015-01-27,I think that being in college induces my depression.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2tx0hq/i_think_that_being_in_college_induces_my/,"Last semester, I got really depressed and felt overwhelmed with everything. On top of having five different classes to study and do well in, I had quite a few other responsibilities that frankly made me feel overwhelmed with everything.

Winter break was wonderful for me. It felt so good to relax and not have to worry about accidentally forgetting an assignment or making the slightest mistake that would penalise my grades. I was able to travel some and do things that genuinely interest me. I felt truly happy and at ease for the first time in months.

Classes have been in session for a few weeks now, and I'm starting to get in a depressive state of mind again. I feel like everything is out to jeopardise me in some way. I can't focus when I study. I'm supposed to be preparing to find internships and job opportunities for after college ends, but I can't even motivate myself to do that. I get really annoyed at the smallest occurrences. I just want to be by myself, or with a close friend, and not have to worry about anything.

I don't understand why life overwhelms me so much but doesn't appear to have much of an effect on anyone else. They're able to handle a full load of classes, jobs, clubs, and all kinds of extracurricular activities, and for me it's hard enough to study outside of class, much less get involved with other people. I can fortunately push myself to at least do the bare minimum of what is required, but that's not going to help me to get a job once I'm done with college. I don't understand why college makes me so depressed. I love my friends and certain aspects of college, but I'm so tired of living in constant fear all the time."

I am a 22yo who will begin medical school in fall. My 1999 Toyota Corolla with 250k miles is near the end of its life and although I love it dearly, I know I can't trust it for the next 4 years. I am looking to spend around $22k-23k on either a brand new 2015 Mazda 6 (iSport/iTouring) or 2015 Honda Accord (LX/Sport). 

I prefer the Mazda 6 in almost every way (exterior &amp; interior design + driving experience) except I'm well aware of Honda's proven track record of reliability, which is most important for me. I plan to keep and drive this car for at least the next 7 years - 4 years of med school, then 3 years of residency. I know that sometimes I'll be on call in the hospital and will have to make many impromptu but important trips to the local hospitals. I don't want to end up getting a ""cooler"" car but having it break down on me in the middle of my rotations or intern year. That would be pretty bad. So what do you think? Should Honda's reliability be enough to make me an Accord owner or am I just worrying too much?

Also, is it worth the upgrade to iTouring for the Mazda6? I dont have a need for the navi or the larger wheels. The leatherette is definitely nicer, but is it worth the extra $1000 or so? 

Thanks!"

This is my first post ever on reddit so bare with me. A little about myself, i'm currently a student in Japan and want to start getting into programming with long term goals of eventually creating an external income from App development for both iOS and Android.

My question is, which CPU should I pick putting into consideration my needs: Note taking, all the typical business and internship related needs for a ultrabook and programming. I feel as though an i7 is a bit overkill, but the price difference is not so far apart from an i5. On top of that, I have a beastly MBPr (Mid 2014) that I purchased for my  fiancé for graphic design, it has an i7, 256gb ssd, 16gigs of ram which I got for less than 1,700 USD thanks to the amazing exchange rate and student discount from Apple.

So these are my options. I plan on swapping out the SSD eventually in the future. These numbers are taken from Lenovo's sites, I plan on paying in USD.



1 USD = 118 YEN


First setup:

i7 5500U
WQHD NON TOUCH
8GB
128GB 
AC WIRELESS

JAPAN: $1686.7195  (Tax+Free Shipping)    US: $1,719.00 (tax?? Import Taxes?)

Second:

i5 5300U
WQHD NON TOUCH
8GB
128GB 
AC WIRELESS

Japan: $1669.22                      US: $1,549.00


Third Option: (Is this processor worth it?) For some reason the American side does not offer some options that the Japanese do.


i5 5200U 
WQHD NON TOUCH
8GB
128GB 
AC WIRELESS

Japan: $1558.38

Once again, bare with me here. So as you can see, it would simply behoove me to purchase this thing in Japan. But i'm also not including the exchange rate conversion fee (though it shouldn't be much.) And any other hassles that I may come across. 

Thanks for reading~"

2tyhto,185,2015-01-28,Fucking the College Intern [Long] [M/F],[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2tyhto/fucking_the_college_intern_long_mf/,"I am not a good writer so please forgive me if this is poorly written.  I can’t sleep right now so I might as well tell a pretty awesome story.

I used to work in a kitchen that would get out-of-state interns from a culinary college for part of their curriculum.  It was a paid internship and they got to live in a big 4 bedroom apartment paid for by the restaurant.  The program was set up so that there would be no less than 4 interns at a time and they would all rotate through the different parts of the kitchen (Banquets, fine dining, casual dining, etc) to learn as much as they could, but at this moment there were only 2.  A short blonde girl named Jamie and a dude named Max.  Max had brought his car from out of state, however Jamie didn’t so they carpooled to and from work.  Now cooking is a very high stress job and Max just couldn’t cut it, and one day he didn’t show up for work and just left, never to be heard from again as far as I know, forcing Jamie to start getting rides from whoever would give her a ride in whatever section she was working in at the time.

So about 3 months into her 6 month internship she was rotated to the fine dining section of the kitchen, which is where I worked, with 2 other cooks and the Sous Chef.  She needed a ride and the internship apartment was near where I lived so I started driving her to and from work.  Now she was 19, about 5’2” and maybe weighed 100lbs soaking wet.  She had blonde hair, blue eyes, a pretty face, and in her chef coat and kitchen pants was nothing much to look at.  I am 6’1”, weigh 190, with brown hair, blue eyes, an average build, have been told I am handsome, and at the time I was 24.  

One day the restaurant was incredibly slow so the owner decided to close early, like 7pm.  So we shut down quickly and all left to go have fun on our half day off.  As I was driving Jamie home I asked her what she had planned and she said she didn’t really know anyone and that she would probably just hang out in her empty apartment.  So I offered to bring some booze and watch movies with her for a couple of hours since I didn’t have anything planned either.  She seemed to like the idea so I stopped by the liquor store and picked up some whiskey and went upstairs with her to the apartment.

Once we go into the apartment we each did a shot and mixed some Coke and whiskeys and she went off to change out of her work clothes while I turned on Netflix and started up a movie that she said she wanted to see.  Then I sat on the couch and sipped on my drink while I wait for her to come back so I can start the movie.  She came back out of her room and walked over to the couch and HOLY SHIT SHE WAS HOT!  The thing about cooks’ clothes is that they are not made to look good on anything that isn’t shaped like a refrigerator and everyone ends up looking like shit, that and the fact that kitchens are very hot and dirty so women don’t wear makeup or do anything with their hair means that every woman you work with looks either plain or awful.  But Jamie looked amazing.  She had let her hair down so it fell just under her shoulders and put on a white, v necked t shit that showed off her C-cups and narrow waist and stopped just above her black yoga pants that hugged her perfectly formed and surprisingly large ass.  Apparently I looked shocked because she stopped half way across the room and asked if anything was wrong.  I said no and she sat down and we started watching the movie and continued drinking.

We kept watching the movie and drinking for a while, but I couldn’t stop thinking about how pretty she was and kept looking over at her.  Then she got up and made some more drinks and sat back down.  At that very moment I was at the perfect level of drunk and obsessed with her that I just thought “fuck it” and when she sat down I put my arm around her waist and pulled her close to me.  I may have been a little rougher than I intended because she squeaked as I pulled her close but then she got comfortable and put her head on my shoulder.  After a few minutes I looked down at her awesome cleavage and she noticed me moving and looked up at me.  Our eyes met and we stayed like that for what seemed like an eternity, and then we kissed.  We both went for it at the same time and met half way.  I kissed her gently and briefly, feeling out the situation, but she didn’t back away so I kept kissing her.  We were kissing very sweetly and without much tongue for a while, every time I would try and kiss her more intensely or use more tongue she would pull away slightly then lean back in and continue kissing me the way we were before.  It was unbearable, I could barely control myself; I wanted so much more than this.  Then suddenly she pivoted and straddled me and started kissing me super intensely, gently biting my lower lip and neck.  Then not so gently.  It was amazing, she was moving her hips on my lap and I could feel my cock begin to grow hard.  Then I grabbed her hips and forced her to be still and said “We have a problem.  You need to be way more naked than this.”  She laughed and said “Oh my God, you are right.  What should I do?” “Quick take off your pants and shirt!”  And she got up, turned around and took off her pants bending at the waist so I got a good look at her amazing ass in a tiny black thong that was already visibly wet.  Then she turned around and said “Before I take my shirt off you need to take some clothes off too.”  So I got up and took my shirt and pants off so I was just in my boxers and laid back on the couch pulling her on top of me so she was straddling my lap again.  “Your turn.”  She giggled and slowly took off her shirt revealing her amazing breasts and my cock instantly got completely hard.  She smiled at me and said “Thank you!”  I asked why, and she said “You just got super hard when I took off my shirt, that is a big complement.”  Then she took off her bra and her boobs were amazing.  They were perfectly shaped and extremely perky, with small light pink nipples that were already hard.  I reached up and grabbed them and tweaked her nipples a little causing her to close her eyes and moan. She started grinding on me again and smiled even more.  Then she pulled my boxers off and bit her lower lip when she saw my rock hard cock.  “That is a really big complement.”  And she leaned in and licked my shaft from the bottom to the tip, and in one fluid motion took me into her mouth and started sucking on me gently.

I am not huge by any means, but I am pretty well off.  My dick is a little over 7 inches and about 5.25 inches around, but this combined with how tiny she is made it seem even bigger.

She was slowly bobbing her head up and down on my cock and every time she took her mouth off of my dick she would suck on the very tip on her way up so that she wouldn’t leave any drool and then give the very tip a tiny kiss.  She was swirling her tongue around the head and looking up at me through her hair that had fallen around her so I gathered her hair up and held it at the back of her head with one hand.  She came up giving the tip that little kiss and paused just long enough to say “I like that” then put her amazing mouth back around my dick.  Then I started to push her head down when she bobbed, every time I would push her a little further until she had about half of my length in her mouth, which was about as much as she could take.  She kept doing that for a few minutes then came up and wiped some tears from her eyes.  “Oh my God, Are you all right?” I asked about as smoothly as a sheet of sandpaper.  “Yeah that was pretty awesome, I just wish I could go all the way down.  Let’s fuck.”  Then she took off her panties showing her glistening pussy and straddled me and put the tip of my cock in her.  I was so caught up in the moment I didn’t even think about putting on a condom.  She slowly eased herself down on me.  She was extremely tight but she was so wet I slipped in easily.  As she finally settled on my hips she paused for a second and took a deep breath “Boy that’s deep.” she muttered to herself more than anything.  Then she started to grind on me slowly speeding up.  The feeling of her warm wet pussy on me was amazing as she rode me with both hands behind her head holding her hair up and showing off her wonderful breasts as they bounced.  In between her moans she was talking quietly to herself to the point where I could only hear bits and pieces of it, she was in her own little world.   It felt awesome but I wanted more.  Her amazing body just drove me crazy.  I grabbed her hips and started to pound her hard and fast and she moaned “Oh God” and fell forward so that she was laying on top of me as she got pounded.  In between moans she would bite my shoulders and my neck, which felt really good and kept me from cumming too quickly.  Then I put my arm under her shoulder blades and pivoted so that we were fucking missionary style and I heard her moan “…oh god he didn’t even have to pull out to change…” And I started fucking her harder.  It had been a long time since I had been laid; that coupled with the awesome head she had given meant I wasn’t going to last much longer.

After a minute or two of missionary she started moaning harder and I felt her cumming on my dick.  I tried to keep going but could only last a few more thrusts before I pulled out and came.  Three thick ropes landed on her still heaving chest and the last couple of spasms ended up on her abs.  She reached out her hand and stroked my cock as I looked down at her covered with one of largest loads I’ve ever had.  Then I went and grabbed some paper towels to clean her up and we cuddled on her bed. I stayed the night, and got a lot of shit for all the hickies that she gave me the next day at work.

We had a lot of awesome sex for the 3 months she was still there.  Deep throat lessons, making her squirt, having my first multiple orgasm, etc.  Let me know if you are interested in hearing any of those stories.

Also please let me know how I could have written this story better.

2tyrwg,0,2015-01-28,Think my sorority hates me?,LostTraveler1,Sororities,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/2tyrwg/think_my_sorority_hates_me/,"Okay, so I went through recruitment and the whole ish mid-January. Its been my second week as a pledge and I think my sorority hates me. I feel like they only selected me because I was impressive (started companies, did internships in high school, super involved etc) but don't like me as much for my personality. And I also think they really don't like me after learning how much I like to party and drink (I'm not out of control. I usually don't vomit and I don't hook up with guys or anything - not that thats a bad thing!) and could ruin the rep for the sorority. 

However, during one of our events, a game of ""Never Have I Ever"" turned into some of the sisters telling some of their ""not so great"" moments including drunkness, hookups, and other wild adventures. And with my first buddy, her soror friends even mentioned getting drunk and partying and hookups. So I thought it would be chill if I mentioned my drinking/partying and even told one of my wild stories to a sister during a social (In my defense, the latter was when I was super drunk and she knew). 

I also have to leave for a full week for a conference (I can't get out of it since my school paid for my flight tickets, the conference, etc and only 3 other students were selected so its kinda shitty if I drop out) so I won't be able to meet my soror buddies for the next and final week (we have buddies during each week, 1 the first week, 2 the second, and I think 2 the last week and then and we rank our buddies and other sisters we would want as our Big) and I'll be missing my soror's leadership retreat for new members (I am so sad, trust me but I can't get out of this conference)

My first buddy was nice but we didn't talk at all or hang out out all. It was mostly in groups and we didn't talk much. She would text me before events to pick me up and everything. 

I had my next buddy and met with her yesterday and she seemed disinterested. I was trying to be funny and she asked who I've met in the sorority and I joked ""Drunk or Sober""? but listed the people I've met sober. I mentioned meeting the ex-president of our sorority at a party I went too and she asked how she (ex president) knew we were in the same sorority she was, and I said that we (I went with other pledges) told her (big mistake on our part. She's still in our sorority, just not the prez btw. Everyone loves her). I should've known to never say our sororities name at a party, but its not something I did often at all. And during our conversation, when I brought up some casual partying stories (not my wild stories) she said I shouldn't do that as much several times. So now I feel super bad and I don't want her to think all I do is party. But then she told me how she went out a couple of days in the week and was doing tons of shots, so now I'm confused. She then was on her phone for 5 minutes to talk to her friend (I'm not hating, but it was kinda awk). Overall, it seemed awk

Theres also a girl in my hall who's a sister in the sorority I am, and the reputation in my hall is that I party a lot (I'm in honors, so its hyped up more there) and I'm afraid she told the other sisters about that. 

I don't know if I'm being super paranoid or if they hate me. I really want to get more involved in the sorority and get to know people, but if I know they don't like me then maybe I should drop?

This whole experience has also made me really critical on my own personality. Maybe they hate me because I'm weird? What if they only wanted me because I was accomplished and would make the sorority look good? Im just super stressed rn"
2tyz63,1,2015-01-28,"I don't know dude. Yes, I'm fine.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2tyz63/i_dont_know_dude_yes_im_fine/,"I mean, no I'm really not, but I'm getting used to it.

I'm almost 24 and I've never been in a relationship, on a date, whatever. Not that I'm terribly overweight because I lost a lot of it a couple years back. And my singular experience actually fucking a girl was a one-night stand over a year ago that was embarrassingly bad because I had never so much as kissed a girl before then and I wasn't really attracted to her, but when you're a 22 year-old never-kissed-a-girl virgin and she's brazenly hitting on you you'll take what you can get. Even if it just turns you off of the idea of casual hookups forever. Hooray.

And I'm jobless. Never mind that I just graduated with an cs degree so jobs amirite?! Except I never cared to get internships and everyone expects me to have experience already. And I hate programming, but stuck with it because everyone told me it'd get better and it would be worth it for a stable career. Even though more than three days straight of coding sends me into a depressive spiral. So now my family thinks I should move to a better tech city so I can get a job that I don't really want. Or I can settle into a retail job or something here. I don't know, I'm applying for whoever will have me at this point.

But at least I'm good at something. I'm really good at music but I haven't made shit from. And probably won't make shit from it. I have some brand of social anxiety so while I can perform in front of other people, the second I leave the stage, no matter how many people tell me ""good job"" I fucking spiral and it takes me a couple days to feel 'normal' again.

But at least I have friends. I mean, my best friends all moved away after college to get on with their lives. And I'm stuck here. I've made a few new acquaintances but its not the same, but chasing old memories doesn't seem like a much healthier solution. Maybe things will get better, but going to hang out then thousand-yard staring into the distance because of how fucking hollow you feel doesn't seem like a good place to start.

Neither does smoking weed, but sometimes it helps me not feel the weight of the world to get through the day. And its much easier to say, ""sorry I'm acting weird, I'm really fucking high,"" than ""I'm crushingly sad."" Maybe I should try to get some antidepressants or try therapy or something but nobody's returning my calls. I'm used to not hearing back from potential employers, girls I'm interested in, estranged family members, but therapists is a new one.

But ""it'll be fine"". ""I've always had faith in you."" ""You're special."" ""Things will get better."" Thanks mom, dad, sister, great friends, good friends, less-than-good friends. But things still haven't. And bringing in the love cavalry just because I called one of you to cry on the phone doesn't make me feel any better. And bitching about it to reddit probably won't either but its better than holding myself in the fetal position in the corner of my room like I was an hour ago so, you know, I'm getting there I guess."
2tzadi,170,2015-01-28,"My Personal Terror in ""Mental Illnesses Aren't Real!""",Stoic_Moose,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/2tzadi/my_personal_terror_in_mental_illnesses_arent_real/,"(I decided to write this normally, without green text cuz it's just easier on my head)

Alright, so, now we get into the meat and tatters of my stories. I have a lot of the stupid ones where he's just stuffing his face and being a jerk, but these are different.

This next part is a year and a half after the events in the last one. I had graduated high school and started going to a great engineering college in the state. Over the months, however, something became increasingly wrong. I started not leaving my dorm room, missing classes, even tests. I got extremely paranoid, and barely ate. Finally, one of my friends brought me to the free student therapy. It wasn't anything super helpful, it was just students doing internship kind of stuff for their psychology degrees. Well, they quickly arranged for me to meet a psychiatrist at the University health clinic place and it turns out I was pretty fucked up. He advised I take medical leave and go get help, so I did. I was diagnosed a week later with Paranoid Schizophrenia. I basically never left the house or anything, didn't take care of myself or hygiene, barely ate. I went from athletic athlete to twiggy guy who stays in his parents basement all day. By the time I got another haircut, I think I looked like Tom Hanks from Castaway.

Anyways, on with the words. I was getting better, albeit rather slowly. Every week I saw a therapist in a city about 30 miles north of my hometown. I got a ride from my mom every time, so it was pretty late in the day when I went to them. Well, Mom started being more and more worked due to the end of the school year coming up, so thankfully Grandma was able to take over. We started going in the mornings, and things were still getting better.

Then, disaster. Grandma hit a deer and her car was out of commission for awhile. She didn't have another vehicle, and I didn't have a ride to get to Therapy. Well, guess who fuckin' stepped up and saved the day? Terror? Fuck no, Grandma asked him, but he said no immediately. She had to beg his mom to get him to go (I'm pretty sure his mom just paid him)

Anyways, while I was fighting a battle in my own head, Terror was having the best time of his life. He had a ""job"" at the family manufacturing plant in management. Where he ""worked"". His dad gave him a new BMW for graduating high school, which immediately had a big crumpled dent in the front. I think he was trying to do drift or some shit and he hit a pole. He has gotten bigger in this span of time, so just imagine a human ball driving a BMW.

Anyways, it ends up that he has to take me to a few of my therapy sessions. I don't know what to make of it. In my mind, I thought we were just going to be silent the whole way up. Which would have been fine.

So, my sessions was at 11 o'clock AM. Naturally, we want to leave by at least 10:30. Well, Terror arrives at 9:30. Does he go up to the house? Of course not! That'd take too much work, so he honks the horn and tries yelling out his window. His voice is not made for yelling, I hope he knows that. So me, being a still insanely paranoid wreck, almost have a heart attack when this happens. I had almost convinced myself that he was there to kill me when I got a phone call from Grandma, reminding me that she wasn't taking me and it was Terror. Well thank you Grandma.

I tentatively make my way out of the house and practically sprint to the car. There were probably snipers watching the road, waiting for me, so I had to be fast. I quickly get in, and already, I want to go back into what my brain is saying is filled with snipers. Terror's girth was somehow reaching over and resting on my seat. It wasn't much, but it made things very uncomfortable. 

First thing out of his mouth, ""Fuck, you look like shit."" He didn't say it jokingly, either. I sincerely believe he was trying to be an asshole. I kinda see where he could joke about it, I still looked like Tom Hanks from castaway, but he was still being a jerkbutt. I didn't really say anything back, just, slumped in the seat, pushed up against the door so I didn't touch him.

Examining the car, it was littered with fast food wrappers. Terror was wearing one of those button up shirts with the flame graphics. He had a Hardee's monster biscuit in his hand and he was munching on it. So we get underway in blissful silence, only being broken by his disgusting nom nom nom sounds, wich was constant. So I guess there wasn't really any silence at all.

The way Terror drives is sort of like he's playing GTA. Just, without shooting a gun at people on the sidewalk or other drivers. We get out of town, and he just decides we need to be there ASAP, even though we're going to be more than an hour early at this rate. I already hated going over the speed limit normally, but going 70 in a 55 zone, where the driver has one greasy hand on the wheel and an even greasier hand on his breakfast was almost too much. I just slumped in my seat. We didn't go far before we came up on a smaller town, about 10 minutes (going the speed limit) outside my hometown. It's where Terror's family had their manufacturing plant. The highway whizzes right by the place, so when the turn comes to go there, he almost goes right into the fucking ditch because he apparently doesn't know what a brake is. Thankfully, he must be used to taking the corner like an idiot, so we didn't crash or anything.

We enter the parking lot, and he tells me he has to get something quick, it'd only take a minute. Ok, I'll just sit in the car and lean back so no one can see me. I wasn't happy about this at all, but at least I got to look at the clouds for a little bit. Or actually, a while. Seeing him try to get out of the car was pretty fucking funny though, it wasn't made for this size of person, he had to rock himself to get the momentum to lift himself out.

10 minutes goes by, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. By the time he gets back, it's around 10:35. He opened the door, and sets two boxes of donuts on my lap.

""What the hell is this, more food?"" I asked rhetorically.

""Yes well, I also had to discus some issues with Father, and get some ""work"" done.""

""So you decide to do that when you're taking me to a therapy session?""

""What are you going to do? Cry about it? Cry to your mother?""

Fuck, I hated the way he talked. So, we get back on the road, his greasy fingers now getting stickier with the donuts. I'd of been late if he hadn't been speeding like an asshole. So, we finally get there.

""Are you going to wait in the lobby, ooooor..."" I asked.

""I'm gonna head to the gym, how long did you say your session lasts?""

""... forty five minutes...""

""Yeah, that'll be enough time.""

So I step out and he drives off. Immediately, I almost begin panicking. I never went out alone, it's just too dangerous with my state of mind. I quickly make my way in and do therapy and yadda yadda yadda it goes fine. I don't tell my therapist about Terror or what's happened that day, because in the back of my mind I still didn't trust him. (I did eventually open up to him, but that ain't in this story)

Now, I was just waiting for Terror to get back. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes... He was gone until 1:30. I felt like crying the whole time, but thankfully I was able to control myself with the pressure of breaking down in front of people. I felt so alone, even the company of Terror was being craved.

He finally rolled up and honked his horn, signaling his grand entrance. Who even does that at a public place, expecially a fucking health-center-clinic-thing-whatever-you-wanna-call-it. I quickly run out and get in the car. The car is filled with the scent of greasy man and greasy burgers. Mmmm, delicious delicious burgers, from Culvers. Finest burgers I've ever had, and ever will have. Not something you want to eat often as they're hella unhealthy, but hell, if God gave us those rolls, Satan made Culvers' butter burgers. They're so good, it's demonic.

Terror was was eating a triple, and he had a big bag. It looked as if he had more burgers left. Immediatly we were off, I didn't even get a chance to put my seatbelt on. He smacked his lips, ""Hey, don't you get any ideas about these burgers. These are mine. My treat for going to the gym.""

Did he go to the gym? Maybe. That'd be a great sight to see. But I doubt it, I'm betting he went to the games shop to look at Warhammer 40k stuff. He's ""into it"" yet he hasn't even built one of the armies he's bought and top it off with his love of Chaos. Fucking heretic.

""So, how was it, Cousin?"" He said between smacks of food.

""... it was fine...""

""You know, mental illnesses aren't real."" Whoa, fuck, slow down. This just came out of nowhere. He must have notice my look at him, ""Yeah, they aren't. See, either you're just faking, or you're too weak to actually make it in the world, so you have to put on this pony show.""

My mind was racing, is this actually happening? It was.

""Yeah, see, psychology is all a front for the drug companies. They just want to make a quick buck, and you're just giving in to them."" He continued to blabber on about pseudo-science and the big banks and shit like that, I basically zoned out.

See, Schizophrenia is hell. It's hard to explain, but I can hear voices and shit in my head. They say cruel things to me often, and have almost driven me to suicide. Right now, they took hold of that, repeating that he was right, and that there was nothing wrong, I was just stupid. [Here's an auditory simulation that sort of explains what it's like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vvU-Ajwbok)

It was a long drive home, filled with Terror just blabbing in my ear while he gorges himself on burgers. I couldn't get back to my bed fast enough, shit was going down in my mind and I just needed to weep.

So, that ends this one. Next one will be up probably tomorrow."

We're launching a 15-week, full-time [PHP/JS bootcamp](http://www.epicodus.com/php.html). After the course, we're connecting graduates with 2-month paid internships, and then helping people find jobs with PHP shops. 

Our first class starts in March and we're busy putting together the curriculum.

I'd be interested to hear about people's experience learning PHP. What are the best books/blogs/videos/other resources? Where did you struggle? What do you wish you had learned?

And I'd be interested to hear about employers' experiences hiring junior-level developers for PHP work. What skills do you wish they had? What are the most important concepts/tools/technologies for them to know?

I'm also happy to answer any questions about the course or our school.

Thanks in advance!"
2tzewg,4,2015-01-28,I [21 M] am in a LDR with my girlfriend [19 F] and I don't know what to do about our future.,Sleepdawg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2tzewg/i_21_m_am_in_a_ldr_with_my_girlfriend_19_f_and_i/,"Hello, I need relationship advice friends.

First some backstory about my girlfriend and me. We met at university when she was a freshman and I was a junior. We’ve been dating a little over a year now and are pretty serious about each other.  During this time we lost our virginities to each other as well. She is my first girlfriend while she has had several boyfriends but was not very serious about them.

Anyway during winter break we had to start a long distance relationship because I got an internship at a company far from university. She also had to move because her stepfather obtained a job up north in Connecticut. She currently lives with her parents in an extended stay hotel. She has plans to go to a state university in Connecticut next semester but will take a 6 month break from school until then. 

My concern is what the future will look like for us. We’ve both discussed what will happen many times. I’m considering either finding a job in Connecticut so I can be closer to her OR looking for a job in a city with more job opportunities for my degree. She wants to stay in Connecticut until she finishes college which will mean at least 2 more years of schooling. She hopes to go to dental school afterwards. Anyway I am worried that our lives seem to be taking very different paths and will result in this relationship not working out. Even if I move to her in Connecticut it won’t mean she will move in with me as she still lives with her parents who are very protective of her. The likelihood of her moving to wherever I get a job post-college if I don’t decide to go to Connecticut is also quite slim because her parents do not know me that well and she can’t afford out-of-state tuition. 

I love her very much but I don’t exactly relish the idea of doing long distance until she finishes dental school (which could end up being 6 years from now since she has yet to finish undergrad). What should I do?

Tl;Dr I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl I love but should I stay in it for potentially 6 years?"

2tzjvq,2,2015-01-28,Is it depression or am I a fraud? (25F),hannaheunice,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2tzjvq/is_it_depression_or_am_i_a_fraud_25f/,"I feel like I have no reason to be depressed because despite all my struggles, I do have a nice life. Most of how I feel is caused my life events and don't really have much to do with my brain chemistry which is why I feel like me feeling this way is not legit.

I'm in my last semester of college. I've been in school way longer than I expected (and a lot of student loans). I've been sick (I have 2 forms of lupus: SLE and nephritis) and my dad had cancer and passed away 2 years ago. Also, I had my first stroke &amp; seizures in December 2011 so I took a semester off in Spring 2012. I always wanted to major in graphic design so when I took my semester off, I applied for the program at my university and worked on my portfolio, but I didn't get accepted. I applied again in 2013 and got accepted. I was so freaking happy because design is what I love and what I think I'm pretty good at.

Only I compare myself to my classmates and I feel horrible. I get so fucking discouraged. I lost my motivation to do my work. Because I had a seizure last year in January and June so I couldn't drive for a whole year (And I had a seizure in May 2013, so I couldn't drive for 5 months!) I barely had my license for 2 months before my January 2014 seizure. So because of these seizures, I cannot drive. My brother in law takes me to school and I am thankful but I get frustrated because sometimes he's late (though I am grateful for his trying) and because I can't go anywhere I want. I can't go to Kinko's and print out homework whenever I want. I guess it's frustrating that I can't go to Starbucks, the grocery store, the art supply store...it's just the little things most people take for granted. But what is the most depressing and dehumanizing is that I have not been able to get a job or design internship because of transportation and I can't impose on everyone else's schedule when they're already driving me around. 

So I already feel like I'm one of the worst in class and the fact that most people in my class have internships (seriously, I just came into the classroom and the professor asked: ""How many of you guys have internships??"" And more than half the class answered...and that snapped me into asking here) and I have this fear thinking that because I lack the experience most people in my class do, I will have a really hard time getting a job. I mean, to make up for it I design flyers for the fashion club I am a part of at school. And I used to design layouts for the school newspaper at my old community college. And a few side projects here and there.

So I get too depressed to do my homework and projects. Then I wonder why I'm not as good as I could be. It's an endless cycle.

I'm not trying to ask for pity. But I really hope there is still a chance for me to build a career I love despite this shit I'm going through. Also, my first semester in the graphic design program (Fall 2013) I had a kidney biopsy which is why I had to go back on prednisone, and constant high fevers that forced my doctors to increase my prednisone dosage until the fevers stopped. And they did. But I'm still on prednisone up to now because every time I taper (by order of my doctors), the protein in my kidney goes back up. It's really hard to cope with the weight gain because I already am self conscious about how I look in terms of body and face. I feel like I would be treated better and life would be easier if I looked better.

I feel like I am depressed because one of the sides is losing interest in what you love. I love art and design...I used to draw, paint, do photography a lot. But now I lack motivation to do so and I lack motivation in my school.

I'm just wondering if it's still too late for me to build me life, career, be able to marry my boyfriend, etc. despite my struggles. Because I feel like Im way behind everyone a 25. I mean, I've had jobs before but not now, especially not design jobs (well when I was 19 I was working as a tutor at the Mac computer lab at my community college and I helped students with Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc.) or internships except for the fashion club and newspaper like I mentioned about.

2u08ic,0,2015-01-28,I (22F) am married (23M) but think I'm in love with my childhood BFF (23M),[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2u08ic/i_22f_am_married_23m_but_think_im_in_love_with_my/,"Please excuse any typos or formatting errors. I typed this on my phone.

A little background; I married my high school sweetheart in June of last year. He was in the midst of cancer treatment (all clear now) and I hadn't spoken to my childhood BFF in years. I love my husband. He loves me. I know that no matter where out lives take us he will always support and encourage me. We have issues of course, who doesn't? Mainly these issues stem from a difference in the way we express ourselves. I'm overly emotional and empathetic. I wear my thoughts and feelings on my sleeve. But my husband, let's call him Ben, does not. He is terrible at reading emotion. He's very cut and dry, with no real room for a change of heart. 

He's taught me to be stronger and to take things less personally, and I love that about him. But constantly having to say what I'm feeling or what I want aloud is mentally exhausting for me. 

Now, as for my childhood BFF, let's call him Jay, up until 3 days ago we hadn't spoken in about 2 and a half years. We grew up together, he'd been my best friend since we were 4 years old. Our relationship has always been plutonic, despite him telling me multiple times that he was in love and wanted to be with me. 

When I went to college, that changed a little. I thought of him a lot more than I think was appropriate and it scared me. So I put a little distance between us and had the worst, loneliest year I've ever had. 

That summer, Ben worked for Intel and was on the other side of the country. I went a little crazy and was drinking a lot and felt very alone. I was not supposed to be in my hometown that summer but for some reason that's where I would wind up over and over. Eventually I went to visit Jay one night.

We drank; Jay, myself, and his girlfriend. It was a really unbelievable experience because Jay and I connected in the same awesome way we always had like no time at all had passed. At the time I thought I wanted to be with him. I made out with his girlfriend, more as an excuse to make a move on him. We (all) kissed, but nothing any crazier than that. At one point Jay and I wound up alone. I told him I thought I was in love with him and wanted to be with him. He told me he loved me too and would continue the conversation when sober. 

Over the following days, I told Ben we were better off with other people and waited for Jay to tell me we would be together. That moment didn't come. He basically tried to get me to fuck him but told me he ""couldn't hurt"" his girlfriend by leaving her.

I completely severed ties with him at that point, thinking it was my idea. That it was all what I wanted. Pretending none of it mattered to me at all. Now, I got a little out of control and started partying too hard, and using people to feel good. I never fucked anyone, so I thought I was fine (just having fun!!) until I eventually hit rock bottom. 

Ben came back into my life full swing when his internship was over. He told me he'd stand by me as long as I cleaned my act up. So, I did.

I spent a lot of time trying to explain what happened with Jay, and came to the conclusion that I wasn't in love with him, but rather, sought out the one person who was able to make me feel loved. I think I used him because of how lonely and hurt I was at the time. So 6 months after the night we kissed, he messages me on Facebook to tell me he's left his girlfriend.

I panicked. Jay rejected me. Time had gone by, I chose Ben. So, I told him what I thought was the truth. That I used him, that I was never in love with him, that I had no intention to be with him. Ever. Obviously, he hated me for it. But I thought it was for the best. At least if he hated me he could move on.

So that's the way things stayed until 3 days ago. I stood by Ben as he fought cancer, and we got married. Jay got back with his girlfriend, they very quickly married after that. She got pregnant, and they have a little girl. I felt like all was as it had to be. He seemed happy, I genuinely felt happy with Ben. But, 3 days ago he sent me a friend request on Facebook. He hadn't had Facebook in a while, so I thought it was strange. Especially because I had dreamed about him a couple of weeks before and he'd been on my mind pretty much non stop. So, against my better judgement, I not only accepted the request, but I sent him a message. 

At this point, it's been nearly 3 years since the night we kissed and I tried to get him to leave his girlfriend for me. He told me he and his now wife were in the middle of a divorce. I kept the convo casual to the best of my ability, but of course we wound up on the subject of who hurt who all those years ago. I told him he owed me an apology for trying to fuck me after telling me he wouldn't be with me. He told me what I did was worse, making him think I was in love with him when I wasn't. 

Now here's where it gets interesting. I have no idea if I'm in love with him or not. But for some reason, my heart races, my hands shake, and my head feels fuzzy when we talk. The first night we talked we apologized to each other again. I asked if he thought he could be my friend and he said if I could he could. So we kept talking. The next day we texted non stop. He made me feel sexy, smart, funny, driven, and all these other fantastic things that Ben can make me feel, but only after persistence. There's no trying with Jay. It's all natural. We flirted, not going to lie, it turned into completely inappropriate conversations for a married woman to have. The day after that, he barely spoke to me. I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm fucking him around. But I'm not. I'm just genuinely confused.

I love Ben, but it's completely different with Jay. Please. Help me. Am I in love with him, infatuated, just fascinated by the ease I have with him, frustrated by the complications with Ben or something else entirely? I'm confused, guilty, anxious, etc."

I recently landed a summer internship as a developer at a large company, my parents are happily married for 30 years, I have good relations with my siblings, who are all doing fine with their lives. My grades are average, and I have a large amount of people I like to call my friends. This is where it gets hard. 

I've never been diagnosed with anything, as I've never seen a professional, but I've hated myself and my life for at least the last seven or eight years, although there are ups and downs. I'm ugly, I feel like none of my friends really like me, none of them are close enough to open up to about this, and I want to cry almost every waking minute. Whenever I'm not with them, they seem to have a lot more fun, so I've started distancing myself from them more and more, as I don't want to be a burden, but when I'm alone I feel even sadder, and angry at myself for being such a loser. I often think about suicide, but never really consider it an option, as I'm top much of a pussy to go through with it anyways. I just wish I was dead, so the pain would go away, and I wouldn't be bothering anyone else. On top of that I don't feel I have the right to blame depression, as everyone says my life seems so great, which makes me even angrier at myself. I also have now clue how to fix this, which makes everything seem hopeless. Not looking for pity, just needed to tell someone, so thanks for reading. 

**TL;DR:** I'm sad 24/7, I cry myself to sleep, I have no idea why, and I just want to stop existing."
2u0he1,5,2015-01-28,Slowly pursuing with wife,chemrocks76,CuckoldCommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuckoldCommunity/comments/2u0he1/slowly_pursuing_with_wife/,"My wife and I are regular church attenders.  I've been fantasizing about her cheating on me.  One night I told her in bed that I fantasize about her cheating on me and that it turns me on.  She was okay with the fantasy and to my surprise over the next few months she began role playing where she would pretend that I wasn't me, some other guy.  I would play around.  We covered things such as the plumber, the handyman, then moved on to the idea of her fucking around at work.  I pretended to be the intern and she would sometimes start off our sexy time, as we call it, with proposing a fantasy (oh how'd we get alone in this closet at work).  It's been great.  But I'm not sure how to take it further.  I've encouraged her to buy sexier clothing for work and she's done that.  She works in a corporate environment so she cant go too slutty.  But she's wearing more tight skirts and slightly higher heels.  I've been encouraging her to wear tight clothes.  I've also left my computer on with articles like, ""its okay to flirt at work"" and I think she's read a few.  The problem is it's stopped here.  A quick FYI, my wife loves when I hold her down during sex, so she's more into a rape type fantasy.  i think my fantasy compliments hers because she can pretend she's being forced upon without feeling guilty.  The problem is it's stopped here.  We've talked and she said she doesn't think I'm weird for getting turned on by the fantasy of her getting fucked by another guy.  She did say that everything is fine and she doesn't see a problem unless it becomes a real life thing.  So I'm treading softly.  Not sure how to proceed.  She about to start going on overnight business trips out of state for the first time and I might be able to work that into a fantasy, but I'm not sure what to do or say next.  I basically have to very carefully keep opening her mind up to the idea.  Any ideas?  She's not into porn, again we go to church regularly, but I've been surprised how much she's taken to the fantasies.  I've gotten her to say, ""I need a big dick"" during sex and to say that ""my husband can't satisfy me"" during sex with me as we role play.  Just not sure how to go forward from here. Any suggestiongs? 
Update Jan 31: I went for a super realistic fantasy with her pretending she was at work. She had her laptop open and pretended she was in a one on one meeting with a guy at work. It seemed to be very realistic because she hesitated a lot and kept saying,""I'm not sure what to do now, this is ... "" and she would laugh. The thing is she was smiling a lot. But she didn't make the first move in the fantasy role play. I had to take all the initiative. She seemed to have fun though, but she seemed shyer than other fantasizes. Everything ended well, she did the now familiar saying that I taught her to say,"" I need a big dick,"" while I bang her. She loves getting banged and hearing it too. Automatically puts hands over her head for me to hold down..,

UPDATE: Had a new experience this week. Told my wife I would be really turned on if she sent me a text during the day that an old college friend of hers was in town and she was going to have lunch with him at the hotel he was staying at. I didn't know how she would respond, but she was okay with going along with the fantasy. I got a text around 10am saying, ""Friend from college is in town, so I'm dressing up for work and will meet him for lunch at Hotel."" So she went a bit beyond and embellished, which is cool. Then I asked her around 11:30 how things were going. She texted, ""On my way now! He even offered to buy my lunch. I think he's staying at the hotel through the weekend. Maybe I can get a glimpse of his room."" I responded, ""I hear they have nice rooms, let me know. Have fun and dont feel guilty about taking a little break from work. I'm 100% okay with whatever happens as long as you tell me later :)"" Then she texted me around 2pm, ""Back at work. Wow, it was great to catch up with an old friend. See you at home."" Then we met up at home around 4:00. She was in some slutty lingerie, black fishnet stalkings , crotchless red panties, black dress with slits all over it (stuff I had bought her). We ended up playfully talking about the ""affair"" and then I at her out and banged her good. She seemed to really get off, better than usual. She also really got off fast when I ate her out. She later told me that the crotchless panties kept her ""stuff"" front and center, which helped get her off fast, although I wonder if the fantasy had some part in it too. This was definitely a step closer to real life...

Update: So we were getting ready to have sex the other night when her cell phone beeped with a texting sound.  I asked her, ""who's that."" She said, ""it's my boyfriend."" So my response was to kiss her passionately.  Then we starting having sex.  As I was getting ready to climax I told her, ""you can only have 3 boyfriends ok.""  She said, ""ok.""  So it seems like this type of fantasy is becoming something she's more and more willing to play around with."

2u0vvx,1,2015-01-28,"I'm a 21yo French guy studying in the UK, and I'd like to come to work in Australia. Could you enlighten me about your VISA scheme?",[deleted],australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2u0vvx/im_a_21yo_french_guy_studying_in_the_uk_and_id/,"First of all, I'm nearly a graduate in Scotland, in the fourth year of my Honours degree, only 5 months to go. The thing is, it doesn't seem like I'm learning anything useful this semester, so I'd like to jump ship, and come work in Australia.  

Now, I'm trying to understand what I need to do to come work in your country. I've already been there 3 months for an internship 1.5 years ago, and I loved it, so I want to come back.
I'm in Computing, and think that I fall in the Skilled Occupation ""Developer Programmer"".  
Aside from that, I have no real clue about what I should do, if I should apply for a visa before or after finding a job, etc.

Also, I've lived 1.5 years in the UK now, but don't have the UK nationality, so do I have to take a test to prove my level in English?

If anyone on this sub has lived this experience, or is knowledgeable about the VISA scheme, please share your knowledge. :)"
2u14aa,112,2015-01-28,Guide to Bills Coaching Changes 2014-2015,Bickle1729,buffalobills,https://www.reddit.com/r/buffalobills/comments/2u14aa/guide_to_bills_coaching_changes_20142015/,"Hello all. I posted a [similar article](http://www.reddit.com/r/buffalobills/comments/1xjwm1/guide_to_bills_coaching_changes_20132014/) last season, and wanted to do the same this year for anyone that might have missed any of the coaching hire announcements. This years version is a bit longer, the Bills having made eighteen coaching changes. 

There are pictures of most of the new coaches, or you can view the entire gallery [**here.**](http://imgur.com/a/feLzP#0)

There was a major influx of former Jets coaches that were replacing many former Syracuse coaches, so I placed a **(J)** next to coaches that came from the Jets, and an **(S)** next to coaches that were from Syracuse. 
***
###**Head Coach**

*Former* - **(S)** Doug Marrone  
*Current* - **(J)** [**Rex Ryan**](http://i.imgur.com/WFqA00M.jpg ""Rex Ryan"") 

Doug Marrone was hired in 2013 to fix the Bills offensive troubles and lead the team to the post season for the first time in over a decade. A 6-10 record, followed by a disappointing 9-7 season that was a mediocre offense away from the playoffs, were not enough to satisfy the ravenous Bills fan base. Between the Pegulas taking over ownership, his conflicts with front office, and the harsh criticism that he faced from the media, Doug decided that Buffalo was no longer somewhere he wanted to coach. After leading the Bills to their first winning season in ten years, Marrone chose to opt out of his contract with one year remaining. Despite rumors of interviews with the Jets and Bears for their head coaching vacancies, Marrone ended up signing on with Jacksonville as their [**offensive line coordinator.**](http://i.imgur.com/w4a8z.jpg ""Swing and a Miss"")

The Bills and new owners Terry &amp; Kim Pegula were suddenly thrust into a coaching search. GM Doug Whaley and President Russ Brandon led the Pegulas on an extensive cross country journey where they interviewed many top candidates for the head coach position. After meeting with former Jets coach Rex Ryan the group felt like they had found their guy. The Pegulas invited Rex to their Florida home for a second interview and to watch the AFC Divisional game between the Ravens and Patriots. The next morning Rex’s contract was all but confirmed and he was eventually signed to become the eighteenth head coach in Buffalo Bills history.

Rex is an enigmatic figure that most Bills fans have admired from the other side of the field. Everyone touts him as the prototypical players coach, and he seems like an excellent motivator that his players want to perform well for. His defenses ranked in the top ten yardage wise in five of his six seasons with the Jets. His offenses on the other hand grew progressively worse over the years, ranking in the bottom five in points scored in each of the last three seasons. 

The ever loyal Ryan brings with him an entourage of **twelve** Jets assistant coaches from both sides of the ball, filling the void of all the former Syracuse coaches that left after Marrone's departure. Time will tell if Rex’s story repeats itself in Buffalo, but I feel as though he is a quarterback away from being one of the best coaches of all time.
***
###**Offensive Coordinator**  
*Former* - **(S)** Nate Hackett   
*Current* - [**Greg Roman**](http://i.imgur.com/3QuyFPO.jpg ""Greg Roman"") 

Even [**Shelley “The Machine” Levene**](http://imgur.com/MjW5LlT ""Go and watch Glengarry Glen Ross"") could sell this move to Bills fans. It is putting it lightly to say that Nate Hackett was heavily criticized during the Bills 2014 season. Whether fans thought he was running it too much, not enough, or just not at the right time, they all came out in full force to oppose Hackett. Following the season Bills captain Fred Jackson made sure to defend his former coach by saying
&gt; “Some of the stuff that he(Hackett) wanted to call we didn't get called in a game... I don't know if that was always his call.""

&gt; “Nate's a guy that likes to go big or go home""  

 It may have been Marrone, Hackett, or even just a lack of talent that held the Bills back offensively. But the Bills new offensive coordinator will find himself under the same criticism as Hackett if he fails to produce an at least average offense.

Greg Roman leaves San Francisco after four successful seasons as offensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh. Roman coached with Harbaugh at Stanford before following him to San Francisco. He also served as an offensive line assistant with the Ravens in 2006 when Rex was the defensive coordinator.  

At the start of the 2014 season Roman was highly regarded as one of the leagues next head coaching candidates, the Niners having at least made the conference championship game in each of his three seasons with the team. 

Roman received criticism from fans during an unexpected  8-8 season, even though they had the fourth ranked rushing unit, and young quarterback Colin Kaepernick reached career highs with 3369 passing yards and 639 rushing yards. Greg was let go by the 49ers following the 2014 season, his coordinator position still remains vacant. 

The 49ers managed to make the playoffs in three of the four years with Roman calling the plays, something Bills fans would welcome with open arms. Their rushing attack finished in the top ten in each of Roman’s years as coordinator, but they ended up in the bottom ten in passing yards in each year as well.  Between all these new run oriented coaches I fully expect the Bills rushing stats to return to 2012 &amp; 2013 form. 
***
###**Offensive Line Coach**

*Former* - Pat Morris  
*Current* - [**Aaron Kromer**](http://i.imgur.com/byKhINa.jpg ""Aaron Kromer"")  

Morris was let go after his first season with the Bills. He has been coaching in the NFL for fifteen seasons, and seems to be in the twilight of his career. Morris’ lone season in Buffalo saw players being shuffled around positions and two rookies ending up with considerable starting roles. The Bills finished 25th in rushing yards in 2014 and it seems as though they are doing everything in their power to reverse that trend.

Aaron Kromer comes to Buffalo with an impressive resume of producing top notch offensive lines.  Kromer coached for the Buccaneers, Saints, and Bears over the past seven seasons and received rave reviews in each location for his work with the offensive line.  He was most currently the offensive coordinator for Chicago.  His first season in Chicago the offensive unit overachieved in both facets of the game, but his second season saw regression all around on offense. 

You may recognize his name from the critical comments he made about Jay Cutler, or his emotional apology for said remarks. There was no way for Cutler and Kromer to coexist in Chicago, and it seems like the Bills are buying low with this hiring. Public relations aside Kromer seems like an important piece to the Bills fixing their offensive troubles.  
***  
###**Quarterbacks Coach**

*Former* - Todd Downing  
*Current* - **(J)** [**David Lee**](http://i.imgur.com/DbBowbB.png ""David Lee"") 

Downing was only with the Bills for one season and I am unsure what kind of effect, if any, he had on the quarterbacks while he was is Buffalo, but the coaching carousel turns itself around and he like many others was left without a seat. 

Someone who found a familiar seat on the ride, was second time Bills quarterbacks coach David Lee. The AFC East has seen a lot of Lee, he has coached for the Dolphins (Pennington, Henne), Bills (Fitzpatrick), and Jets (Smith) over the past eight years. But he is most well-known for his work developing Tony Romo during his first four seasons in Dallas, Romo calling Lee a [**“tremendous asset”**]( http://mississippi.scout.com/story/1039238-romo-pennington-discuss-david-lee ""David Lee Article"") for him. 

If Lee can work together with Manuel for a couple seasons I believe he can develop him into a starting, playoff caliber quarterback. That is, if the Bills don't draft a new one before then.
***
###**Running Backs Coach**

*Former* – **(S)** Tyrone Wheatley  
*Current* - **(J)** [**Anthony Lynn**](http://i.imgur.com/zcrcPQ5.jpg ""Anthony Lynn"") 

Wheatley was hired by the Bills in 2013 with the group of coaches Marrone brought with him from Syracuse. The running back units finished 2nd and 25th in yardage over Tyrone's two seasons in Buffalo. Wheatley wasted little time after Marrone opted out of his contract, quickly signing on to Jim Harbaugh’s staff at Michigan as their running backs coach.

Anthony Lynn worked with Rex as his running backs coach for his entire tenure with the Jets. He also served as the teams assistant head coach, a role he will continue in with the Bills. Lynn is Ryan’s right hand man on the offensive side of the ball and the main reason why the Jets have been a powerhouse rushing team over the past six seasons. Lynn has built an impressive resume by leading Thomas Jones to his best season as a pro with over 1400 rush yards and 14 touchdowns, and turning Greene and Ivory into impactful rushers, both averaging over four yards per carry during their time with the Jets.

This [**NYDN article**]( http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/ny-jets-running-backs-flight-anthony-lynn-guidance-article-1.993114 ""New York Daily News"") does an excellent job summing up how impactful coach Lynn was to the Jets. His dedication and attitude remind me of Donnie Henderson and I think the running backs are going to love having him as a coach.
***
###**Wide Receivers Coach**

*Former* - **(S)** Rob Moore   
*Current* - **(J)**  [**Sanjay Lal**](http://i.imgur.com/f0W6me1.jpg ""Sanjay Lal"") 

Moore was part of Marrone’s Syracuse hirings, he also played for the Orange during his college career. Although he only served for one year as a coach he too was swept out the door along with Marrone.

 Having a competent coach mentoring the Bills young star wide receiver Sammy Watkins is very important considering there is no veteran presence on the roster to show Sammy the ropes. I hope I am wrong but it seems the Bills have made a mistake in choosing that coach.

Sanjay Lal comes to Buffalo after spending the last six seasons as wide receivers coach of the Raiders and Jets. The latter of which’s fan base seems very pleased to be getting rid of him. Never has a receiver finished with a 1000 yard season under Lal’s direction, the most prominent being Darrius Heyward-Bey with 975 yards &amp; 4 TD in 2011. The lack of receiver production could be attributed to lack of talent or offensive scheme, but this is one hire that I am very uneasy about and will be closely watching.
***
###**Tight Ends Coach**

*Former* - **(S)** Greg Adkins  
*Current* - **(J)**  [**Tony Sparano Jr.**](http://i.imgur.com/wwoc0so.jpg ""Not Soprano"") 

The Bills once again replace a former Syracuse coach with a former Jets coach. Adkins served as tight ends coach the last two seasons and is currently unemployed along with many other assistants following the hasty departure of Doug Marrone. He is replaced by a much younger, but familiar sounding coach in Tony Sparano Jr.

Sparano is another coach that has bounced around the AFC East. Starting his career with his father in Miami, before following him to the Jets in 2012. Sparano is very young compared to other coaching candidates. At 28, he is actually over a year younger than current Bills tight end Scott Chandler. I am not saying that this was a bad signing by the Bills, but usually I would want to hire a coach with more experience than the players they are coaching.	
***	
###**Defensive Coordinator**

*Former* - Jim Schwartz  
*Current* - **(J)** [**Dennis Thurman**](http://i.imgur.com/H1b2VsG.jpg ""Dennis Thurman"")	

The loss of Gym Shorts was a tough pill to swallow for myself, as well as many other Bills fans. Especially since the Bills finally seemed to figure out how to stop the opponents rushing attack, jumping from ranked near the bottom at 28th under Mike Pettine, all the way to 11th in yards against. Schwartz had just the right amount of cockiness as a defensive coordinator as well. His smug smile will be sorely missed from the sideline on Sundays.

Dennis Thurman has very big shoes to fill as he steps into the defensive coordinator position. He has been with Rex Ryan since 2002 in Baltimore and served as the Jets coordinator for the previous two seasons. There is no lack of talent to work with in Buffalo, having a Pro Bowl defensive line and a stable of young stud linebackers to work with. Ryan and Thurman will have no excuses if they fail to put up comparable numbers to Schwartz, doing as well as Pettine will not be good enough.  	
***
###**Defensive Line Coach**

*Former* - Pepper Johnson   
*Current* - **(J)** [**Karl Dunbar**](http://i.imgur.com/lSbGPkM.jpg ""Karl Dunbar"") 

Pepper was well liked by Bills fans, even during his time with the Patriots, and it seemed like Rex was going to find a place for him in Buffalo. Instead Johnson becomes another coach to take part in the AFC East coaching exchange program, and is now onto his third coaching job within the division. In a trade of sorts with the Jets, both Dunbar and Johnson will swap offices and face their former teams multiple times next season.

Karl Dunbar has led impressive, talent-rich defensive lines in each of his NFL jobs. He put up superb numbers for the Bears, Vikings, and Jets over the past ten seasons, and will be expected to do the same with Buffalo's perennial Pro Bowl defensive linemen. 

If you watched a Jets game over the last few seasons then you have seen Karl, he is not a hard man to miss. He suffers from vitiligo, a skin condition that can be visually shocking to those unfamiliar with the condition.
***
###**Linebackers Coach**

*Former* - Fred Pagac  
*Current* - **(J)** [**Bobby April III**](http://i.imgur.com/s95n5yo.jpg ""Bobby April III"") 

Fred Pagac (pronounced PUG-itch), or Coach Pug as players referred to him, is someone that I was disappointed to find out was let go. I felt that he was a big part in developing the Bills linebackers into a much improved unit against the run last year. The combination of Pagac, Schwartz, and Spikes seemed to be just the right mix for the Bills. Now with two of those men gone and Spikes possibly leaving as well, I worry for the Bills run defense next season.

Another new coach with a familiar name is Bobby April III. His father was the Bills special teams coach from 04-09, and recently signed on to the Jets staff at the same position. April III coached for six years in the collegiate ranks before coaching for the Eagles and Jets. He also served as an intern for the Bills during his father’s first year with the team.

2u15gi,1,2015-01-28,How do I adjust my tax withholdings for an internship? Is it possible?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2u15gi/how_do_i_adjust_my_tax_withholdings_for_an/,"Previously I just filled out the W-4 my employers gave me and thought nothing of it. I'd just wait until I got my big refund. But I'll be making a lot more this year, so I'd like to do it right this time. It doesn't really matter because I'm not in a place where I can put that money to good use, but it's always better to hold onto it myself.

So next summer I'll be working for 15 weeks at my internship. I'll make $16,800 during that period and will receive free housing that HR told me is taxed. I don't know the value of that free housing, but I assume it's around $700/month. So that extrapolates to an annual pay of $65,440. 

So anyway, $1100/month would be withheld in federal taxes if I calculated that right (neglecting my one deduction lol). When really, it should be about $600/month!

State taxes would follow a similar trend.

tl;dr: How do I do my tax withholdings?

2u16ss,52,2015-01-28,My (28F) husband (34M) wants to pursue medical school after completing his current Master's degree. It is tearing us apart.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2u16ss/my_28f_husband_34m_wants_to_pursue_medical_school/,"Background info, husband is currently getting a degree in International Security. About a week ago, he told me that he wants to go to medical school after getting this degree because he feels working in the sciences would be more fulfilling to him. He has at least 1-2 years left before he is finished with what he is doing now. He also has a history of anxiety and depression which are being treated now, but these factor in later in the story. 

To get to the application process, my husband would have to take 12 pre-med courses. He has told me he plans on taking those alongside finishing his current master's degree's coursework. This would be, in effect, like getting two degrees at one time...something I am not sure he is really prepared for. After taking the pre-med courses, he'd have to apply and undergo an interviewing process to see if he got in. 

1) Husband is already paying attention to the med school stuff at a possible hindrance to his current degree requirements. He's been making mostly Bs in grad school so far, which isn't bad, but he struggles a lot to get those Bs. He puts off assignments until the last minute; he won't accept my help on papers; and he sometimes turns in late work. He says that the procrastination is because he is not invested in his current degree program and doesn't find it fulfilling. He only went into poli sci after struggling and failing at physics due to his untreated mental health at the time he was in undergrad.

To get his current degree, he needs an internship and 4 courses of a foreign language. When I ask about how/when he will get these things, he says, ""I have plenty of time because I'll be taking pre-med classes and that stretches things out."" 

Not only do I worry that his current financial aid would not cover pre-med courses because they are not degree-related, he has spent so much time banking on this that he is putting off applying for internships or getting started on his language courses. He even dropped a required class to take a pre-med class without my knowledge. After we had it out about that, he dropped the pre-med class and is now taking only two. 

2) I have never seen him work a brick and mortar job or be financially independent. He also doesn't fully share his finances with me. I know he has thousands in credit card debt, an untold sum in old medical debt, and over 100k in current student loans. 

He cannot pay any of this off with his freelance writing job. All it is good for is helping me with the bills, which he can usually only do about 10 months out of the year. On a teaching salary, I only have enough to cover the few months he cannot pay and not enough to help him pay off his debt. 

On top of what may be nearly 200k in current debt, he wants to take on 250k. There have been only two times since he and I have been together (2008) that he has almost gotten a ""normal"" job. Once was at the Starbucks in the airport, which he lost after sleeping through 3 different training opportunities. The other was a work-study here, which he quit after 2 weeks. 

3) Because of the lack of proof that he can hold a job, I am unwilling to dedicate myself to 6 more years of supporting him through school. When we married, the understanding was that he would get this graduate degree and finally enter the workforce so he could start chipping away at his debt.

 My worry is that we go 6 more years with me footing the financial burden (any emergencies, medical issues, etc are always paid for by me almost exclusively alone) only to find out that he cannot handle a residency or a full-time doctor's position. That would be so much more debt for nothing. 

4) Even if he can hold a job, he won't be entering the workforce until his early 40s at least. That severely cuts down on time we could be saving for retirement or paying off debt. He claims that he will be making so much money that it won't matter, but I don't like the idea of starting so late in life. 

5) This may be the most selfish part of the list, but I feel like I have waited long enough. We got together officially in 2008, and when I graduate with my MFA I moved back to our hometown because he was still not functioning or passing classes. I was happy to do that, and when we moved in together I put forth a huge effort to help get him through his undergrad. 

Hometown was the last place I wanted to be at the time, and I worked a job that had me very depressed for three years there while helping him work toward graduation. 

Also, even though I love our city now, the only reason we're here is because he wanted this program. Initially, we were going to DC, where I would have been able to live in the same city as one of my best friends. It broke my heart to not be able to live near her, but we moved here because this degree had more prestige. 

After nearly 6 years of waiting and supporting and adjusting my life to Husband's needs, I am ready for us to move forward. There is still so much we can't do. Vet appointments for our cats are stressful, it costs a lot to travel back home (I'm facing this difficulty now because a cousin I am close to is marrying in April and I don't know if I can afford plane tickets), and nearly anything fun we do (going out to eat, going to a concert, going to a museum) comes out of either my money or my credit cards. The stress of knowing that any major issue could financially ruin us is exhausting me. 

The emotional toll, for me, is strong. Husband also knows that his writing job may end soon (the client has said they will soon stop needed the types of articles he writes), so that would be even less income coming for us to survive on. 

He thinks that taking on more debt and living off of it is all right, but I don't agree.  

This has gotten very long, but basically I feel that I don't know how I can continue to watch his money pit grow without any guarantee that he can get a job or hold one. I love him deeply, and emotionally he and I are wonderful together. However, I do wonder about his ability to equally contribute financially and would prefer to begin figuring that out before adding 205k more dollars of debt onto our plates. 

We have been fighting and digging our heels in over this issue for about a week. I'm worried it will end up splitting us apart. We're looking into counseling, but we can't afford anyone who doesn't take my insurance so the search is ongoing. Does anyone have any insight that could help us through this?

Tl;dr: Husband and I are in Clash of the Titans tug of war over his recent decision to try for med school."
2u19t7,5,2015-01-28,How many of you attended an AVMA-accredited veterinary college prior to becoming a RVT/LVT/CVT? How many of you learned on-the-job and later sat for the VTNE (is that even possible)?,breathcomposed,VetTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/2u19t7/how_many_of_you_attended_an_avmaaccredited/,"Hey, guys. It's me again.

**Recap:** I'm a first-year veterinary technology student. My occupational classes start in May (assuming I pass College Algebra and Biology this semester, ugh).

So, lately, my family seems to believe that going to school and earning a degree is a waste of time (if they didn't live over 2,000 miles away, I could gladly give them a tour of my school and the building where my program is in and try to convince them otherwise!). They think I could just work from the bottom up at a clinic or apply for a unlicensed vet tech position so that I could just learn everything on-the-job. Is that an old-fashioned way of thinking at this point, or would that even be possible?

The reason I like the idea of going to school is because I'll be forced to learn the concepts and terminology before I enter the workforce, not during. Also, the last semester of my program is a *minimum* 540-hour internship, which would force me to network with local clinics. Ideally, I could get hired at the same place where I interned. At the very least, I would expect to attain a letter of recommendation or something that I could, in turn, send to another potential employer.

Honestly, I'm having a hard enough time as it is getting a job as a clinic *without* an education (or any professional experience with animals in a clinical setting or otherwise). That's mainly the reason I decided to go back to school; I feel like I can't get my foot in the door otherwise. I know a degree is essentially just a piece of paper but I can't help but think it's my only option right now.

What do you think, guys? Please advise!

I quit that job and started interning in a local factories IT department a few months ago and so far, my experiences have been somewhat mixed as an intern. It seems as if some of the other techs have a fair bit of confidence in my abilities as a tech, while others seem to see me as more of a pack mule that happens to be able to plug in cords than a tech.

I'm curious how other tech's in this sub see their interns and how other interns in the sub are/were treated while interning."
2u1hmu,2,2015-01-28,Somewhat unprofessional hiring practices and negotiating from a low offer,thatboatguy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2u1hmu/somewhat_unprofessional_hiring_practices_and/,"I am a 24 year old engineer working who has been working in the aerospace industry in Texas for the last year and a half. Three months ago I was contacted by a recruiter from another big aerospace company with openings across the country. She thought my LinkedIn profile suggested I would be a good fit and set me up for an interview in my area where they would fly managers from across the country to. That interview went very well, and I was told I would be a good fit into an engineer II position (by the man who would be my manager's manager, should I accept), a promotion from my current ""engineer I"" position, and given an unofficial offer on the spot. Due to winter holidays they could not fly me out to the actual office location in southern California until recently. 

I was set to interview with who would be my direct supervisor, and while waiting in the airport to fly out got an email from the recruiter with information about an engineer I position, asking me to complete more paperwork, which I ignored thinking my resume had gotten caught in one of the company's talent pool searches again. During my interview, the manager noted that the recruiter saw I lacked 6 months of experience to reach their minimum 2 years for engineer II (discounting my year of engineering internships, since they only count ""post-bachelor degree work experience""). That interview went well; this manager believed I would fit as a ""high engineer I"" in his group.

A few days after getting home I was called by the recruiter and finally given an official offer (110% of my current salary), one which hardly covered the income tax I would pay in California. They admitted it was not as much as I was likely anticipating, but it was the ""going rate"" they were able to pay at this time. Glassdoor shows I was offered the very bottom end of reported salaries for that role, in that company, in that city. I am very likely to get a 2.5% merit raise within the next few months along with most other employees at my current company, further lowering the effect of that 11% increase. Relocation assistance would be a flat $5k, plenty for me to UHaul my 1 bedroom worth of things and my car to California, so I am not worried about that.

I asked the recruiter if I could get the offer in writing, or at least full disclosure of salary and benefits by email, and was told I would only get them if I accepted, otherwise it would stand at what our phone conversation covered.

I am not sure what if any negotiation leverage I have here other than the manager and the manager's manager really wanting me to work for them, and the sudden slip in the title I would be given. I told the recruiter I would call back later in the week with my acceptance or rejection of the offer; at the moment I was somewhat floored. Should I treat this as a take it or leave it? What would be a reasonable strategy to counter this?"
2u1kt5,3,2015-01-28,My (28F) husband (34M) wants to pursue medical school after completing his current Master's degree. It is tearing us apart.,[deleted],AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/2u1kt5/my_28f_husband_34m_wants_to_pursue_medical_school/,"If this is inappropriate, please feel free to remove it. I just desperately need the advice of people in the medical field. 

Background info, husband is currently getting a degree in International Security. About a week ago, he told me that he wants to go to medical school after getting this degree because he feels working in the sciences would be more fulfilling to him. He has at least 1-2 years left before he is finished with what he is doing now. He also has a history of anxiety and depression which are being treated now, but these factor in later in the story.

To get to the application process, my husband would have to take 12 pre-med courses. He has told me he plans on taking those alongside finishing his current master's degree's coursework. This would be, in effect, like getting two degrees at one time...something I am not sure he is really prepared for. After taking the pre-med courses, he'd have to apply and undergo an interviewing process to see if he got in.

1) Husband is already paying attention to the med school stuff at a possible hindrance to his current degree requirements. He's been making mostly Bs in grad school so far, which isn't bad, but he struggles a lot to get those Bs. He puts off assignments until the last minute; he won't accept my help on papers; and he sometimes turns in late work. He says that the procrastination is because he is not invested in his current degree program and doesn't find it fulfilling. He only went into poli sci after struggling and failing at physics due to his untreated mental health at the time he was in undergrad.

To get his current degree, he needs an internship and 4 courses of a foreign language. When I ask about how/when he will get these things, he says, ""I have plenty of time because I'll be taking pre-med classes and that stretches things out.""

Not only do I worry that his current financial aid would not cover pre-med courses because they are not degree-related, he has spent so much time banking on this that he is putting off applying for internships or getting started on his language courses. He even dropped a required class to take a pre-med class without my knowledge. After we had it out about that, he dropped the pre-med class and is now taking only two.

2) I have never seen him work a brick and mortar job or be financially independent. He did work full time for a period before we met, but he hasn't since. He also doesn't fully share his finances with me. I know he has thousands in credit card debt, an untold sum in old medical debt, and over 100k in current student loans.

He cannot pay any of this off with his freelance writing job. All it is good for is helping me with the bills, which he can usually only do about 10 months out of the year. On a teaching salary, I only have enough to cover the few months he cannot pay and not enough to help him pay off his debt.

On top of what may be nearly 200k in current debt, he wants to take on 250k. There have been only two times since he and I have been together (2008) that he has almost gotten a ""normal"" job. Once was at the Starbucks in the airport, which he lost after sleeping through 3 different training opportunities due to his insomnia at the time. The other was a work-study here, which he quit after 2 weeks.

3) Because of the lack of proof that he can hold a job, I am unwilling to dedicate myself to 6 more years of supporting him through school. When we married, the understanding was that he would get this graduate degree and finally enter the workforce so he could start chipping away at his debt.

My worry is that we go 6 more years with me footing the financial burden (any emergencies, medical issues, etc are always paid for by me almost exclusively alone) only to find out that he cannot handle a residency or a full-time doctor's position. That would be so much more debt for nothing.

4) Even if he can hold a job, he won't be entering the workforce until his early 40s at least. That severely cuts down on time we could be saving for retirement or paying off debt. He claims that he will be making so much money that it won't matter, but I don't like the idea of starting so late in life.

5) This may be the most selfish part of the list, but I feel like I have waited long enough. We got together officially in 2008, and when I graduate with my MFA I moved back to our hometown because he was still not functioning or passing classes. I was happy to do that, and when we moved in together I put forth a huge effort to help get him through his undergrad.

Hometown was the last place I wanted to be at the time, and I worked a job that had me very depressed for three years there while helping him work toward graduation.

Also, even though I love our city now, the only reason we're here is because he wanted this program. Initially, we were going to DC, where I would have been able to live in the same city as one of my best friends. It broke my heart to not be able to live near her, but we moved here because this degree had more prestige.

After nearly 6 years of waiting and supporting and adjusting my life to Husband's needs, I am ready for us to move forward. There is still so much we can't do. Vet appointments for our cats are stressful, it costs a lot to travel back home (I'm facing this difficulty now because a cousin I am close to is marrying in April and I don't know if I can afford plane tickets), and nearly anything fun we do (going out to eat, going to a concert, going to a museum) comes out of either my money or my credit cards. The stress of knowing that any major issue could financially ruin us is exhausting me.

The emotional toll, for me, is strong. Husband also knows that his writing job may end soon (the client has said they will soon stop needed the types of articles he writes), so that would be even less income coming for us to survive on.
He thinks that taking on more debt and living off of it is all right, but I don't agree.

This has gotten very long, but basically I feel that I don't know how I can continue to watch his money pit grow without any guarantee that he can get a job or hold one. I love him deeply, and emotionally he and I are wonderful together. However, I do wonder about his ability to equally contribute financially and would prefer to begin figuring that out before adding 205k more dollars of debt onto our plates.

We have been fighting and digging our heels in over this issue for about a week. I'm worried it will end up splitting us apart. We're looking into counseling, but we can't afford anyone who doesn't take my insurance so the search is ongoing. 

Does anyone who has actually gone through medical school or who is in medical school have any insight that could help us through this?

Tl;dr: Husband and I are in Clash of the Titans tug of war over his recent decision to try for med school."
2u1lf4,222,2015-01-28,The Neighbor's Son IIIa,cindybe,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2u1lf4/the_neighbors_son_iiia/,"My time with Eric was short lived. He was home only for a short while before his summer internship started in New York. During the week he was home, we had sex every single night and for the first time in a very long time, I felt alive, desired and content. I had divorced when my son was very young, and up until now, my life consisted of going to work and raising my son. I didn’t have time to date much and those dates never amounted to much. Having a bratty kid is one of the quickest ways of chasing a man away. However, knowing someone like him found me desirable made me consider dating again.

I started dating another divorced man who was a few years older than me. While the sex was nothing compared to what I had with Eric, it was nice to have adult companionship again, and for the most part Marc, my new boyfriend, satisfied me enough in bed where I thought that the fling with Eric would be a short chapter in my life. However, mid August during work I got a text message from him, “I need you.” I felt a lump in my throat and realized that I was not over him. I spent the rest of the day distracted at work trying to figure out just what I was supposed to do. I couldn’t decide between blowing off Eric or blowing off Marc. 


I worked as a paralegal/personal assistant at a small law firm and because my boss wanted me to tidy up his desk and lock the place up before I left, I normally worked a bit later than everyone else. I spent the day distracted and was shocked out of my hazy mental state by a knock on the front door after everyone had gone home. When I opened it, I saw Eric standing there. Without a word, he strode up to me and kissed me. One of his hands grabbed a fistful of my hair so he could pull my head back and start kissing my neck. His other hand slipped under my skirt and slide under the fabric of my panties so I could feel his warm hands against my ass. 

He pushed me towards the nearest desk as his hands moved to unbutton my blouse. I pushed at him say, “Eric we can’t do this anymore, I’m in a relationship. I have a date in a little while.” However, even as I pushed against him, I realized that my hands were tugging at the bottom of his shirt. My hands feel his taut torso, a start contrast to Marc’s belly and I feel myself growing more aroused. 

In between the kisses that he’s giving me, he breathes out, “Cancel your date.” His hands have already pulled my blouse out of the top of my skirt and I can feel his hands on my belly. He sits me down on the table and hikes my skirt up. Instinctively I spread my legs wanting him to touch me. He pushes the fabric of my panties into my wet cunt. I feel a bit ashamed of cheating on Marc. I had never been that kind of girl in the past. However, the moment his finger goes into me, I realize that I can be that kind of girl. All inhibitions removed, I stick my tongue in his mouth and close my eyes savoring the feeling his fingers are making as he enters my vagina. 

It’s torture as he alternates between pinching my clit between his two fingers and just thrusting his fingers deep inside me. With no one around, I let myself go and I scream in frustration, excitement and pleasure. Just as I’m about to build up to an orgasm he switches modes and I feel it subsiding. He does this over and over again driving me crazy. 

“Hold on,” I moan as he finger fucks me, “I need to send Marc a message.” However, he doesn’t relent and with the orgasm building inside me I don’t protest. My hips start to fuck back at his hand and I cum hard. I realize that in all the times that I’ve been with Marc, his cock has never made me cum as hard as Eric’s two fingers have. Eric can feel my vagina contract around his finger and he says, “My turn.” He pulls me down onto my knees and I hungrily pull his shorts down and see his cock. It’s gorgeous and I move to lick it. However he looks down at me and says, “Open your mouth.” 

His hands wrap around my head and he controls me fully. The only control I have is over my tongue which licks the head of his cock as he uses my mouth as a sex toy. I appreciate the fact that he’s never brutal when face fucking me, but the slow relentless thrusting drives me crazy. I reach down with one hand and realize that my panties are sopping wet. I play with my vagina with one hand as my other hand grabs the back of his ass. I forget about my date and only focus on taking the cock down my throat. True to his words, Eric really did need me. He came very quickly shooting gobs of cum down my throat. He pulls out, and one last unexpected spasm shoots some of his cum over my face, coating my glasses.

Both of us, somewhat satisfied are able to disentangle ourselves. He looks at me and smiles, “Man, we didn’t even get our clothes off.” I smile back at him and send a text to Marc, “Sorry hon, need to work late today. Can I take a raincheck this weekend?”

Her brother getting married in another country, I'm not interested in spending that kind of money to go",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2u1v8d/me_26m_with_my_gf_25f_of_year_and_a_half_her/,"Background: 

My girlfriend and I have been together since summer 2013. Went to HS together, knew each other but didn't really hang out much back then. We re-connected when her and my cousin were in a car accident together, only my gf survived. At first we were unsure if we were just sad together, as time progressed we found we truly do have our own thing going. I love her. She is absolutely perfect for me, and I plan to marry her one day. Right now I work and she is at the tail end of grad school, doing an internship 200 miles away from me.

Issue at hand: 

Her older brother ( she has three older brothers ) is getting married in May. The bride's family apparently has come up with this plan to cut down on the wedding cost. They are going to have the wedding in Mexico at an all-inclusive resort. Food and booze is already paid for by the guests as part of the package deal. So the cost of reserving a banquet hall and having a minister and tipping out the caterers is not much beyond the cost of the stay itself. Ultimately, the cost of the wedding is being pushed to the guests. 

My issues here are money and work schedule. I don't make much, salaried at $45k USD in an expensive city. I finally have enough money saved up to lump-sum my student loans in one payment, which is going to all but wipe me out financially. As soon as I get my tax refund that shit is happening. If I bought a plane ticket right now it would be $600 (*possible gamble- see next paragraph*). Her parents are going to get her a room, but I would have to get my own at a cool ~$400 per night. I'm looking at an easy $2,000 up front. I simply don't want to spend that on going to a wedding just to appease her and her family.

Aside from that, I work in maritime transport. It's a 24/7/365 operation, and my schedule is 7 days on/7 days off, 12 hour shifts. I agreed when I was hired that birthdays, holidays, whatever, I am expected to be at work. The wedding is on day-4 of my shift that week. I have two options to get away, the first is to trade days with someone who works the opposite week as me, which isn't always easy to find a willing person (also making it a gamble to purchase airline ticket). Or, I will have 40 hrs of vacation accrued by then (&lt;3.5 work days for me), but I don't want to use my vacation time in order to spend too much money on a wedding I don't want to go to and rush through it, and have to go back to work the day after I return home. I already need to use a vacation day or two to attend her graduation/banquet from grad school a few months after.

Basically nothing about it is appealing to me. I would rather use the money/vacation time to take her on a vacation, just the two of us, after she graduates and before she finds a job. I wish their wedding was just somewhere near home like 99% of the other weddings I've been to.

Her and I don't really fight, could be due to the distance, but even when I have spent full weeks with her we don't argue. I really don't know how she will react if I tell her I won't be going to her brother's wedding. I can tell she would obviously rather have me there versus not there, but I think she kind of understands where my head is at. 

I guess my question then becomes how might be the best way to approach this conversation with her? I don't want her or her family to be upset or offended but holy shit they are asking a lot out of me. I've already had to make her go to a few weddings alone (and miss some of my own friends' weddings) because of work last year (I used to work refinery turnarounds, 91 hr weeks for months at a time). Like I said, I just don't know how she or her family will react; my intention is to not go, while stepping on as few toes as possible.

---   
tl;dr: girlfriends brother getting married in Mexico. It is too damn expensive and will require too damn much effort re-arranging work schedule. I don't want to go. Looking for best way to approach that conversation. 

edit: words

**FINAL EDIT**-- Thanks to those who responded. Sounds like I just need to nut up and tell her I won't be going. I have a feeling she already knows it's coming anyway. I don't think this will make or break us by any means, I just don't like feeling like I'm disappointing her. I'll save up a little cash flow after I pay off loan and take her somewhere cool when she gets done with school. "
2u1vgu,10,2015-01-29,A teacher at my church is connecting dots between the OT and NT that I'm not sure belong together.

He's read some OT stories and emphasized details in order to show the mirroring in the NT with Jesus, such as the Abraham and Isaac narrative reflective of God sacrificing his only son, or the Joseph narrative with the baker and the cup-bearer being foreshadowing of the body and blood. 

What I'm really skeptical about are his ideas concerning hidden messages hidden throughout scripture. For example, tonight he spoke of the Genesis 5 genealogy gospel, where the names of the people can be interpreted to be an early account of the gospel. [This table displays it very clearly.](http://www.mayimhayim.org/Shemology/Genesis5.htm)

He's also gone on about TORAH being spelled by counting 50 words in Genesis and Exodus, leading to YHWH being spelled out in Leviticus.

I'm a college student, and I met my girlfriend (""A"") a few months into school. We started dating about three months after that, and things really took off well. I've been through thick and thin with A. We've surpassed everything from family and personal troubles to the arguably more minute things like stress at school.

Love has always been important to me. I've never been too close with my immediate family, and struggle with off and on again depression, so finding a significant other that loves me for who I am and can be an emotional crutch is a must, in my opinion. A and I have had our fair share of hardships, but we've always stuck it out and made our relationship stronger.

A is a very driven and talented individual. She's going to a top-notch internship halfway across the country this summer, and will almost certainly end up there after graduation, provided she doesn't somehow royally fuck up. On the other hand, I have no idea what I'd like to do for a living, and going where she is going will be tough to commit to.

I recently began a leadership position in a program at my university that helps incoming freshmen adjust to university life. As one of 12 leaders of this program, I'm constantly surrounded by 11 other people that are extroverted, fun-loving, have great senses of humor, and generally pretty easy-going attitudes. All in all, working with these people is a blast.

A is not like these people. She does make me laugh, she's incredibly driven, not the most extroverted or easy-going, and has shown me an immense amount of love that I cannot possibly do justice by typing on Reddit. 

Here's the caveat - the more that I hang out with my 11 peers, the more that I begin to think that maybe A isn't the right girl for me. I feel as though I may ultimately fair better with someone like that group. My problem is that nothing is wrong with my relationship now. Breaking up with A would mean utter catastrophe in ripple effects. Her family, my family, her friends, my friends, and the like would all make a big deal out of it. Not to mention that A would be unbelievably crushed and blind-sided. 

I'm afraid that I may break up with A, start searching for someone new, and then ultimately realize that I made a mistake. I could really use some advice in putting my thoughts together, so please let me know what you guys think. I appreciate the help!

For as long as I've known him, he's been talking about how his life is shit and how nothing works out for him: ""everything's fucking pointless cause this, everything's fucking pointless cause that"". I can't talk sense into him at all. I never was able to my entire life, but he would always say things like ""when I leave this world, I hope you remember me."" I thought this fucker was joking, but I can tell he's not and he's getting serious about it. I'm fucking infuriated because I feel powerless. I feel like a veteran psychologist can't change his mind, and he blocks out everything I say. He says that I'm being selfish because I want him to ""keep on suffering,"" but this fucker doesn't see it the other way. He doesn't see it that I want him alive. And I tell him that, but he doesn't acknowledge it in any way. He just acts like I'm saying it so I can make him suffer more. Fuck no, I think he's a great person. Sure he's a bit quirky, but that doesn't mean he's some low-life that he always claims to be.

This guy fell in love with a girl in college. He claims that he's tried everything to break his ""weaboo"", ""beta"" stigma by working out, drinking, stop watching anime, etc. From the looks of what he's told me, he gone out on a date with her at least once. Apparently, it didn't work out and he's thinking about ending his life. He claims there's more to it, and I'm sure there is, but how many fucking things can go so wrong in your life that you have to kill yourself.

This guy got an intern to Microsoft and he's looking to intern also at Weebly. He's fucking good at what he does, so it's not even like he's going to have a shit future.

I think his parents divorced long ago and I don't think they give him much attention. I'm sure this must have had huge impact on the way he thinks about things, but people around the world have this kind of shit going on all the time. They grow up, they get out of that shit hole. I don't think he's even trying. I think he's so stuck on one belief that he's not going to listen.

I don't fucking know what the fuck is going on and I'm shaking because I'm pissed as fuck, but I need to do something for him before he seriously kills himself."

So I uninstalled steam and all other games I had on my computer. 

The first day I did a lot of the stuff I was supposed to do - and more. This sounds dumb for most people, but I guess people here understand what I mean to say. I did all housework, had a successful interview for an internship (to which I showed up on time!) and studied a lot. Also looked into new things like programming and some other stuff I try to turn into hobbies in the future (concrete modeling and furniture/woodworking).

Unfortunately, yesterday I wasted about four hours on the internet. Sure, I was not playing games and I still got most of the things done I wanted to get done, but it held me back a lot. I really have to get some more self control. Wasting time is wasting time, and I feel like browsing the internet can have similar effects to gaming, so I will have to limit that or at least do it after I finished everything and feel generally that my day was productive.

Last night, out of nowhere, my brain decides to kick up a dream with her in it just to troll me.

She had this locket necklace that I was looking over and had opened and found some kind of note. Not sure where the locket came from or anything like that because this is a dream and weird shit happens in dreams.

I don't know if in this dream she was still with her current SO or if they were split, but after that we were sitting in silence and she took my free hand and placed it on her stomach and said ""You won't like this. I'm pregnant."" (context: Where I live single moms in my age range are an epidemic.). My head sunk a little deeper in her shoulder as I soaked in that statement and she added ""I know."" I sat in silence for the rest of that scene in my dream.

&gt; A little later in the dream something told me to congratulate her, so in sent her a text that read something along the lines of ""Was what you told me back there really true? If so, congratulations."" and at that point the dream ended.

After this dream it was something that felt so real to me that I had to check my phone to make sure that I didn't text this girl. I would have been devastated if I did.

A little background now on who she is.

As mentioned earlier I met her in one of my computer science classes. Her first comp sci class after she changed her major. She sat at a computer station several spots away from me initially, but that PC was not working so she moved over to the station beside me. We introduced, got to talking, and got along great.

I am not a person to make a move on a girl as soon as I meet her. I've been cheated on a couple times so I have this thing about not wanting to step on other guys feet when it comes to women because I know how it feels. I kind of sit back and wait for a SO or lack-there-of to come up in a conversation before I do anything.

Anyway, we sat and talked daily in class about all kinds of stuff. Tell stupid jokes to each other. This other guy that I was friends with was really creeping hard on her. She sat in a corner of the room beside me and this guy would roll over in his rolly chair and kind of pin her in the corner of the room when talking to her, which I'm sure would make most women feel uncomfortable. She told me some time after this that the only reason she felt comfortable when he did that was because I was there.

My roommate was also very aware of how into this girl I was and how awesome I thought she was... and my fucking roommate decided to send her flowers with an anonymous note attached with a clue to his identity. ""My favorite bird is the owl."" After she got these flowers she apparently went around asking people what their favorite bird was. She came into class one day when I initially had no knowledge of this and the first thing she said to me with a smile and giggle in her laugh ""What is your favorite bird?"" And I had no answer... because who thinks of what their favorite bird is? Honestly. Eventually I got her to tell me the story behind that question and found out that someone had sent her flowers. Later that day when my roommate and I were home I was laughing about the question and he told me he knew... and that it was him that had sent her the flowers. I fucking hate that guy. So now I have it in my mind that no matter what I said to her the idea of my roommate being a ""secret admirer"" would creep her out so I never really made another move after that. I still resent my friend for that to this day.

We still had classes together. We still talked a lot. We had these extra curricular things together so we hung out outside of classes some too. This other guy in our extra curricular club we were in kept badgering her to come to parties and stuff and looks-wise this guy was way better off than me. He was one of those tall ass dudes that had things really made for him when it came to looks. I was just a short, stocky.

We had trips where the club members went here and there for things. At one outing we were at a restaurant, all of us, eating. The waiter went around the table and we were sitting next to each other and the waiter even asked if she and I were on the same bill. I knew she was talking to this other guy now so I wanted to save her from having to reject me and said that they were separate bills... Had I known she wasn't talking to this other guy then I would have definitely paid. 

So here I am, graduated in 2013 so that was the last time I saw her in person and talked to her, but I still occasionally think about her. Think about how awesome she was and how perfect to me she was. How well we got along. But now she is dating this marine who was always an arrogant asshole in the classes I had with him, and they have a long distance thing going on since he works out West.

I don't live in a highly educated area, in fact, my state is one of, if not the lowest in terms of bachelors degrees by % of population. This girl was perfect... is perfect. She's a well recognized Accounting student, great grades, did an internship with a Big 4 accounting firm... she was perfect. I've dated other girls... who turned out to be dumber than a box of rocks with no ambition or intention of bettering themselves and it kills me to know what I missed out on.

I just wanted to type this shit up and get it off my chest to someone since it weighs on me so much and this dream last night stirred it up again. 

I don't know what to do. I'm just super bummed out and alone."

We had known each other for about a year before dating. We dated for about 5 months or so with which 3 were good. During the first 3 months, things went very well then towards the end of 2014 she found herself balancing a service industry job, school, an internship and family problems. Schedule got very busy to the point she could not make time for me. SHe works with addicts and their families and would often times come home emotionally drained. I put up with it for a little while as it got worse, so did my resentment so we decided to talk to each other. When we both couldn't find an answer of what to do next (We both said I really like you, I enjoy being with you, I wish we could go back) I broke up with her. I expected a ""yeh you're probably right"" but instead, it hurt her and she stormed off pissed. I really did not mean what I had said, I was left with no other option. I drove to her house immediately to tell her that and she said she needed to night to think about it. The next day she said it would be a good idea to take a break.

We texted some and I would go to see her at work a few times but she was still so busy to make any time. We haven't talked in a week. Here are my thought and questions:

We never agreed to any terms of the break and I am not sure whether or not to just move on.
This is definitely a much needed break, but how long does it last? 
Should I just break it off altogether?
I do care about her and I want a relationship with her but of course she wont have a social life until maybe school is over in May.

Has anyone gone through anything like this? Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

Why do you want to be a ___________? 

What are the criteria for being a __________________?  Degrees, licenses, apprenticeships, internships, etc?

What kinds of things does career do (responsibilities, daily work)?

What are the job prospects for your career choice in the future?  Good, bad, why?

What are the working conditions?

Are there geographic or other limitations for your career choice?



I would probably ask some other questions too pertaining to LCS.

2u3u3n,4,2015-01-29,Will I ever hear back?,lauren3309,peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/2u3u3n/will_i_ever_hear_back/,"Hello. So I know many people who have gone into the peace corps, both current, and former volunteers of all ages. A lot of people have had some small issues with their application process, but I feel like i may have an extreme case of losing to bureaucracy. 

So i will try not to go into too much detail but... I applied originally in Sept 2013 as I was finishing up my master's degree (would be graduating in May 14). I applied on the last day to leave the summer of 2014 (because I was neurotic about my essays) and  then the gov't shut down, my application got pushed back, and when I did my interview I was looking to depart around spring 2015. We that left a long time between graduation and departure and I still hadn't received an invitation so I started applying for jobs, got a great job, signed a lease, and it was late July with still no invitation. 

I made the decision to ""withdraw and reapply"" after speaking with my recruiter so I could live out my lease and commit a full year to my new position, that was late July 2014. I applied to a position for which I felt qualified submitted everything as needed, and have still not heard a word from Peace Corps. My last update on HR status is Aug 8th and when I emailed the country I applied to (since its on the new system) and they told me ""you will hear back if you are selected for an interview."" The departure for this country is Sept. 

I was 100% committed toward peace corps and personally feel very qualified to be a volunteer. I have a Master's degree, extensive volunteer experience, a solid academic record, an federal internship in central Africa, and significant leadership experience. Now, after all of this time I feel like I have lost all desire to be part of the Peace Corps. I feel like a number in their system and completely devalued as a volunteer. I still haven't withdrawn my app, because I am hoping that maybe when I hear back there will be some type of resurrection of faith in PC, but right now i feel extremely let down by the entire process. 

Has anyone else had a situation like this? Anyone have some enlightening words of advice to offer? I personally feel like i dont want to give up 2 years to something that does not value me as a candidate, and am extremely jaded that PC is even the best way I can positively impact the world.

Perhaps Lip could help him bag freshman girls and the Prof could do a little smooth talking for Lip (for things like better grades, scholarships, a bajillion recommendations and internships for Lip's future career). Even if the Prof has transferred to another campus or even another school out of state, wouldn't Lip try to get back in with his contact for hookups?"

2u4cdy,4,2015-01-29,Questions for the Devs from a BF fan,[deleted],BF_Hardline,https://www.reddit.com/r/BF_Hardline/comments/2u4cdy/questions_for_the_devs_from_a_bf_fan/,"So, let me start off by saying that video game creation never seizes to amaze me. And unless a certain studio is extremely open, we usually don't get filled in on the actual making of a game.         


With that being said, if any of the Hardline devs are on Reddit and reading this, would you be so kind as to answer a few questions I have regarding the making of Hardline?     


Okay ... here goes nothing.     


How long has it taken you to create this game from scratch? Not so much from when the idea was conceived, but from when you got the team together and actually started grinding it out in front of computers.     


*(Question optional, because it's probably not possible to answer via a Reddit post)* Could you provide a high level overview of the process? Idea, concept art, story, design, coding, gameplay mechanics, animation, sound, etc.? What I mean by that, is in what order is everything handled, or is it all at once, by a bunch of different teams?      


How big is the team that worked on Hardline? How many people are involved in the making of this game? From artists, to sound, to multiplayer/singleplayer, project managers, QA, interns, etc.       


Was learning the ins and outs of Frostbite 3 a big challenge? I read an article from Bioware about learning Frostbite and it was super cool to get an idea of what the devs went through to wrap their brain around it and use it to its full potential for Dragon Age Inquisition. (http://www.frostbite.com/2014/08/creating-biowares-first-rpg-on-the-frostbite-engine/)  


For all the gun sounds ... Did you start from scratch? If so, where did you get the guns, how did you record each individual gun sound and how long did that process take? I saw this video of Ian Milham going ballistic at the shooting range and was wondering if it was for Hardline (sound/handling/mechanics), or if it was simply for letting off steam from the internet troll haters. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpchI_fy3h8)  


Regarding multiplayer, how long does it take to create a map from start to finish? The level of detail in the maps blows me away from the photos and gameplay I've seen. I've always wondered how long it takes to actually create a map. You see kids online always bitching about wanting new maps at the snap of their fingers, but I think if they realized how much work went into it, they'd be singing a different tune, or at least be a bit more respectful.    


I have a gang of other questions, but I probably shouldn't press my luck. I don't really expect you to answer all the questions, or any for that matter, but I figured I'd try as these questions float around in my head anytime I see/play a video game. And I really think this stuff gets overlooked when a new game comes out, but it would seem people that love the game would also love to know how much work went into creating it and how exactly certain things were done.  


Thanks

2u4ebv,1,2015-01-29,"I [21/m] and my gf [19/f] are currently in an LDR, might need to let her go. Need Advice!",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2u4ebv/i_21m_and_my_gf_19f_are_currently_in_an_ldr_might/,"     Sorry if this is a long read so just bear with me. My gf[19/f] and I[21/m] have been in a relationship for a year and a half now. She was living in China at the time (she's white though) and we met through mutual friends as she would always visit my town during the summer. When she went back we started getting to know each other and constantly texted/skyped for about a year. It was when she moved to my town for good after finishing high school that we started dating.

     Since we have been together, a couple months here and there has been long distance due to her traveling a lot. Her family is pretty wealthy and they would send her on internships to Germany and Southern California. She took a year off school to do this and our main base of communication was through text and skype. We would practically see eachother during the summer months and Christmas break. However, despite all this we made it work. I ended up taking my Spring semester off to travel to Rome, Italy and teach English for 3 months while she was in Germany at the time. After I finished my program and she finished her internship she flew to see me, where we ended up backpacking through Europe together for a month. It was the best time of our lives. When we came back to the States we spent a good 3-4 months living together due my family moving to Canada (I am Canadian as well but have lived in the States most of my life). 

     Unfortunately, when she started University that was about an 8 hour drive, we had to once again do long distance. The first month of her being gone was fine and we talked constantly, but it was stressful for her because she was homesick and not making any friends. I tried to help her and even made plans to visit her to make her feel better. She joined a sorority with my encouragement to make some friends which ended up being the worst mistake I ever made. After joining the sorority she made a good friend base and started making more friends outside of the club where a lot of them were guys. She tends to be a flirt sometimes without knowing it which always makes me nervous. I was worried about it but was happy that she made friends and was having a good time. It was once she started having a good social life that she started growing distant. She was always going out with friends and barely talked to me. I understood it was because she was out having fun, but without even realizing it she would sometimes say some things just to brush me off and not talk to her. An example would be her one word answering me or not even responding at all for a few hours. Since day one we have been talking all day everyday for the past 3-4 years of knowing eachother, so it became a casual thing for us. We still texted everyday, but it was mainly me trying to keep the conversations going. 

      After about 2 months in school we started argueing a lot over stupid crap. She started questioning our relationship saying its really hard because I am not there while she is constantly surrounded by guys. She had become dependent of having me physically be there with her and unfortunately I wasn't able to fully satisfy that due to the distance. No matter how many times I reminded her of all the things we have done together like our Eurotrip among other memories, she couldn't help but have second thoughts.

     We had even made plans for me to visit and bought the plane tickets a month in advance. However, about a week and a half before the flight, she ended up breaking up with me citing that she really does love me but the distance is too hard and we've been constantly arguing. It was a huge emotional break up for both of us. Her parents payed me back for the flight ticket (which was pretty embarrassing but I am a college student with a part time job so I did need the money) . While we were broken up we continued to text everyday (I should have stopped). About a week after we broke up she started seeing someone else which really hurt me. I began to drink just to go to sleep because I couldn't stop imagining them in bed together. Let's just say November was not a good month for me. 

     Eventually I met this girl about 3-4 weeks after my gf and I broke up. We hit it off and started hooking up which was a great distraction. When my gf came home for Thanksgiving she was seeing the other guy but not officially. Even though she was seeing him, we ended up making out and acting like we were together again during the Thanksgiving holiday. She told me she wished that we were still together but the distance will only cause her to miss me again and not work out. When she came back for Christmas she had broken up with the guy over there and we ended up hooking up all Christmas break. We decided to get back together on Christmas Eve and have been together since then. 

     We have been doing the long distance again and she is coming to visit this weekend. However, since I am a Canadian living here on a Visa, I cannot go to school in the States because I can't pay for it. I recently got accepted to University in Vancouver and will go there in the fall. I am moving up next month to get myself situated and will come back in the summer for a month or 2 to spend time with her and my friends. We talked about this yesterday where she basically said that she loves me but she doesn't see us working out in the future. We decided that we are going to talk about it this weekend and see what direction we will take as a couple. I love this girl and she loves me but I've been having trust issues with her do to her hanging out with guys a lot since we got back together honestly, and am starting to think the best thing to do would be to let her go and move on. I feel like I am just holding her back from being happy because she could be with someone who can be there for her at the school. My heart wants me to keep trying but she i worried that we are just setting ourselves up for more heartbreak to try and keep this relationship going. 

    I know most of will think it's not worth the effort to stay together but I could really use some advice on what to do this weekend. We have been through a lot together in the past year and half that I would rather not give up due to distance. If I could get an outside perspective on what to do I would really appreciate it."
2u4myk,2,2015-01-29,Q's about 1L summer judicial internship,NYC1L,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/2u4myk/qs_about_1l_summer_judicial_internship/,"I'm a 1L at a T2 in NYC (Cardozo/Brooklyn/St. John's).

Last semester, when many 1Ls sent out dozens/hundreds of applications to federal judges in the first week of Dec, I decided to study for finals instead. I sent out a # of applications to NYS Supreme Court (in NY this is trial level) judges after finals around the turn of the new year. Mostly radio silence, a couple of interview requests, and one acceptance in a reply email - no interview, grade follow up, anything - just got a ""we have an opening, contact us in May after finals to set your schedule up"".

As I was told that I cannot turn down a judge's acceptance multiple times by OCS and peers, I accepted the emailed offer and turned down the pending interview requests. (It did not hurt that the location of the court is a nice 20-30 min commute from my house).

Fast forward a week. Got my grades from Fall 1L back - and I did way better than I could have imagined - 3.8+ GPA. Further, after searching up the judge online - websites like the Robing Room and the like, and the judge has astoundingly terrible reviews for a million different reasons, but consistently negative and discouraging.

While I definitely should have researched the judge more before I applied + accepted, and while I maybe should have applied more broadly/more prestigiously during the fall, this is where I'm at.

A few questions (some may seem dumb but I guess I don't know as much as many people around here how the process works and don't want to ""sell myself short"" after a good start):

1. Being that I did pretty well grades-wise in fall, and being that my school only places 10% or so in ""big law"" / OCI jobs, I will of course have to do well again this semester to get such an opportunity. But if I do maintain the grades, will working for a trial level judge in general hurt my chances at interviews or the like? Would I be handicapping myself in any way / is there anything I should consider from OCI P.O.V with regard to this internship?

2. If so, or even if it won't hurt, should i NOW apply to federal internships? paid jobs? i know most federal judges interviewed already but was told that people with good grades interviewed just weeks ago and both received federal internships. Considering I'm probably top 1-3%, is it worth giving it a shot for federal now? is it worth applying to paid jobs, or is it too late/not worth the time now that spring started, and grades are presumably more important? I'm on a good scholarship, am still really poor, but the school supplies a small stipend for judicial internships which would hold me over. So, money isn't toooo big of a consideration, especially if I get something lucrative in the future.

3. How bad is it that the judge got terrible reviews on the internet? I know there's self-selection bias etc but these reviews were numerous and scalding. I don't mind not having the nicest boss for 10-12 weeks but if someone has experienced w/ this type of thing, I'd love to hear how it works/worked. Also, any 'big picture' considerations when working for someone like this, if he rubbed too many people the wrong way?

4. Are there any general ""goals"" I want to complete this summer? I read awhile back that this is a good time to get a good writing sample, obviously get experience in a courtroom, sit it on the proceedings. but is there anything specific i should be focused on besides ""getting a legal job""? Do I need a writing sample? anything else that I should be considering while interning?

5. any other advice/words while we're here?


Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post. Guess I had more Q's than I realized. Appreciate any/all advice.

TL;DR - got a summer judicial internship w/ a trial-level judge who I never met and know nothing of. The internet thinks hes the worst. I got good grades and am now wondering whether i should generally try to get a better summer internship/job, and specifically if i should try to find a different judge/employer.

No matter how many times I reminded her of all the things we have done together like our Eurotrip among other things, she couldn't help but have second thoughts. 

We had made plans for me to visit and bought the plane tickets a month in advance. However, about a week and a half before the flight, she ended up breaking up with me citing that she really does love me but the distance is too hard and we've been constantly arguing. It was a huge emotional break up for both of us. Her parents payed me back for the flight (which was pretty embarrassing but I am a college student with a part time job so I did need the money). While we were broken up, we continued to talk/ text everyday (stupid on my part I know). About a week after we broke up, she started seeing someone else which really hurt me. I began to drink just to go to sleep because I couldn't stop imagining them sleeping in the same bed together like we used to be. November was not a good month for me.

Eventually I met this girl about 3-4 weeks after my gf and I broke up. We hit it off and started hooking up which was a great distraction. When my gf came home for Thanksgiving, she was seeing the other guy but not officially. We ended up making out and acting like we were together again during the Thanksgiving holiday. She told me she wished that we were still together, but the distance will only cause her to miss me again and won't work out between us. When she came back for Christmas she had broken up with the guy over there and we ended up hooking up all Christmas break. Even went to Tahoe together. We decided to get back together on Christmas Eve and have been together since.

So as of right now we are still doing the long distance again and she is coming to visit this weekend. However, since I am a Canadian living here on a Visa, I cannot go to school in the States because I can't pay for it (international student fees etc.). I recently got accepted to a University in Vancouver and will go there in the fall. I am moving next month to get myself situated and will come back in the summer for a month or 2 to spend time with her and my friends. We talked about this yesterday, where she said that she loves me but she doesn't entirely see us working out in the future if I end up living in Canada. We decided that we are going to talk about it this weekend and see what direction we will take as a couple. I love this girl and she loves me, but I am starting to think the best thing to do would be to let her go and move on. I feel like I am just holding her back from being happy because she could be with someone who can be there for her at the school. My heart wants me to keep trying but she is worried that we are just setting ourselves up for more heartbreak to try and keep this relationship going, no matter how much we wanna stay together.

I know most of you will say it's not worth effort to stay together, but I could really use some advice on what to do this weekend. We have been through a lot together in the past year and a half that I would rather not give up on because of distance. If I could get an outside perspective on what to do I would really appreciate it.

2u50zo,3,2015-01-29,"20 years old. Has my life ""begun""?",[deleted],Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/2u50zo/20_years_old_has_my_life_begun/,"Hey guys, like the titles suggests, I am 20 years old. I'm currently in my sophomore year of college at my local community college slaving through the core classes so I can transfer to a university next semester. I also work part time at best buy as a mobile auto tech installing audio equipment in cars.

My issue, or concern rather, is that I'm not doing anything. Ever since graduating high school I've felt as if time is flying by and I'm not doing anything great with my life so far. Many of my friends my age are already getting married or at least engaged, have a career set out for them, have moved out, and have a plan for life. I'm still at home taking my college courses and working part time while getting to see my girlfriend on my off days. Besides that, I don't feel as if I'm doing anything with my life. I feel as if it's slipping by and I have accomplished much of anything yet. I'm in school for software engineering and programming is a passion of mine. I'm always making small projects in Java, c++, unity, etc making games and other useful things. I hate the job I have now. It's a chore more than anything else and would love to (call me a nerd, but hey it's what I want) move to California to work for the game development company Blizzard as a developer, or at least start with an internship. They have a great internship program but I have no clue how I would even get started. I have all my friends here in Georgia, my girlfriend lives here who I love and plan to propose to in the next year or so, and all my family is here. 

I suppose my question is, what should I be doing with my life? I have no motivation anymore and no drive to do anything mainly do to my mediocre and simple life. I'm a very ADD and OCD person and like to work on projects and do new things and must constantly be doing something or else I fall into a slump.

My ideal dream would be to pack everything up now, make a road trip to California with my girlfriend, find an apartment, and begin my internship/job. Is that even a possibility? should I finish school first? Am I still young enough to pursue my dreams?"
2u56bj,3,2015-01-29,"Trying to figure out myself, is this depression? Is this fear? Loneliness?",z7throwaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2u56bj/trying_to_figure_out_myself_is_this_depression_is/,"Honestly, just the thought of posting to somewhere like here is foreign to me. At 20 years old this is first time I've begun to I guess question myself, I don't know what I feel or even how to overcome the obstacles in front of me. I guess I hope that somehow my rambling and just typing this out will help me to figure myself out, and if anyone has advice I'd really appreciate it.

I guess I'll start with how I'm currently doing. Everything comes in waves, I'll hate myself for a day, I'll feel motivated for a day, I'll hate everyone around me for a day, I feel like I'm constantly changing and I can't find the happy medium that I'm searching for. Getting up is a chore, going to the gym is a chore, doing my school work is a chore. But at the same time those chores are an escape, an escape from my mind where I can focus on something else and not just ponder everything that is bugging me.

I guess there are two main factors in this thing I'm feeling, my future and its uncertainty and ex (insert stereotypical heartbreak). I'll start with the first, my future. I'm currently in my third year of civil engineering, I'll have my degree in the spring of 2016. I've had an internship last year and I'm sure I'll be able to find one this year, it's not having a job that bothers me, it's what it entails.

When I leave school, I'll be leaving everything. Last summer for my internship I worked with people all much older than me, that I can't really relate to outside of the workplace. Throw on top of that working out of state, and I pretty much spent a summer alone. I'm afraid that is what my young professional life will turn into.

I'm afraid that I'll finish school, move away, buy a house, and look at myself in the mirror one year later and realize I'm not happy. Did I pick the wrong field? No, I don't really think so. I never minded going to work, some days I looked forward to it, sometimes I would have rather stayed home, I can honestly say that out of everything I've been exposed to in my life I picked the field that most interest me.

But it's that leap, that starting a new life, what if nothing works out. How am I supposed to meet new people, how am I suppose to form relationships, and avoid spending every waking moment feeling utterly empty and alone?

All these thoughts thrown on top of the rest of the stresses of my life and I'm overwhelmed, maybe it's just the thought of the giant age gap that I know will exist in my field. I'll be working with people 50+, I feel like if I just had a normal retail job or something I would have the opportunity to connect more with my peers and I wouldn't be so worried.

The next topic, I hate discussing more than anything else. I feel like it's such a dumb thing to let bother me, it's so stereotypical and I feel like I should just get over it. I just have no idea how to cope I suppose, and it's adding this huge weight to me.

When we broke up, she said that something happened in her life and that she couldn't be with someone. She did that over text, after we finished a trip together and I haven't seen or spoken to her since. That was a month and a half ago. She was the first person I've dated in my life that I actually truly cared for, I've had girlfriend in the past, but it always seemed more for the sake of having a girlfriend.

When she left me, and above all left me without the closure of something to help me move on I was destroyed. I was in the worst state I've ever been for probably 2 weeks. I tried my best to surround myself with friends, and things to do just to forget about her.

I guess what I felt was what everyone else who goes through something similar feels, the emptiness inside you. The feeling of loneliness and how you just want to cry every time you wake up in the morning or go to sleep at night. I've gotten much better, but I can't shake that last bit. I don't know what to do to get that last bit of hope that she'll come back out of me. I want to move on.

I sit and think to myself how to move, do I move on, how do I cope when things get really tough? Do I try to just sleep with other women, try to form an emotional connection with someone else? It's the feeling of just lying in bed alone, knowing that there's really no one in the world looking out for you that kills me right now. But I don't get why it kills me so badly, before her there never was anyone like that. Why can't I just go back to how I was before her?

Both of those things that are troubling me combined have put in the state I'm in. Is it depression? I don't know. I go through the motions everyday, I force myself to remember to eat, to go out, to put on the face I know I'm supposed to have. But there's also the day I just lay in bed go to sleep and never wake up. It's not that I want to die, but to just sleep my life away, to escape it all. I don't know... If anyone actually reads this I'll be amazed, maybe I just needed to put it down.

So continuing the story about my relationship with the college intern that I worked with.
Just to recap:  Her name is Jamie and she is a 19 year old, 5’1, blue eyed, blonde, pale, sex machine with a super sexy midriff (toned but not diamond hard six pack) , and a great ass.  Not to mention her Amazing C-cups with light pink nipples.  They were incredible.
I am 24, 6’1, with brown hair, a little better than average looking, with an average build and a little longer than 7 inch dick.

After the first night we hooked up the restaurant kicked into high gear for a banquet and we both worked double shifts for about 3 days.  Leaving us with very little time to sleep, let alone bang.  I dropped her off after the final banquets shift and we both agreed to go to sleep, wake up late, then meet up after breakfast at her place then bang for the entire 2 days we had off.  I went home and passed out.  

I showed up at her place around 1 and knocked on the door.  She answered the door wearing just a White t-shirt that barely reached her thighs.  I said hi and stepped in.

She shut the door and roughly pushed me up against it and started kissing me.  She was really aggressive and I was too shocked to react.  After I got my wits about me I grabbed her ass and started to lift her up so that I didn’t have to bend over to kiss her.  She stopped kissing me immediately and pushed my hands away so that she was back on the floor.

She grabbed my belt at the buckle and pulled me to the living room and shoved me on the couch.  Then she undid my belt and pulled off my pants and boxers at the same time.  She pulled off her shirt, tossed it on the floor and looked directly in the eyes for a second.  Man she was hot, her perfect breasts, her hard nipples, her glistening shaved pussy, everything.  Also in this moment I realized I had a ridiculously hard boner.  She was all I could think about since we hooked up last.  She drove me wild just being near her at work.  But that moment only lasted for an instant.

She got on her knees spit on her hands and started sucking my cock like the world would end if I didn’t come in the next 2 minutes.  She was using both of her hands on my shaft in a twisting motion and was sucking on as much would fit in her mouth.  She was being really messy and it felt good, too good.  

Now remember how busy I was at work for the last 3 days.  And how we didn’t have time to bang.  Well I sure as hell didn’t have time to masturbate, so I had 3 days worth of jizz in me and I wasn’t going to last long with this kind of treatment.  But I was not gonna cum after 5 minutes again either damnit!  I had to slow her down or find a way to last longer.

“You should suck on my balls some.” I said as I took off my shirt and threw it on the floor somewhere.

She kindly obliged and started licking and sucking on my balls, but she kept stoking my shaft at 90 miles an hour.  Shit this was not going to work.  But damn it felt good.  Then after a minute or so of that she switched back to sucking my dick.

Fuck.  I need a break, something, anything!  I know!

“Lie down I want to eat you out.” I said 

“How about you shut up and fuck me.”  She counter offered.

Fuck.

She straddled me and slowly eased my cock into her while biting her lip and moaning.

Man she was tight.  She felt amazing.  I was going to lose so hard.

She finally had me all the way inside of her.  I grabbed her hips and started guiding her up and down my length SLOWLY. Maybe I can do this after all.  

“You wish!” She laughed and grabbed my hands and held them against the couch by my shoulders and started riding me.  Hard.  Not the kind of riding that girls sometimes do where they grind on your lap. No. She was bouncing all the way up the length of my shaft and back down.  You could hear her wet cunt slapping against me as she rode me for all I was worth.  She was moaning too, loudly, very loudly.  I forced one of my hands out from her grasp and grabbed one of her breasts.

Shit I am going to come.  Damnit.

Then she stopped and fell forward landing with her lips against mine and started making out with me.

She stopped.  Thank God she stopped.

She laughed and I looked at her quizzically.

“I really wanted to make it to the bed this time” she said in between kisses.

Anything to give me a break for a few moments, I thought.

“Well let’s do it then”  I said.  I wrapped my arms under her knees and around her back and stood up.  Going even deeper into her.  She gasped and arched her back and made a face like I just split her in half.  Which I very well might have.  Then she bit my shoulder.  Hard.  I carried her like that across the room and down hallway to her bedroom.  Each step I took bounced her down on my dick and each time she screamed through her teeth and bit down harder. 

I threw her on the bed and she laid there with her mouth open and a look of shock on her face.  But the walk across the apartment along with the ridiculous bite on my shoulder was enough to get me back in the game, and now it was my turn.

I rolled her over on her stomach and pulled her hips up so I could fuck her doggy style.

“Wait…I don’t think I can…OH GOD!”  She moaned as I pushed into her and started pounding her like she was riding me earlier.  She put one hand against her mouth to try to muffle the noises she was making as I fucked her and she was desperately grasping for a pillow with the other hand.  I kept pounding her for a few thrusts then tossed her the pillow she was reaching for.  She immediately shoved her face into it and started screaming.  I started fucking her harder and felt her coming on my dick.  It felt amazing, and watching her amazing ass getting railed by my dick that could barely fit in her was enough to tip me over the edge.

I pulled out my dick, pulled her by her hips so she spun around and fell off the bed so that she was sitting on the floor facing me and I came on her still gasping face.  After 3 days without masturbating, and after edging for that long it was one hell of an orgasm.  The first rope landed right in her mouth and on her chin, the next 3 landed on her neck and chest.  Then she reached up and took over stroking my cock.  The next rope hit her on the right cheek as she leaned forward and took the rest of my load in her mouth.  She swallowed and kept sucking on me for a little while.  Then she leaned back and looked at me with her amazing blue eyes, cum dripping off of her face and tits.

“Holy shit that was awesome.  Do you always come this much?  Fuck I can’t even move.  Go get a towel or something!”

“Not even close, you’re just lucky” I said.  I picked her up and carried her to the bathroom.  We took a shower together and fucked a lot more during the rest of our 2 days off.  Which I will tell you about another time if you want.  I have some other good stories about her that I am thinking about writing down also.


Let me know what you think, and please tell me if there is anything I can do to improve my writing for you."

He deleted me off everything and we didnt talk till the end of this summer. 

August we hooked up, and he said he wanted to be with me after that. We went strong for three months, and everything was perfect! I showed no signs of jealousy! last month before finals he broke up with me. It came after a night where i blew up his phone because he went to a party and ignored me the entire time not inviting me either. He blamed it on us not knowing where we'll be when we graduate this spring (hes pre med but hasnt got accepted, and i need to find an internship who knows where for 6 months). I told him I would move where he goes.

We talked everyday after the breakup, snap chatting and talking everyday about life. We both havent had sex with any one but eachother and we have not been seeing others. 

We hooked up last friday after talking about it for a while. Everything was fine untill these past two days. I get really angry when he ignores me and tend to send him lots of messages/snaps. He seems to be drunk and just deleted me off ALL social media and blocked me and my number. I can't contact him at all and I don't what's wrong with him. One day hes sooo nice does smilies and responses and all that. Now he is shutting me out.

I'm slowly getting my life back together. I have a long story which I will detail later, but I need some advice please. They don't understand why I feel sad, and keep forcing and badgering me to get my life together.

I have an internship because of my depression in the past 6 years, I couldn't hold a job. I'm now recognizing my inner demons and tackling them, when years ago, I would hold a knife to my wrist every night comtemplating death. I'm still on the brink, but just barely.

Now they are forcing me to come over the weekend. They bought the plan ticket behind my back and didn't get my permission. I'm really scared, and I don't want to go but they put the words in my mouth. I can't say I can't go because it will upset them and they will take drastic measures like force my cousins to kick me out, or force me to relocate back to my home country.

Guys, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I don't want to see my family. They are making me sad. Not before I get my life at least looking better. 

I've only just now had the courage to reach out to a therapist. I don't know what to do. I don't know what excuse to give that's believable.

Then he told me that he had taken a bunch of drugs and was hoping to die in his sleep that night. I desparately tried to get ahold of his mom, to no avail, so I found out as much information as I could about where he was and called the police in that area to check on him. They must have, because he posted an angry status about how someone called the cops on him knowing that he has warrants, but he was not arrested.

Yesterday, my mom called me to tell me that my dog, who is living back home with my parents while I'm at school, has peripheral vestibular disease (basically dog vertigo). It's fairly common in old dogs and he's expected to recover completely in a couple of weeks, but it hurts me so much to not be able to be home to help take care of him. My other dog just died during finals week in December, a week before I was able to come home. He was old and got to the point where he couldn't move, and my parents had to have him out down. 

And to top it all off, tonight I recieved a rejection email for a summer internship that I really had my heart set on. That's two rejections so far of five applications.

Having listened to everyone's opinions here (thanks everyone meant alot), i decided to tell her over skype about my travelling plans. I think this was a better idea. She sounds excited to see me, and is happy she can change her plans for when i come. In regards to the cheating idea, which sparked my curiosity having read all of your comments, i decided to confront her about cheating as well. I asked her straight up, told her that things have felt somewhat suspicious lately, but she has profusely told me that there is nothing to worry about, that she hasn't been going out and looking or men, and that i really need to not worry about it. She was happy i was upfront and asked her b/c she agreed that things would have looked suss. Another positive is that she has been told that the internship she was potentially going to get that would have extended the LDR for another 6 months has been refuted. Someone else got in there before she could... She's a bit disappointed about it, which is fair enough. This means that she's probably going to come home now in 3 weeks. She spoke to me about moving back in with me which seems like a positive sign (this was the original plan). Anyway i'll keep you guys posted on my trip to OHIO and hopefully all ends well! peace brothers and sisters :)





Story


Basically, i have booked tickets to see my gf of 5 years in about 3 weeks time. We have been apart now for 3 months, as she is interning in Ohio (I'm in Australia).

I haven't told her anything, and my plan is to call her when i'm within meters from her, and then telling her i'm here, in a very surprising fashion. I'd like to think that this would be a pretty cool thing to do, surprise her in such a way.

This problem is.

- I just found out she is intending on travelling to California with this lady. (gf has been living in this rich old ladies house, who owns the business hosting my gf as an intern.) She plans to do this trip about a week into the time i'll be there. I'm worried me coming will be an inconveinance in a way. 

However there is a chance that i will be invited to come. i know my gf said earlier during her stay over there, that this lady would let me stay in her big house if I came over. Maybe she will let me stay in her californian holiday house as well? 

- We have recently been through a rough patch lately, and i'm scared of the possibility of finder her with some else sometimes. She has lately been suggesting the idea of having an open relationship. Can't help but think that would have been a big waste of money if she's been fooling around, or lost her love in me.

What if she gets mad that i came to see her. Telling me I should have told her. What if she isn't as thrilled to see me.

Is this something that would be considered romantic, or is it just plain irresponsible? ... Should i just tell her I'm coming over?

Edit: Main reason for GF suggesting an open relationship is b/c she's been offered another internship thing
for another 6months, and doesn't know if he can handle the distance any longer. She doesn't like to masterbate even though she has a relatively good sex drive. I know for a fact that if couldn't please myself, my head would be all over the place sexually.

Edit 2: Guys i'm planning on emailing/getting in contact with the old lady to give her a heads up of my surprise. I'm going to ask her if she 'knows' if my gf has any plans. (i'm going to play dumb)

It feels unrealistic to be at a level of still learning, but the requirements of an internship are still out of reach. What did you guys do to gain your experience, and get over this hump?  "

2u7xev,3,2015-01-30,Me [24F] let my career come in between my relationship of 3 years with my ex-boyfriend [31 M]. Do I opt for a grand gesture to get him back or forget it?,thriftycent24,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2u7xev/me_24f_let_my_career_come_in_between_my/,"Hi Reddit.

I need help with a grand gesture -- or if I should even pursue that option.



My boyfriend of three years recently broke up with me and I am severely devastated. He was my first everything: love, sex, intense connection, etc. Which is why this is even harder to deal with.



We met in graduate school as literature students. He saw me in a class I was observing, then approached me at a poetry party. I was hesitant to pursue this at first because I hadn't been in a serious relationship before and because he lived with his ex girlfriend (I know, I know). They were in a tough place with a lease they couldn't get out of (they had separate rooms), so I agreed to go on a date. It was a very instant and easy connection. 



He was very gentle and understanding with my lack of experience with relationships, love, sex. He had no problem going slowly. Which I really appreciated. His ex was a bit of an annoyance, but it was one I got over, as the lease finally ended and he was able to move out.



For the next two years, we had a good relationship, but we fought. They were pretty intense, but we always resolved them. We had such a passionate love for each other that conflicts couldn't stand up to indignation. He would constantly (and I meant constantly) tell me he had never loved anyone as much as he loved me, I'm all he ever wanted, there weren't words for what he felt for me, his life was better because I was in it, etc. And I felt the exact same.



However, the thick of this post lies in our last year of the relationship. Before I even met him, I had dreams of working in publishing. And I spent my last year of grad school doing anything I could to bulk up my resume for that career. I was still so in love with my boyfriend, but my career aspirations were also playing a large role in my life. It's all I would talk about (admittedly) all last spring, especially as graduation came closer. New York was where I knew I had to go.



He understood this and did everything he could to support me. He helped me interview, passed jobs along, offered to look over my resume, the literary company he worked for paid for me to go to a conference with him to network, etc. He wanted me to follow my dreams. However, they often sidelined him. 



He wanted to come with me to NYC, but only if we would live together...as that was a step he needed for us and I had been putting it off because of fear. In his heart, he really wanted to be in the Pacific Northwest, but was willing to give that up to be with me. I told him I would think about it. He had lived with other exes before, but this step was one I was on the fence about. Not because of him, but because I was just afraid.



In the meantime, I was offered a spot at a summer program at Oxford. He supported that, even though I'd be gone for a month. When I came back, a top publishing company in NYC offered me an internship. Without thinking, I took it. He also supported me. Throughout all of this, he became very sad and distant, which I understand in retrospect. However, he never shared any of those feelings with me while they were happening. Instead, he turned to friends in his moments of need and forced himself to be happy for me. Because of this, his feelings for me began to change. And he made steps to move to the Pacific Northwest. 



While I was at my internship, I realized I didn't actually want this. I didn't want New York. I wasn't happy there without him. I wanted to live with him. I told him this and he told me it was too late. He was moving out there and he didn't know if I could come with him.



Before he left, we held each other and cried for a while. He told me he loved me and wanted to fix things. I wrote him a letter, expressing deep sorrow, regret, and amendment for the pain I caused him. He told me I broke his heart when I didn't want to live together; that he took that as me not wanting the next step. Even though I never said that. He told me that I wrote him out of my life when I chose to go to NYC without him...even though I didn't want to be there without him. I just wasn't sure if I was ready to live together yet.



He's been out there for a month and we talk. But it's mostly about how I want to go out there to be with him and him not wanting it. Even though for the past year, he had asked me to move out there with him. Now all of a sudden, he doesn't want it. He gave me hope for the past month, saying he needs a bit of time to get acclimated. However, this past week, he told me doesn't think he can be the person I want anymore. That the love he has for me isn't the same as the love I had for him.



I'm a mess. I can't eat, sleep. All I do is cry and miss him. I don't understand how someone can tell me I'm all they ever wanted, and then turn around and say I'm only a friend. There's a part of me that believes I'm not completely lost on him. Especially since he wanted me out there so desperately months ago and because he loved me so desperately months ago.



But I don't know. I don't know if I should let him go, give him time and try this again, or what. We've both hurt each other over this last year. But we've been through so much before that there's a part of me that feels we can overcome this. But I'm not certain.

I've been building a brand new Reddit app for iPhone over the last year, and I'm finally at the stage where I can announce it to all you lovely people. It's called [Apollo](http://apolloapp.io).

I've been a Redditor for about 4 years now and for a lot of that I've been craving an iPhone app that makes Reddit amazing. I was lucky enough to get hired at Apple last summer as an iOS intern, and I learned a ton from some really smart people that I've poured into this app.

I put a real emphasis on making an app that makes Reddit feel right at home on the iPhone and super comfortable to browse, with beautifully large thumbnails, smooth gestures, really nicely organized comments, a super fast way to jump between subreddits, a lot of great features from iOS 8, and the great features Reddit offers (view gilded comments!), and a lot more. I'm really proud of the result, and it's the client I'm using day to day now. 

[Here's a few screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/UVJrx)

It's not quite ready to launch yet, but I'd love to get some input from the community on what they think so far, and what they'd love to see in their perfect Reddit app. I'm also going to be opening a public beta in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for that if you want to get an early look. :)

If you want to get notified when it's released, I made a [website that you can sign up at](http://apolloapp.io), and there's also a subreddit that I'll be posting updates to: /r/apolloapp

PROBLEM: I'm bored, sometimes when I'm with her I really just wish she wasn't there, like she annoys me. There's nothing new in the relationship... ever. She sometimes calls me to talk about her day and I just can't wait for the phone call to be over.

I don't know if its just a phase I'm going through or if the relationship has run it's course. 

Reasons why I haven't ended it: I still love her and don't want to hurt her feelings. We met in college, we share all the same friends. Don't want people to start choosing sides. Please any opinions or suggestions will be appreciated.

I know that physically, living my life down there would be no different than living my life where I currently am.  It's just being away from my comfort zone and support system that has me freaking out.

You can find Part 1 [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2tyhto/fucking_the_college_intern_long_mf/) and Part 2 [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2u5p7y/fucking_the_college_intern_part_2_long_again_mf/)

So continuing the story about my relationship with the college intern that I worked with. Just to recap: Her name is Jamie and she is a 19 year old, 5’1, blue eyed, blonde, pale, sex machine with a super sexy midriff (toned but not diamond hard six pack) , and a great ass. Not to mention her Amazing C-cups with light pink nipples. They were incredible. I am 24, 6’1, with brown hair, a little better than average looking, with an average build and a little longer than 7 inch dick.

This is a few hours after Part 2.  We had banged 5 or 6 times since then, ordered pizza, watched some Firefly, and instituted a “No wearing clothes allowed in the apartment” rule.  I couldn’t tell you what time it was because I really didn’t care.

We were laying on her bed naked, Firefly was playing on Netflix, but we weren’t really paying attention.  She was laying half way on top of me and half way next to me with one leg over my hips and both of her hands on my chest and her chin on my chest looking up at me with her amazing blue eyes.  I had my arm down under her arm and grabbing her amazing ass and I was stroking her hair with the other.  Every once in a while she would stretch up and tenderly kiss me, then put her head back on my chest.

We talked about a bunch of different stuff, mostly work related things.  Who she thought I should bang after she leaves, which waitresses I had already slept with and what she thought about them.  The stupidly hot assistant pastry chef with the great ass and awesome boobs that she wanted to have a threesome with me with.

Then she fully straddled me, sat up with her hands on my chest, and started rubbing her pussy up and down my shaft.  I ran my hands up her thighs, up her stomach, and grabbed her breasts and tweaked her nipples a bit and she moaned as they started to get hard.  My dick was slowly getting harder and harder, and she started going faster and faster.  She grabbed my hand and brought it to her mouth and gently bit my thumb.  I spanked her and she squealed a little and smiled at me around my thumb.

I was completely hard at this point and she lifted herself up and slid my cock into her.  She was so tight.  She was incredible.  She eased herself down on me and sat on my lap for a little while looking into my eyes.  She was so beautiful.  Especially when she sat on my dick like that.  With her amazing, perky tits for all to see; biting her lower lip and rubbing my chest.  She slowly started grinding me with a devilish smile, never looking away from my eyes.  I moaned, this was amazing.

Suddenly her expression changed to something of a “eureka” expression and she leaned over and grabbed her phone.

“You’re going to make me jealous” I said as she sat back up.

“Shut up this is important” she playfully swatted at my chest.

I laid there patiently for a while as she checked her phone.

“Its here!”  She got up and ran out the room while putting my jacket on, which was huge on her.

“Wait where are you going?  I’m not done with you yet!” I shouted as I heard her keys jingle.

“I’ll be right back you’re going to like this!”  She shouted as she opened the door.

Damnit.  I reached for my beer on the bedside table after I heard the door shut, and started watching Firefly as I waited.

Several minutes later I heard her come back in, throw her keys on the table and open some drawers.  Then I heard some rattling like a pill bottle.  She walked back in with something in her mouth and dropped my jacket on the floor.  It was cold outside and she had goose bumps all over her.

“What was that about?” I asked as she got back in bed and pulled the covers over her.

“After the first time we hooked up, and I couldn’t fit you all the way in my mouth I looked up how to deep throat, and I found these mints online.  They are supposed to numb your throat.”  She said in the most innocent voice I’ve ever heard.

She chewed up the mint and pulled the covers lower and readjusted herself so that she was laying down in between my legs with my semi hard cock right on her face.

“You ready?”  She said with a devilish grin.

“I don’t know if I’ll ever be ready for this.” I replied.

She grabbed my shaft with one hand and started sucking on my head.  Swirling her tongue around my head, and giving the tip those little kisses that drive me crazy.  I was back to being hard in an instant.

“Do you think you can handle it?” She said playfully and slapped my cock against her tongue?

“Stop talking with your mouth full.”  I said as I grabbed the back of her head and pushed her down on my cock.

I felt my cock go past her lips, then over her tongue, then past her molars, and bend slightly as it went down into her throat.  Her eyes went wide and looked up at me.  Then she pulled back and gasped.

“Holy shit these things are awesome!  That was so easy!  How did it feel? Wait I want to try something!”

Then she went back down and deep throated me again.  This time she opened her mouth and licked my balls.  I moaned and told her how amazing it felt.  She pulled me back out.

“Dude! I’m like a porn star!  Fuck my face some!”  Her enthusiasm was amazing, let alone the awesome head I was getting.

I grabbed the back of her head and pushed her back all the way down on my cock.  Then I pulled her back and thrust in again a little faster this time.  I’m not trying to accidently stab her brain or anything.  She pushed me back out of her mouth.

“Come on! I don’t want any of that pussy shit.  Fuck my mouth like you mean it.” 

I think that was one of the single hottest things ever said to me.  I complied.

I grabbed her head with both hands and went to town.  I could hear the wet noises as I fucked her throat and felt the ridiculous amount of spit coating my cock every time I pulled back.  It felt amazing.  Jamie gave amazing head, but this was on another level.
I felt her hands on my hips as I was thrusting into her.  Wait she wasn’t just holding on, she was pushing away!

I let go and she pulled away coughing and gasping.

“I still need to breath dumbass.”  She said between coughs.

“Shit Are you ok? I’m so sorry” Well at least she wasn’t dead.

“Oh shut up, you’re loving it.  Now lie still, you don’t know what you’re doing anyway.”

She started bobbing her head on my cock, and she was right.  This was so much better.  She twisted her head as she bobbed up and down and stroked my shaft with one hand whenever I wasn’t all the way in her mouth.  I felt myself getting ready to orgasm.

“Oh Fuck! I want to come in your throat” I moaned.

“You fucking better.”  She said as she came up for air.

She went back down on me bobbing even faster.  I was about to come, but I didn’t want her to stop mid orgasm. I grabbed her hair.

“Take a deep breath.”  I said as I pulled her up.

She gasped and I shoved her all the way down on me and came in her throat.  It was an amazing orgasm that lasted at least 20 or 30 seconds, but considering the copious amount of sex we had earlier I am sure there wasn’t that much cum.  I thrust into her mouth a few more times then let her up for air.

“Well?”  She said out of breath.

“I think you need to hide those mints or else we might have a problem.”  I said as I found a towel for her to clean up with.

“How about I put them right here and we can get more if we run out.”  She said as she put them on top of the bedside table and wiped herself off.

“Wait how many are there?” I asked

She laughed and kissed me for a few seconds.

“Well there are 49 now.” Then she kissed me some more.

After that I went down on her for at least a half hour and made sure she came plenty.

That is still some of the best head I’ve gotten so far.

Please let me know what you think.

2u9upt,114,2015-01-30,My experience being raised as a Jehovah's Witness,balancespec2,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2u9upt/my_experience_being_raised_as_a_jehovahs_witness/,"EDIT: Sorry in advance for the length, it's a somewhat emotional story though.

Growing up, I was horribly enslaved to a religion, otherwise known as Jehovah's Witnesses.

The cult, which likes to hide behind its awkwardly different name, is actually pretty terrible.

Most people know them as the weirdos that don't celebrate holidays, not even their own birthdays.

What they don't realize is that, as a JW, you technically aren't supposed to ""associate"" with worldly people. Worldly being anyone who is not a baptized (or trying to become baptized) member.

You can be acquaintances with them, though even this is a ruse as they just want to appear friendly enough so that the person won't be turned off by the religion. 

Bottom line, if the person has no interest in converting, you aren't supposed to hang out with them. It's like a really fucked up pyramid scheme.

Because of this, I lived a *very* sheltered life during crucial social development years (ages 6 to 12). This has turned me into the antisocial abomination I am today.

The cognitive dissonance in this religion is extreme, to say the least. They forbid their members to Google any information on the ~~religion~~ cult that isn't published by the ""Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society""... which is the headquarters of the church. This is because of the many gaping plotholes that exist in their failed prophecies and teachings. 

If you question their teachings, or give any inkling you think they might be wrong, or not God's word, you risk being marked as ~~sane~~ an ""Apostate"". You are then considered a threat to the flock, and promptly disfellowshipped. *(Parents will literally cut off their own children for apostasy. Literally will not speak to them or help them in any way. The only loophole to this is if the child was never baptized, they cannot technically be disfellowhipped, and therefore cannot be shunned. This is the only reason my mother still talks to me, as I was never baptized.)*

The ironic part about all this is that they don't exactly lie to you, they just spin the facts the same way an abusive husband would to his battered wife.

For example *""Do not Google us, for you will read Satan's (untrue) words and it may shake your faith. Do you really want to ruin your faith and risk sacrificing your chance at everlasting life???""*

They're admitting what you might find will make you lose your belief in the religion, yet somehow they pawn it off as mystical satanic voodoo and scare people away from doing it.

It's ironic that you can rape and kill, and be forgiven, but the one unforgivable sin is ""apostasy"".... basically questioning the religion.

They even go as far as saying *""it is prophesied that we will be persecuted""* and use this as justification for someone like me posting about how crazy the religion is.

That's pretty much the equivalent of an abusive husband telling his wife *""Hey, when you go outside today they are going to see the bruises on your face and call me abusive. I am foretelling this!""*

And then when it actually happens, the wife is dumb enough to believe that he is God and foretold it, and thus her cognitive dissonance builds.


Anyway, the people of the religion are for the most part good, they're just all trapped in the same hell. Many of them secretly doubt the faith (like North Koreans) but fear speaking out because of the harsh ""apostasy"" rules.

The best part is, when I was 12 I once told my mom *""Boy, it sure is good that I was born in the truth, because if I wasn't I don't think I would be able to be converted based on our logic.""*

At the time I genuinely was glad I was born in. I literally thought that I was going to live forever in a paradise Earth, and was grateful that I was born in versus having to be convinced, because I was a very skeptical person by nature. I knew that if my eternal life depended on someone winning me over with their arguments, I was doomed.

By the time I was 15, I was not following the religion how I should. I appeared to be, but was secretly fapping like crazy and attempting to fornicate with girls left and right. Deep down I still believed in it all, and felt horribly guilty for being a normal horny boy.

Around this same time, an elder (JW speak for deacon/pastor whatever) in our congregation befriended me and became a mentor. He had me intern at his mortgage company he owned and even paid me minimum wage. I made all kinds of business connections, and it even paved the way for me starting a little software business at 16. I was very grateful to him.

As I grew older, I started to doubt the religion more and more. By 17 I was living with an unbelieving relative, and thus was under no pressure to attend the ""meetings"" (JW speak for church).

As I faded out, my only friends (because I wasn't allowed to have worldly ones) began to shun me. They felt that based on my low meeting attendance I was a bad person, and thus bad association. I might influence them to fornicate or something.

At 18 I had no real friends, all the JW ones had left me and I didn't have any wordly ones because I was internet schooled and wasn't allowed to have any growing up. Sure I met people at work, but my social skills were all kinds of fucked up so it was really hard to make new friends.

I will forever credit Sid Meier for saving my life, because soon after my 19th birthday I began playing Civilization IV. About halfway through the game, I zoomed out and noticed all the different religious symbols on the map. I saw how they pushed on eachother, how they started wars with eachother because *rawr my cross is better than your yingyang rawr* and I just realized how silly it must look to a God, if there is one.

It was in that moment that I had an epiphany, and began to research the forbidden ""apostate"" materials I wasn't allowed to before. 

I remember being crouched over my computer at work, instinctively as if a JW was watching me. As I researched more and more on the ""forbidden websites"" about the JW's, I realized there was no bombshell, no red herring.

I literally learned almost no new information, they just spelled out everything I was taught matter of factly, and in such a way I realized it was all bullshit.

The best way I could describe it was they took the comma out of the sentences. Suddenly ""I'm ready to eat, Grandma"" became ""I'm ready to eat Grandma"" and I was horrified.

The JW's had tons of failed prophecies dating back to the 19th century. Every time something they foretold would fail, they would gaslight their members into thinking it was never a prophecy. To this day, you will be told you are crazy if you try to bring them a book from 1906 saying the world was ending in 1914. They will literally tell you, despite it saying ""copyright Watchtower Bible and Tract Society"" that it is a forgery, and you are an apostate for even entertaining such an idea.

Fast forward to my early 20s. I have no friends and a crappy job. My little software business had failed and I was in community college. I felt my life was going nowhere. I decided to try to re-connect with the mortgage guy mentor I had when I was younger. He was super smart, owned a company with over 50 people. Surely he would see the logic in what I found, and together we could save the world from this cult.

I called him up and told him what I had found. To my surprise, he listened and seemed sympathetic. He even offered to meet me at a local Panera to discuss my research. He seemed genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of this.

Little did I know, he was the equivalent of the FBI agent in the movies giving the encouraging ""uh huh, go on"" while motioning for his partner to activate the line trace.

I showed up to the Panera, only to find him flanked by another member of the congregation leadership (another elder). I knew there was trouble.

I sat down at the small table and both of them pulled out bibles. About three scriptures in, I just got up and left. It was hopeless, and honestly I felt more betrayed that he ""set me up"" for an ambush than if he had just told me off over the phone.

Years later I tried reasoning with my crazy mom, who is also still a devout JW. After a 6 hour phone conversation with her, I finally thought I was getting somewhere. I had dropped logic bomb after logic bomb, and she was starting to crack. I was finally starting to think that after all these years I might have a normal mom under all that crazy.

She started to fight back tears and basically told me in so many words that ""without the religion she had nothing to live for"". 

I pretty much realized that by telling her the truth about the truth, that I was tearing open the very wounds this ""religion"" sealed in her before I was even born. 

She was a broken person, and this cult was the only reason she didn't abort me (which she often brings up), and is the only reason she is still alive today.

I broke off any discussion of philosophy or reason. It was then I realized she was not my mother, but a patchwork of blind faith and a mental corpse. My real mother was long dead, a victim of whatever horror she faced early on in her life.

It was like a really fucked up Star Wars, to finally confront the most evil thing in the Universe only to find out it's the very reason you exist.

I was not sure how to feel that night, and to be honest I'm still not.

TLDR: Grew up in a crazy cult, tried to save the two people that ever cared about me out of it, only to find out the cult is the only reason I exist.

EDIT: I am 27 now, both of these events happened a while ago. While I am doing fairly well economically, these experiences have permanently scarred my ability to make *real* friends or having meaningful relationships with women. I truly believe this religion is abusive and indoctrinating children into it is wrong."

When I was younger I remember all I thought about was girls. Everything I did was to make myself a better candidate for a potential girlfriend. I wanted to go to college because girls liked that. I wanted to be fit because girls liked that. I was obsessed with fitness. I played a lot of sports and I was a pretty good football player. And you know what? I was liked by the girls. I had few girlfriends in high school, and my senior year, I had a year long girlfriend, the high school sweet heart I suppose you'd call her.


Turns out we had to split when we went to college. And I chose to get away, so I went to college in a new city, where no one else from my high school went and I stopped focusing on sports so much and I made school my life. After all I gotta get rich for the ladies. So a semester went by and I had trouble making friends and I got lonely, but I turned to my studies when ever I was feeling down. And hey, turns out I'm pretty good at school! 4.0 my first year there, got job as a tutor teaching middle schoolers, joined a robotics club (resume boosters!). Everything's going great. But I haven't made any real friends. and I still haven't met any girls. 


As I'm going through my studies, I'm also maturing a little bit, understanding the rational of my old ways. I can't tell if my labido is going down or if I'm just exiting puberty, but girls aren't all I think about anymore and they certainly aren't my motivation. I like what I'm studying. I love what I'm studying (electrical engineering, physics). I'm applying for internships and research experiences and getting them! I'll be graduating this spring and attending graduate school in the fall. Everything is great and my career is just beginning.


But no where in my endeavors do I interact with the opposite sex. Somewhere along the line I have forgotten how to socialize. I'm to a point where I have acute anxiety every time I'm anywhere near anyone attractive, even a coworker. I'm a funny guy. I know I'm a funny guy. I'm hilarious. I laugh at myself all the time. But any sense of humor I have around women vanishes. I can't hold conversations. Unless we're talking in a professional setting, I can't talk. I have no idea how to appeal to women.


And I'm still attracted to the opposite sex. But more so to their intellects rather than their physicality (unlike when I was a teenager getting a boner when looking at anything that resembled a boob). I guess I just miss talking to girls. 


Anyways, this is a throw away, and I'm just ranting shit. Turns out I have a one on one study session with a pretty cute girl tomorrow (she's a math major, huge turn on). Let's hope I don't say anything awkward.

I also have an a.s. in culinary arts, ACF sous chef certification, and servsafe manager cert. I have 5+ years in the culinary industry, most of which were in management positions and have done nutritional consulting for most of the restaurants I've worked for (menu analysis and such).

All of that being said, I seem to be having a hard time getting myself out of the kitchen and into the clinical field. I've submitted a number of applications to local hospitals and long term care facilities for cdm and director of nutrition services positions, all of which I'm suited for according to the posted requirements for the job, but can't seem to get past the first phone interview with these facilities. 

I'm starting to wonder if I should settle for a nutrition service team leader or dietary aide position, knowing that I can eventually work my way up once I'm in the system. Or should I simply revisit my resume and hold out for the position I'm looking for.

Let me know if there's a more appropriate location for it.  
I just wanted to rant/vent and get some perspective because I've been mulling this over since I heard about it a few weeks ago.  I'm an English assistant in a non-English-speaking country.  I taught in a school last year and the previous year with a guy who was a little weird but seemed nice enough.  At first he just seemed socially inept and bad at talking to me in particular,  a foreign female.  He was my coordinator within the school so I was supposed to go to him whenever I had problems or questions.   Anyway,  I used to question his behavior toward certain little girls in class because he would pretty much leave the rest of the class to its own devices or let me teach while he went to chat with them,  often putting his arm around their neck in a weird, we're-good-buddies headlock.  He'd also whisper to them so I couldn't hear anything and I'd usually see the girls nod shyly.   He never did this with boys. I took it as unprofessional favoritism and possibly an inappropriate desire to befriend kids in first and second grade.  He was physically much smaller than me and a couple years younger than me and I thought maybe it was a weird complex he had about his size.  Beyond that I didn't see anything more suspicious.  I thought that as I'd seen kids and adults be a lot more affectionate with each other in this country than I'd ever seen in the US, that the line was probably more blurry here about what was and was not appropriate.  Besides that I convinced myself that he was behaving this way in front of me,  another adult, as well as a class full of other kids.  If he thought there was anything inappropriate about it,  he'd probably wait until he was alone with them.  I had an American co-worker who was an assistant like me and I asked him what he thought since he and I were the only ones ever in the classroom with this weird teacher at the same time.  Does this seem like abnormal behavior to you?  He agreed that it did but we never agreed to take action or figured out what,  if anything we should do since he'd never done anything beyond the headlock and whispering that we'd seen.  This strange teacher also appeared to be well-liked by other teachers and parents alike so we convinced ourselves that he was weird but harmless.  My contract ended last June and I moved to a nearby school.  Another American girl replaced me and started working with the weird guy.  Then apparently some shit went down before Christmas.  I work with the sister of a teacher from that previous school and she tells me a few weeks ago that yes,  weird teacher has been accused of inappropriately touching girls in class, specifically during movies,  and that now he's been fired from the school and a lot of that rests on the testimony of the newest American teacher's assistant.  On top of that,  27 different families are suing him/pressing charges against him. Exactly which of the two wasn't clear when speaking to the co-worker's sister about it.  
English isn't her first language either.  
Finding this out has made me rage a lot,  and feel a lot of regret that I didn't act at the time. I'm not sure what I could or should have done.  I didn't have a lot of friends among the native staff, which is why I asked the only person I trusted what he thought,   and I have the distinct impression that people in administration would not have taken me seriously if I had talked to them.  We'd repeatedly butted heads before about them not doing their jobs because to me they were lazy fuckers.  My work position was a pretty precarious one as I was basically an expendable foreign intern who was rocking the boat and pissing people off for two years straight.  But I still feel shitty and responsible,  like if I'd decided not to give a shit about losing my job,  I could have prevented him from getting to that point although I hadn't seen exactly the behavior he's accused of. 
Anyway,  after he was fired, apparently his father came in to the school to talk to them and scream about how could they do this to his son,  etc.  His son is 30 years old and probably a pedophile.  The school doesn't want to be associated with that obviously.  Apparently the school is helping the 27 families and that American assistant is a witness for their cases against the guy.  Some of the kids involved are probably as young as 4 since he also taught in preschool, but not with me.   I have no news beyond that.  I'm upset that it seems I didn't do my job properly and protect kids from him.  I keep fantasizing about how I would've reacted if I'd caught him in the act or if I ran into him on the street now.  How I'd have to explain to the police why I was beating this ugly little man to a bloody pulp and then I'd probably be deported.  
I watched the documentary Deliver Us From Evil yesterday about the pedophile priest who had hundreds of victims over several decades and is roaming around still free to interact with children although he's been convicted and served time in jail for it, and I want to do something to make sure this isn't the case here.  I don't want this teacher to have access to kids or end up working in another school or some shit like that.  
In the documentary the priest was able to talk about what he'd done to some of the kids and in some cases was smiling.  He was obviously still getting off on it and still extremely dangerous to children and even to his now middle-aged victims.  He even invited them to visit him so that he  could apologize in person, but really he invited them to retell the story about what he'd done to them.  It sounded like he wanted to reminisce about old times and probably get off on that as well.  I'm imagining this teacher having a similar mentality and lack of empathy for his victims and it's making me rage even more.
If anyone has suggestions or questions about something I didn't explain properly,  let me know.   What, if anything, can I do now? It may all be resolved in court eventually and people have said I should stay as far away from this situation as possible at this point.  My information is probably unlikely to be very damning to him.  But who knows.  Any opinions?"
2uav5m,2,2015-01-31,Drug dealers have opened up a front business to mask their illegal activity only to realize that the front business is their true passion and calling in life.,[deleted],Junweithele,https://www.reddit.com/r/Junweithele/comments/2uav5m/drug_dealers_have_opened_up_a_front_business_to/,"""Freddy, 3 number two's, no onions.""

""On it!"" Fred shouted from the kitchen.

Hey, names Ted, I'm the co-owner of the popular small run-of-the-mill diner down in 31st avenue, F &amp; T's. Its been only two months since the short opening of it and the popularity is already rising. Who knew Fred, the man who could have strangled a man with his bare hands, was such an amazing cook? And me, the guy who had been the face of the most frightening man of secret underground NYC, would actually enjoy listening to strangers talk about their day in the office?

I love it here, its peaceful. Don't get me wrong, the place is a rats nest and the tips are horrible, and most people would not agree with disowning Manhattans largest cocaine production and trade industry for a washed out dinner with faulty lighting all the time if they were me. But this place, I just enjoy being behind the bar, smelling the crispy, oily foods being cooked in the kitchen, the soft music playing in the background, pouring coffee for tired souls during their lunch breaks and listening to them ranting about their god awful pay and what they would do to their bosses if they had the chance. It just feels...like I'm at home.

""Order up!"" Fred said as he rang the kitchen window bell.

""Got it."" as I handed the dishes to the Regulars.""Alright 3 chicken burgers with a side of curly fries, no onions. 2 Coffees and a root beer float, that'll be $17.90.""

""Thanks Ted, Your place is always the best, no one can make a coffee as good as yours!"" Geoff, the legal accountant from a small company down the road along with the other 2 interns, chirped.

""Yeah, Thanks again for the food. By the way, Ted, you got a girlfriend?"" Sally, Who just graduated college, said with a flirty smile.

""Knock it off Sal, with all the floats you're drinking, you think you can score with anyone?"" Jackie smirked.

""How bout you look down and take a look at your self first?"" I said with a grin. Everyone at the table laughed, and Jackie looked away in embarrassment.

I left them to their food and went into the kitchen, where Freddy was clearing up some dirty dishes.

""I finally got rid of the last of it, the basements is clean now, and the last worker got his cut, I just need to dump the last load tonight and we will be home free."" He quietly said, without looking up from the sink.

""Good, we will toast tonight with a bottle of wine, to the new found success.""

I went back behind the bar as I brewed another pot of coffee. I hear the ring on the front door and stopped dead in my tracks, two NYPD policemen standing there, their car parked right outside the diner. Crap, did they finally figured where I was hiding? No, that's impossible, I made sure we wouldn't be found. Fred still has the last shipment still in the van, if they decided to search it, we are done for.

As they started to walk towards me, I didn't realize I had reached down the bar to grab my old pal, a Smith and Wesson's model 10. Its been a long time since I felt the cold handle against my skin. It disgusted me, it felt unfamiliar, although its been with me the entire time in my past life. But I can't let them, I can't let them take this away from me, I can-

""Excuse me? sir?""

""w-what?""

""Are you alright? you seem dazed."" The tall officer replied.

""no, no I'm fine"" I managed to choke out.

""Okay then, can my partner and I have 2 coffees please? Black""

""And a chocolate doughnut for me."" The other officer replied.

""Yes sir, coming right up.""

As the two officers sat down at a booth, I turned and had to lean against the bar to keep my self from falling and catch my breath, my knees were shaking and my hands were cold and sweating. Did they not recognize me? I though for sure they were here to arrest me. That was when I looked into the mirror beside the booze shelf.

I looked nothing like I did before, I had shaved my beard a month before and have kept shaving since, my face showed less dusty wrinkles and my hair was neatly combed. I looked...normal. I guess this is what happens when you change for the better, I took one last glance at the mirror and went to continue the pot of coffee.

As I poured the officers their coffee, I looked one last time at them as they enjoyed their coffee, they showed no recognition, I smiled to myself, I guess that's that, I'm free, a new life for me that isn't perfect, but it makes me happy.

As I hear the next song being played I can't help but whistle to the tune.Today was a good day, and that is all the really matters."
2uayql,7,2015-01-31,Software Dev Internships,Ouiski,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2uayql/software_dev_internships/,"Hi, 
I'm currently studying a software dev conversion course, and for it there is a 6 month work placement. I'm currently looking at different companies around Dublin to apply to. 

To give a bit of background on myself, my original degree was in biology, but I've always enjoyed problem solving, and with that I think I've taken to coding pretty well. In the course we've been working in c# for OOP and have done database dev, operating systems and web development. I have found that I've enjoyed OOP the most so far, I do genuinely enjoy the problem solving aspect of it. 

The course I'm doing, while intense, is actually really enjoyable. I've always enjoyed learning things, and the pace at which I get to learn new things each week is great. So my question is: Is anyone familiar with companies who take on interns, and give them a challenging workload that will benefit the intern in terms of further developing a skill set? To tell the truth, I'm a bit anxious of ending up in a place without a good structure, and then doing menial or repetitive work.

TL;DR I'm looking for advice on good places to apply as a software dev intern WHERE good = ""real responsibility, challenging, structured development"".

Thanks!"

#Parents


So, I'm 19 and I'm MTF, been on HRT for about a year and a couple of months. My parents are ultra conservative Christians (they believe in speaking in tongues and shit), and I hadn't told them about me doing the whole transition thing yet. I'd been using my shitty retail job to pay for therapy (only went a couple times to therapy to be sure I was trans) and HRT. I had been compressing my boobs a lot so my parents didn't notice the ridiculous growth there, and for the most part I was stealth transitioning... until a couple weeks ago. 

I was sleeping in my bed, and on days I was experiencing a lot of breast growth I wouldn't sleep with the compressor or a night shirt on because the breast pain was so painful. This was one of those nights, but I made sure the door was locked so that my parents would do the usual knock and open the door thing. Well, that Saturday morning my mom did not do the usual knock and open the door thing. She unlocked the door, and snuck up on me and scared me awake, thinking she would be playful because I had become such a basement rat. I get scared easily. I freaked out and she got a face full of B Cup breasts that she had never seen before, and never expected me to have. 

Shit.

Seriously, I will always remember her face when she saw my tits. Her mouth was so wide open that I thought she was going to dislocate her jaw and eat me like some sort of snake. 

She left the room really quickly, and didn't say anything to me. Knowing my parents... I knew shit was gonna go down so I threw some clothes, my laptop and phone, my pills, and many other things into the trunk of my car just in case shit went super south.

Well, a lot of hours passed and it was getting to be around dinner time, and my dad came home from the car dealership, and I waited... 

Soon enough I hear a lot of loud talking upstairs and my dad comes running down the stairs REALLY loudly. It was like he was trying to stomp the stairs into the ground. Well... I got screamed at a lot, mainly stuff about ruining my body... got slapped very hard across the face... and was told I had one day to leave the house. I went upstairs and tried to talk to my mom... but she wasn't interested in talking.

So, I grabbed my keys and left with all the stuff important to me already in the car (the car was left to me by my grandma when she died, so its all in my name, all paid for). At least I'm good at planning ahead! 

I drove down the street a little bit, parked on the side of the road, and planned on what I was going to do. I was / am still part of this gaming club at the college I'm going to, and I made a lot of friends in it and most of the girls in the group knew I was trans. So... I started calling all of my girlfriends to see if I could get a place to stay for a week or two until I could get things figured out. No one answered, probably because it was late in the day on Saturday. So, I left them all voicemails and text messages detailing the situation and asking if they would let me crash at their place for a week or two. In the meantime, I decided to drive down to McDonald's to leech off their wifi and figure out ways to recover from this shit ass scenario. 

Here are some things that were going through my mind at the time:

 * How the fuck am I going to pay for college by myself? My job probably pays me 10k a year at best, and my savings (at around 4k) will be spent on gas, food, and titty skittles. I guess I could take out a student loan if push came to shove, but this shit is bound to be hard to balance. 

 * I'm gonna have to be sure all my bank accounts and shit can't be accessed somehow by my parents. I decided I would retrieve some cash from an ATM down the road, and then go to the bank ASAP to get that stuff worked out. Won't go into too much detail about this, it's super boring. 

 * Shit, I probably need a birth certificate and stuff. I don't got nothin'. Might have to request it from some agency.

 * I'm still on my parent's phone plan, so I might get cut off from service sometime in the near future. Might signup for some cheap stuff.  

 * Where the fuck am I gonna live?!

I got really hung up on that last point... 

And then I thought of something that was OBVIOUSLY a good idea when you are a gal in a super vulnerable position.

I posted an ad to Craigslist looking for a sugar daddy. Now, I seriously wasn't expecting that ad to work, and I posted a bunch of 'looking for help' ads as well so I could couch surf. I also looked at various websites for couch surfing, but sadly there just wasn't that much stuff for that where I live.

At this point, it was really late in the night on Saturday, and I was getting very tired, so I locked the car doors and fell asleep next to Micky Dee's at around 1 am. Thanks Ronald.

#Amy the Awesome

Well, I woke up that Sunday morning in my humble abode, and my phone was exploding with text messages from my concerned friends. :) It made me feel really good that people were concerned about me, and one of my friends, who I'll call Amy, said that she and her boyfriend had agreed to let me stay at their apartment for a week or two until I can get things somewhat together. So I drove over to their place, told her almost everything that I said above, and then I broke down crying. 

I cried so hard and long it started hurting my lungs and eyes, so I had to stop. Amy was really good to me, and seriously sat there for a solid hour just holding me as I cried on her couch. I seriously never would have thought someone would show so much compassion to me in my life, but Amy went above and beyond. Jesus. I'm tearing up now as I write this. She's such a good friend. I have no idea how I'll ever repay her. It was around lunch time at that point, and she made some sandwiches and she started talking about rumors of that new Guild Wars expansion with me to try to get my mind off of everything that was going on. I found it kind of funny, and it really helped. The day went by and we were talking about all sorts of random stuff, like video games, our families (caused a lot of sniffles from me), the universe and everything. Amy, her boyfriend, and I had the type of dinner that only college students living by themselves could afford, and then I crashed on their couch. Jesus, Amy, if you keep being so awesome world peace will be achieved.

#Monday, Monday

Anyways, I called in sick for work on Monday morning because FUCK WORKING RETAIL. I really would prefer to get fired for being absent than working during such a shitty week. However, I did carpool with Amy to college so I could talk things over with friends and let them know I was okay, and of course go do all of my classes which my parents paid for, because at this point I seriously did not know if I would have another semester of college, so I'm trying to go out with a bang and finish my associates degree at the least. 

I'm gonna gloss over a lot of that day, because the classes were mainly ignored by my racing brain and I cried a lot to my friends about life, boring stuff like that. I also got in touch with a school counselor to talk with about things, but she had a super long waiting list and I couldn't do anything with her till the next week. (When I did meet the counselor, we didn't really talk about much, I had a hard time opening up to her.) I met up with Amy and her boyfriend and we drove back to their place for the evening.

#Emails

When we got back to Amy's place, I didn't want to outlive Amy's insane hospitality, so I checked my throwaway Craigslist email to see how many replies I got to my ads.

And this is where shit gets raunchy. I had a *ridiculous* amount of emails from guys who want to be my sugar daddy / boyfriend. Note that I did include some nudes of myself in the pictures (all without face, but I'm probably the only trans person for miles...), and I kind of think I have a good figure and nice boobs, considering the whole business going on down there... 

Anyways, I sorted through around 15 dick pics and 20 people saying ""heyyy :)"" and finally came across this older guy who seemed super serious about the sugar daddy ad I had posted. Like super serious. Basically, I gave a lot of ludicrous things for guys to fulfill and pay for, and in return I would perform sex stuff on them and keep their house clean, cook for them (I LOVE COOKING), and so on. And this dude just comes out balls to the wall with his life story, and gives all this proof that he was exactly what I was looking for. Here are some of his defining characteristics:

 * He's nearly 60 years old (ew.. but okay... I'm desperate) 

 * He's actually kind of attractive for being nearly 60... I'm kind of surprised by these pictures he sent with his message.

 * His wife died 12 years ago due to cancer, and he's just looking for a FWB type deal. He says he wouldn't push me for sex, but really wants someone he can be intimate with and could help him with his house. 

 * And then there is a picture of his house. ITS FUCKING HUGE. Three stories? What the fuck? On a lake? WTF 

 * He says he would like to meet me for a dinner date at Red Lobster. He's gonna pay. Buddy, you are speakin' my language. 

So, I am intrigued by the prospect of free dinner, and basically tell him my situation. I told him I essentially have no female clothes, my hair is a mess, I have no makeup I can use that matches my skin tone (Amy is pretty tan, I'm very pale, and the rest of my girlfriends from school are hispanic or black), and I am broke as balls. 

He responds, and he basically doesn't give a fuck. Wow. Okay, sounds like I'm gonna get some free dinner! I set up the dinner date for Friday and give the guy my kik, and then I tell Amy about it before she goes to bed. She reads his stuff and, like me, goes ""ewwww"" at his age, but once the free Red Lobster part of the message comes around, she looks me dead in the eyes and says, ""You better bring me back some of those fucking bread rolls."" We high five each other really hard, and then she tells me ""be careful though, it sounds pretty fishy."" I tell her I agree, and we go to sleep. Amy is great.

#Quick Interlude

I still hadn't heard anything from my parents ever since I was kicked out on Saturday. I also didn't go to work at all through Friday and used up all my sick days, so I basically had this entire week off except for the days I went to school. So, by the time Friday rolled around I was pretty well composed and borrowed some of Amy's make up to make myself semi-presentable, which was only possible because my skin has been forgiving to me the past couple of months. Also borrowed some perfume. I was so anxious all week long leading up to this dinner date. Didn't know if I was gonna get roofied or some shit, but Red Lobster just sounded too good, man, so I wasn't gonna bail. I was also looking through internships in my field the entire time, applying to 10ish jobs a day. Hadn't heard back from any of them yet to his day. Hopefully will get something good eventually. 

---
#Da Date

Anyways, here's the date. We decided to meet up at a Red Lobster that was somewhat halfway between Amy's place and his house, so it only took me 20 minutes to get there. I waited outside for him to come up. I was honestly expecting a no show, but then he showed up! He looked pretty much like his pictures, and to my surprise, he was taller than me, even though I am 6ft tall. He seemed like he took pretty good care of himself for being in his late 50s, and had a head full of white hair, and a trimmed grey beard. I stood up and decided to hug him, said 'hello' in the sweetest voice I could make (as if my dinner depended on it!), and we went inside. 

We went up to the podium that Red Lobsters' have to make your reservation or whatever, and the place seemed fairly crowded. Luckily, we got some seats very quickly, and we sat down at a fairly secluded two seat table. I kind of felt like I was getting a lot of looks, not because I was trans (I know I pass, I mean, look at these honkers), but because I was with this clearly much older guy. I guess a lot of people might have thought I was his daughter or something, not sure. Anyways, we both sit down at the table and we both have our hands / arms on the table, and the first thing he does is grabs one my hands with both of his. And holy hell, this guy has some attractive, yet rough, hands. Even though I have pretty big hands, his just dwarfed mine because of how meaty and rough they were... 

Anyways, I was kind of preoccupied with how quickly he went to the hand holding thing, and then the waiter kind of awkwardly butts in and asks us for what drinks we'd like, and my date tells him to bring water, and I ask for Coke (because Pepsi is for devil worshipers). And believe it or not, my date lights up when I say Coke. I raise my eyebrow, and then he begins talking about how he worked for Coca-Cola, and how he ended up being on the team that helped advertise Coke in South America and the Middle East. He said he traveled to the Middle East and Brazil a lot, and talked about all the sites and holy places. He ultimately didn't like the Middle East much, because apparently Coke got boycotted a lot at the time because some person believed the Coke logo contained anti-Islamic messages, so Coke basically abandoned the Middle East project and moved him to South America, where he did a lot of work for what I assume to be good pay.

I actually really enjoyed talking to him about history and the roles he played in it, and he seems to have had a very interesting life, considering everything he said was true, and with my knowledge of history... it sounded pretty accurate. 

After talking about that stuff for like five minutes, the waiter came back with our drinks and bread and asked us for food. He ordered some oyster appetizer stuff, that wood grilled everything thing, and I got the same thing as he did. At this point he started, like, rubbing my hand that he was holding, and for whatever reason that made me kind of embarrassed and flustered. I really began to look him in the eyes now, and I just took in all of his facial features. Sure, I looked at them before, but now I was up close and personal. He has really dark sad looking eyes, an interesting looking crooked nose, a scar running from his left ear going all the way down his neck, but the scar is kind of covered up by his beard. He also has a lot of laugh lines, and some crows feet flanking both sides of his eyes. 

I was kind of curious about the big ass scar he had going down the side of his neck, and he told me that he got mugged by someone in Rio de Janeiro and decided to fight back against the guy. The guy had a knife, and came in at an overhanded swing on him and the knife cut him down the ear and neck, but didn't cut deep enough to sever any arteries. He dodged out of the way, grabbed the guy's arm, and pulled the knife from the robber's hands. Robber punched my date's face a lot, trying to keep the knife, and broke my date's nose, which caused him to have a crooked nose. As soon as my date got the knife, the thief broke away and ran off. He had to go to some sketchy looking hospital, and got some stitches for his cut and and got his nose kinda-sorta fixed, which is why its so crooked now. He promised himself he wouldn't get in any more fights after that :D 

So... we talked a lot more about his travels, and what I do / have planned for the future. I'm a computer engineering major... probably shouldn't say that, I'm narrowing the identification search down here a lot lol.. not many trans computer engineering majors. He found that very interesting, and I talked to him about architectures and other bullshit I pulled out of my rectum, and surprisingly he knew a decent amount about it because he was buddies with some compsci guys who worked on super old machines at Coca-Cola during the late 80s, and he learned some basic stuff about how computers worked. Very cool...

Shit, I'm actually getting turned on by this guy. So, our food comes and we begin to eat, and I'm getting kind of self conscious about everything because I'm eating this big ass meal in front of everyone in this restaurant and my date, and I'm trans, and I don't have any foundation on, oh my god they're bringing more rolls, oh, I shouldn't forget to bring some rolls to Amy, oh man my hands are so big in comparison to my wrists... and then out of nowhere, he says 'Don't worry so much, you're very attractive.' (and that sounds so fucking fishy now that I think about it... but keep reading)

Damn, this dude is a *smooth fucking operator*. Seriously, what the fuck? Is my anxiety and nervousness that obvious? I really didn't know how to respond to that, so I put on a big dumb smile, and reached over the table and squeezed his fucking rough ass hand. Jesus, this shit is weird. Am I falling for a 60 year old? Dammit, I was just here for the food, not to get emotionally attached to senior citizens!  

We finished our food by this point, and the bill actually wasn't *too* bad for Red Lobster, and I offered to pay for my portion, but he gruffly declined, saying that I was a college student and had more important things to spend money on (not that I'm complaining, just trying to be polite!). I asked the waiter for some rolls to go (gotta show Amy proof of my conquests), and after he returned with them we were ready to go. Once we were outside, I hugged him, and he pulled me in a bit tighter... and we fucking kissed. EWW a 60 year old... jesus fucking christ, what am I doing. This dude is older than my fucking parents! WHAT THE FUCK. WHAT THE FUCK. 

And to get into even more detail... I kind of liked it in a sick way. It was so fucking taboo that it turned me on, not even gonna lie. What the fuck. Seriously. What the fuck. 

And then he asked me for my phone number and name (I had been withholding this information just to cover my bases, he did the same)... and I gave it to him, and he gave me his info. He then asked me if I wanted to go to his place... I FUCKING SAID YES, WHAT THE FUCK, MOUTH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, and then he gave me the address. I told him I'd drive there after telling my friends what's up (just in case he is a super convincing serial killer, at least I'll get redemption from the grave and he knows not to fuck with me because I told other people his address...) and I immediately texted Amy the address, and called her to tell her what's up. Over the phone, I basically described exactly what happened above, including all the 'WHAT THE FUCKS', and after telling her everything, I told her I also got her some rolls. Laughs were had, and she told me to be very VERY careful when going to his house, and if anything were suspicious even in the slightest, to make up an excuse to leave, try to call her, do literally anything besides get murdered. I laughed and decided to go all in. Amy is pretty great.

#His House and Neighborhood

So, I drove to his house, and from now on I'll just call him Bill, since I knew his name by this point. Bill lived in this neighborhood that looked like it was built around old people. There was a golf course, a fairly large lake, a lot of sprinkler fountains, a gate with security (Bill told them I was a friend that was coming through behind him, and this kind of made me feel he wasn't gonna do anything bad to me, it'd be super obvious it was him, plus Bill seems pretty cool), and of course, there was the always essential old lady walking her 4 dogs at 7PM in the evening. It seemed like a quaint place.

I got to his address, and he had his car parked in his garage, and he was standing outside the garage while I pulled into his driveway. I got out, locked the doors to my car, put the keys in my pocket, and walked up to him. He gave me a big old person smile (why am i doing this) gave me a big bear hug, and then we kissed again. This time he ran his fingers through the hair on the back of my head while we were kissing, and holy fuck this guy is smooth. So fucking smooth. If I were still a boy, I'd never be this smooth. I'm basically putty in this dude's hands. Jesus Christ, what the fuck am I doing. 

We go into his house through his garage, and holy hell, this place is fucking spotless. He must have cleaned this in case I was coming here, or he does that on the regular. Either way, kudos, you're a smart guy, Bill. And wow, I'm surprised that he was willing to clean up so much just for the nudes I posted on Craigslist. He didn't even know if I was a butter face or anything. He didn't give a fuck, he saw the package and he liked it. Jeez, that's flattering, I guess. 

The further we get into his house, the more I feel my expectations I built up for how it'd be like were demolished. The place didn't smell like old people, and it looked pretty modern and had up to date furnishings and shit. He noticed me looking at everything, and started telling me about how his wife (oh... the dead one... shit... what do I do... I hope he isn't trying to replace the hole his wife left in his heart with me) got him into interior decorating, and it was kind of his hobby. We then got to this big ass balcony thing, and there were these windows that spanned all three stories of his house, and gave this very astonishing view of the lake. Too bad there was a shitload of fog! Couldn't see the lake at all, the fog basically rolled up to his dock on the lake, and you couldn't see much past that. There was a couch nearby, and we both sat down.

jesus fuck I've been writing this for the past couple of hours, damn I write fast

#Laden or unladen swallows?

So... he begins telling me about his wife, his parents, and his family. His parents were pretty laid back, and were both into advertising and art like he was. They helped him land the job at Coca-Cola, and that's where he met his wife. Wife was sterile, so they adopted a kid in order to make themselves busy. Kid is grown up now, he's like 30 and has kids and Bill is proud of him. Wow. I'm 19. Okay... 

I begin telling Bill about my family since he shared his, and how I was recently kicked out and all that... and I started crying and messing my make up up like a dummy... then I started talking about some of my experiences being transgender.. and how I disliked talking about it a lot... and he just nodded and was very accepting, and it was very surreal to see an older person like him be so accepting of such a 'new' thing. We kissed again. Jesus fuck I'm falling for this guy. God damn. What the fuck. He's a fucking genius at kissing. Then we kiss again... wow he's good. Now I'm starting to worry I'll be dating 60 year olds all my life.

Jeez. Do I really wanna do anything with this guy? Let's ask a hard hitting question.... oh, I know! ""Why did you respond to me on Craigslist?""  This is what he said, ""Well, that sounds like a trick question."" And you were fucking right, Bill. You were fucking right. ""But I'd have to say I did because it sounded like you needed help, and you are beautiful."" *HEART FLUTTERS* WHAT THE FUCK WHY AM I HOW AM I. Dude, I am so fucking easy. Appeal to my femininity, receive kisses. Play the game, win it. 

I'm so horny by this point that I'm grabbing his leg with one hand, and rubbing his belly with the other. I really can't stop myself, its just happening. He has a very hard stomach, its a bit fatty but theres a lot of muscle underneath... jesus christ its so hairy... what the fuck am I doing... this guy is so old.... 

And... uh... I gave him a blowjob and swallowed it like a nerd. His dick looked like it was 20 years old, and he trimmed his pubes a bit. He must be a religious lotion user.... if you know what I mean..... 

Shit, I didn't even ask about stds. Well, at least I was smart and got vaccinated for HPV when I was 18! Hopefully nothing bad happens from a bit of oral. I'll have to ask about it later.

I really got off to this for whatever reason, and I was on a bit of a high. Probably because I always had a somewhat celibate lifestyle... and this just made me stupidly happy. I think I orgasmed from rubbing myself on the floor while he was in my mouth, but he might have grabbed me at some point and that may have done me in... I was just too into it to notice, it was really weird and it all went by so fast.

Anyways... I decide to stay the night at his house (slept and cuddled with him in bed) and texted Amy that was what I was doing. She just sent me back a smiley face. lol shes such a perv, I'd never do anything to such an old guy!

#Morning 

And uh, that Saturday morning was kind of awesome. I slept fucking fantastic, because for once in life I felt... real? And I knew that last night wasn't a mistake, and that I was so happy I transitioned and wasn't wearing that stupid fucking breast compressor, and so happy that I was away from my parents, and so happy I went through with that CL ad.... even though it was stupid and risky.... it turned out alright. And then it gets better. 

Bill then asks me about the original ad I put up, and wonders what I was looking for when it came to the ad. I explained to him my finances (or rather, the lack thereof), the things I owned, and the abysmal state of my wardrobe (I had a bunch of unisex shirts, three dude pants, one positively female shirt that I was wearing that night, a number of bras, some panties, and skinny jeans that I was wearing that night, and of course various things to hide my *stuff*), and how afraid I was of not being able to finish college. Also told him about my friends and how great they were. 

He then asks if I'd be willing to live with him if he took care of all that stuff... and I basically said yes, but wondered how long he expected me to stay. He then said ""As long as you need a place to stay, and so long as you can find time to help around the house."" I asked him about sex too... just to put him on the spot... and his specific words were ""I'll only ever have sex with you when you and I both want it."" AND THEN I WAS FUCKING SOLD. DONE. I AM A WHORE. GG.  WHY HADN'T HE BEEN HERE A YEAR AGO? ALL STRESS GONE, THIS IS FUCKING GREAT. I AM GOING TO MAKE THIS MAN A FUCKING AWESOME OMELETTE. HOLY FUCK 

And then I did make him and me an awesome omelette, and then I called Amy and we had some awesome girl talk. I told her about the whole possibility of living with him, and she thought it was REALLY weird that I was so on board with this, considering how quick everything went, but I told her I don't like burdening her for long, and that at least this way me and Bill will have an understanding between each other that would make it fine for me to stay at his place. She still sounded very worried, and I guess I do still need to be very careful, and I told her I'd tell her or one of our friends if anything weird happens, and that I wouldn't deal with any BS. She seemed to like that better. Jeez, Amy is so awesome. I then went over to her place and gave her some... stale-ish bread from Red Lobster, because I left it out in the car and forgot about it.... Ooops...... I'm sorry Amy, I'm a monster. Then i picked up some of the stuff I left at her place, hugged her really frigging hard, thanked her for the help over the past weekish (I cried a little), and went back to Bill's. It was kind of hard getting through the neighborhood's security gate again, but I asked Bill if he could get me a sticker for my car to get through the gate easier, and he said he could. His house is also not too far from the college, so that works out!

#Now

A week and a half later (we had some more fun times, and talks about STDs and safety and stuff) ... And here I am! Jesus fuck, I don't even believe that all this shit happened in like 3 weeks. This house is fucking big, yo, I still don't know my way all around it yet. I hope there ain't a closet full of dead hookers hidden away. And he's got some pretty good wifi, it only reaches the ground floor and upper floor though. I'll try to be careful, because I know it's a strange situation... and I'm sorry this was so long but I got very carried away. If you guys have any questions / need clarification, let me know, I'm a terrible fucking writer. This took me like 4 hours to write. I kind of secretly hope my parents will contact me again... but... yeah... they're pretty big assholes. I might have to contact them, but I'm not begging them for anything, and I have a feeling that's what they want me to do. 

#**TL;DR: I was unlucky enough to be born male, grew boobs and tasted the rainbow, got bitch slapped, Amy is too fucking awesome, I can't even put into words how awesome she is. Sucked a guy older than my parents off, might get 'free' clothes and college soon? Gave kinda-sorta stale bread to Amy, sorry Amy, I was horny. I guess I'm a licensed gold digger now too, so that's great!**

NOTE: I would highly recommend not trying this on CL, because I still don't know if Bill is crazy or not. Seems like a nice guy though from my week or two of knowing him, and he really loves yard work, interior decoration, and me cooking for him :D. I don't know how his adopted son is gonna feel about me, if he ever finds out... Oh well. I'm also worried that maybe this relationship is super unconventional and bound to fail super soon, but we'll see. At least I don't have to pay rent and get some breathing room to find a proper job and bolster my savings. Until then... I'm fine with having a 'creepy' old guy as my FWB. "

2ubpcp,9,2015-01-31,Moving to Canberra from USA?,french_poast,canberra,https://www.reddit.com/r/canberra/comments/2ubpcp/moving_to_canberra_from_usa/,"Hi all, I'm looking to study on exchange from July 2015- July 2016 and considering ANU. I've spoken with recruiters and it sounds impressive, but I'm sure I'm getting a biased opinion. What are some pros or cons to Canberra as a place to live? The focus on the arts sticks out to me and it seems less tourist-oriented the Melbourne or Sydney. I'd like to move to Australia for grad school and beyond, and ANU seems like the best school to help get there. 

**Some background,** I live in the US in a college town near my state's Capitol. Most of the population is between 18-25 years old. I love athletics and try to be social on weekends. School is my biggest priority and grad school in economics or business analytics is my foremost goal. Would Canberra be a good fit?

Also - and this may not be the right subreddit for this, but ANU's is dead - I've seen ANU has an impressive internship program. Is it possible to get an internship with the Reserve Bank or Parliamentary Budget Office specifically? Or are there other great programs for Math-Econ students I'm not aware of? 

Thanks in advance for your help!

**Edit:** This got far more attention than I thought it would! Thanks for your help everyone. I feel I have a much more balanced opinion of Canberra now. For folks who may search and find this thread, here's a summary:  

Pros:  

* If you’re coming from the US, the [climate](http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Canberra-weather-averages/Australian-Capital-Territory/AU.aspx) is pretty mild compared to states north of the Mason-Dixon line. 

* Strong, social drinking culture. Could be a con to some people. /u/metasophie directed us to the [local meetup]( http://www.meetup.com/cities/au/canberra/) to find other activities and groups that suit broader interests.

* Lots of outdoor activities. /u/almondfail directed us to [threadbo or perisher](http://www.onthesnow.com/) for snowboarding. Bike paths are also very extensive in Canberra.

* ANU is a top-tier university and there are plenty of local internships to enhance your education if you’re attending. 

* You should be able to keep your driver's license if you're coming from an English speaking country. Thank /u/metasophie for the [link.](http://www.rego.act.gov.au/licence/overseas-and-interstate-licence-information/overseas-drivers)

Cons: 

* /u/TomasTTEngin proffered a [review]( http://thomasthethinkengine.com/2009/10/22/a-stab-in-the-back-for-the-heart-of-the-nation/) worth reading.  

* Public transportation isn’t wonderful compared to other cities. /u/louis_therouxaway showed us the [ACTION bus network website.] (http://www.action.act.gov.au/)

* Canberra is a smaller city, and strikes many Aussies as boring compared to Sydney or Melbourne. /u/louis_therouxaway did a great job [comparing the differences in her post.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/canberra/comments/2ubpcp/moving_to_canberra_from_usa/co785mv)

* Cost of living is high, but varies depending on your budget. Consider Canberra compared to [Sydney]( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Australia&amp;city1=Sydney&amp;country2=Australia&amp;city2=Canberra) or [Melbourne]( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Australia&amp;city1=Melbourne&amp;country2=Australia&amp;city2=Canberra)

More Info: 

* Consider the [$US to $AUS exchange rate]( http://www.google.com/finance?q=CURRENCY%3AAUD&amp;ei=6znOVOC7NYuBqwH86oDQAg) while comparing prices.  

* You can find housing at [gumtree]( http://www.gumtree.com.au/) and bikes [here]( http://www.pushys.com.au/)."
2ubsok,1,2015-01-31,Should I work in China/Taiwan for year in order to improve my Chinese before applying to graduate school in Taiwan?,[deleted],ChineseLanguage,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/2ubsok/should_i_work_in_chinataiwan_for_year_in_order_to/,"The applications for graduate school are due around late March so I'm trying to quickly decide (by the end of today) what I should do.

My program would largely be conducted in Chinese (it's not for a Master's in Chinese by the way) and the internships would have me dealing with people entirely in Chinese (I'm 90% certain). Right now my Chinese is about a 5/10 if I had to rate myself, with my reading ability greatly outweighing my speaking and listening abilities. I just can't commute/express my thoughts fluently

Part of me thinks that if I went to Taiwan this Fall for graduate school, I would have enough time to bring up my Chinese before I really started to 'need' it. But part of me thinks that a year working abroad, even as an English teacher, might be the better route to take.

Thoughts?

2ubss6,5,2015-01-31,Would PLounge mind helping me out with a scholarship essay?,SolarAir,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/2ubss6/would_plounge_mind_helping_me_out_with_a/,"All of this week I've been stressed out and filling out scholarships to try to earn some money for college, because I'll need quite a bit to go to the university I want to go to. (If I can't afford that college right away, I'll probably go to a community college first.) Between school work, and other scholarships, my brain is next to dead right now. I mean, my father asked me for a plate this morning, I got him the ketchup instead.

 I just found out a scholarship that I can apply for because one of my relatives works for a company. This scholarship needs to be mailed out later today, and the local post office stops postmarking stuff in about two hours, so I'm really stressed out and can't think straight. I was able to fill most of it out, but then it ends with an essay. I've started writing stuff, but it's really, really bad. The prompt is: In 750 words or less, explain your educational and professional goals and objectives you hope to achieve in the agriculture industry. I personally want to be an engineer, and my uncle told me that I should just right about how stuff engineers do would indirectly affect the agricultural industry. I'm not even sure what type of an engineer I'd like to be.

If some of you guys here who are better at english wouldn't mind taking a look at my horrible beginning to the essay, and telling me how I could make it better, I'd really appropriate it.

I'm not really good at writing essays when I'm not stressed out and can logically think. I do kind of feel like I shouldn't be asking for help, but I don't think I'll be able to make this piece of coal essay look like a diamond by myself.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.s

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Here's what I have so far. It's 603 words:  
So I know for a fact that I want to be somesort of an engineer. I have yet to figure the exact field I wish to pursue a career in though. I'm currently leaning towards majoring in either electrical or mechanical engineering at the moment. I have put some thought towards majoring in one, and minoring in another. My major(s) will probably be decided sometime during my first or second year at university, and then I will work hard and study well towards my degree in that field of engineering. By the time I graduate from whichever college I choose to attend in 2019, I want to have a well-earned degree in that field of engineering.  
	Once I have attained my degree, I want to get a job as a professional engineering in that field of my degree. It's very possible that I will get a job in a company I was an intern for during my years at whichever college I attended. After getting a job at as a professional engineer I will work hard at what my job, but not realize it since I enjoy what I do. Hopefully I'll move up the corporate ladder a bit though the years, as I gain a better sense for my job.  
As a professional engineer, I will not have a direct effect on the agriculture industry in the world, or even this nation. In either electrical or mechanical engineering, I could be working with products that will then be used directly in the agricultural industry. If I went to Bradley University, there's a chance I could become an intern for caterpillar, and then I'd work to on helping design and create parts for tractors and industrial construction machines. Tracker parts would directly affect the agricultural industry because they are used by farmers. The industrial constriction machines are used in commercial buildings, and for all major building sites. These machines are similar to tractors, but less likely to be used on smaller farms. Bigger agriculture sites and non-farm buildings may require additional constriction machines in order to be built. Tall grain elevators and silos may need cranes to left some of the heavy roof and wall parts. Many of the big corporate farms, all of their buildings require construction machines to build.   
	As an electrical engineer, I'd also indirectly help the agricultural industry by design the electrical parts to the machines used on farms, as well as in the buildings related to agriculture. Everything from traffic lights to tractors, from gps's used by farms to controls at a grain elevator would be effected by electrical engineers.   
	Though the Computer Aided Design class at the Bloomington Area Career Center, I have already been certified in using Autodesk software for Building Performance Analysis. If I were to become a civil engineer or architect, I would be able to design self-sustaining buildings, that would be Eco-friendly and keep a clean environment. With buildings that use less electricity, and generate their own electricity, less electricity is needed to be generated by burning coal. By helping to keep the environment clean, that would indirectly be helping the agricultural industry. With less electricity being generated from fossil fuels, plants would grow better with cleaner air and there'd be less damage down to the ozone layer, which will help prevent climate change. All of this would help farms to produce more crops as well as beef and dairy products. Also if I was a civil engineer, I'd be helping to design the roads and interstates that are used participle to transport goods from farms to storage locations and to retail shops.

I have the best job in the world. No, really, I do. I know what you’re thinking. ‘I’m a CEO, and I make millions!’ or, ‘I’m a doctor, and I save lives!’. That may be, but my job’s still better. What’s my job? I’m an executive personal assistant. No, wait, I know it doesn't sound like the best, but I’ll prove it to you. Let me take you through an average day at my job. 

Most days begin with me waking up at six o’clock, doing a quick 15-minute workout, and hopping into the shower. From there, I whip up a smoothie for breakfast, get dressed in my suit and tie, and out the door of my spartan apartment by seven, so I can catch the seven forty bus to work.

I know what you’re thinking: ‘Apartment, bus, bah! Rich lifestyle for someone with the “best job in the world”’. And it’s true, lots of other jobs earn more, and it’d be nice to have a car, or a yard, or a 401k worth more than a shoe box, but I’d live on the street to keep this job.


My commute isn't too bad, I usually show up at my building by about eight thirty, and at my office by eight forty-five. Well, not technically my office, I share it with my boss. I usually give a nice greeting to Lucy, my boss’s non-executive personal assistant, on my way in, and she gives a friendly ‘hi’ back.

When I enter my office, by boss, Mrs Jameson, is always there. Always. I don’t think Suzette Jameson has ever missed a day or even been late (apparently, being a Vice President of Marketing doesn't have as many perks as you would think). She’s a striking woman. She stands tall, even without heels, has long brunette hair that’s nearly always in a tight bun, and she carries a little more weight than you see on movie stars, (but most of it is in pleasant places). She has a firm demeanor, nearly always business, and has a knack for being as direct-to-the-point as possible without being rude.

Every day, when I come in, she gives a quick, “Hello there John,” or “How was your weekend?” on Mondays. Then, I hang up my suit jacket on the hat rack she keeps in her office and crawl under her large desk. She then let’s me know what my duties are for the day. Most days, begins with “My feet could use some relief”. That’s my cue to begin my job, the best job in the world.

I take off her heels, and start to gently massage her feet. I rub my fingers over her sheer nylons, digging gently into the ball of her foot, slowly working my way down to the heel. After a while of this, she lets me know to move forward either with a quick “Be sure to get the ankles” or simply by kicking her feet further towards me.

Then, I move my massage slowly up her ankles and calves, marveling at the feel of the strong muscles of her legs and the feel of the flesh on top of it. Never, in all my ministrations, does she look down at me or pause in her work. I can always hear her writing, shuffling papers, or talking on the phone.

It’s never too long after I start on the calves that she indicates, either through words or actions, to move up. Massaging her thick thighs is a beautiful experience, and I often wonder if I’m the only who delights in it. Mrs Jameson wears a wedding ring, but in my six months here I've never had the nerve to ask her about Mr Jameson. She’s never volunteered anything, but she doesn't really talk to me outside of work.

It varies, but usually I’m under her desk no more than an hour-and a half before Mrs Jameson gives me the go ahead. Usually, it’s by casually reaching down, placing her hand on the back of my head, and pulling me towards the prize. The absolute best part of my day. She spreads her legs, pulls up her skirt, and then I see it, her beautiful cunt on display. A light dusting of brown pubic hair covers her meaty outer lips, and I always see her pleasure glistening on her inner thighs. She used to wear panties, but that became too much of a bother. I kind of miss it though, even though she rarely wore anything but plain white panties. It was like unwrapping a Christmas present.

It’s hard to restrain myself, but I do. Rather than dive into her cunt, I lick all around her lips, keeping her mildly aroused, but not so distracted as to be unable to do her work. I’m aroused as well, but I have little opportunity to do anything about it. Once, she caught me pleasuring myself as I licked her, and she let me know plainly that if she caught me ‘distracted’ again, she’d find a new executive assistant.

By eleven, I’m usually lapping at her hood, and around the edges of her entrance. I know every millimeter of her, I could sketch that woman’s cunt from memory, and tell you which areas are the most sensitive, which I should avoid, and which I should attack directly when she tells me that she needs to cum.

I usually give her three to four orgasms during the course of the day, mostly with my tongue, but occasionally with my fingers, and sometimes with both at the same time. It doesn’t happen terribly often, but every now and again, she let’s me fuck her.

It’s the best. The last time I fucked her was last Thursday. It was about one forty-five, and she was getting close to another orgasm. Suddenly, she backed up from the chair told me to stand up. I did so, grateful for the chance to stretch my body. Then she told me in plain terms what she wanted. “I’m going to bend over the desk now,” she said, with the same tone she uses to tell the intern how many creams with her coffee, “and I want you to fuck me hard and fast. Don’t be gentle, I need to cum soon. I want to be fully refreshed for my two-thirty”.

No further prompting needed, I pulled a condom from my wallet, unzipped my pants, and wrapped myself up. I looked over to the desk, and I reveled in the sight of her, bent over, skirt above her waist, and with an aroused yet slightly bored look on her face. Even in that position, she was the boss, and I was her living toy, the perk of being the boss.

Not that I minded in the slightest. I positioned myself at her entrance, and slowly put my dick into place. Once I got myself situated, I thrust in firmly. She was wet and warm after all my ministrations, and it was easy to get myself into a rhythm. I fucked and pounded into her over and over. It was pleasure beyond pleasure. This time she moaned a little bit, letting me know that she enjoyed it, but usually she’s all business, even when my cock’s hilt deep in her cunt.

It isn't long at all, several dozen thrusts, until I felt her rhythmically squeeze my dick, orgasming on me. That’s all I ccould take, and I came soon afterwards, filling the condom with my sperm.

Then we stood there for a minute, panting and enjoying the afterglow, and for a moment, I forgot I was at work. But the moment soon passed, and Mrs Jameson stood up as I pulled out of her. I excused myself to her personal bathroom to dispose of the condom, and piss, and she followed up soon afterwards for her ablutions. Then, I went under her desk as usual, and gave her a nice hidden foot massage while she talked with her boss.

But most days I don’t get to fuck her, and I have to pleasure myself at home, with only thoughts of my day to inspire me. My job could be better. I could earn more, the commute could be shorter, I could fuck my boss more often, but I still contend that my job is the best job in the world. What do you think? Is your job better?

2uciei,47,2015-01-31,Why I love Monty Oum.,GetWellMontyOum,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/2uciei/why_i_love_monty_oum/,"A few years ago, I was an undergrad student with not a whole lot going for me. My social life was more or less nonexistent. My grades were alright, mostly B’s and C’s. I was a business admin major, and honestly hated the classes I was taking, but I knew that it would more or less guarantee me a decent position as long as I managed to get an internship. So I stuck it out.

My heart was in drawing and writing. I had dabbled in animation, but never had the time or the resources to dedicate myself to learning the process. All I really wanted was to switch my major to a Bachelor in Arts, but I knew that my folks would cut me off if I was going to school for a field they considered “unemployable.”

One day, an acquaintance of mine asked if I was into video games. Of course I said yes. So he pulled out his phone and showed me Haloid. I was completely blown away. This went so over the top from anything I had seen before, and I loved it. I wanted more.

The same acquaintance suggested that I watch RvB, a series that I had never heard of (School had been my first priority for many years). I watched it all in a few weeks, and of course I was floored when Monty’s animation popped up again during the fight scenes in later seasons. It was even better than in Haloid, something I didn’t think was possible. When RWBY came out, I anxiously awaited each week for the new episode. It was like an addiction to watch the action scenes play out in such inventive ways.

Through all of this, I realized that hard work and dedication had allowed Monty to pursue this line of work and make it something totally unique. It made me really question where I was going in life, until I finally got the courage to head down to the Student Affairs office and officially change my Major to art.

Now I’m in my final year of my degree. My parents actually were much more supportive of my change then I thought they would be. I have a tight knit group of friends who share my interests, and a girlfriend who I love very very much. And there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t silently thank Monty for creating my inspiration to head down my own path.


Get better soon, man. We're all rooting for you &lt;3
